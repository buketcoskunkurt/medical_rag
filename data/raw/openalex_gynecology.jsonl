Frequency analysis suggests that, in obstetrics, the main cause of trouble is grade 3, in which the epiglottis can be seen, but not the cords. This group is fairly rare so that a proportion of anaesthetists will not meet the problem in their first few years and may thus be unprepared for it in obstetrics. However the problem can be simulated in routine anaesthesia, so that a drill for managing it can be practised. Laryngoscopy is carried out as usual, then the blade is lowered so that the epiglottis descends and hides the cords. Intubation has to be done blind, using the Macintosh method. This can be helpful as part of the training before starting in the maternity department, supplementing the Aberdeen drill.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2044.1984.tb08932.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100858040", "source": "openalex"}

A number of self-administered questionnaires are available for assessing depression severity, including the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9). Because even briefer measures might be desirable for use in busy clinical settings or as part of comprehensive health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item version of the PHQ depression module, the PHQ-2. Methods. The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The PHQ-2 was completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics–gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. Results. As PHQ-2 depression severity increased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-2 score ≥3 had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 92% for major depression. Likelihood ratio and receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a PHQ-2 score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening purposes. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics–gynecology samples. Conclusion. The construct and criterion validity of the PHQ-2 make it an attractive measure for depression screening.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.mlr.0000093487.78664.3c", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975970108", "source": "openalex"}

However, instruments for identifying and monitoring somatic symptoms are few in number and not widely used. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief measure of the severity of somatic symptoms. Methods The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-15 comprises 15 somatic symptoms from the PHQ, each symptom scored from 0 (\"not bothered at all\") to 2 (\"bothered a lot\"). The PHQ-15 was administered to 6000 patients in eight general internal medicine and family practice clinics and seven obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Outcomes included functional status as assessed by the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20), self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Results As PHQ-15 somatic symptom severity increased, there was a substantial stepwise decrement in functional status on all six SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased.

Yet it is poorly documented in the literature. METHODS Three hundred seventy patients with PC from non-gynecologic malignancies were followed prospectively: the PC was of gastric origin in 125 cases, of colorectal origin in 118 cases, of pancreatic origin in 58 cases, of unknown origin in 43 cases, and of miscellaneous origins in 26 cases. A previously reported PC staging system was used to classify these 370 patients. RESULTS Mean and median overall survival periods were 6.0 and 3.1 months, respectively. Survival rates were mainly affected by the initial PC stage (9.8 months for Stage I with malignant peritoneal granulations less than 5 mm in greatest dimension, versus 3.7 months for Stage IV with large, malignant peritoneal masses more than 2 cm in greatest dimension). The presence of ascites was associated with poor survival of patients with gastric or pancreatic carcinoma. Differentiation of the primary tumor did not influence the prognoses of patients with PC. CONCLUSIONS A better knowledge of the natural history of PC is needed, in view of the many Phase I, II, and III trials currently being conducted to evaluate aggressive multimodal therapeutic approaches to treating patients with PC from non-gynecologic malignancies.

Systematic analysis of obstetrics and gynecology-related risk management files allows a more complete examination of ways that human and systems factors may contribute to adverse events. OBJECTIVE: To learn the medical complaints of patients who experienced apparent adverse events, the general causes of those adverse events, and the significant specific causal factors involved in obstetrics and gynecology-related risk management cases. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 90 consecutive obstetrics and gynecology-related internal review files opened by a medical center's risk managers between 1995 and 2001. Each file was analyzed to identify factors that may have contributed to or caused unanticipated adverse events. The main outcome was the pattern of contributing factors when they were aggregated into categories. RESULTS: Fifty percent of cases were associated with inpatient obstetrics. Factors that may have contributed to adverse events were identified in 78% of cases, and most had more than one contributing factor. Thirty-one percent of adverse events were associated with apparent communication problems. Clinical performance issues were identified in 31% of cases, diagnostic issues in 18% of cases, and patient behavior contributed to 14% of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic, therapeutic, and communication issues were the most common factors identified. Although the generalizability of these data are unknown, all obstetrics and gynecology departments face multiple challenges in assuring consistent quality care. Analysis of claims files may help identify opportunities for improvement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-3 A cause-and-effect analysis shows that significant proportions of adverse outcomes in an obstetrics-gynecology department seem to be related to issues of diagnosis, communication, and surgical care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000158864.09443.77", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061691229", "source": "openalex"}

The goals were to determine the superior chemoradiation regimen and to quantitate the relative toxicities. METHODS: All patients had biopsy-proven invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Patients underwent standard clinical staging studies and their tumors were found to be International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stages IIB, III, or IVA. Negative cytologic washings and para-aortic lymph nodes were required for entry. Patients were randomized to receive either standard whole pelvic RT with concurrent 5-FU infusion and bolus CF or the same RT plus oral HU. RESULTS: Of 388 randomized patients, 368 were eligible; 177 were randomized to CF and 191 to HU. Adverse effects were predominantly hematologic or gastrointestinal in both regimens. Severe or life-threatening leukopenia was more common in the HU group (24%) than in the CF group (4%). The difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically significant in favor of the CF group (P = .033). The sites of progression in the two treatment groups were not substantially different. Survival was significantly better for the patients randomized to CF (P = .018).

There are tens of thousands of chemicals in global commerce, and even small exposures to toxic chemicals during pregnancy can trigger adverse health consequences. Exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and related health outcomes are inequitably distributed within and between countries; universally, the consequences of exposure are disproportionately borne by people with low incomes. Discrimination, other social factors, economic factors, and occupation impact risk of exposure and harm. Documented links between prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals and adverse health outcomes span the life course and include impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and cancer. The global health and economic burden related to toxic environmental chemicals is in excess of millions of deaths and billions of dollars every year. On the basis of accumulating robust evidence of exposures and adverse health impacts related to toxic environmental chemicals, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) joins other leading reproductive health professional societies in calling for timely action to prevent harm. FIGO recommends that reproductive and other health professionals advocate for policies to prevent exposure to toxic environmental chemicals, work to ensure a healthy food system for all, make environmental health part of health care, and champion environmental justice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.09.002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2179658697", "source": "openalex"}

Work hour limits for residents in obstetrics and gynecology and decreased patient availability for teaching of students and residents require us to think creatively and practically on how to optimize their education. Medical simulations may address scenarios in clinical practice that are considered important to know or understand. Simulations can take many forms, including computer programs, models or mannequins, virtual reality data immersion caves, and a combination of formats. The purpose of this commentary is to call attention to a potential role for medical simulation in obstetrics and gynecology. We briefly describe an example of how simulation may be incorporated into obstetric and gynecologic residency training. It is our contention that educators in obstetrics and gynecology should be aware of the potential for simulation in education. We hope this commentary will stimulate interest in the field, lead to validation studies, and improve training in and the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(03)00483-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2050238536", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to identify factors predictive of poor prognosis in a similarly treated population of women with advanced EOC. Patients and Methods A retrospective review of demographic, pathologic, treatment, and outcome data from 1,895 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III EOC who had undergone primary surgery followed by six cycles of intravenous platinum/paclitaxel was conducted. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of prognostic factors with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Increasing age was associated with increased risks for disease progression (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11 for an increase every 10 years) and death (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.18). Mucinous or clear-cell histology was associated with a worse PFS and OS compared with serous carcinomas. Patients with performance status (PS) 1 or 2 were at an increased risk for recurrence compared with PS 0 (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.24). Compared with patients with microscopic residual disease, patients with 0.1 to 1.0 cm and &gt; 1.0 cm residual disease had an increased risk of recurrence (HR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.70 to 2.26; and HR = 2.36; 95% CI, 2.04 to 2.73, respectively) and death (HR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.78 to 2.49; P &lt; .001; and HR = 2.47; 95% CI, 2.09 to 2.92, respectively).

Methods: A total of 3472 pregnant women age 18 and older were screened while waiting for their prenatal care visits in 10 obstetrics clinics using a brief (10 minute) screening questionnaire. This screen measured demographics, tobacco and alcohol (TWEAK problem alcohol use screening measure), and depression measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), use of antidepressant medications, past history of depression, and current treatment (i.e., medications, psychotherapy, or counseling) for depression. Results: Of women screened, 20% (n = 689) scored above the cutoff score on the CES-D, and only 13.8% of those women reported receiving any formal treatment for depression. Past history of depression, poorer overall health, greater alcohol use consequences, smoking, being unmarried, unemployment, and lower educational attainment were significantly associated with symptoms of depression during pregnancy. Conclusions: These data show that a substantial number of pregnant women screened in obstetrics settings have significant symptoms of depression, and most of them are not being monitored in treatment during this vulnerable time. This information may be used to justify and streamline systematic screening for depression in clinical encounters with pregnant women as a first step in determining which women may require further treatment for their mood symptoms. As elevations in depressive symptomatology have been associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes, further study of the impact of psychiatric treatment in gravid women is essential.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/154099903765448880", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992853570", "source": "openalex"}

AI is already part of our daily life; it is behind face recognition technology, speech recognition in virtual assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) and self‐driving cars. AI software has been able to beat world champions in chess, Go and recently even Poker. Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology. The list of medical image‐analysis AI applications with USA Food and Drug Administration or European Union (soon to fall under European Union Medical Device Regulation) approval is growing rapidly and covers diverse clinical needs, such as detection of arrhythmia using a smartwatch or automatic triage of critical imaging studies to the top of the radiologist's worklist. Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good‐quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary. In this article, we explore the fundamentals of medical imaging AI, from theory to applicability, and introduce some key terms to medical professionals in the field of ultrasound. We believe that wider knowledge of AI will help accelerate its integration into healthcare. © 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: A validated survey by the American College of Surgeons was modified and distributed to all fellowship program directors in four subspecialties within obstetrics and gynecology: female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, gynecologic oncology, maternal–fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology–infertility. The 59-item survey explored five domains concerning preparedness for fellowship: professionalism, independent practice, psychomotor ability, clinical evaluation, and academic scholarship. A Likert scale with five responses was used and tailored to each subspecialty. Standard statistical methods were used to compare responses between subspecialties and to analyze data within each subspecialty individually. RESULTS: One hundred thirty directors completed the survey, for a response rate of 60%. In the domain of professionalism, more than 88% of participants stated that incoming fellows had appropriate interactions with faculty and staff. Scores in this domain were lower for gynecologic oncology respondents (P=.046). Responses concerning independent practice of surgical procedures (hysterectomy, pelvic reconstruction, and minimally invasive) were overwhelmingly negative. Only 20% of first-year fellows were able to independently perform a vaginal hysterectomy, 46% an abdominal hysterectomy, and 34% basic hysteroscopic procedures. Appropriate postoperative care (63%) and management of the critically ill patient (71%) were rated adequate for all subspecialties. CONCLUSION: Graduating residents may be underprepared for advanced subspecialty training, necessitating an evaluation of the current structure of resident and fellow curriculum.

The benefit of prophylactic gynecologic surgery for women with this syndrome has been uncertain. We designed this study to determine the reduction in the risk of gynecologic cancers associated with prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with the Lynch syndrome.Three hundred fifteen women with documented germ-line mutations associated with the Lynch syndrome were identified. Women who had undergone prophylactic hysterectomy (61 women) and women who had undergone prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (47 women) were matched with mutation-positive women who had not undergone the procedure in question (210 women for the analysis of endometrial cancer and 223 for the analysis of ovarian cancer). Women who had undergone prophylactic surgery and their matched controls were followed from the date of the surgery until the occurrence of cancer or until the data were censored at the time of the last follow-up visit.There were no occurrences of endometrial, ovarian, or primary peritoneal cancer among the women who had undergone prophylactic surgery. Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 69 women in the control group (33 percent), for an incidence density of 0.045 per woman-year, yielding a prevented fraction (the proportion of potential new cancers prevented) of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 90 to 100 percent). Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 12 women in the control group (5 percent), for an incidence density of 0.005 per woman-year, yielding a prevented fraction of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -62 to 100 percent).These findings suggest that prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is an effective strategy for preventing endometrial and ovarian cancer in women with the Lynch syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa052627", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035624229", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2020685660", "title": "The Race of Hysteria: \"Overcivilization\" and the \"Savage\" Woman in Late Nineteenth-Century Obstetrics and Gynecology", "text": "Hysteria, we learned from feminist historical scholarship in the 1970s, was never just a disease. It was also the way nineteenth-century U.S. and European cultures made sense of women's changing roles. Industrialization and urbanization wrought one set of changes, while the women's rights movement brought another. Together, these included higher education for women, their increasing participation in a (rapidly changing) public sphere, paid employment, and declining fertility. These cultural changes were accompanied by a virtual epidemic of \"nervous weakness\" largely among women, causing feminist historians to begin asking whether the diagnostic category of hysteria was simply a way of keeping women in the home. 1 In light of recent work in race theory, it is worth examining these scholarly insights to ask: could hysteria equally be said to be about race? I will argue that it was, centrally, in two senses. First, nervousness was often characterized as an illness caused by \"overcivilization,\" 2 which located it in a scientific and popular discourse that defined cultural evolution as beginning with the \"savage,\" culminating in the \"civilized,\" but also containing the possibility of degeneration--\"overcivilization.\" In this literature, \"savage\" or \"barbarian\" was applied to indigenous peoples, Africans, Asians, Latin Americans, and sometimes poor people generally. As a disease of \"overcivilization,\" hysterical illness was the provenance almost exclusively of Anglo-American, native-born whites, specifically, white women of a certain class. Second, the primary symptoms of [End Page 246] hysteria in women were gynecologic and reproductive--prolapsed uterus, diseased ovaries, long and difficult childbirths--maladies that made it difficult for these hysterical (white) women to have children. As such, hysteria also implicitly participated in a discourse of race and reproduction, one which identified white women of the middle and upper classes as endangering the race through their low fertility, while non-white women, immigrants, and poor people had many children. A reading of the American Journal of Obstetrics suggests that its physician-contributors understood and deployed these distinctions extensively, characterizing white women as weak, frail, and nervous while non-white women and poor people were described as strong, hardy, and prolifically fertile. Ultimately, this doubled discourse of women had profound consequences for medicine and science: the frailty and nervousness of one group provided the raison d'être of obstetrics and gynecology, while the insensate hardiness of the other offered the grounds on which they became the experimental \"material\" that defined its progress. Hysteria in the nineteenth century was not a single disease or entity but entailed a profusion of symptoms. As a description, \"nervousness\" did heroic labor, and accounted for the most various distresses of body and mind. \"Hysteria\" and its variants neurasthenia and nervousness were part of the lexicon of psychiatry, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology and also of reformers cautioning about the dangers of cities or of women's education or labor. 3 One physician, George Beard, wrote a catalogue of symptoms that ran to seventy-five pages, and he counted it incomplete. 4 Both women and men suffered from neurasthenia, but the overwhelming majority of its victims were women. The treatments were drastic: bleeding, extended bed rest and for women, surgery to remove the ovaries. Scholars of women and gender have long argued that hysteria participated in powerful narratives of cultural crisis, which goes a long way toward explaining the logical glue that held together an apparently endless catalogue of symptoms as a singular syndrome. The hysterical woman, women's historians suggest, is both sign and symptom of conflict over the cultural meaning of gender. In this scholarship, hysteria is at once a diagnostic gesture of dismissal of women as competent participants in public life, a social role uncomfortably inhabited by suffering women, and a warning about the dangerous consequences for women of engaging in \"unfeminine\" behavior. 5 Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, for example, [End Page 247] consider hysteria virtually a diagnostic fiction, arguing that nineteenth...", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1353/aq.2000.0013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020685660", "source": "openalex"}

This family of tumors includes angiomyolipoma (AML), clear cell sugar tumor of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and very rare tumors in other locations. Because non-AML/non-LAM PEComas are extremely rare and their natural history and prognostic features undefined, we present our experience with 26 PEComas of soft tissue and the gynecologic tract, the largest series to date. We also performed a detailed review of the literature, with special attention to features predictive of clinical behavior. All PEComas exclusive of AML and LAM were retrieved from our consultation files. Immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (CK), S-100 protein, smooth muscle actins (SMA), desmin, vimentin, HMB45, Melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), TFE3, CD117, and CD34 was performed. Clinical follow-up information was obtained. Fisher's exact test was performed. The median patient age was 46 years (range, 15-97 years); there was a marked female predominance (22 females, 4 males). Sites of involvement included the omentum or mesentery (6 cases), uterus (4 cases), pelvic soft tissues (3 cases), abdominal wall (2 cases), uterine cervix (2 cases), and vagina, retroperitoneum, thigh, falciform ligament, scalp, broad ligament, forearm, shoulder, and neck (1 case each). The tumors ranged from 1.6 to 29 cm in size (median, 7.8 cm). Tumors were epithelioid (N = 9), spindled (N = 7), or mixed (N = 10). Multinucleated giant cells were present in 18 cases. High nuclear grade was noted in 10 cases, high cellularity in 7 cases, necrosis in 8 cases, and vascular invasion in 3 cases. Mitotic activity was 0 to 50 mitotic figures (MF)/50 high power fields (HPF) (median, 0 MF/50 HPF) with atypical MF in 6 cases. IHC results were: SMA (20/25), desmin (8/22), HMB45 (22/24), Melan-A (13/18), MITF (9/18), S-100 protein (8/24), CK (3/23), vimentin (12/14), TFE3 (5/17), c-kit (1/20), and CD34 (0/7). Clinical follow-up (24 of 26 patients, 92%; median, 30 months; range, 10-84 months) showed 3 local recurrences and 5 distant metastases. At last available clinical follow-up, 2 patients (8%) were dead of disease, 4 patients (17%) were alive with metastatic or unresectable local disease, and 18 patients (75%) were alive with no evidence of disease. No patient in our series had a history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Recurrence and/or metastasis was strongly associated tumor size > median size (8 cm), mitotic activity greater than 1/50 HPF, and necrosis. We conclude that PEComas of soft tissue and gynecologic origin may be classified as \"benign,\" \"of uncertain malignant potential,\" or \"malignant.\" Small PEComas without any worrisome histologic features are most likely benign. PEComas with nuclear pleomorphism alone (\"symplastic\") and large PEComas without other worrisome features have uncertain malignant potential. PEComas with two or more worrisome histologic features should be considered malignant. Occasional PEComas express unusual markers, such as S-100 protein, desmin, and rarely CK. The role of TFE3 in PEComas should be further studied.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.pas.0000173232.22117.37", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2095543034", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: We used the National Cancer Database to identify women with cervical cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2015. Using clinical and pathologic data, each patient's stage was classified using three staging schemas: American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition, FIGO 2009 and FIGO 2018. The FIGO 2018 revised staging classifies stage IB tumors into three substages based on tumor size (IB1–IB3) and classifies patients with positive lymph nodes (pathologically or clinically detected) as stage IIIC1 (positive pelvic nodes) or IIIC2 (positive para-aortic nodes). Five-year survival rates were estimated for each stage grouping. We sought to determine whether the 2018 FIGO staging system was able to offer improved 5-year survival rate differentiation compared with older staging schemas. RESULTS: A total of 62,212 women were identified. The classification of stage IB tumors into three substages improved discriminatory ability. Five-year survival in the FIGO 2018 schema was 91.6% (95% CI 90.4–92.6%) for stage IB1 tumors, 83.3% (95% CI 81.8–84.8%) for stage IB2 neoplasms, and 76.1% (95% CI 74.3–77.8%) for IB3 lesions. In contrast, for women with stage III tumors, higher FIGO staging was not consistently associated with worse 5-year survival rates: stage IIIA (40.7%, 95 CI 37.1–44.3%), stage IIIB (41.4%; 95% CI 39.9–42.9%), stage IIIC1 (positive pelvic nodes) was 60.8% (95% CI 58.7–62.8%) and stage IIIC2 37.5% (95% CI 33.3–41.7%).

A gynecologic oncology group study", "text": "Background. The histologic grade of endometrial adenocarcinoma is related to the aggressiveness of the tumor and probability of death from disease. However, the ideal system for assignment of histologic grade remains controversial. In 1988, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) revised its recommendations for grading typical endometrial adenocarcinoma, such that grade is determined primarily by the architecture of the tumor and secondarily modified in the presence of \"notable nuclear atypia\"; this phrase, however, has never been defined, and therefore the prognostic validity of this system is unknown. Methods. Seven hundred and fifteen women with clinical Stage I and occult Stage II endometrial adenocarcinomas (excluding serous or clear cell type) entered on a Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol, and those treated by total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oo-phorectomy, and selective pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling formed the study population. All cases were centrally reviewed and assigned an architectural grade and a nuclear grade using specific criteria. The FIGO grade was then determined. The various grading methods were examined based on ability to stratify patients into groups with differing rates of disease progression and relative survival at five years. Results. The architectural grade, nuclear grade, and FIGO grade of tumors each were used to separate patients into groups with statistically significant different rates of progression of disease and relative survival. The FIGO modification of architectural grade resulted in the reassignment of 44 patients into a higher grade. The outcome for these 44 was worse than for the remaining patients in the initial grade but was similar to the group into which they were moved. Conclusions. If clearly specified criteria for architectural and nuclear grading are used and \"notable nuclearatypia\" is defined as grade 3 nuclei, the 1988 FIGO grading system has prognostic utility. The authors recommend this system as the standard method for the grading of typical endometrial adenocarcinoma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1<81::aid-cncr2820750114>3.0.co;2-f", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980688154", "source": "openalex"}

The questionnaires asked about demographics, perceptions about careers in academic medicine, and residents' experiences with mentorship.Response rates were 96.8% for residents and 40.6% for FELLOWS: Of the residents, 26.1% indicated they would not consider a career in academic medicine. First-year women residents were more inclined to pursue careers in academic medicine than were first-year men (p =.042), but their interest declined during residency. Women residents (43%)-especially minorities-felt that men were mentored and recruited more for faculty positions, while men (38%) felt that women were mentored and recruited more. Fellows' reports of recruitment did not differ by gender. Most white residents did not perceive racial or ethnic bias in mentoring or recruiting, while most non-white residents did. Almost one third of non-white women residents felt that supervisors were more likely to condescend to women and minority individuals.It is likely that neither men nor women residents in obstetrics and gynecology receive adequate mentorship for careers in academic medicine.

Cochrane Collaboration's tool and ROBINS-I tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Summary of evidence tables were created using the United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table for Evidence Reviews.Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms.Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics. Further well-designed studies are needed to examine these interventions and others to generate evidence that can inform decisions about implementation of newer telehealth technologies into obstetrics and gynecology practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003646", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3002030059", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Anonymous, self-administered surveys to third-year medical students rotating on the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. Results: Eighty-one of 91 students participated (89% response rate): 33 men, 46 women, 2 declined to reveal their gender. No significant gender differences existed regarding number of interactions with residents and faculty; number of deliveries, surgeries, or examinations performed; perceived quality of teaching; or feeling included as part of the clinical team. Male students were more likely to report performing specific surgical procedures, such as operating the bovie cautery during gynecological surgeries (p = 0.005). More men experienced patients refusing to allow them to participate in the clinical interview (p < 0.0001) and physical examination (p < 0.0001). Male students were also more likely to report feeling that their gender negatively impacted their clerkship experience (p < 0.0001). Although less likely to report preclerkship and postclerkship career interest in obstetrics and gynecology, male students were more likely to report that their interest increased at the end of the clerkship. Conclusions: Male students were more likely to experience gender bias from patients on the obstetrics and gynecology service. Male students also described feeling socially excluded from female-dominated clinical teams. Obstetrics and gynecology educators need to consider methods of encouraging patients to accept medical student participation regardless of gender. Obstetrics and gynecology faculty and residents need to be sensitive to subtle forms of gender bias and ensure equal inclusion for both male and female medical students.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2009.1357", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026797030", "source": "openalex"}

For this report, the authors evaluated the effects of primary surgery by a gynecologic oncologist on treatment outcome. METHODS The hospital files from 680 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who were diagnosed between 1994 and 1997 in the northern part of the Netherlands were abstracted. Treatment results were analyzed according to the operating physician's education by using survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS Primary surgery was performed on 184 patients by gynecologic oncologists, and on 328 patients by general gynecologists. Gynecologic oncologists followed surgical guidelines more strictly compared with general gynecologists (patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stage I–II disease, 55% vs. 33% [ P = 0.01]; patients with FIGO Stage III disease, 60% vs. 40% [ P = 0.003]) and more often removed all macroscopic tumor in patients with FIGO Stage III disease (24% vs. 12%; P = 0.02). When patients were stratified according to FIGO stage, the 5‐year overall survival rate was 86% versus 70% ( P = 0.03) for patients with Stage I–II disease and 21% versus 13% ( P = 0.02) for patients with Stage III–IV disease who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists and general gynecologists, respectively. The hazards ratio for patients who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.61–1.03; adjusted for patient age, disease stage, type of hospital, and chemotherapy); when patients age 75 years and older were excluded, the hazards ratio fell to 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54–0.94) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The surgical treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma by gynecologic oncologists occurred more often according to surgical guidelines, tumor removal more often was complete, and survival was improved.

Several MR imaging techniques used in evaluation of patients with gynecologic malignancies are described, including both anatomic MR imaging sequences (T1- and T2-weighted sequences) and pulse sequences that characterize tissue on the basis of physiologic features (diffusion-weighted MR imaging), dynamic contrast agent-enhanced MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy. MR imaging findings corresponding to the 2009 revised International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging of gynecologic malignancies are also described in detail, highlighting possible pearls and pitfalls of staging.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study. The gender of department-based leaders (chair, vice chair, division director) and residency program directors was determined from websites of 950 academic departments of anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Each specialty's representation ratio—proportion of leadership roles held by women in 2013 divided by proportion of residents in 1990 who were women—and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A ratio of 1 indicates proportionate representation. RESULTS: Women were significantly underrepresented among chairs for all specialties (ratios 0.60 or less, P≤.02) and division directors for all specialties except anesthesiology (ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.87–1.46) and diagnostic radiology (ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81–1.16). The representation ratio for vice chair was below 1.0 for all specialties except anesthesiology; this finding reached statistical significance only for pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Women were significantly overrepresented as residency program directors in general surgery, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics (ratios greater than 1.19, P≤.046). Obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics had the highest proportions of residents in 1990 and department leaders in 2013 who were women. CONCLUSION: Despite having the largest proportion of leaders who were women, representation ratios demonstrate obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in progression of women to departmental leadership. Women's overrepresentation as residency program directors raises concern because education-based academic tracks may not lead to major leadership roles. Representation ratios, which allow meaningful comparisons across specialties, demonstrate that obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in the progression of women to departmental leadership roles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000001290", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2286701001", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Study patients were 472 women receiving cancer care in an urban public medical center. Women had a primary diagnosis of breast (stage 0 to III) or gynecologic cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 0 to IIIB). A diagnostic depression screen and baseline questionnaire were administered before or during active treatment or during active follow-up. Self-report data were collected on receipt of depression treatment, use of supportive counseling, pain and receipt of pain medication, functional status and well-being, and perceived barriers to cancer care. Results Twenty-four percent of women reported moderate to severe levels of depressive disorder (30% of breast cancer patients and 17% of gynecologic cancer patients). Only 12% of women meeting criteria for major depression reported currently receiving medications for depression, and only 5% of women reported seeing a counselor or participating in a cancer support group. Neither cancer stage nor treatment status was correlated with depression. Primary diagnosis of breast cancer, younger age, greater functional impairment, poorer social and family well-being, anxiety, comorbid arthritis, and fears about treatment side effects were correlated with depression. Conclusion Findings indicate that depressive disorder among ethnic minority, low-income women with breast or gynecologic cancer is prevalent and is correlated with pain, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Because these women are unlikely to receive depression treatment or supportive counseling, there is a need for routine screening, evaluation, and treatment in this population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2005.08.041", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2136833425", "source": "openalex"}

There has been a rise in the prevalence of large newborns over a few decades in many parts of the world. There is ample evidence that fetal macrosomia is associated with increased risk of complications both for the mother and the newborn. In current obstetrics, the macrosomic fetus represents a frequent clinical challenge. Evidence is emerging that being born macrosomic is also associated with future health risks. Objective. To provide a review of causes and risks, prevention, prediction and clinical management of suspected large fetus/fetal macrosomia, primarily aimed at clinical obstetricians. Methods. Medline and EMBASE were searched between 1980 and 2007 by combining either ‘fetal macrosomia’ or ‘large for gestational age’ with other relevant terms. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for the term ‘fetal macrosomia’. Results and conclusions. Although the causes of high birthweight include both genetic and environmental factors, the rapid increase in the prevalence of large newborns has environmental causes. The evidence is extensive that maternal overweight and associated metabolic changes, including type 2 and gestational diabetes, play a central role. There is a paucity of studies of the effect of intervention before and/or during pregnancy on the risk of having an ‘overweight newborn’. It appears rational, however, that preventive measures should primarily be implemented before pregnancy and should include guidance about nutrition and physical activity in order to reduce the prevalence of overweight. In pregnancy, limited weight gain, especially in obese women, seems to reduce the risk of macrosomia, as do good control of plasma glucose among those with diabetes. Prediction of fetal macrosomia remains an inaccurate task even with modern ultrasound equipment. There is little evidence that routine elective delivery (induction or caesarean section) for the mere reason of suspected macrosomia should be employed in a general population. Vaginal delivery of a macrosomic fetus requires considered attention by an experienced obstetrician and preparedness for operative delivery, shoulder dystocia and newborn asphyxia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00016340801899289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022707347", "source": "openalex"}

The strong ion difference was calculated as serum sodium + serum potassium - serum chloride - serum lactate. The amount of weak plasma acid was calculated as the serum total protein concentration in g/dl x 2.43. Results Infusion of 0.9% saline, but not lactated Ringer's solution, caused a metabolic acidosis with hyperchloremia and a concomitant decrease in the strong ion difference. Calculating the serum bicarbonate concentration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Stewart approach produced equivalent results. Conclusions Infusion of approximately 30 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1) saline during anesthesia and surgery inevitably leads to metabolic acidosis, which is not observed after administration of lactated Ringer's solution. The acidosis is associated with hyperchloremia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-199905000-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987303342", "source": "openalex"}

The current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grading scheme provides prognostic information that can be used to guide the extent of surgery and use of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. We recommend moving toward a binary scheme to grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas by considering International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics defined grades 1 and 2 tumors as “low grade” and grade 3 tumors as “high grade.” The current evidence base does not support the use of a 3-tiered grading system, although this is considered standard by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the College of American Pathologists. As for the 4 genomic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma (copy number low/p53 wild-type, copy number high/p53 abnormal, polymerase E mutant, and mismatch repair deficient), which only recently have been identified, there is accumulating evidence showing these categories can be reproducibly diagnosed and accurately assessed based on biopsy/curettage specimens as well as hysterectomy specimens. Furthermore, this subclassification system can be adapted for current clinical practice and is of prognostic significance independent of conventional variables used for risk assessment in patients with endometrial carcinoma (eg, stage). It is too soon to recommend the routine use of genomic classification in this setting; however, with further evidence, this system may become the basis for the subclassification of all endometrial carcinomas, supplanting (partially or completely) histotype, and grade. These recommendations were developed from the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists Endometrial Carcinoma project.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0000000000000518", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2908657103", "source": "openalex"}

The statement provides state-of-the-art information and presents the conclusions and recommendations of the consensus panel regarding these issues. In addition, the statement identifies those areas of study that deserve further investigation. The target audience of clinicians for this statement includes, but is not limited to, family practitioners, internists, gerontologists, orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, obstetricians and gynecologists, and preventive medicine specialisits.A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopaedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. In addition, 32 experts from these same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of approximately 700.The literature was searched using MEDLINE and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for their conference presentations with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience.The panel, answering predefined questions, developed their conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately following its release at the conference and was updated with the panel's final revisions.Osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages. Though more prevalent in white postmenopausal females, it often goes unrecognized in other populations. Osteoporosis is a devastating disorder with significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. The risks for osteoporosis, as reflected by low bone density, and the risks for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions known to be associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important, but as yet poorly validated, role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing risk of fracture, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation of these two components in bioavailable forms may be necessary in individuals who do not achieve recommended intake from dietary sources. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce the risk of falls in older individuals. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary goal in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. These include therapies that enhance bone mass and reduce risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for the presence of osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.285.6.785", "url": "https://openalex.org/W175660244", "source": "openalex"}

However, its presence in situ in solid human tumors has not been reported. In this study, we have investigated NO synthase activity and its cellular localization in malignant and nonmalignant human gynecological tissue. Nitric oxide synthase activity was observed in malignant tissue, was highest (> or = 250 pmol/min/g tissue) in poorly differentiated tumors, and was below detectable levels in normal gynecological tissue. Furthermore, investigations with a polyclonal NO synthase antibody revealed immunoreactivity only in malignant tissue. This was associated with NO synthase activity and localized to tumor cells.

Worldwide, FGR is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term morbidity. Ongoing advances in clinical care, especially in definitions, diagnosis, and management of FGR, require efforts to effectively translate these changes to the wide range of obstetric care providers. This article highlights agreements based on current research in the diagnosis and management of FGR, and the areas that need more research to provide further clarification of recommendations. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of available evidence along with practical recommendations concerning the care of pregnancies at risk of or complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. To achieve these goals, FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) brought together international experts to review and summarize current knowledge of FGR. This summary is directed at multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, healthcare delivery organizations and providers, FIGO member societies, and professional organizations. Recognizing the variation in the resources and expertise available for the management of FGR in different countries or regions, this article attempts to take into consideration the unique aspects of antenatal care in low-resource settings (labelled \"LRS\" in the recommendations). This was achieved by collaboration with authors and FIGO member societies from low-resource settings such as India, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Aspects of FGR addressed in this article include prediction, diagnosis, investigation, management, and postpartum counselling. The main recommendations are given below and are summarized in Table 1 (section 8) and in the management algorithms for high-resource settings (Figure 1a) and low-resource settings (Figure 1b) (section 4). This article is directed at multiple stakeholders with the intention of bringing attention to the assessment of fetal growth, with a particular focus on the screening, diagnosis, and management of FGR, which is a leading cause of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This article proposes to standardize and provide guidance for the screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management of FGR. The intended target audience includes: Healthcare providers: all those qualified to care for pregnant women (obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, general practitioners, midwives, nurses, advance practice clinicians, radiologists, sonographers, pediatricians, and neonatologists). Healthcare delivery organizations and providers: governments, federal and state legislators, healthcare management organizations, health insurance organizations, international development agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. Professional organizations: international, regional, and national professional organizations of obstetricians and gynecologists, obstetric ultrasound, family practitioners, pediatricians, neonatologists, and worldwide national organizations dedicated to the care of pregnant women and their offspring. In assessing the quality of evidence and grading of strength of recommendations, the article follows the terminology proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group.5 This system uses consistent language and graphical descriptions for the strength and quality of the recommendations and the evidence on which they are based. Recommendations are classified as strong or conditional (weak) (Table S1).6 The strength of recommendation is dependent not only on the quality of evidence, but also on factors such as risk–benefit, cost, resource allocation, values, and preferences. Thus, some recommendations may be based on low-quality evidence but still represent a benefit that outweighs the risks and burdens, and therefore may be strongly recommended. The overall quality of evidence was assessed for each of the recommendations and expressed using four levels of quality: very low, low, moderate, and high (Table S2).7 Considerations for quality of evidence include primarily the study design and methodology. As such, evidence based on randomized controlled trials is considered high-quality evidence, observational studies provide moderate or low quality of evidence, and all others are very low. However, other parameters must be considered while assessing the level of evidence: risk of bias, study limitations, consistency of results, precision, publication bias, indirectness of evidence, and scarcity of evidence. For the quality of evidence, cross-filled circles are used: ⊕○○○ denotes very low-quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○ low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○ moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕ high-quality evidence. FGR is a common pregnancy complication that worldwide is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term neonatal morbidity.8-15 The definition, diagnosis, and optimal management of FGR have generated controversy as clinicians strive for more harmonized care. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the available evidence and provide recommendations regarding the early prediction and prevention, diagnosis, investigation, monitoring, and timing of delivery of pregnancies complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this pregnancy complication. Given the variation in resources and expertise available for the assessment and monitoring of pregnancies complicated by FGR in different countries or regions, we have included, in addition to the standard of care or \"best\" recommendations, specific recommendations for low-resource settings, which are marked as in the recommendation tables. Management algorithms for women in high-resource and low-resource settings are summarized in Figure 1a,b, respectively. FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Clinically, this is reflected by a drop in fetal size percentiles over the course of gestation. However, fetal growth potential is difficult to determine, and serial assessments of fetal size to detect a drop in fetal weight percentile are usually not available. Instead, care providers most commonly have only a \"snapshot\" of fetal weight estimation at a given point in time. Therefore, in clinical practice, small for gestational age (SGA), defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference below a certain threshold such as the 10th or 3rd percentile, is most commonly used to suspect FGR. The use of SGA as a proxy for FGR has several limitations that need to be recognized. First, most SGA fetuses are constitutionally healthy small fetuses, whose smallness is merely the result of their predetermined growth potential (i.e. false-positive diagnosis of FGR). Second, some growth-restricted fetuses, depending on their original growth potential and timing of insult, may remain above the percentile threshold described above and may thus not be SGA (i.e. false-negative diagnosis of FGR). Third, the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR is limited by the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation, which has an estimation error of up to ±15%–20%. Finally, the diagnosis of SGA is highly dependent on the growth chart being used, which can therefore have a considerable effect on the proportion of fetuses or infants flagged as SGA in a given population. It should be noted that there is inconsistency in the literature regarding the terminology described above, where some use the term FGR to describe a fetus with an estimated weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and the term SGA to describe an infant with birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. However, for the purpose of this article, the term SGA is used to indicate an EFW or birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, and the term FGR to refer to a small fetus that has failed to achieve its growth potential because of a pathologic process. The major member societies of FIGO follow a definition using the 10th percentile as a means of diagnosing an SGA fetus, which then leads to further testing, assessment, and follow-up. There are proposals to address the limitations of this definition, but their validity regarding reduction in adverse outcomes needs to be tested. For example, in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations described above, a consensus-based definition for placenta-mediated FGR has been proposed via a Delphi procedure.1 To decrease the likelihood of false-positive and false-negative diagnosis of FGR, the consensus definition was based on a combination of measures of fetal size (fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference) and abnormal Doppler findings in the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries, as described in Box 1. The implementation of this definition is limited by the lack of a recommendation on which growth chart should be used to define the 10th and 3rd percentiles for EFW and fetal abdominal circumference. In addition, further research is needed to correlate this definition with adverse perinatal outcomes. Early-onset FGR (<32 weeks) Late-onset FGR (≥32 weeks) Abbreviations: AC, fetal abdominal circumference; AREDV, absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity; CPR, cerebroplacental ratio; EFW, estimated fetal weight; PI, pulsatility index; UA, umbilical artery; UtA, uterine artery. Adapted from Gordijn et al.1 It has been suggested that FGR should be broadly classified, based on gestational age at the time of diagnosis, into early-onset FGR (<32 weeks) and late-onset FGR (≥32 weeks). The rationale underlying this classification is based on differences between these two phenotypes of FGR in severity, natural history, Doppler findings, association with hypertensive complications, placental findings, and management.16-18 Early-onset FGR has a prevalence of 0.5%–1%, is usually more severe, and is more likely to be associated with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler than late-onset FGR. The underlying placental pathology is frequently similar to that observed in cases of early-onset pre-eclampsia (maternal vascular malperfusion), which explains the strong association of early-onset FGR with pre-eclampsia. Therefore, early-onset FGR is usually easier to detect, and the natural history tends to follow a predictable sequence of Doppler changes in the umbilical artery and ductus venosus. The main challenge in cases of early-onset FGR is management (i.e. timing of delivery), by attempting to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity.19 Late-onset FGR is more common than early-onset FGR with a prevalence of 5%–10%. In contrast to early-onset FGR, it is usually milder, is less likely to be associated with pre-eclampsia, and is usually associated with normal umbilical artery Doppler. Therefore, the main challenge with regard to late-onset FGR is diagnosis, while management (i.e. delivery) is relatively simple given that the diagnosis is commonly made during the late-preterm or term periods, where the risks associated with delivery are relatively small. The diagnosis of late-onset FGR mainly relies on adaptive changes in the cerebral circulation (\"redistribution\" or \"brain-sparing effect\"), which is reflected by low resistance to flow in the middle cerebral artery thereby generating a low cerebroplacental ratio, as described in section 8.1.7. Given that the umbilical artery and ductus venosus Doppler studies are usually normal in cases of late-onset FGR, the natural history in these cases is less predictable and there is a risk of sudden decompensation and stillbirth.16, 19 FGR is often the result of one or more maternal, placental, or fetal disorders that interfere with the normal mechanisms regulating fetal growth.20, 21 The most common etiologies of FGR are listed in Box 2. It is important to note that there is often confusion in the literature between \"etiologies\" (or pathogenetic pathways) and \"risk factors\" for FGR. For example, although maternal conditions such as chronic hypertension, kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and long-standing diabetes are often listed as \"maternal etiologies\" for FGR, these conditions should probably be viewed instead as maternal risk factors for abnormal placentation that may result in placenta-mediated FGR. Given that maternal nutrition and fetal growth are closely related,22, 23 maternal undernutrition is an important cause of FGR worldwide.24-26 The impact of maternal undernutrition on fetal growth depends on its timing and severity.20 To date, maternal interventions in dietary advice and modifications have lacked significant success in preventing FGR. While the mechanisms by which maternal anemia contribute to FGR are unclear, both impaired nutrient transport to the fetus 27 and abnormal placental adaptation to low maternal hemoglobin 28 have been suggested as potential mechanisms. Abnormal placentation is a common cause of FGR, 29 which is often diagnosed by ultrasound Doppler studies 30 and typical histopathological placental findings.31-33 Chromosomal abnormalities have been suggested to contribute to up to 5% of FGR cases; triploidy and trisomy 13 and 18 are important considerations in early-onset FGR and the risk of many aneuploidies is higher in the presence of structural fetal anomalies.34-36 In 1%–6% of cases of FGR with normal karyotype, submicroscopic (micro) duplications/deletions can be found using chromosomal microarray analysis,35 even when FGR is an apparently isolated finding.37 FGR is also more prevalent in fetuses with structural malformations, and the risk increases when multiple anomalies are present.38 FGR is related to intrauterine infection in up to 5% of cases.20, 39 Viral agents such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and Zika are common causes of infection-related FGR.40-44 Protozoan infections like toxoplasmosis and malaria are another important cause, especially in endemic areas.45, 46 The main mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of FGR in these cases is a decline in cell population.20 Finally, maternal exposure to teratogens such as radiation,47 illicit drugs,48, 49 and alcohol50 is another important etiology for FGR. The main short- and long-term risks associated with FGR are listed in Box 3. It is associated with both fetal and obstetric complications. The most devastating complication is stillbirth,51-53 and there is a well-established inverse relationship between weight percentile and the risk of stillbirth,54-57 which is more pronounced in the early preterm period than at term.58 FGR is an important cause of iatrogenic preterm birth,59 as early delivery remains the main and perhaps only strategy for the prevention of stillbirth in cases of severe FGR.16, 60 FGR is also an independent risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth.61 Other obstetric complications associated with FGR include pre-eclampsia and placental abruption, as the pathophysiology of these conditions is often closely related.29, 30, 62-66 Despite ongoing improvements in neonatal care, FGR is associated with increased neonatal mortality and short-term morbidity. The risk of perinatal mortality in term FGR is reported to be five- to 10-fold higher than in appropriately grown neonates.57, 61, 67 The severity of FGR, Doppler abnormalities, and associated prematurity are independent predictors of neonatal complications.68 Among preterm infants, the co-presence of FGR further increases the risk of certain prematurity-related complications such as respiratory morbidity, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and metabolic disorders.57 Among term infants, FGR increases the risks of low cord artery pH,69 low Apgar score,69 and neonatal complications such as hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and jaundice.70-72 Growth-restricted infants are also at risk of long-term complications including neurodevelopmental impairment 11, 73-78 and noncommunicable diseases.15, 79-82 This is discussed in greater detail in section 9.1 (Infant follow-up). Early prediction of FGR is important as it can identify women at high risk of FGR who may benefit from preventive interventions and close monitoring during pregnancy. Box 4 lists the most common risk factors for FGR. While the predictive value of individual risk factors is low, clinical prediction models that are based on combinations of the risk factors outlined below can considerably improve the prediction of FGR. One important limitation of most of the studies on early prediction of FGR is the lack of a gold standard for the antenatal or postnatal diagnosis of FGR. As such, there is wide variation among studies regarding the outcomes being predicted, including either SGA (birth weight below the 10th or 3rd percentile) or adverse perinatal outcomes that are associated with (but are not specific to) FGR. As many SGA infants are constitutionally small and healthy, differentiating between healthy small fetuses and those that are small due to FGR is critically important. As a rule, the prediction of early-onset severe FGR is better than of late-onset FGR.

Several maternal factors influence fetal growth and the risk of FGR: advanced maternal age, racial/ethnic origin (e.g. South Asian), consanguinity, low body mass index, nulliparity, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, assisted reproductive technology, and medical disorders such as chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune conditions (Box 4).83-89 Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for FGR and reduces birth weight by an average of 200 g in a dose–response manner.90 In a cohort of 33 602 pregnancies, maternal characteristics predicted 37% of women who subsequently delivered SGA neonates (birth weight <5th percentile) at a false-positive rate of 10%.83 Some risk factors for FGR are especially relevant in low-resource countries. In a recent review from Africa, the main risk factors reported were low maternal nutritional status, HIV infection, malaria, and hypertensive diseases. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that to a large extent FGR in Africa is preventable through established interventions for malaria, HIV, and maternal undernutrition.42 In addition, exposure during pregnancy and lactation to toxic environmental chemicals and heavy metals has become a growing problem, especially in low-resource countries.91 At this point there is no role for routine screening with serum biomarkers for FGR. However, when biochemical markers are available as part of prenatal genetic screening for trisomy 21, it may be reasonable to use this information for the purpose of risk stratification for FGR. The placenta releases multiple factors into maternal circulation from the early stages of pregnancy, and first-trimester serum levels of some of these factors have been shown to be associated with subsequent placenta-mediated complications.92, 93 Low levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a placental glycoprotein produced by the syncytiotrophoblast layer, have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. A meta-analysis including 32 studies and 175 240 pregnancies found that PAPP-A levels below the 5th percentile had a moderate association with birth weight below the 10th percentile (OR 2.08, positive predictive value of 18%), while the association was stronger for PAPP-A levels below the 1st percentile (OR 3.4; positive predictive value of 28%).94 Thus, although women with low PAPP-A are at increased risk for FGR, the majority of these women will have a normal pregnancy outcome, especially as an isolated biomarker in healthy women. However, a low PAPP-A level is often considered an indication for closer monitoring of fetal growth.95 Elevated second-trimester maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein are thought to reflect abnormal placental permeability and are associated with increased risk of placenta-mediated complications including FGR and stillbirth.96, 97 The combination of low PAPP-A in the first trimester and high alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester is particularly predictive of severe FGR.98 Elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels greater than 2.5 MoM in the second trimester, alone or combined with high alpha-fetoprotein levels, are also associated with an increased risk of SGA.99 Angiogenic factors play a key role in the regulation of placental vascular development.100 Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a proangiogenic factor highly expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast and the maternal endothelium. Impaired placentation is associated with reduced placental production of this protein. Low first-trimester PlGF levels have been shown to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome including pre-eclampsia and SGA.101-104 In a case–control study of 296 pregnancies with SGA and 609 controls, the detection rate of low PlGF for SGA at a false-positive rate of 5% and 10% was 15% and 21%, respectively. The combined use of PlGF and PAPP-A increased the detection rate to 19% and 27%, respectively.103 A multicenter screening study found that the detection rate of a combined screening by maternal factors, fetal biometry, and serum PlGF and alpha-fetoprotein at 19–24 weeks for the delivery of SGA infants below the 5th percentile at less than 32, 32–36, and greater than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation was 100%, 76%, and 38%, respectively, at a false-positive rate of 10%.96 Findings are less consistent for soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an antiangiogenic factor released from the placenta that results in maternal endothelial dysfunction characteristic of pre-eclampsia.105 Although maternal serum sFlt-1 levels are known to be elevated in pre-eclamptic pregnancies, a large case–control study demonstrated that high levels of sFlt-1 at 10–14 weeks were actually associated with a slightly reduced risk of SGA (OR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.96).101 Therefore, the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio test used to diagnose pre-eclampsia should not be used in the first trimester as a screening test for FGR.106 Several ultrasound-based markers have been shown to be predictive of FGR, including uterine artery Doppler, placental morphology, and placental volumes. However, given their modest predictive accuracy, they cannot be recommended for universal screening for FGR. Increased uterine artery resistance largely reflects a failure of extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion and transformation of the spiral arteries and is associated with the development of pre-eclampsia and FGR due to maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta.107 First- and second-trimester abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, defined as mean pulsatility index above the 95th percentile, have been shown to be associated with FGR.108-110 In a large prospective cohort study of 4610 nulliparous women, uterine artery pulsatility index at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks predicted 60% of preterm and 17% of term SGA infants at a false-positive rate of 10%.111 Although uterine artery Doppler shows promise, especially for the prediction of early-onset FGR, current evidence does not support routine screening with uterine artery Doppler for FGR in low- or high-risk pregnancies.112 Sonographic evaluation of the placenta is a routine part of the obstetric ultrasound examination. A method for systematic two-dimensional (2D) placental ultrasound examination has been described, often in combination with other parameters 30, 113, 114 Abnormal placental morphology is defined by placental dimensions, shape, texture, and cord insertion. Placental shape is considered abnormal when the placental thickness is above 4 cm or greater than 50% of placental length. Placental texture is defined as normal when it is homogenous, and abnormal when the placenta is heterogeneous and contains multiple echogenic cystic lesions or has a jelly-like appearance with turbulent uteroplacental flow.115, 116 Placental cord insertion is defined as central (>2 cm from placental disc margin), marginal (within 2 cm of margin), or velamentous (inserting into the surrounding membranes).114 In a cohort of 60 high-risk women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler, women with abnormal placental shape at 19–23 weeks had higher odds of FGR (OR 4.7) than women with normal placental shape.108 However, the use of 2D placental imaging has significant limitations, including difficulty in assessing nonanterior placentas and a wide variability in the morphology of normal placentas. Furthermore, there are no large-scale prospective studies validating the use of this modality for prediction of FGR.114 Improvements in ultrasonographic imaging provide a tool for estimating placental volume using three- and four-dimensional scanning techniques. Placental volume has been proposed as a marker for various obstetric complications related to defective placental function, including FGR.117, 118 A systematic review estimating the value of first-trimester 3D placental volume for the prediction of SGA found a detection rate of 24.7% at a 10% false-positive rate.119 Another parameter is the placental quotient, defined as the ratio of the placental volume to the fetal crown–rump length. The placental quotient was reported to have a high negative predictive value for perinatal complications but was not very useful when used for screening of SGA in a low-risk population, with a sensitivity of 27.1%.120 The discriminatory ability of placental volume alone for SGA appears to be modest, but may be integrated into a multivariable screening model. However, the use of 3D placental volume as a routine screening tool for FGR is limited by the need for proper equipment and training required to obtain these measurements in a reproducible manner. Currently there is no single screening test sufficiently predictive of FGR to recommend routine clinical use. Investigations are underway to combine various tests, but such prediction models have not been sufficiently validated in terms of outcomes studies and therefore must be considered investigative protocols at this time. In a prospective cohort of 4970 women, the combination of first-trimester maternal serum PAPP-A, beta hCG, maternal blood pressure, and uterine artery Doppler performed in the first trimester had a detection rate of 73% for early SGA (<34 weeks) but only 32% for late SGA (≥34 weeks).19 A different model that included maternal characteristics, first-trimester blood pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, PlGF, and sFlt-1 was evaluated in a larger cohort of 9150 women and achieved a detection rate of 86% for early-onset FGR and 66% for late-onset FGR, both at a false-positive rate of 10%.19, 121 In the second trimester, the SCOPE consortium examined 5606 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies and found that the combination of clinical risk factors, 15-week biomarkers (53 biomarkers were used), and 20-week ultrasound (fetal biometry and Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries) had only a moderate detection rate for SGA below the 10th percentile, with a positive predictive value of 32% and a negative predictive value of 91%.122 Ideally, all women should plan their pregnancies, adopting a healthy lifestyle and optimizing any medical conditions and their body mass index. The preconception period provides an opportunity for health promotion with the aim of reducing accepted risk factors, including those associated with FGR.123 Insufficient gestational weight gain has been associated with an increased risk of FGR, especially in women with low body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).124 Recognizing that these associations are only based on observational data, we still believe that it would be reasonable to recommend monitoring of weight gain and informing women of the target weight gain range, as recommended by the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines.125 These guidelines recommend a total gestational weight gain of 12.5–18 kg (28–40 lb) for underweight women (BMI <18.5); 11.5–16 kg (25–35 lb) for the normal weight group (BMI 18.5–24.9); 7–11.5 kg (15–25 lb) for overweight women (BMI 25.0–29.9); and 5–9 kg (11–20 lb) for obese women (BMI ≥30).126 Substance use, including smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs, is associated with low birth weight and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.90 Interventions to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy have been shown to result in a reduction in low birth weight (RR 0.81) and an increase in mean birth weight (+33 g).127 Women should be advised that smoking cessation at any point in gestation is of benefit, and that the greatest benefit is associated with cessation before 15 weeks of pregnancy.128 The risk of SGA with alcohol intake is increased with as little as one drink per day.129 Most studies on early prevention of placental complications have focused on pre-eclampsia, with the results often being extrapolated to FGR due to the common pathophysiology. However, to date, other than lifestyle modifications, no medical interventions to prevent FGR have been clearly established. Aspirin is recommended for women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia, but there is some evidence that it may a", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13522", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3139210974", "source": "openalex"}

As an obstetrics and gynecology physician or provider, you will likely encounter women who are at risk of development or relapse of a mental disorder during this vulnerable time. Objective The aim of this review is to examine theory and research on mood and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period with an emphasis on screening recommendations. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed and PsycINFO search for English-language publications about perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and screening was performed and included studies on subtopics. Results The literature reviewed suggests that perinatal mood and anxiety symptoms are prevalent and have significant consequences, and best practices for early detection are through routine depression and anxiety screening in the obstetrics setting. This includes overcoming barriers to care and use of liaison services to potentially reduce risk. Conclusions and Relevance High-quality prenatal care systems should develop the capacity for depression and anxiety risk assessment and treatment. Providers should routinely screen using validated screening tools, provide maternal mental health education, and be aware of the various medical, psychological, and complementary approaches for treating mood and anxiety disorders, to best guide and refer patients. The use of this practice will increase the quality of life in pregnant women with depression and anxiety and may help to reduce the likelihood of adverse birth outcomes, postpartum mental health problems, and adverse effects on offspring.

In 1993, we introduced evidence-based practice into our Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco. We orient all fellows, residents, and students to new methods of clinical decision making that use formal rules of evidence. We changed the format of clinical conferences from didactic lectures to clinical problem-solving sessions using the evidence-based medicine approach. Useful resources include the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Database on computer; Epi Info, version 6, a public-domain software package for microcomputers; 24-hour access to free MEDLINE searches via the Internet; the ACOG Resource Center; ACOGNET; and several paperback texts on critical appraisal. Evidence-based medicine helps to level the intellectual playing field in an academic department. This approach directly improves patient care by placing practice on a more secure scientific foundation.

From 1975 to 2000, medical malpractice costs for obstetrician–gynecologists have risen nearly four-fold higher than that of other medical costs. In addition, it has been estimated that defensive medicine may cost society $80 billion per year. Most importantly, many obstetrician–gynecologists are frustrated and seem to be abandoning the parts of their practice they perceive to put them at higher liability risk. This article discusses other medical specialty society efforts that have been successful in addressing the area of patient safety. Efforts to better track quality outcomes has been initiated by the American College of Surgeons through the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists has demonstrated both dramatically improved outcomes and reduced liability costs through a concerted patient safety effort. The author proposes changes in four areas to specifically address patient safety in obstetrics and gynecology, including: the development of reliable and reproducible quality control measures (and a system to track them); national closed claim reviews to better understand and address the most important safety and liability areas for obstetrician–gynecologists; work prospectively with pharmaceutical and surgical device manufacturers to develop innovative new products that would increase the likelihood of safe outcomes; and create a culture of safety in obstetrics and gynecology by incorporating safety education into all levels of training. Systematic focus on patient safety, with specific recommendations for improvements, is needed in obstetrics and gynecology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000241096.85499.a8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980825397", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: Three groups of 10 doctors with different levels of ultrasound experience in obstetrics and gynecology were included. The novices had less than 1 month of experience, the intermediate group had 12-60 months of experience and the senior participants were all consultants. Fifteen participants performed transabdominal fetal biometry and the other 15 participants performed systematic transvaginal gynecological ultrasound scans. All scans were video-recorded and assessed by two blinded consultants using the OSAUS scale. The OSAUS scores were compared between the groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and pass/fail scores were determined using the contrasting-groups method of standard setting. RESULTS: For the transabdominal fetal biometry examinations, the mean ± SD OSAUS scores of the novices, intermediates and senior participants were 1.5 ± 0.4, 3.3 ± 0.6 and 4.4 ± 0.4, respectively (P = 0.003). For the systematic transvaginal scans, the mean ± SD OSAUS scores of the novices, intermediates and senior participants were 1.8 ± 0.2, 3.1 ± 0.1 and 3.9 ± 0.5, respectively (P = 0.003). Post-hoc comparisons showed significant differences between each of the groups for both types of scans. The pass/fail score was 2.5 for the transvaginal scan and 3.0 for the transabdominal biometry examinations. The inter-rater reliability was 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound competence can be assessed in a reliable and valid way using the OSAUS scale. The pass/fail scores may be used to help determine when trainees are qualified for independent practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.13198", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1607559973", "source": "openalex"}

Compared to the number of registered treatments in 2008, when the cycle‐based registry was newly introduced, there was a 2.07‐fold increase in the total number of treatments and a 2.25‐fold increase in the number of cycles with a live birth. As the average age of patients who receive assisted reproductive technology has become markedly higher year by year, the most common age of those patients who received assisted reproductive technology in 2014 was 40 years.

This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7124", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3006809786", "source": "openalex"}

However, it has been used widely in obstetrics and gynecology practice because of its effectiveness, low cost, stability in light and hot climate conditions, and ease of administration compared with its licensed counterparts—dinoprostone and gemeprost. A large number of studies have shown that misoprostol is effective in first and second trimester abortion, late pregnancy labor induction, and third stage of labor management (misoprostol has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for these indications). Because misoprostol is not registered for such use, it has not undergone the extensive testing for appropriate dosage and safety required for registration. Serious complications such as teratogenesis after failed abortions and uterine rupture during second trimester abortions and third trimester labor induction have been reported as the result of increasingly wide use of misoprostol in obstetric and gynecology practice.

The extent of the professional barriers physicians face trying to integrate abortion into their practice is unknown.In 2006, in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 obstetrician-gynecologists who had graduated 5-10 years earlier from residency programs that included abortion training. Interviews about physicians' experiences with abortion training and practice were coded and analyzed using a grounded theoretical approach.Eighteen physicians had wanted to offer elective abortions after residency, but only three were doing so at the time of the interview. The majority were unable to provide abortions because of formal and informal policies imposed by their private group practices, employers and hospitals, as well as the strain that doing so might put on relationships with superiors and coworkers. Restrictions on abortion provision sometimes were made explicit when new physicians interviewed for a job, but sometimes became apparent only after they had joined a practice or institution. Several physicians mentioned the threat of violence as an obstacle to providing abortions, but few considered this the greatest deterrent.The stigma and ideological contention surrounding abortion manifest themselves in professional environments as barriers to the integration of abortion into medical practice.

Prolonged median survival can be achieved in those patients entirely free of tumor after surgery by the administration of postsurgical platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. However, residual tumor is present in the majority of patients, which limits survival prognosis. Different therapy approaches should be utilized to improve prognosis in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce “downstaging” of the tumor and thus improve operability. Here, evidence of large ascites volume (>500 mL) can be used to identify those patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS In a prospective, nonrandomized Phase II study, 31 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received 3 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy, followed by tumor debulking surgery and 3 additional cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy. During the same period, 32 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received conventional therapy (tumor debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy). The two groups were investigated and compared with respect to tumor resection rates, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery, duration of surgery, and median survival. RESULTS The tumor resection rate in the patient group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that of the conventionally treated group; the median survival time of 42 months versus 23 months also was significantly longer (P = 0.007). Time spent in surgery, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of FIGO Stage IIIC who will benefit only marginally from conventional therapy can be identified by evidence of large ascites volume. Higher tumor resection rates and longer median survival can be achieved in these patients by the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A prospective randomized multicenter study currently is being performed by the Society for Gynecological Oncology in Germany to confirm these findings.

METHODS: This is an observational study conducted through web sites of U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residency programs accredited in 2012–2013. RESULTS: In obstetrics and gynecology departmental administrative leadership roles, women comprised 20.4% of chairs, 36.1% of vice chairs, and 29.6% of division directors. Among educational leaders, women comprised 31.9% of fellowship directors, 47.3% of residency directors, and 66.1% of medical student clerkship directors. Chairs were most likely to be maternal–fetal medicine faculty (38.2%) followed by specialists in general obstetrics and gynecology (21.8%), reproductive endocrinologists (15.6%), and gynecologic oncologists (14.7%). Among chairs, 32.9% are male maternal–fetal medicine specialists. Family planning had the highest representation of women (80.0%) among division directors, whereas reproductive endocrinology and infertility had the lowest (15.8%). The largest proportion of women chairs, vice chairs, residency program directors, and medical student clerkship directors were specialists in general obstetrics and gynecology. CONCLUSION: Women remained underrepresented in the departmental leadership roles of chair, vice chair, division director, and fellowship director. Representation of women was closer to parity among residency program directors, in which women held just under half of positions. Nearly one in three department chairs was a male maternal–fetal medicine specialist.

Currently, no studies of US OB/GYN residents exist that question their knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward discussing age-related fertility decline and oocyte cryopreservation with patients.A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the fall of 2014 among residents in American Council for Graduate (ACOG) Medical Education-approved OB/GYN residency programs. Program directors were emailed via the ACOG Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology server listing and asked to solicit resident participation.Participants included 238 residents evenly distributed between post-graduate years 1-4 with varied post-residency plans; 90% of residents were women and 75% were 26-30 years old. The survey was divided into three sections: demographics, fertility awareness, and attitudes toward discussing fertility preservation options with patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted.A strong majority of residents (83%) believed an OB/GYN should initiate discussions about age-related fertility decline with patients (mean patient age 31.8), and 73% percent believed these discussions should be part of an annual exam. One third of residents overestimated the age at which there is a slight decline in female fertility, while nearly half of residents overestimated the age at which female fertility markedly declines. Over three-quarters of residents (78.4%) also overestimated the likelihood of success using assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). Residents were likely to support oocyte cryopreservation in cancer patients irrespective of the woman's age, but much less likely to support elective oocyte cryopreservation. For elective oocyte cryopreservation, 40% believed OB/GYNs should initiate discussions with patients (mean age 31.1), while only 20% believed this topic should be part of an annual exam.Because the study invitation was sent through US OB/GYN residency program directors rather than directly to residents, it is possible that some residents did not receive the invitation to participate. This limits the generalizability of the findings.Within the USA, there appears to be a critical need for improved education on fertility decline in OB/GYN residency programs. To promote informed reproductive decision-making among patients, efforts should be made to help OB/GYNs provide comprehensive fertility education to all women, while also respecting patient choices.None.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dev308", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2235432447", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Methodologic criteria for reporting logistic regression analyses were developed to identify problems affecting accuracy, precision, and interpretation of this approach to multivariable statistical analysis. These criteria were applied to 193 articles that reported multivariable logistic regression in the issues of four generic obstetrics and gynecology journals in 1985, 1990, and 1995. Rates of compliance with the methodologic criteria and their time trends were analyzed. Results: The proportion of articles using logistic regression analysis increased over time: 1.7% in 1985, 2.8% in 1990, and 6.5% in 1995 (P < .001 for trend). Violations and omissions of methodologic criteria for reporting logistic models were common. The research question, in terms of dependent and independent variables, was not clearly reported in 32.1%.

Outcome measurements include the number and stage of screen-detected cancers, the number and stage of cancers not detected at screening, the number of equivocal screening results requiring recall/repetition, and the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease.Thirteen epithelial ovarian malignancies (12 invasive and one borderline), developed in the cohort.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could induce \"downstaging\" of the tumor and thus improve operability. Here, evidence of large ascites volume (>500 mL) can be used to identify those patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In a prospective, nonrandomized Phase II study, 31 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received 3 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy, followed by tumor debulking surgery and 3 additional cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy. During the same period, 32 patients with advanced FIGO Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and large ascites volume (>500 mL) received conventional therapy (tumor debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum/taxane-based combination chemotherapy). The two groups were investigated and compared with respect to tumor resection rates, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery, duration of surgery, and median survival.The tumor resection rate in the patient group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that of the conventionally treated group; the median survival time of 42 months versus 23 months also was significantly longer (P = 0.007). Time spent in surgery, blood transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality during surgery were not significantly different.Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma of FIGO Stage IIIC who will benefit only marginally from conventional therapy can be identified by evidence of large ascites volume. Higher tumor resection rates and longer median survival can be achieved in these patients by the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A prospective randomized multicenter study currently is being performed by the Society for Gynecological Oncology in Germany to confirm these findings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(20011115)92:10<2585::aid-cncr1611>3.0.co;2-", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4250894715", "source": "openalex"}

Women were classified based on 1988 and 2009 FIGO staging systems. Major changes in the 2009 system include: 1) classification of patients with stage IA and IB tumors as stage IA; 2) elimination of stage IIA; and 3) stratification of stage IIIC into pelvic nodes only (IIIC1) or paraaortic nodal (IIIC2) involvement. Survival and use of adjuvant therapy were analyzed.A total of 81,902 women were identified. Based on the 1988 staging system, survival for stage IA was 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90-91%) compared with 88.9% (95% CI 88-89%) for IB tumors. In the 2009 system, survival was 89.6% (95% CI 89-90%) for stage IA and 77.6% (95% CI 76-79%) for stage IB. The survival for FIGO 1988 stage IIA was superior to stage IC, whereas in the 2009 system, survival for stage II was inferior to all stage I patients. The newly defined stage IIIC substages are prognostically different. Survival for stage IIIC1 was 57.0% (95% CI 54-60%) compared with 49.4% (95% CI 46-53%) for stage IIIC2.The 2009 FIGO staging system for uterine corpus cancer is highly prognostic.

The questionnaire asked patients about their comfort levels with having medical students present during commonly encountered clinical situations. A random subsample of these patients were also asked whether they would allow a medical student to be present during future visits, and why or why not.A total of 229 patients completed the survey and 124 responded to the supplemental survey. Sixteen respondents were excluded due to missing data or a lack of an adequate comparison group. A majority responded they would feel comfortable having a medical student present during most clinical situations. Almost half of the patients preferred to see the doctor and medical student together, while less than a quarter wanted to see just the physician. Patients with more experience with medical students were more likely to favor medical student involvement and would feel more comfortable having a medical student present during obstetrics or gynecology clinical situations.Patients are willing to involve and feel comfortable with medical students in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic.

Evidence based on meta-analyses of individual case-control studies is accumulating, defining specific individual variations in disease susceptibility. For example, genetic variations of the estradiol metabolism have been described as significant contributors to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. In the field of obstetrics and gynecology, the genetic contribution of polymorphic markers to a series of disorders has been characterized. These disorders include recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-related complications such as thrombosis. Among other genetic markers, thrombophilic genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A polymorphisms, as well as genetic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for example, CYP19 and CYP1B1, have been established as genetic risk markers and disease modifiers of recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss and HRT-independent and -dependent breast cancer, respectively. In addition, meta-analyses of data in the literature established the TGFBR1*6A, GSTP I105V, and TP53 R72P polymorphisms, as well as the GSTM1 gene deletion as low-penetrance genetic risk factors of sporadic breast cancer. With respect to genetic modulation of therapeutic effects, beneficial effects of estrogen replacement therapy and HRT are modulated by the carriage of single nucleotide polymorphisms, for example, osteoprotection and blood lipid changes by the estrogen receptor-α (ER-a) PvuII polymorphism. Polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), ER-α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and Factor V genes have been demonstrated to modulate the timing of natural menopause. Lastly, a strong genetic contribution of polymorphisms to the development and the clinical course of endometriosis has been established with data pointing to polymorphisms of the COMT, GST, NAT-2, and ER-α genes as susceptibility markers. In summary, the available evidence points to a number of polymorphisms of a wide variety of genes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign and malignant gynecologic and obstetric conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1517/phgs.5.1.57.25687", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160293805", "source": "openalex"}

New insights and more experience were gained since the first consensus meeting 5 years ago. METHODS: Members of the European Society of Gynecological Oncology task force \"Cancer in Pregnancy\" in concert with other international experts reviewed the existing literature on their respective areas of expertise. The summaries were subsequently merged into a complete article that served as a basis for discussion during the consensus meeting. All participants approved the final article. RESULTS: In the experts' view, cancer can be successfully treated during pregnancy in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, optimizing maternal treatment while considering fetal safety. To maximize the maternal outcome, cancer treatment should follow a standard treatment protocol as for nonpregnant patients. Iatrogenic prematurity should be avoided. Individualization of treatment and effective psychologic support is imperative to provide throughout the pregnancy period. Diagnostic procedures, including staging examinations and imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging and sonography, are preferable. Pelvic surgery, either open or laparoscopic, as part of a treatment protocol, may reveal beneficial outcomes and is preferably performed by experts. Most standard regimens of chemotherapy can be administered from 14 weeks gestational age onward. Apart from cervical and vulvar cancer, as well as important vulvar scarring, the mode of delivery is determined by the obstetrician. Term delivery is aimed for. Breast-feeding should be considered based on individual drug safety and neonatologist-breast-feeding expert's consult. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited evidence-based information, cancer treatment during pregnancy can succeed. State-of-the-art treatment should be provided for this vulnerable population to preserve maternal and fetal prognosis.

Patients and Methods A retrospective review of 360 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV EOC who underwent primary surgery followed by six cycles of intravenous platinum/paclitaxel was performed. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of potential prognostic factors with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results The median PFS and OS for this group of stage IV ovarian cancer patients was 12 and 29 months, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that histology, malignant pleural effusion, intraparenchymal liver metastasis, and residual tumor size were significant prognostic variables. Whereas patients with microscopic residual disease had the best outcome, patients with 0.1 to 1.0 cm residual disease and patients with 1.1 to 5.0 cm residual disease had similar PFS and OS. Patients with a residual size more than 5 cm had a diminished PFS and OS when compared with all other groups. Median OS for microscopic, 0.1 to 5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm residual disease was 64, 30, and 19 months, respectively. Conclusion Patients with more than 5 cm residual disease have the shortest PFS and OS, whereas patients with 0.1 to 1.0 and 1.1 to 5.0 cm have similar outcome. These findings suggest that ultraradical cytoreductive procedures might be targeted for selected patients in whom microscopic residual disease is achievable. Patients with less than 5.0 cm of disease initially and significant disease and/or comorbidities precluding microscopic cytoreduction may be considered for alternative therapeutic options other than primary cytoreduction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2007.13.1953", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167610363", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2722685099", "title": "FIGO's updated recommendations for misoprostol used alone in gynecology and obstetrics", "text": "In 2012, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) produced a chart detailing recommended dosages of misoprostol when used alone, for a variety of gynecologic and obstetric indications. In light of new evidence1-13 and through expert deliberation, this chart has now been revised and expanded (Fig. 1). Some areas were particularly challenging to develop given the limited, low-quality, or inconsistent evidence. The present commentary is intended to explain some of the changes and decisions made. The layout is now categorized vertically by gestation and horizontally by indication. Gestation is labelled and referred to as the number of weeks of gestation (<13 weeks, 13–26 weeks, and >26 weeks), with the final column being for postpartum use. However, in the case of incomplete abortion under 13 weeks, and inevitable abortion between 13–26 weeks, women should be treated on the basis of their uterine size rather than last menstrual period dating. Recommendations have been added for inevitable abortion and cervical preparation between 13 and 26 weeks, and for termination of pregnancy at more than 26 weeks. For less than 13 weeks' gestation, we decided to recommend a fixed number of doses without specifying a maximum. This is because many early pregnancy regimens will be used on an outpatient basis, so it is useful for healthcare providers to know in advance how many doses to give the client; there is also sufficient evidence to support a fixed number of doses for use in pregnancies of less than 13 weeks' gestation, as well as evidence that it is safe to give further doses if they are required.1-4, 14 For 13–26 weeks' gestation, the notion of a maximum number of doses has been extrapolated from clinical research in which maximum doses are commonly noted not on the basis of patient safety issues or efficacy,9 but rather as tangible endpoints. In clinical practice, however, they might not have great utility, and dosing should continue until expulsion, in the absence of rare complications. Suggesting that providers should discontinue dosing could actually increase risks, particularly when providers have few alternatives available if expulsion has not yet occurred. Some unpublished studies and clinical experience have shown that complete expulsion can be safely achieved by continuing the regimen up to 72 hours, without compromising the woman's safety.9 Given recently published evidence,2-9 we have added alternative routes for taking misoprostol; in most cases, this has meant the addition of the buccal route, in which the tablets are placed in the cheek for 30 minutes after which any remnants are swallowed. This route has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to the vaginal route. Further ongoing studies are indicating this to be a promising route for other indications on the chart, but these indications have not been included because data on efficacy have not been reported. Future studies will continue to provide evidence on what might be a variety of effective regimens and routes of administration. Although this could result in several available options for providers, it will also enable women's preferences to be taken into consideration. Women's preferences can vary, with some preferring the vaginal route (if inserting the pills themselves) and some preferring non-vaginal routes. However, the vaginal route should be avoided when there is bleeding and/or signs of infection. The chart does not include the rectal route. We recommend against using this route because the pharmacokinetic profile is not associated with the best efficacy. The use of misoprostol at 13–26 weeks' gestation in women with previous cesarean or transmural uterine scar was debated because of concerns about an increased risk of uterine rupture. For fetal death, a Cochrane meta-analysis15 reported mixed findings, concluding that the data were insufficient to assess the occurrence of uterine rupture. A few studies have reported no increased likelihood of rupture,16 but often women with prior cesarean or uterine surgery are excluded from studies or reviews, or trials are insufficiently powered to detect a difference in safety outcomes as a result of the rarity of major adverse events. There is some evidence that, for terminations in this period, the risk of uterine rupture among women with a prior cesarean delivery using misoprostol is less than 0.3%1, 17; other studies9, 18-20 concluded that there are no significant differences in outcomes for women with previous cesarean(s). We therefore concluded that misoprostol can be used for women with previous cesarean or other transmural uterine scar throughout 13–26 weeks. There is insufficient evidence available to recommend a regimen of misoprostol for use at more than 26 weeks' gestation in women who have had a previous cesarean or transmural uterine scar. Therefore, without evidence to support a safe regimen, we do not provide one, other than to recommend following local protocol in these cases. Although there is some evidence to support a decreasing dose with increasing gestational age, there is little evidence to support the advice given in some international and national clinical guidelines to use lower doses of misoprostol in cases of fetal death. Irrespective of the issue of recommendations for different doses, various reviews15, 20, 21 have concluded that there is insufficient evidence overall of superiority of one dose or schedule of misoprostol over another for use in pregnancies at or over 13 weeks' gestation. In making recommendations, we acknowledged that providers might be keen to identify lowest possible doses because of reduced adverse effects,21 but that it was also important to consider success rates and time to delivery: low doses have been shown to be associated with a longer induction-to-delivery interval and lower overall effectiveness,15, 21 and evidence has supported the safety of the \"higher\" doses for women.7-9 Recommendations in the chart were compiled with this in mind, while also acknowledging that it is possible that a range of dosages could be effective and safe. There have been two studies of the use of misoprostol for the treatment of retained placenta following live birth, neither of which show any benefit over placebo.22 We therefore do not recommend misoprostol for retained placenta in late pregnancy. Secondary prevention is a community-based strategy that has been shown to be a comparable alternative to a universal prophylaxis approach in two large community trials (one in press).12 Rather than medicating all women during the third stage of labor with a prophylactic dose, a regimen of 800 μg sublingual misoprostol (the same as for treatment) can be used to treat only women with higher-than-average bleeding (e.g. approximately 350 mL or more). Although there is limited published data, it was agreed that secondary prevention of PPH is a strong alternative approach to universal prophylaxis, because it involves medicating far fewer women (5%–10% vs 100%), thus causing fewer adverse effects and reducing costs. The FIGO Misoprostol-only Recommended Regimens 2017 chart (Fig. 1) is the result of extensive collaboration among an international expert group. It has been endorsed by the FIGO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion Working Group and the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee, and approved by the FIGO Officers. Available in other languages and formats from http://figo.org, it is hoped that it will be as widely distributed and used as the previous version. Although these recommended dosages have been decided on the basis of current evidence available and expert opinion, new evidence is regularly emerging and thus there is a need to review and revise these recommendations in the future. Misoprostol is an important medicine and, although it should not be used in preference over oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage, or instead of mifepristone plus misoprostol for pregnancy termination, it could be the only medicine available in some circumstances, which is why FIGO believes this \"misoprostol-only\" chart is needed. Misoprostol must continue to be highlighted as an essential medicine and included in international documents, national guidelines, and essential medicines lists. Further, we must work to ensure the availability of high-quality misoprostol, and the establishment of policy and programs that support its availability and use. The recent WHO guidelines on health worker roles in providing safe abortion care23 outline a wide variety of healthcare providers who can manage medical abortion and postabortion care in the first trimester, with auxiliary nurses, nurses, and midwives listed, as well as lay health workers and doctors of complementary systems for some subtasks. Women can also fulfill some of the components of assessment and management themselves outside of a healthcare facility. It is anticipated that this misoprostol chart can be used by all healthcare providers identified in the WHO publication and that by implementing both, we will come closer to achieving optimal care for the women we aim to serve. All authors contributed to the development of the chart and the writing of the commentary.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.12181", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2722685099", "source": "openalex"}

However, this relationship has not been well evaluated within clinical learning environments.To evaluate the relationship between student attendance and academic performance in a medical student obstetrics/gynecology clinical rotation.A prospective cohort study of student attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities during a full academic year (September 2011 to June 2012) within a publicly funded university teaching hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Students were expected to attend 64 activities (26 clinical activities and 38 tutorial-based activities) but attendance was not mandatory. All 147 fourth-year medical students who completed an 8-week obstetrics/gynecology rotation were included.Student attendance at clinical and tutorial-based activities, recorded using a paper-based logbook.The overall examination score (out of a possible 200 points) was obtained using an 11-station objective structured clinical examination (40 points), an end-of-year written examination comprising 50 multiple-choice questions (40 points) and 6 short-answer questions (40 points), and an end-of-year long-case clinical/oral examination (80 points). Students were required to have an overall score of 100 points (50%) and a minimum of 40 points in the long-case clinical/oral examination (50%) to pass.The mean attendance rate was 89% (range, 39%-100% [SD, 11%], n = 57/64 activities). Male students (84% attendance, P = .001) and students who failed an end-of-year examination previously (84% attendance, P = .04) had significantly lower rates. There was a positive correlation between attendance and overall examination score (r = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.44-0.70]; P < .001). Both clinical attendance (r = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.32-0.64]; P < .001) and tutorial-based attendance (r = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40-0.70]; P < .001) were positively correlated with overall examination score. The associations persisted after controlling for confounding factors of student sex, age, country of origin, previous failure in an end-of-year examination, and the timing of the rotation during the academic year. Distinction grades (overall score of ≥60%) were present only among students with attendance rates of 80% or higher. The odds of a distinction grade increased with each 10% increase in attendance (adjusted odds ratio, 5.52; 95% CI, 2.17-14.00).

Data sources and methods: We reviewed the published literature on calcium channel blockers and their pharmacology and therapeutic applications in obstetrics and gynecology. We paid particular attention to methods of animal research and recent clinical evaluations. Conclusions: The dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers (type II calcium blockers) and, specifically, nifedipine are safe for use in pregnancy. They have little teratogenic or fetotoxic potential. Nifedipine's mechanism of action is through smooth-muscle relaxation secondary to blockage of the slow calcium channels into the cells. In vivo, there is minimal effect on the cardiac conducting system. Multiple studies in women have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of nifedipine as an antihypertensive. Therapeutic doses range from 10-30 mg orally every 6-8 hours. For acute control of hypertension, 10 mg of sublingual nifedipine may be used. Nifedipine is as effective as betamimetics in decreasing uterine activity. As a tocolytic agent, it is more effective as there are fewer patients who have to discontinue nifedipine because of side effects. The side effects of nifedipine include flushing, headache, or, rarely, hypotension in the hypovolemic patient. Nifedipine has potential and theoretical indications for dysmenorrhea and bladder irritability.(Obstet Gynecol 1994;83:616-24)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006250-199404000-00024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991694792", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS A questionnaire-based study was administered to residents taking the 2001 Council on Residency Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology examination. RESULTS More than 90% of the residents reported that their institution had a maternity leave policy. The leave was usually 4–8 weeks long and was paid. Nearly 95% of residents reported that they had to take over the work of residents on maternity leave. Most women residents worked more than 80 hours weekly throughout pregnancy, and few took time off before delivery. Most pregnancies occurred during the fourth year of training and did not seem to be adversely affected by the long work hours. CONCLUSION This study, performed before the institution of the new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education resident duty hour policies, demonstrated that, although women house officers continued to work more than 80 hours per week during pregnancy, most had a good pregnancy outcome. Nevertheless, there was a higher frequency of preterm labor, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction in female residents than in spouses or partners of male residents.

Current applications in gynecology and their associated outcomes will be analyzed.Since the late 1990s, the use of computer-assisted or robotic technology in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery has increased. Much of this experience revolves around the da Vinci surgical system, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for gynecologic applications in April 2005. The largest body of experience exists with robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, particularly those classified as American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists type IVE or Laparoscopic Supracervical Hysterectomy III. Other notable applications are in the areas of myomectomy, tubal reanastomosis, sacrocolpopexy, and cancer staging. Advantages of the robotic approach are the improved dexterity and precision of the instruments coupled with three-dimensional imaging. Limitations include the absence of haptic (tactile) feedback, bulkiness of the system, lack of vaginal access, and cost.Current evidence demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the robotic approach for gynecologic surgery.

METHODS: An investigator-designed questionnaire about abortion training in obstetrics and gynecology residency programs was mailed to all U.S. residency directors. Collected data included program information, abortion training, and numbers of residents trained. Data were analyzed to estimate differences in abortion training by region, program size, and type of training offered. RESULTS: Of the 252 questionnaires mailed, 185 (73%) were returned. Of the 185, 94 (51%) program directors reported routine instruction in elective abortion, 72 (39%) optional training, and 19 (10%) no training. Large programs and programs located in the Northeast and West Coast were significantly more likely to offer routine training in terminations (P < .01). In the programs offering routine training, more than 50% of residents received instruction in termination practices. Of those practices, the most common were first-trimester surgical abortion (85% of programs), followed by medical abortion (59%), second-trimester induction (51% of programs), and dilation and extraction (36%). As compared with those in programs with optional training, residents in programs with routine training were significantly more likely to receive instruction in all modalities of abortion provision and performed proportionally more first- and second-trimester terminations (P < .01).

The use of robotics in gynecologic surgery is increasing in the United States. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries in gynecology include benign hysterectomy, myomectomy, tubal reanastomoses, radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissections, and sacrocolpopexies. The majority of the current literature includes case series of various robotic surgeries. Recently, comparative retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this particular type of surgery. Although individual studies vary, robot-assisted gynecologic surgery is often associated with longer operating room time but generally similar clinical outcomes, decreased blood loss, and shorter hospital stay. Robot-assisted gynecologic surgery will likely continue to develop as more gynecologic surgeons are trained and more patients seek minimally invasive surgical options. Well-designed, prospective studies with well-defined clinical, long-term outcomes, including complications, cost, pain, return to normal activity, and quality of life, are needed to fully assess the value of this new technology. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has several applications in gynecologic surgery, including simple and radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissection, tubal reanastomosis, myomectomy, and sacrocolpopexy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0b013e31818f3c17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054088885", "source": "openalex"}

Given the documented shortage of abortion providers, assessing and ensuring the availability of abortion training in graduate medical education is critical.In 1998, the National Abortion Federation surveyed the 261 accredited U.S. residency programs in obstetrics and gynecology, and analyzed the availability of first- and second-trimester abortion training.Of the 179 programs that responded to the survey, 81% reported that they offer first-trimester abortion training--46% routinely and 34% as an elective. Seventy-four percent of programs offer second-trimester training--44% routinely and 29% as an elective. Some programs that do not offer training give residents the option of obtaining it elsewhere. While 26% of programs indicated that all residents in their programs receive abortion training, 40% said that fewer than half are trained, including 14% that train no residents. The operating room is the most common training site: Fifty-nine percent of programs reported that abortion training takes place in the operating room.After a decades-long decline in the availability of abortion training, opportunities for abortion training have increased.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2021456087", "title": "Evidence-Based Strategies for Implementing Guidelines in Obstetrics", "text": "In Brief OBJECTIVE: To estimate effective strategies for implementing clinical practice guidelines in obstetric care and to identify specific barriers to behavior change and facilitators in obstetrics. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were consulted from January 1990 to June 2005. Additional studies were identified by screening reference lists from identified studies and experts' suggestions. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies of clinical practice guidelines implementation strategies in obstetric care and reviews of such studies were selected. Randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies were evaluated according to Effective Practice and Organization of Care criteria standards. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Studies were reviewed by two investigators to assess the quality and the efficacy of each strategy. Discordances between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus. In obstetrics, educational strategies with medical providers are generally ineffective; educational strategies with paramedical providers, opinion leaders, qualitative improvement, and academic detailing have mixed effects; audit and feedback, reminders, and multifaceted strategies are generally effective. These findings differ from data on the efficacy of clinical practice guidelines implementation strategies in other medical specialties. Specific barriers to behavior change in obstetrics and methods to overcome these barriers could explain these differences. The proportion of effective strategies is significantly higher among the interventions that include a prospective identification of barriers to change compared with standardized interventions. CONCLUSION: Prospective identification of efficient strategies and barriers to change is necessary to achieve a better adaptation of intervention and to improve clinical practice guidelines implementation. In the field of obstetric care, multifaceted strategy based on audit and feedback and facilitated by local opinion leaders is recommended to effectively change behaviors. In obstetrics, multifaceted strategy based on audit and feedback is effective in changing behavior.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000236434.74160.8b", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2021456087", "source": "openalex"}

The predictive accuracy of the two staging systems was compared using concordance estimation.Two hundred nineteen patients had sufficient clinical and pathologic information to be staged under both systems; 132 patients were upstaged using the AJCC staging system, whereas only four were downstaged. Stage-specific PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III differed substantially between the two staging systems. In both systems, there was prognostic overlap between stages II and III. Thus, despite the marked stage-specific differences in 5-year PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III, both systems had similar concordance indices.Estimates of stage-specific PFS and OS for uterine LMS were altered substantially when using the AJCC versus FIGO staging system. Adjuvant treatment strategies should be tested in patients at substantial risk for disease progression and death. Neither the FIGO nor AJCC staging system is ideal for identifying such patients, suggesting a need for a uterine LMS-specific staging system to better target patients for trials of adjuvant therapies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2008.19.8366", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170281817", "source": "openalex"}

The use of POCUS enables the clinician to perform the ultrasound scan either at the medical office or the patient’s bedside and used as an extension of the physical examination. Real-time images can immediately be correlated with the patient’s symptoms, and any changes in a (critical) patient’s condition can be more rapidly detected. POCUS in OBGYN POCUS is also suitable for time-critical scenarios, and depending on the situation and its dynamics, the course and results of any therapy may be observed in real time. POCUS should be considered to be a routine extension of practice for most OB/GYN clinicians as it can give immediate answers to what could be life-threatening situations for the mother and/or baby. With its proven usefulness, the applications and use of POCUS should be incorporated in teaching programs for medical students, OBGYN residents and emergency physicians.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-021-05972-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127327146", "source": "openalex"}

Work hour limits for residents in obstetrics and gynecology and decreased patient availability for teaching of students and residents require us to think creatively and practically on how to optimize their education. Medical simulations may address scenarios in clinical practice that are considered important to know or understand. Simulations can take many forms, including computer programs, models or mannequins, virtual reality data immersion caves, and a combination of formats. The purpose of this commentary is to call attention to a potential role for medical simulation in obstetrics and gynecology. We briefly describe an example of how simulation may be incorporated into obstetric and gynecologic residency training. It is our contention that educators in obstetrics and gynecology should be aware of the potential for simulation in education. We hope this commentary will stimulate interest in the field, lead to validation studies, and improve training in and the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Simulations in obstetrics and gynecology may improve education, training, and evaluation and ensure competency.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006250-200308000-00030", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4235533678", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: One hundred thirty-six ultrasound program directors from 254 accredited obstetrics and gynecology residency programs completed a web-based survey regarding obstetric ultrasound training for residents. Questions were presented in yes-or-no, ranking, short-answer, and open-comment formats that examined general teaching environment and curriculum content. These results were compared with a mandatory fetal ultrasound training survey that was independently administered to 4,666 obstetrics and gynecology residents during the 2003 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) In-Training Examination. Friedman one-way analysis of variance was used to compare ranked nonparametric data with the Dunn posttest. Statistical significance was taken at the P < .05 level. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of accredited obstetrics and gynecology residencies responded to the survey of ultrasound directors from November 2000 to April 2003. Nearly all responding directors were obstetrician-gynecologists, many of whom had subspecialty training in maternal-fetal medicine. Full-time faculty and sonographers were the most important individuals contributing to ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residents. Hands-on scanning and observation were the most significant educational activities for ultrasound training. Ultrasound program directors generally rated the overall preparedness of residents as ranging from adequate to excellent. The most important learning obstacles were limited curriculum and faculty time. Most programs evaluated competency by direct observation of scanning skills. According to the CREOG survey, only 16.3% of residents indicated that the performance and interpretation of fetal ultrasound examinations were mandatory program requirements. Nearly two thirds of residents believed that their training would be adequate by the time of graduation. Only 18.4% of residents, however, were planning to perform or interpret fetal ultrasound scans in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Fetal ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residents is perceived by most ultrasound program directors and residents to be adequate. Future development of standardized guidelines and competency assessment tools should consider that approximately one fifth of obstetrics and gynecology residents are currently planning to use this diagnostic modality in clinical practice. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2 Fetal ultrasound training for obstetrics and gynecology residencies is perceived as being adequate, although limited curriculum and faculty time are potential obstacles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000109522.51314.5c", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2069394172", "source": "openalex"}

Utilizing Cox proportional hazards modeling and relative survival rates analysis of 17,119 cases of cervical cancer indicated that the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histology, histological grade, lymph node status, and age at diagnosis were all independently prognostic. No evidence was found of survival differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Younger women were not found to have a poorer prognosis, survival declined with increased age. Analysis of 41,120 cases of endometrial cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, lymph node status, age at diagnostic, and race were all prognostic factors. Clear cell adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and mixed mullerian tumors were all found to have poorer prognosis. Analysis of 21,240 cases of ovarian cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, lymph node status, age at diagnosis, presence of ascites, and race were all prognostically significant. Analysis of 2,575 cases of vulvar cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, age, and race were all prognostically significant. Analysis of 916 cases of vaginal cancer indicated that FIGO stage, histologic grade, lymph node status, and age are all prognostically significant. Additional analysis of the data by combinations of independent prognostic factors indicates that the interaction of factors may be more predictive of outcome than any one factor separately. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1953222123", "title": "<scp>WHO</scp> Statement on Caesarean Section Rates", "text": "In 1985 when a group of experts convened by the World Health Organization in Fortaleza, Brazil, met to discuss the appropriate technology for birth, they echoed what at that moment was considered an unjustified and remarkable increase of caesarean section (CS) rates worldwide.1 Based on the evidence available at that time, the experts in Fortaleza concluded: 'there is no justification for any region to have a caesarean section rate higher than 10–15%'.1 Over the years, this quote has become ubiquitous in scientific literature, being interpreted as the ideal CS rate. Although this reference range was intended for 'populations', which are defined by geopolitical boundaries, in many instances it has been mistakenly used as the measurement for healthcare facilities regardless of their complexity or other characteristics. In addition to the case mix of the obstetric population served, the use of CS at healthcare facilities is also affected by factors such as their capacity to handle cases, availability of resource and the clinical management protocols used locally. Since its publication and for the last 30 years, this reference rate for CS has received intense criticism and has led to controversy, concern, polarised opinions and heated debates, while in parallel, the use of CS as a mode of delivery has continued its worrying rise worldwide. The need to revisit the recommended CS rate has been considered more and more necessary in view of the significant improvements in clinical obstetric care and in the methodology to assess evidence and issue recommendations in the last three decades. The global concern around CS rates is understandable. When medically justified, a CS can prevent maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. There is no evidence, however, showing the benefits of the procedure for women or infants where it is not required. CS is associated with short- and long-term risk, which can extend beyond the current delivery and affect future pregnancies. In addition, the increase in CS rates seems uncontrollable, with no signs that it is slowing down. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the causes of the rise are not fully understood but emerge as a complex multifactorial labyrinth involving health systems, health care providers, women, societies, and even fashion and media.2-6 Lastly, non-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary CS have shown limited effectiveness to date.7 In light of these issues, WHO convened a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on 8–9 October 2014 with the objective of (1) establishing the current WHO position on the CS rate or range for optimal maternal and perinatal outcomes at population level, and (2) agreeing on a proposal for a tool to monitor CS rates at facility level. The Statement on Caesarean Section Rates recently released by WHO summarises the results of the systematic reviews and analyses conducted for this purpose and conveys the thinking emerging from the discussions of the meeting.8 A systematic review and an ecological analysis were performed and concluded that at population level, CS rates higher than 10% were not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.9, 10 The Statement notes, however, that the association between CS rates and other relevant outcomes such as stillbirths, maternal and perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes and psychological or social well-being could not be determined due to the lack of data on these other outcomes at the population level. This lack of data represents a limitation of these analyses that needs to be borne in mind. Beyond numbers and rates, the Statement emphasises that the critical role played by the quality of care in this equation cannot be overstated. As with any surgery, CS is associated with short- and long-term risks, particularly in settings that lack the facilities or capacity to conduct safe surgery or treat surgical complications properly, or where access to labour care or repeat CS in subsequent pregnancies cannot be taken for granted. On the other hand, inadequate access to timely CS may result in perinatal asphyxia, stillbirth, uterine rupture or obstetric fistula, a marker for exceptionally prolonged, obstructed labour.11 Thus, CS should be undertaken when medically necessary, and rather than striving to achieve a specific rate, efforts should focus on providing caesarean section to all women in need. How to define the woman 'in need' can only be ascertained by the health care providers caring for the woman on a case-by-case basis. Most importantly, at the healthcare facility level, clinicians and administrators struggle to monitor CS rates in a meaningful, reliable and action-oriented manner. Historically, caesarean sections have often been categorised using its indications as the unit being classified. Using indications to classify CS has always been problematic due to the lack of uniform definitions for most common indications and has resulted in poor reproducibility and unsatisfactory comparisons.12 In 2001, Dr Michael Robson proposed a system of 10 groups that classifies all women admitted for delivery (and not indications) according to five obstetric characteristics that are generally routinely collected in most maternities.13 Two systematic reviews conducted at WHO identified this classification as the most appropriate system to fulfil current international and local needs.12, 14 The WHO Statement proposes the use of the Robson classification as the global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing CS rates within healthcare facilities over time, and between facilities. In the last decade, this classification has witnessed an extraordinary expansion in its use worldwide, particularly in healthcare facilities, due to its intrinsic appealing characteristics: simplicity of design, validity of purpose, ease of implementation and directness of initial interpretation.14 WHO envisions that the information stemming from the classification can be a powerful tool to inform practice. The classification will allow not only for stratification of CS rates in more uniform groups of women but also the assessment of CS rates in relation to other perinatal outcomes and processes (e.g. rates of oxytocin usage, postpartum haemorrhage, newborn outcomes, length of labour). WHO will guide and support countries in the use, implementation and interpretation of the classification so that we can start comparing CS rates in a meaningful, targeted, transparent and useful manner. By endorsing the Robson classification, this Statement should become a catalyst for action. The time has come to put the debate about the preferable rate of CS on hold. Let's start to collect data uniformly so that in the near future we will be able to move our focus from CS rates at population level to monitoring and discussing CS rates and outcomes in each group of the Robson classification. Only then will we have the data and evidence that will lead us more clearly to actions to improve care.15 Ultimately, we hope the debate can recommence with more valuable, solid and informative data to support our discussions.
