These pathways are called longevity pathways and they have relevance for many age-related diseases. In the eye, longevity pathways are involved in the major blinding diseases, cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. Pharmaceutical targeting of longevity pathways can extend healthy lifespan in laboratory model systems. This offers the possibility of therapeutic interventions to also delay onset or slow the progression of age-related eye diseases. I suggest that retinal degeneration may be viewed as accelerated aging of photoreceptors and that interventions extending healthy lifespan may also slow the pace of photoreceptor loss.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26427437/"}
{"id": "39463170", "title": "Caffeine and Vision: Effects on the Eye.", "text": "Caffeine, commonly found in coffee and tea, affects various aspects of eye health as it blocks adenosine receptors, impacting tear production, intraocular pressure, macular perfusion, and choroidal thickness. However, its connection with eye conditions like glaucoma and cataracts remains uncertain due to conflicting research findings. Some studies suggest potential benefits for cataracts, while others warn against frequent caffeine intake in glaucoma and surgical scenarios due to possible increases in intraocular pressure. Conflicting evidence also exists regarding its effects on dry eye, macular degeneration, myopia/hyperopia, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and central serous retinopathy. Caffeine does not seem to be a risk factor for dry eye, although studies have shown that caffeine may offer protection against wet age-related macular degeneration, and the metabolite 7-methylxanthine could be a more promising treatment for myopia. Moreover, caffeine can potentially cause tremors and might hinder surgical performance, especially in less experienced surgeons. Recommendations from experts vary, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand how caffeine affects the eye. Individuals genetically predisposed to glaucoma should be cautious due to the possibility of clinically significant elevations in intraocular pressure with caffeine consumption. For delicate procedures like microsurgery, where tremors can be detrimental, caution should be exercised with caffeine. This review underscores the importance of additional studies to provide clearer insights and prudent recommendations regarding caffeine's impact on eye health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39463170/"}

As a result of continual medical specialization, technological progress in genetics and knowledge garnered by over a century and a half of cataloguing eye pathology, ophthalmic genetics has become an emerging subspecialty within ophthalmology.

It is estimated that over 2 billion people suffer from vision loss with common causative factors such as; age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and infections amongst others. The use of Orthodox procedures has only helped mitigate the pathology; however, it doesn't serve any substantial curative purpose. More recently, the incorporation of new therapies via ocular delivery of nanomaterials and stem cell intervention has helped to change tides in the treatment of various ophthalmic pathologies. This review provides an overview of the current trends and breakthroughs in ophthalmology via stem cell therapy, with emphasis on its types, mechanisms, applications, and benefits. Mesenchymal stem cells which can arise from embryonic or adult origin possess some immunomodulatory effects that contribute to the therapeutic relevance of the MSCs and the ability to evade rejection from the host. However, the major drawback has been uncontrolled growth which can result in unintended side effects. Moreso, religious and ethical issues concerning the employment of MSCs from embryonic origin have also hindered clinical progression with its use. The use of stem cell therapy in the treatment of eye pathologies which is still undergoing clinical trials has shown to be a more viable treatment approach in ophthalmology as it targets retinal degenerative diseases thereby offering novel pathways for vision restoration. And also serves as a revolutionary alternative for treating severe ocular diseases. Stem cell delivery techniques might be quite cumbersome as the eye is a very delicate organ. The therapeutic interventional technique employed is aimed to ensure the reduction or absence of undesired effects in the deposition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) being the stem cells. Techniques such as hydrogel-based injectables, which offer delivery of the APIs to the desired site of action without change in the physicochemical properties of the drug molecule, the scaffold delivery techniques, and the use of 3D bio-printing which can be used to develop scaffolds for retinal degeneration. The employment of artificial intelligence and machine learning in stem cell therapy has shown to be very fast and efficient in stem cell delivery and preventing likely human errors. Unlike conventional treatments that often focus on managing symptoms, stem cells have the unique ability to repair and regenerate damaged tissues, addressing the root causes of the diseases. However, limitations due to economic, regulatory, and ethical challenges have posed barriers to advancing stem cell therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120030/"}

Practical methods to define genotypes will be increasingly important and non-invasive nanotechnologies are needed to detect molecular changes that predate histopathology. This is not a review nor meant to be comprehensive. Specific topics have been selected to illustrate the principles of important paradigm shifts that will influence the future of ophthalmic diagnostics. It is our impression that future evaluation of vision will go beyond visual acuity to assess ocular health in terms of psychophysical function. The definition of disease will incorporate genotype into what has historically been a phenotype-centric discipline. Non-invasive nanotechnologies will enable a paradigm shift from disease detection on a cellular level to a sub-cellular molecular level. Vision can be evaluated beyond visual acuity by measuring contrast sensitivity, color vision, and macular function, as these provide better insights into the impact of aging and disease. Distortions can be quantified and the psychophysical basis of vision can be better evaluated than in the past by designing tests that assess particular macular cell function(s). Advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of eye diseases will enable better characterization of ocular health and disease. Non-invasive nanotechnologies can assess molecular changes in the lens, vitreous, and macula that predate visible pathology. Oxygen metabolism and circulatory physiology are measurable indices of ocular health that can detect variations of physiology and early disease. This overview of paradigm shifts in ophthalmology suggests that the future will see significant improvements in ophthalmic diagnostics. The selected topics illustrate the principles of these paradigm shifts and should serve as a guide to further research and development. Indeed, successful implementation of these paradigm shifts in ophthalmology may provide useful guidance for similar developments in all of healthcare.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28008209/"}

Ophthalmology cannot explain art, but vision is a tool for artists and its normal and abnormal characteristics may influence what an artist can do. The retina codes for contrast, and the impact of this is evident throughout art history from Asian brush painting, to Renaissance chiaroscuro, to Op Art. Art exists, and can portray day or night, only because of the way retina adjusts to light. Color processing is complex, but artists have exploited it to create shimmer (Seurat, Op Art), or to disconnect color from form (fauvists, expressionists, Andy Warhol). It is hazardous to diagnose eye disease from an artist's work, because artists have license to create as they wish. El Greco was not astigmatic; Monet was not myopic; Turner did not have cataracts. But when eye disease is documented, the effects can be analyzed. Color-blind artists limit their palette to ambers and blues, and avoid greens. Dense brown cataracts destroy color distinctions, and Monet's late canvases (before surgery) showed strange and intense uses of color. Degas had failing vision for 40 years, and his pastels grew coarser and coarser. He may have continued working because his blurred vision smoothed over the rough work. This paper can barely touch upon the complexity of either vision or art. However, it demonstrates some ways in which understanding vision and eye disease give insight into art, and thereby an appreciation of both art and ophthalmology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26563659/"}

It was not until the 1800s, however, that specific connections between the hypothalamus and the vision system were discovered. With a fuller elaboration of the autonomic nervous system in the early to mid 1900s, many more pathways were discovered. The more recently discovered retinohypothalamic tracts show the extent and influence of light stimulation on hypothalamic function and bodily processes. The hypothalamus maintains its myriad connections via neural pathways, such as with the pituitary and pineal glands; the chemical messengers of the peptides, cytokines, and neurotransmitters; and the nitric oxide mechanism. As a result of these connections, the hypothalamus has involvement in many degenerative diseases. A complete feedback mechanism between the eye and hypothalamus is established by the retinohypothalamic tracts and the ciliary nerves innervating the anterior pole of the eye and the retina. A discussion of hypothalamic-related vision disorders includes neurologic syndromes, the lacrimal system, the retina, and ocular inflammation. Tables and figures have been used to aid in the explanation of the many connections and chemicals controlled by the hypothalamus. The understanding of the functions of the hypothalamus will allow the clinician to gain better insight into the many pathologies associated between the vision system and the hypothalamus.

Defects in these functional modules are responsible for a rapidly growing list of human diseases collectively termed ciliopathies. Ocular pathogenesis is common in virtually all classes of syndromic ciliopathies, and disruptions in cilia genes have been found to be causative in a growing number of non-syndromic retinal dystrophies. This review will address what is currently known about cilia contribution to visual function. We will focus on the molecular and cellular functions of ciliary proteins and their role in the photoreceptor sensory cilia and their visual phenotypes. We also highlight other ciliated cell types in tissues of the eye (e.g. lens, RPE and M√ºller glia cells) discussing their possible contribution to disease progression. Progress in basic research on the cilia function in the eye is paving the way for therapeutic options for retinal ciliopathies. In the final section we describe the latest advancements in gene therapy, read-through of non-sense mutations and stem cell therapy, all being adopted to treat cilia dysfunction in the retina.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504201/"}

Mathematical and computational techniques can provide complementary insight into this inherently complex and nonlinear system. They allow us to characterise and predict the behaviour of the retina, as well as to test hypotheses which are experimentally intractable. In this review, we survey some of the key theoretical models of the retina in the healthy, developmental and diseased states. The main insights derived from each of these modelling studies are highlighted, as are model predictions which have yet to be tested, and data which need to be gathered to inform future modelling work. Possible directions for future research are also discussed. Whilst the present modelling studies have achieved great success in unravelling the workings of the retina, they have yet to achieve their full potential. For this to happen, greater involvement with the modelling community is required, and stronger collaborations forged between experimentalists, clinicians and theoreticians. It is hoped that, in addition to bringing the fruits of current modelling studies to the attention of the ophthalmological community, this review will encourage many such future collaborations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27063291/"}

Humans and animals cannot synthesize carotenoids de novo and must obtain them solely through dietary sources. Among the more than 750 carotenoids in nature, only lutein, zeaxanthin, meso-zeaxanthin, and their oxidative metabolites selectively accumulate in the foveal region of the retina where they are collectively referred to as the macular pigment (MP) of the macula lutea. MP serves an ocular protective role through its ability to filter phototoxic blue light radiation and also via its antioxidant activity. These properties have led to the hypothesis that carotenoids may protect against the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in the aged population >60 years old. Epidemiological studies have supported this by showing that patients with lower concentrations of serum carotenoids and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurements are at a higher risk of developing AMD. Conversely, nutritional supplementation and diets rich in lutein and zeaxanthin readily impact MP concentrations and reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD, and the AREDS2 supplement formulation containing 10‚Äâmg of lutein and 2‚Äâmg of zeaxanthin is the standard-of-care recommendation for individuals at risk for visual loss from advanced AMD.

Prevailing ocular prostheses are acrylic shells with a static eye image rendered on the convex surface. A limited range of ocular prosthetic movement and lack of natural saccadic movements commonly causes the appearance of eye misalignment that may be disfiguring. Digital screens and computational systems may obviate current limitations in eye prosthetic motility and help prosthetic wearers feel less self-conscious about their appearance. We applied convoluted neural networks (CNNs) to track pupil location in various conditions. These algorithms were coupled to a microscreen digital prosthetic eye (DPE) prototype to assess the ability of the system to capture full ocular ductions and saccadic movements in a miniaturized, portable, and wearable system. The CNNs captured pupil location with high accuracy. Pupil location data were transmitted to a miniature screen ocular prosthetic prototype that displayed a dynamic contralateral eye image. The transmission achieved a full range of ocular ductions and with grossly undetectable latency. Lack of iris and sclera color and detail, as well as constraints in luminosity, dimensionality and image stability limited the real eye appearance. Yet, the digitally rendered eye moved in the same amplitude and velocity as the native, tracked eye. Real-time image processing using CNNs coupled to microcameras and a miniscreen DPE may offer improvements in amplitude and velocity of apparent prosthetic eye movement. These developments, along with ocular image precision, may offer a next-generation eye prosthesis.

The common eye diseases were cataract (44.7¬†%), dry eye (15.5¬†%), and glaucoma (8.7¬†%). Among the participants, 61.0¬†% sought ophthalmic care under the IDS in the past year and 17.6¬†% experienced unmet ophthalmic needs in the past 6¬†months. Satisfaction with ophthalmic care under the IDS was 88.1¬†%. Determinants of dissatisfaction under the IDS were distance to healthcare facility and VRQoL. Predictors of VRQoL included age, residential area, marital status, occupation, comorbid condition, commercial insurance, household income, cataracts and glaucoma. The implementation of IDS improves accessibility of ophthalmic care for residents of an offshore island. Geographic proximity to avail healthcare facility and VRQoL affect satisfaction with the IDS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27412399/"}

Different methods for evaluating quality of life are available. A well-known questionnaire for measuring global quality of life is the Short Form 36 (SF 36). However, in ophthalmology more specific instruments for measuring visual quality of life are needed. We review the usefulness of specific questionnaires such as the Visual Function 14 (VF-14) or the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) in their application to common ophthalmologic diseases such as cataract, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Studies applying these methods were identified by a search in the Medline database. Several instruments to measure visual life quality in ophthalmologic patients are available. Internal consistency and validity are shown. Evaluating visual quality of life is an important parameter for assessing ophthalmologic diseases and the value of different therapies. It is an important outcome variable in clinical studies. Furthermore, individual visual quality of life should be considered in individual therapeutic decisions and helps to assess the economic effect of current and new therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14704825/"}

Similar to death, darkness drops on human beings in deep sleep and they enter a space inhabited by shadows. Dreams were believed to reveal an unknown world, to give the sleeper a glimpse into the future. Vision attracts distant objects and their light, on the other hand, can hurt the eyes like a burning flame. Eyes were the most important organ in Egyptian thought, as they allowed perception of the real world. Their importance has been immortalised in the myth of the Eye of Horus that explains the role of either eye. One represents the moonlight, which disperses the darkness of the night, and the other represents the sunshine, which creates life, and both could also represents the power of human intellect. Blindness, in turn, congenital or disease-related, was considered a divine punishment. A man, thus handicapped, would sink in a state of uncertainty and darkness. To protect the eyes from blindness, people used drops and ointments, which were believed to chase away all kinds of insects and demons that threatened with a variety of eye infections. Egyptian eye doctors or physicians, carried a special kit that contained green chrysocolla and a black kohl makeup, highly appreciated as prophylaxis because they personified Osiris' humours or body fluids. These products were offered to Gods to restore the brightness of divine glance and incite sun and moon to spread their beneficial light.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21192112/"}

The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of anterior segment pathology in the setting of the ED in hopes that this information will be useful in creating more effective management algorithms. A retrospective study based on electronic patient charts from the University of California Davis ED that included ophthalmology consults. We reviewed the charts for demographic data, as well as visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and diagnosis as determined by ED and ophthalmology personnel, respectively. The most common anterior segment diagnoses were uveitis, corneal abrasion, corneal ulcer, meibomian gland dysfunction/dry eyes/blepharitis/punctate epithelial erosions, and conjunctivitis/epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Emergency Department personnel measured the VA and IOP in 40.8% and 16.7% of patients, respectively. The ophthalmologist measured the VA and IOP in 78.4% and 95.1% of patients, respectively. The percentage agreement in VA measurement between ophthalmology and ED was 11.8%. The percentage agreement in IOP measurement between ophthalmology and ED was 0.86%. The percentage agreement in diagnosis between ophthalmology and ED was 49.4%. Most ocular conditions that present in the ED are nonurgent and can be treated in an outpatient setting. However, ED personnel are often unable to obtain the proper \"ocular vital signs\" (the VA and IOP) and diagnoses.

Building on our previous analysis of current progress towards key HReH indicators and cataract surgery rates (CSRs), we predicted future indicator achievement among 16 countries of sub-Saharan Africa by 2020. Surgical and HReH data were collected from national eye care programme coordinators on six practitioner cadres: ophthalmologists, cataract surgeons, ophthalmic clinical officers, ophthalmic nurses, optometrists and 'mid-level refractionists' and combined them with publicly available population data to calculate practitioner-to-population ratios and CSRs. Data on workforce entry and exit (2008 to 2010) was used to project practitioner population and CSR growth between 2011 and 2020 in relation to projected growth in the general population. Associations between indicator progress and the presence of a non-physician cataract surgeon cadre were also explored using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Spearman rank correlations. In our 16-country sample, practitioner per million population ratios are predicted to increase slightly for surgeons (ophthalmologists/cataract surgeons, from 3.1 in 2011 to 3.4 in 2020) and ophthalmic nurses/clinical officers (5.8 to 6.8) but remain low for refractionists (including optometrists, at 3.6 in 2011 and 2020). Among countries that have not already achieved target indicators, however, practitioner growth will be insufficient for any additional countries to reach the surgeon and refractionist targets by year 2020. Without further strategy change and investment, even after 2020, surgeon growth is only expected to sufficiently outpace general population growth to reach the target in one country. For nurses, two additional countries will achieve the target while one will fall below it. In 2011, high surgeon practitioner ratios were associated with high CSR, regardless of the type of surgeon employed. The cataract surgeon workforce is growing proportionately faster than the ophthalmologist. The HReH workforce is not growing fast enough to achieve global eye health targets in most of the sub-Saharan countries we surveyed by 2020. Countries seeking to make rapid progress to improve CSR could prioritise investment in training new cataract surgeons over ophthalmologists and improving surgical output efficiency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25128287/"}

Al Haitam is born in city Basra and immigrated to Egypt during reign of Caliph Al Hakim. He is quoted as excellent astronomer, mathematician and doctor as well as one of the best commentators of the Galen and Aristotle's work. He is the first medical scholar who teaches that light \"does not originates from the eye but on opposite enters the eye\", and in that manner corrects the wrong opinion of the Greeks about the nature of vision. According to this scholar retina is the center of vision and the impressions that it receives are transferred to the brain by the optical nerve, in order that brain afterwards create visual image in the symmetrical relationship for both retinas. Al-Haitam was the most important researcher of optics in Islam. He was convinced that the adequate theory of vision must combine Euclid and Ptolemy \"mathematical\" approach and \"physical doctrine of the naturalists. The result of his reflections in the paper \"Optics\", supported by the experimental approach, is the new theory of vision, much richer and perfected than any before. He thought that light and color, two physical features that exist independently from the observed subject, in strait lines originates from the each point of visible object. Al Haitam concludes that what we perceive is actually the object which is on a certain distance from the eye and which have certain shape and size, and vision itself is the result of intervention by the visual material received by the brain and stored information's from previous experiences. Reception hypothesis (intromission) Al-Haitam exposed to mathematical testing, and then incorporated into already developed perception theory, which is still not completely explored by historians. In his experiments he used \"dark chambers\", trying to confirm the features of light, such as expansion in straight lines, reflexion and refraction of the light beams. Basic stand point which he supported was that the vision is the result of impression which light leaves on the sight sense, he supported it based on the experience that the eye \"retains an image\" or has pain when looking into bright light.

Participants completed a detailed questionnaire and underwent a comprehensive eye assessment including stereo disc and retinal photography, ocular coherence topography and conjunctival autofluorescence assessment. Additionally, blood or saliva was taken for DNA testing. 781 participants aged over 15 years were seen (54% female), comprising 61% of the permanent Island population. 343 people (43.9%) could trace their family history to the Pitcairn Islanders (Norfolk Island Pitcairn Pedigree). Mean anterior chamber depth was 3.32mm, mean axial length (AL) was 23.5mm, and mean central corneal thickness was 546 microns. There were no statistically significant differences in these characteristics between persons with and without Pitcairn Island ancestry. Mean intra-ocular pressure was lower in people with Pitcairn Island ancestry: 15.89mmHg compared to those without Pitcairn Island ancestry 16.49mmHg (P = .007). The mean keratometry value was lower in people with Pitcairn Island ancestry (43.22 vs. 43.52, P = .007). The corneas were flatter in people of Pitcairn ancestry but there was no corresponding difference in AL or refraction. Our study population is highly representative of the permanent population of Norfolk Island. Ocular biometry was similar to that of other white populations. Heritability estimates, linkage analysis and genome-wide studies will further elucidate the genetic determinants of chronic ocular diseases in this genetic isolate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21314255/"}

These limitations have been substantially reduced in recent years, opening up a wider range of contexts where experimental control is possible. Given this, it is important to examine just what the benefits are for exploring natural vision, with its attendant disadvantages. Work over the last two decades provides insights into these benefits. Natural behavior turns out to be a rich domain for investigation, as it is remarkably stable and opens up new questions, and the behavioral context helps specify the momentary visual computations and their temporal evolution.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29710300/"}

Forty-six children ages 1 month to 1 1/2 years with either assumed normal vision, visual impairment due to eye disease, or strabismus were examined with the following tests: Stycar rolling balls; preferential looking (Teller acuity cards); and the ability to detect raisins, puffed rice, and sugar strands on two different backgrounds, one white and one black. Children with visual impairment and strabismus often showed normal values for their age, and children with assumed normal vision sometimes had values below those established for normal development of vision with the Stycar rolling balls and the Teller acuity cards. It is not possible to use these tests to reliably differentiate among normal vision, visual impairment, or strabismus in children younger than 1 1/2.

The visual acuity with the Fresnel membrane prism is significantly less than that with the conventional prism of the same power for all prism powers from 12 delta through 30 delata at distance and from 15 delta through 30 delta at near. 2. The difference in the visual acuity between base up and base down, and between base in and base out, is not significantly different for either the Fresnel membrane prism or for the conventional prism. 3. For both Fresnel membrane prism and the conventional prism, the visual acuity when looking straight ahead. 4. Using Fresnel membrane prisms of the same power from different lots, the visual acuity varied significantly. The 30 delta prism caused the widest range in visual acuity. 5. When normal subjects are fitted with the higher powers of the Fresnel membrane prism, fusion and stereopsis are disrupted to such an extent that the use of this device to restore or to improve binocular vision in cases with large-angle deviations is seriously questioned. 6. Moreover, the disruption of fusion and stereopsis is abrupt and severe and does not parallel the decrease in visual acuity. The severely reduced ability to maintain fusion may be related to the optical aberrations, which, in turn, may be due to the molding process and the polyvinyl chloride molding material. 7. Through the flexibility of the membrane prism is a definite advantage, because of its proclivity to reduce visual acuity and increase aberrations its prescription for adults often must be limited to only one eye. 8. For the same reasons in the young child with binocular vision problems, the membrane prism presently available should be prescribed over both eyes only in powers less than 20 delta. When the membrane prism is to be used as a partial occluder (over one eye only), any power can be used. 9. The new Fresnel \"hard\" prism reduces visual acuity minimally and rarely disrupts binocularity, thus increasing the potential for prismotherapy to establish binocularity. This prism is currently available only for use as a trial set. Since the cosmetic appearance of the Fresnel \"hard\" prism is similar to that of the Fresnel membrane prism and it is easier to maintain, it would be the prism of choice (over all other types) for bilateral prescriptions in the young patient with emmetropia. The manufacturer is urged to make these prisms available to fit a special round adjustable frame, such as that developed in Europe for use with the wafer prism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/754384/"}

Keratometric measurements and two videokeratographs were gathered prospectively on 262 normal and abnormal corneas. The best-fit measurements of spherical power, astigmatism, and topographic irregularity were reproducible with one standard deviation of 0.75 diopter or better; agreement with keratometric measurements in normal eyes was good (0.60 diopter or better).

Visual information, spatially or temporally distinct, is transmitted to various regions of the brain. This paper presents clinical and anatomical evidence for parallel processing in the human visual system. The neuro-ophthalmologist often has psychophysical evidence for the separation of visual functions. Our own investigations have demonstrated that brightness sense and other visual functions may be impaired out of proportion to visual acuity in diseases of the optic nerve. Classes of retinal ganglion cells have been morphologically and physiologically described in several experimental animals. No such classification of retinal ganglion cell types has been made in man. However, psychophysical and retinal electrophysiological human studies suggest the segregation of human retinal ganglion cells into classes which subserve different functions. A new staining method (PPD) has made it possible to directly study the visual pathways in man. With this method, we have documented several previously undescribed human visual pathways to different brain visual nuclei: the lateral geniculate nucleus, the pretectum, the superior colliculus, the pulvinar, and three nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN, PVN, SON). We have also developed a method which permits the accurate and rapid measurement of human retinal ganglion cell axon diameters through the optic nerve and through the fascicles of optic fibers entering several of these recently described visual nuclei.

The experiment, as described by Leonardo, was repeated in our laboratory. The study further discusses Leonardo's primary interest in the study of the eye (especially the lens), to determine how the image of an object which enters the eye in an inverted form is righted. The study shows the evolution of Leonardo's understanding of the anatomy and the physiology of vision. Initially, in keeping with his reading of the literature, the lens was placed in the centre but he made it globular. Later he promulgated two theories, reflection from the uvea and refraction within the lens to explain reversal of the image in the eye. Subsequently he rejected the first theory and, putting credence in the second theory, experimented (1509) to show that the lens is globular and is centrally placed. The fact that the present knowledge about the lens is at variance from his findings is not because he did not carry out the experiment, as suggested by some modern authors, but because of the limitation of the techniques available to him at the time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15386876/"}

Vigabatrin is an extremely effective antiepileptic drug that selectively increases brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several patients recently developed constricted visual fields during vigabatrin treatment in the United Kingdom, indicating the possibility of GABA-associated retinal dysfunction. Patients with visual symptoms treated chronically with vigabatrin at our center underwent visual evoked potentials (VEP), electroretinograms (ERG), and visual field and ophthalmologic examinations. Four of 38 patients treated with vigabatrin developed visual symptoms 2 to 40 months after starting the drug. Two patients complained of constricted visual fields and two had blurred vision. ERG demonstrated evidence of bilateral retinal dysfunction consistent with reduced inner retinal cone response in all four patients. Oscillatory potential responses were lost, suggesting impairment of the highly GABAergic amacrine cells. Two of the patients had normal VEPs and minimal findings on clinical ophthalmology examinations despite abnormal ERGs. Abnormal examination findings were narrowed retinal arteries, surface wrinkling retinopathy, and abnormal macular reflexes. One patient also had reduced rod photoreceptor function in the more symptomatic left eye. Visual field constriction and blurring during vigabatrin therapy is associated with retinal cone system dysfunction. Visual symptoms may represent selective vulnerability of retinas of affected patients to GABAergic effects of vigabatrin. The prevalence and course of retinal changes associated with vigabatrin therapy are important to determine in a larger group of patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9521245/"}

Measured values were correlated to the anticipated magnification effects determined by computation. Measured and computed magnifications were highly correlated (r = .891). Magnification induced by refractive surgery can increase visual acuity in excess of 1 line for myopic corrections or similarly decrease visual acuity for hyperopic corrections. Magnification effects can be modeled accurately by means of computational methods. When clinical studies are designed to evaluate refractive surgery, ignoring the effects of magnification is similar to saying that visual acuity can be measured with and without the aid of a magnifier and the results directly compared.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7748125/"}

{"id": "18669099", "title": "[Colors and their meaning in culture and psychology--a historical outline and contemporary status of color vision theories].", "text": "The mechanism of color perception has intrigued scholars from antiquity. However, the understanding of this phenomena only came with the recognition of the nature of light and visual perception. Ancient concepts, present in science until the Renaissance, were based more on philosophical considerations and theoretical speculations than on anatomical studies and a matter-of-fact assessment of physiological functions of the visual system. From antiquity to 17th century scientific approach to the concept of vision was dominated by two theories: intromission and extramission (emanation). Intromission theory, propagated by Alhazen (lbn al.-Haythama), Vitello, John Peckham, Roger Bacon and Leonardo da Vinci, assumed that the light was transmitted from the observed object perpendicularly to the transparent eye structures. Johannes Kepler was the first scholar to propose that the retina was the receptive part of the eye. In the first half of the 17th century, Kepler's groundbreaking optical achievements and anatomical discoveries of many other scientists cast new light on the understanding of the role of different eye structures, finally wiping out the intromission theory. A further major achievement contributing to the recognition of the true nature of colors was a theory presented by Newton in 1688. He argued that they were colored rays, and not white light, that were composed of homogenous and pure light. It was, however, not until the 19th century when two modern theories of color appeared, i.e. a trichromatic theory mostly associated with the names of Young and Hemlholtz, and an opponent colors theory of Hering. In the 20th century, the two theories--previously assumed as contradictory--were joined into the zone theories of color vision. Colors have their cultural and social meanings, as far as a very individual and personal interpretation. In the former function they are used to illustrate some cultural and sociological phenomena; in the latter, they are helpful in psychological analyses of patients. The paper outlines major historical concepts of color perception and the present usefulness of color vision tests in psychology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18669099/"}

The technique is based on intensity measurements of the 4th Purkinje image for different wavelengths, and incorporates several features that overcome some of the difficulties associated with previous studies using this approach. LAM transmission measures for the visible spectrum can be obtained in approximately 2 s, and in most instances can be obtained without having to dilate the subject's eye. This paper describes the technique and presents our initial findings for 40 normal observers between the ages of 24 and 77 years. Results of the LAM technique show that it is able to measure the wavelength-dependent properties of the lens accurately and to identify age-related changes in \"yellowing\" of the lens. Test-retest reliability of the LAM is better than for psychophysical estimates of ocular media transmission. LAM and psychophysical measures in the same subjects were found to be correlated, although LAM measures produced consistently lower values of lens density than the psychophysical determinations. There was only moderate agreement between LAM and psychophysical measures of lens density. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed. Future research will determine whether this technique is able to detect and quantify early cataract development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8302531/"}

The historical survey on the search of the receptive part of the eye].", "text": "In the historical context, theories of vision reflected gradual recognition of human anatomy, physiology and histology, including also the development of optics. Ancient Greeks and Romans believed that the lens is the part of the eye responsible for light reception. It was followed by misconception of the central localization of the lens within the eye. This approach outlasted until the 16th century. Then, due to such scholars as Leonardo da Vinci, Felix Platter, Hieronymus Fabricius d'Aquapendente, Johannes Kepler and Christopher Schemer, the previous concepts concerning the role of the lens were gradually questioned, and finally its role was limited to light refraction and focusing the light beam to the bottom of the eye. In the 17th century appeared a controversy concerning the two membranes--retina and choroidea--and question which one of them is responsible for the reception of light. Finally, it was only at the onset of the 19th century when the true function of retina was confirmed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19195177/"}

The X-ray irradiation produced an improvement in 62% of the cases; the separate evaluation of cases with malignant course showed an improvement in nine cases. Thus the results produced by this method are as good as those of high doses, the greater possibilities in case of recurrence, however, are to be considered as an advantage.

Seventy-five ophthalmologists were recruited from three cities based on a sampling scheme stratified by surgeon-reported annual volume of cataract surgery. Seven hundred seventy-two patients undergoing first eye cataract surgery were enrolled, with complete preoperative, perioperative, and 4-month postoperative clinical data on 717 patients (93%). Sixty-five percent of surgery was performed by phacoemulsification and 35% by standard extracapsular (ECCE) techniques. Performance of ECCE was associated with the presence of ocular comorbidity and 21 or more years in practice of the surgeon. Performance of phacoemulsification was associated with annual volume of cataract surgery, wherein high-volume (201-399 patients annually) and very high-volume (> 400 patients annually) surgeons had 3.7 and 3.9 times the likelihood of performing phacoemulsification compared with moderate-volume (51-200 cases annually) surgeons. The rates of intraoperative, perioperative, and 4-month postoperative adverse events and the amount of improvement in visual acuity did not differ either by surgical technique or volume stratum. The reported occurrence of posterior capsular opacification within 4 months of surgery was increased in the presence of cortical opacification, one city, and patients operated on by either high- or very high-volume surgeons. In this cohort, no difference in clinical outcomes, as measured by change in visual acuity or occurrence of postoperative adverse events (except for posterior capsular opacification), can be attributed to performance of phacoemulsification versus ECCE or to the reported annual volume of cataract surgery of the surgeon. Self-reported high and very high annual volume of cataract surgery is associated independently with performance of phacoemulsification and surgeon's report of posterior capsular opacification at 4 months after cataract surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8008356/"}

{"id": "20443647", "title": "Ocular adverse effects of common psychotropic agents: a review.", "text": "All psychotropic medications have the potential to induce numerous and diverse unwanted ocular effects. Visual adverse effects can be divided into seven major categories: eyelid and keratoconjunctival disorders; uveal tract disorders; accommodation interference; angle-closure glaucoma; cataract/pigmentary deposits in the lens and cornea; retinopathy; and other disorders. The disorders of the eyelid and of the keratoconjunctiva are mainly related to phenothiazines and lithium. Chlorpromazine, at high dosages, can commonly cause abnormal pigmentation of the eyelids, interpalpebral conjunctiva and cornea. It can also cause a more worrisome but rarer visual impairment, namely corneal oedema. Lithium can rarely lead to a bothersome eye irritation by affecting sodium transport. Uveal tract problems are mainly associated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), typical antipsychotics, topiramate and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). TCAs, typical antipsychotics and SSRIs can all cause mydriasis that is often transient and with no major consequences, but that can promote closure of angles in susceptible patients. Topiramate has been frequently associated with a number of significant ocular symptoms including acquired myopia and angle-closure glaucoma. Problems with accommodation are related to TCAs and to low-potency antipsychotics. TCAs cause transient blurred vision in up to one-third of patients. Angle-closure glaucoma is a serious condition that has been mainly associated with TCAs, low-potency antipsychotics, topiramate and, to a lesser extent, SSRIs. When patients with narrow angles are given TCAs, they all appear to experience induction of glaucomatous attacks. Antipsychotics and SSRIs may lead to an added risk of developing angle-closure glaucoma, but only in predisposed eyes. Topiramate can lead to an allergic-type reaction whereby structures of the lens and ciliary body are displaced, which results in angle-closure glaucoma. Cataractous changes can result from antipsychotics, mainly from high dosages of chlorpromazine or thioridazine. These two drugs, when used at high dosages and for prolonged periods, frequently cause lenticular opacifications. Retinopathy has been shown to be related to high dosages of typical antipsychotics, mainly chlorpromazine and thioridazine. The frequency of occurrence of retinal effects seems to be proportional to the total amount of drug used over a long period of time. Other visual problems of special concern are the ocular dystonias, other eye movement disorders, and decreased ability to perceive colours and to discriminate contrast. Ocular dystonias can occur with antipsychotics (especially high-potency ones), carbamazepine (especially in polytherapy), topiramate and, rarely, with SSRIs. Disturbance in various eye movements is frequently seen with benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and lithium. Impairment in the perception of colours and the discrimination of contrasts has been shown to occur not uncommonly with carbamazepine and lorazepam. Thus, typical antipsychotics, TCAs, lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, topiramate and SSRIs appear to produce most of the currently recognized ocular problems. Psychiatrists, ophthalmologists and patients need to be aware of and prepared for any medication-induced adverse effect. Early prevention and intervention can avoid most of the serious and potentially irreversible ocular toxicities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20443647/"}

Ocular manifestations range from fluctuations in vision, to microstructural changes in the retina and choroid, to dry eye disease. This narrative review highlights the range of pregnancy-related effects on the eye and vision that are likely to present in the context of routine eyecare. Specifically, physiological ocular changes and pathological ocular changes that manifest for the first time, or are exacerbated, in uncomplicated pregnancy are discussed. The literature has evolved from simply noting differences in the eye between pregnant and non-pregnant groups, to refining knowledge of the proposed underlying pathophysiology with the advent of newer technologies in eyecare. A particular focus of this review is navigating when pregnancy changes in the eye occur or peak during the gestational period, and whether the changes are short-lived or might extend past pregnancy. While many pregnancy-associated changes are temporary and resolve post-partum, it is also recognised that some changes persist after pregnancy, with a notable absence of literature on ocular changes with loss or termination of pregnancy. Currently or previously pregnant women (or those planning to become pregnant), and other health professionals, should be educated about the importance of seeking eyecare before, during and after pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374945/"}

Statistical analysis including binary logistic regression to investigate predictive factors of eye disease was performed. The age of the participants was mean 42 years. In 108 patients (17.4%) an ophthalmological disease was present. The mean VFQ-25 composite score was 91.1, and was not significantly different between the group with (88.8) or without (91.6) eye disease. A clear age dependency of VFQ-25 scores was seen. Most reduced subscales in eye disease were ocular pain and role difficulties. Patients with amblyopia did not show any reduction in visual quality of life (composite score 93.4). In the binary regression model, considering the clinical parameters intraocular pressure (IOP), cup/disc ratio (CDR), and spherical equivalent, as well as some of the VFQ-25 subscales, the presence of eye disease could be predicted with a high specificity of 98.7% but a low sensitivity of 12.2%. Normal values of the VFQ-25 performance in a large number of working people in Germany are given with a clear age dependency.

DeepSeek-R1 was accessed through its public chat interface, while OpenAI o1 was queried via its Application Programming Interface with a standardised temperature of 0.3. Both models were prompted using plan-and-solve+. Performance was calculated as the proportion of correct answers. McNemar's test was employed to compare the two models' performance on paired data. Intermodel agreement for correct diagnoses was evaluated via Cohen's kappa. Token-based cost analyses were performed to estimate the comparative expenditures of running each model at scale, including input prompts and model-generated output. DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 achieved an identical overall performance of 82.0% (n=246/300; 95%‚ÄâCI: 77.3 to 85.9). Subspecialty-specific analysis revealed numerical variation in performance, though none of these comparisons reached statistical significance (p>0.05).

Retrospective utilization analysis. A historical review of the development of the Aravind Eye Care system was undertaken to evaluate the services provided by various tertiary services of the system. Demand for services is inferred based on the utilization statistics described below and distance traveled by patients to obtain services. Utilization of subspecialty services increased logarithmically for 17 years in all specialties. At all centers except one historically focused on glaucoma, retina services had the highest demand among subspecialty surgical services. The proportion of tertiary care patients among all new outpatients (39% in 2009 and 45% in 2013) and the proportion of specialty surgical and treatment procedures among all procedures (30% in 1997 and 49% 2013) increased over time. More patients traveled long distances (>100 kilometers) to receive specialty services than to receive cataract services (30% vs 23%). These observations suggest that in regions where tertiary services are not widely available, (1) patients demand (travel further for) tertiary care more than general ophthalmology services; (2) demand for services can expand rapidly for many years; (3) tertiary care services tend to grow over time as a proportion of all services provided; and (4) retina services are the most highly demanded subspecialty surgical services. In such settings, it is likely that considerable latent demand exists; planned tertiary eye centers should anticipate sustained growth of tertiary services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26095262/"}

Intraoperative monitoring of VEP was attempted in 35 cases. We evaluated success rate of VEP recording, correlation between VEP findings and postoperative visual function, and reasons why recording was not successful. Stable and reproducible waveforms were obtained in 59 sides (84%). Two cases, whose VEP deteriorated intraoperatively, developed postoperative visual disturbance: In 11 sides (16%), stable waveforms were not obtained. There were two main causes. In 8 sides out of 11, the cause was attributed to pre-existing severe visual disturbance. In these 8 sides, VEP in the awake state was not recordable or was recordable, but with very low amplitudes under 1 microV. In the other 3 sides, the cause was attributed to movement of a stimulating device by reflecting the fronto-temporal scalp flap.

Many ocular diseases leading to blindness can be halted or delayed when detected and treated at its earliest stages. With the recent developments in diagnostic devices, imaging and genomics, new sources of data for early disease detection and patients' management are now available. Machine learning techniques emerged in the biomedical sciences as clinical decision-support techniques to improve sensitivity and specificity of disease detection and monitoring, increasing objectively the clinical decision-making process. This manuscript presents a review in multimodal ocular disease diagnosis and monitoring based on machine learning approaches. In the first section, the technical issues related to the different machine learning approaches will be present. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically recognize complex patterns in a given dataset. These techniques allows creating homogeneous groups (unsupervised learning), or creating a classifier predicting group membership of new cases (supervised learning), when a group label is available for each case. To ensure a good performance of the machine learning techniques in a given dataset, all possible sources of bias should be removed or minimized. For that, the representativeness of the input dataset for the true population should be confirmed, the noise should be removed, the missing data should be treated and the data dimensionally (i.e., the number of parameters/features and the number of cases in the dataset) should be adjusted. The application of machine learning techniques in ocular disease diagnosis and monitoring will be presented and discussed in the second section of this manuscript. To show the clinical benefits of machine learning in clinical vision sciences, several examples will be presented in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, these ocular pathologies being the major causes of irreversible visual impairment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27362387/"}

Response to cataract surgery and treatment of other chronic ocular conditions.", "text": "Evaluation of health care in older populations has increasingly focused on quality of life as a critical outcome of treatment. Vision is assumed to be central to functioning. Data suggest that aging, in itself, is associated with a decline in visual functioning, which, in turn, is related to a decline in physical and mental functioning. Other studies indicate that cataract surgery is followed by significant improvement in vision and visual function. Our objective was to test these assumptions. Prospective study of 1021 patients, consecutively drawn from 76 randomly selected ophthalmologists' offices in three cities. Structured interviews were completed at baseline, 2 months, and 1 year after entry. Six hundred thirteen patients with cataracts and 408 other ophthalmic patients drawn from the same offices but treated for other chronic ocular disorders. All received refractive services as needed. Patients from three cities (Baltimore, Md, St Louis, Mo, and San Diego, Calif) were interviewed once in their homes and twice by telephone. The study involved the measurement of the effects of usual treatment for cataracts and other degenerative eye diseases. Visual, social, and psychological functioning. Within 1 year of treatment, change in visual function was accompanied by significant changes, in the same direction, in quality of life functions: night-time driving, daytime driving, community activities, home activities, mental health, and life satisfaction. In addition, the patients with cataracts showed significantly greater improvement in measures of vision than did the noncataract group. Regardless of treatment, improvement across quality of life functions occurred when visual function improved. Thus, many types of functional degeneration observed in older populations, attributed to a decline in vision, can be slowed, or even reversed, when visual function is improved. Cataract surgery was effective in improving vision and quality of life functions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8489453/"}

Vision is one of the most important senses in the normal physical and cognitive development of children. Schoolchildren who were born preterm have impaired visual, motor and cognitive functions when compared to those of children born full term. This is more a consequence of central nervous system immaturity than of localized injuries to ocular and/ or cortical structures. The literature pinpoints retinopathy of prematurity, strabismus and refractive errors as the main ophthalmologic alterations resulting from prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is one of the main causes of preventable blindness in childhood. It is estimated that on average 562 children become blind each year in Brazil, which is a very high socioeconomic cost to result from a treatable disease. Children with visual deficiencies may be helped by programs of early visual stimulation in order to promote their environmental integration. The recommendation is that every preterm newborn weighing less than 1,500 g and/or with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks should be monitored until complete retinal vascularization and that the first examination should be performed between the fourth and sixth weeks of life.

Preoperational examination included measurement of visual acuity, biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, tonography, ultrasonography and electrophysiological examinations. Vitreotome 'ocutome' was used to perform the operations. A transcyliar approach was used in all but 14 cases, for which the operations were performed by limbal incision. Improvement of visual functions was noted in 28 eyes (63.3%), and relatively good visual function was achieved in 7 eyes (16.9%). Visual acuity remained unchanged in 6 eyes (13.6%) because of severe amblyopia, although the transparency of optic zone was restored and the fundus did become visible. IN 10 (22.7%) of the children visual acuity could not be measured because of too young an age. One day after surgery a cellular suspension in the vitreous was observed in many eyes. This however, resolved within 3 days. Intraocular pressure usually returned during the first week after surgery. Hypotonia remained for 1-2 months after subtotal vitrectomy. The transcyliar extraction of pathological vitreous in children is generally a less traumatic and more convenient means of intravitreal manipulation, but 2 cases of intraoperational hemophthalmia suggested that iridiocyclitis is a contraindication for transcyliar approach.

Visually significant cataract was defined by Wisconsin Cataract Grading System and a best-corrected visual acuity <20/40 with cataract as the primary cause of vision impairment. Participants were deemed 'undiagnosed' if they had visually significant cataract and reported no prior physician diagnosis of cataract.

We found that on average, blind children showed a roughly half-year vocabulary delay relative to sighted children, amid considerable variability. However, the content of blind and sighted children's vocabulary was statistically indistinguishable in word length, part of speech, semantic category, concreteness, interactiveness, and perceptual modality. At a finer-grained level, we also found that words' perceptual properties intersect with children's perceptual abilities. Our findings suggest that while an absence of visual input may initially make vocabulary development more difficult, the content of the early productive vocabulary is largely resilient to differences in perceptual access. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Infants and toddlers born blind (with no other diagnoses) show a 7.5 month productive vocabulary delay on average, with wide variability. Across the studied age range (7-57¬†months), vocabulary delays widened with age. Blind and sighted children's early vocabularies contain similar distributions of word lengths, parts of speech, semantic categories, and perceptual modalities.

The examples chosen demonstrate problems artists have had to face from different types of eye disease, including cataract, glaucoma, and retinal diseases. The ophthalmological care provided is described in terms of scientific knowledge at the time. Investigation of primary and secondary source material. Discussion with art historians and ophthalmic historians. Examination of work by the artists. Artists can be markedly affected by ocular diseases that change their ability to see the world. The individuals described here worked during the 19th century and first half of the 20th century. Homer Martin suffered from cataracts, and his works reveal changes in details and color as he aged. Henri Harpignies, who had an extremely long career, undoubtedly had cataracts and may also have had macular degeneration. Angle-closure glaucoma blinded Jules Ch√©ret. Auguste Ravier suffered from neovascular glaucoma in one eye and was able to work with his remaining eye, which developed a cataract. Louis Valtat suffered from what was in all likelihood open-angle glaucoma, but specific changes due to this disease are not apparent in his work. Roger Bissi√®re developed glaucoma and did well following filtration surgery. George Du Maurier lost one eye from what was probably a retinal detachment and later suffered from a central retinal problem in the other eye. Diseases of the eye may profoundly influence artists by altering their perception of the world. The specific effects may vary, depending on the disease, its severity, and the psychology of the artist. Cataracts typically affect an artist's ability to depict color and detail. The effect of glaucoma generally depends on whether central vision is preserved. Disease that affects the center of the retina has a substantial effect on an artist's ability to depict fine details. Ophthalmological care was limited during the lifetimes of the artists under consideration, by comparison to 21st century standards. When medical or surgical therapy was ineffective, the most important thing a physician could offer these artists was consolation against anxiety and depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19277248/"}

Optogenetics refers to techniques that use light to control the cellular activity of targeted cells. Although optogenetics is a relatively new technology, multiple therapeutic options are already being explored in pre-clinical and phase I/II clinical trials with the aim of developing novel, safe, and effective treatments for major blinding eye diseases, such as glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa. Optogenetic approaches to visual restoration are primarily aimed at replacing lost or dysfunctional photoreceptors by inserting light-sensitive proteins into downstream retinal neurons that have no intrinsic light sensitivity. Such approaches are attractive because they are agnostic to the genetic causes of retinal degeneration, which raises hopes that all forms of retinal dystrophic and degenerative diseases could become treatable. Optogenetic strategies can also have a far-reaching impact on translational research by serving as important tools to study the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration and to identify clinically relevant therapeutic targets. For example, the CRY-CIBN optogenetic system has been recently applied to animal models of glaucoma, suggesting a potential role of OCRL in the regulation of intraocular pressure in trabecular meshwork.

However, the brain, through multiple indirect influences, has also a major impact on functional visual impairment. Such indirect influences include intracerebral pressure, eye movements, top-down modulation (attention, cognition), and emotionally triggered stress hormone release affecting blood vessel dysregulation. Therefore, vision loss should be viewed as the result of multiple interactions within a \"brain-eye-vascular triad\", and several eye diseases may also be considered as brain diseases in disguise. While the brain is part of the problem, it can also be part of the solution. Neuronal networks of the brain can \"amplify\" residual vision through neuroplasticity changes of local and global functional connectivity by activating, modulating and strengthening residual visual signals. The activation of residual vision can be achieved by different means such as vision restoration training, non-invasive brain stimulation, or blood flow enhancing medications. Modulating brain functional networks and improving vascular regulation may offer new opportunities to recover or restore low vision by increasing visual field size, visual acuity and overall functional vision. Hence, neuroscience offers new insights to better understand vision loss, and modulating brain and vascular function is a promising source for new opportunities to activate residual vision to achieve restoration and recovery to improve quality of live in patients suffering from low vision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30412515/"}

The stroma layer comprises nearly 90¬†% of the thickness of the cornea and thus plays a pivotal role in normal visual function. The bulk of this layer is constituted by proteins in the extracellular martrix secreted by the corneal epithelial, stroma, and endothelial cells. Clinical research has shown that corneal stroma diseases are common and involve conditions such as infections, injuries, and genetic defects, which cause severe visual disturbances or even blindness. To improve our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms involved in the physiological and pathological activities of the corneal stroma, its proteins have been brought into the limelight to determine their crucial and irreplaceable roles. The data presented in a previous study have demonstrated the presence of 1679 proteins in the stroma, and this data set has subsequently been perfected by utilizing a highly sensitive isobaric peptide-labeling approach. According to their manifestations, these proteins can be classified as a gel-like organic material composed of proteoglycans, enzymes, and hemocyanin-binding proteins and a network of filaments composed of collagen, elastin, keratin, vimentin, and interconnected filaments comprising fibronectin and laminin. The aim of this review is to describe some corneal stroma proteins by highlighting their major functions and valuable applications in ophthalmologic research toward the better characterization and treatment of eye diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26905288/"}

To combat this thoroughgoing relativism a case study is taken from the early history of visual science. In classical antiquity several fundamentally different 'views' (to use Don Juan's term) of how we see contended for approval. It was only at the beginning of the seventeenth century that the 'modern' interpretation was selected. This interpretation was selected, ultimately, because it 'worked'. Reference is made to both Wittgenstein and Marx to support this appeal to praxis.

After adjusting for age, pseudoexfoliation, small pupil, prior ocular surgery, and anterior chamber depth, we found that glaucoma cases were more likely to have posterior capsular tear with vitrectomy (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, P = .03) and sulcus intraocular lens placement (OR 1.65, P = .03) during cataract surgery. Glaucoma cases were more likely to have postoperative inflammation (OR 1.73, P < .0001), prolonged elevated intraocular pressure (OR 2.96, P = .0003), and additional surgery within 30 days (OR 1.92, P = .03). Mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ) scores significantly improved after cataract surgery in both groups (P < .0001), but there were larger improvements in BCVA (P = .01) and VFQ composite scores (P < .0001) in the nonglaucoma vs the glaucoma group.

Reversal of the imagery to the contralateral eyes again brought large changes in opposite directions. In the two older children, aged 4 and 8 years, respectively, there were marked decreases in acuity in the patched eye, but little or no change in the unpatched eye. It is not know whether these differences are due to age or to the original kind of visual disorder, such as deprivation, occlusion, or strabismus, or are merely individual differences. It is clear, however, that some children exhibit large changes in acuity in response to visual deprivation or patching, or to its removal, in a readily reversible manner.

Eye parasites can impair their host's sensory performance with important consequences for the detection of prey, predators, and conspecifics. We used European perch (Perca fluviatilis) experimentally infected with the eye fluke Tylodelphys clavata and evaluated their feeding behavior and competitive ability under competition with non-infected conspecifics, in groups of four individuals, for two different prey species (Asellus aquaticus and Daphnia magna). To test whether the effect of T. clavata infection differs at different light conditions, we performed the experiments at two light intensities (600 and 6¬†lx). Foraging efficiency of perch was significantly affected by infection but not by light intensity. The distance at which infected fish attacked both prey species was significantly shorter in comparison to non-infected conspecifics. Additionally, infected fish more often unsuccessfully attacked A. aquaticus. Although the outcome of competition depended on prey species, there was a general tendency that non-infected fish consumed more of the available prey under both light intensities. Even though individual prey preferences for either A. aquaticus or D. magna were observed, we could not detect that infected fish change their prey preference to compensate for a reduced competitive foraging ability. As infection of T. clavata impairs foraging efficiency and competitive ability, infected fish would need to spend more time foraging to attain similar food intake as non-infected conspecifics; this presumably increases predation risk and potentially enhances transmission success to the final host.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31286263/"}

Pig eyes share many similarities with human eyes, having a holangiotic retinal vasculature, no tapetum, cone photoreceptors in the outer retina, and a similar scleral thickness, rendering them valuable in comparative research. It must not be forgotten, however, that pigs are intelligent sentient animals which use vision as an important sense. Thus, diseases such as congenital cataracts, which impede vision, are important from the perspective of pig welfare.

This study evaluates the CFEH integrated eye-care model in the identification of chronic eye diseases within the community.<b>Methods</b>: A retrospective random clinical audit of over 750 medical records of patients referred to the CFEH between July 2016 and June 2019 was conducted. Demographics of patients, referral type, final diagnosis and recommended management plans were extracted from this subset. Clinic key performance indicators (referral turnaround time, and net cost per patient appointment) were also extracted.<b>Results</b>: Of the 755 referrals associated with the audited records, 77.4% resulted in the identification of patients with or at-risk of developing eye diseases with 73.5% of this cohort requiring ongoing monitoring at CFEH or referral to ophthalmology. Although the CFEH model is not designed to diagnose or manage acute conditions, 1.5% of patients in this pathway required same day ophthalmological or medical intervention. The cost per patient was equivalent to hospital eye departments costs.<b>Conclusion</b>: This integrated care pathway has the potential to reduce unnecessary referrals from optometrists to hospital ophthalmological service by offering a safe and effective alternate pathway. The majority of patients seen within this pathway were able to be monitored within optometry-led services. This is a unique clinical model utilising inter-professional referrals within optometry which has the potential to reduce preventable blindness within the community through the early detection of eye diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33689627/"}

The VF-14 Index was used to assess the visual function of 833 consecutive cataract patients, attending 19 ophthalmologists from public and private hospitals and primary care practices in Spain, in 1999-2000. In this before/after trial, the intervention included (1) an educational session, and (2) the provision of the VF-14 scores of all subsequent patients to the ophthalmologist. Mixed effects linear and logistic models were constructed to assess the effect on the process (correlation between patients' and physicians' assessments of visual function, appropriateness of surgery recommendation) and the outcome of care (satisfaction). The adjusted regression coefficient for the VF-14 score significantly increased after the intervention as a predictor of the ophthalmologist's assessment of visual function (beta coefficient: control 0.10 vs. intervention 0.35, p < 0.05). The intervention did not increase the probability of an appropriate medical decision (OR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.42; 2,69) and it did not change patient satisfaction with care. Routine provision of education and feedback on the patient's VF-14 Index score significantly increases agreement between patients' and physicians' assessments of functional capacity.

From 1991 to 1997, all new BL and LL patients who had relapsed from an earlier disease, detected by active case finding in the geographically defined area of Gudiyattam taluk, were invited for ocular examination after their leprosy status was confirmed clinically and histopathologically. Sixty relapsed lepromatous patients, 45 male and 15 females, were examined. Fifty-two patients had relapsed after receiving only dapsone mono-therapy, 4 after receiving paucibacillary multi-drug therapy (PB-MDT) preceded by dapsone mono-therapy and 4 after only PB-MDT. Three (5%) patients had lagophthalmos, 1 (1.6%) patients each had ectropion and trichiasis, 32 (53%) patients had impaired corneal sensation in both eyes, 2 (3.3%) patients each had corneal opacity (associated with reduced vision), corneal nerve beading, punctate keratitis, keratic precipitates, and iris atrophy, 4 (6.6%) patients had cataract associated with decreased vision, 1 (1.6%) patient had blocked naso-lacrimal duct and 13 (21.7%) patients had pterygium. Seven (12%) patients had a visual acuity of 6/18 or less, 4 (6.7%) patients had 6/60 or less and one patients had vision below 3/60. General ocular complications rather than leprosy-related ocular complications were responsible for reduced vision. Lagophthalmos was associated with increased duration of the disease (P = 0.009), Grade II deformity (P = 0.001), punctate keratitis (P < 0.001) and cataract (P < 0.001). Beaded corneal nerves were associated with lepromatous leprosy (P < 0.001) and high mycobacterial infection (P = 0.05). Patients whose initial disease was categorised as BL and LL had greater impairment of vision (P = 0.037), more iris atrophy (P = 0.013), increased keratic precipitates (P = 0.013) and more corneal nerve beading (P = 0.013), when compared with the group comprising Tuberculoid-tuberculoid (TT), Borderline-tuberculoid (BT) and Intermediate (IND). This first report on ocular complications in relapsed lepromatous patients demonstrates that general and leprosy-related ocular complications occur in these patients.

Comprehensive general medical and ophthalmic histories are most helpful. Information about the animal's vision, based on its performance in familiar and unfamiliar environments, should be obtained from the owner. As bilateral involvement and visual disturbances are often associated with systemic diseases, a complete physical examination is indicated. The ophthalmic examination consists of a series of diagnostic procedures to isolate and define the ophthalmic disorder. Several clinical tests can be performed easily in the examination room, including the light-induced pupillary reflex, the dazzle or photic reflex, the menace reflex, the obstacle course test and, if indicated, the flash electroretinogram, the visual evoked response and, recently, the pattern electroretinogram. Ophthalmic diseases that produce visual disturbances in dogs often affect the cornea, aqueous pathways, lens and ocular fundus; in cats, they usually affect the uveal tract and are associated with serious systemic diseases. Orbital diseases are not usually associated with visual disturbance unless the optic nerve is involved. Corneal diseases and cataract formation that involve the visual axis and pupillary aperture often cause visual disturbance. Inflammations of the Iris and ciliary body can produce both acute and long-term visual disturbance and even blindness.

It was designed to provide free eye examinations to all prekindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade students enrolled in Cleveland City public schools in order to diagnose refractive errors, amblyopia, and strabismus, so that treatment is instituted and the best possible visual outcome attained. Examinations are performed in 2 lanes of a specially outfitted recreational vehicle. All children undergo monocular visual acuity testing at distance and near, stereopsis testing, cover testing at distance and near, testing of versions, and external ocular inspection. If a child fails any part of this examination according to the guidelines set by the American Academy of Pediatrics, cycloplegic drops are instilled and an optometrist refracts the child on location and performs indirect ophthalmoscopy. Glasses are prescribed and follow-up with a pediatric ophthamologist is arranged. During the first 4 years of the program, 22,988 examinations were performed. Seven percent of children had errors of refraction that necessitated optical correction, about 2.1% had strabismus, and 1.7% had amblyopia. The cost per student per year was around $23 excluding glasses. About 10% of 5- and 6-year-old schoolchildren have eye problems that require either glasses or treatment for strabismus or amblyopia.

Ocular toxicity induced by anticancer chemotherapy is not uncommon. The development of more aggressive regimens as well as new agents and combination chemotherapies have resulted in a significant increase of reported cases of chemotherapy-induced ocular side effects. In most instances, the mechanisms of ocular toxicity continue to be poorly understood. Ocular toxicities induced by chemotherapeutic agents are generally not preventable; therefore, clinicians must be aware of potential vision-threatening complications.

This visual bioelectricity changes can be recorded by using visual stimulus, surface electrode and amplified recording apparatus. Clinical electrophysiology examination of vision has been an important clinical examination technique in ophthalmology. This technique provides a non-traumatic, objective, quantitative and location-detecting visual function examination procedure that can inspect visual path from the retina to visual cortex. Recently, visual physiology has gained noticeable development in basic research and clinical application.

The methods used were: the LH contrast vision test and the ability to detect raisins, puffed rice and white and black sugar strands against a white and black background. The aim of the study was to see whether any of the tests could be used in the detection of subnormal vision, and to compare the results between the different groups of patients. The following parameters of contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were measured with the LH-test: the maximum contrast sensitivity, the total area of CSF, and the area of 8 spatial frequency bands. Difficulty in detecting an object with low versus high contrast was measured with the sugar strands. Subjects with subnormal vision due to ocular disease and strabismic amblyopia had lower contrast sensitivity than subjects with normal vision measured as the total area of the CSF or the area of a specific frequency band. However, the maximum contrast sensitivity value that could be measured with the test was not significantly different between the groups. No subject had difficulties in the detection of raisins and puffed rice on a white and black background. Difficulties in detecting sugar strands on a white background were not seen in the normal children, but approximately 65% of the children with visual impairment had difficulties, as did approximately 25% of the children and adults with strabismus. Most of these subjects also had low visual acuity, but there was no correlation between the level of reduction of visual acuity and the difficulty in detecting sugar strands.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10420213/"}

In an ongoing series, this third article is the first of 2 related articles that deal with the basics of producing a high-quality research manuscript. Although ophthalmology and vision science are the principal focus of this series, the general concepts essential to producing a quality manuscript are applicable to diverse fields of research. This article highlights the exponential growth in the scientific literature over the past 40 years, considers why it is important to publish completed research, and discusses the necessity of identifying the key messages of the research, and their context, in relation to the published literature. The ethics of publishing biomedical research and scientific misconduct, such as duplicate publication or plagiarism, are outlined. To avoid later conflict, there is a critical need for coworkers to carefully address authorship order and inclusion early in the manuscript process. Internationally agreed guidelines are identified to guide this process. The importance of choosing the correct journal for a specific article and the nature of basic citation indices are discussed.

In the first of a series of articles for those embarking on ophthalmic and vision science research, this paper discusses the key features of citation analysis, concentrating on the 2004 Journal Citation Report figures for the field of ophthalmology that include 42 ophthalmology, vision science, physiological optics, and optometry journals. The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) calculates a number of parameters including citation counts, Journal Impact Factor (JIF), Immediacy Index, and cited/citing half-life. This article discusses the methods of calculation and possible uses along with current controversies and potential abuses. The JIF and its relevance, potential bias, and limitations are discussed in depth as it has become the most widely used analysis of journal quality.

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising means of centralizing data collection and analysis, but to date, most AI algorithms have only been applied to analyzing image data in ophthalmologic practice. In this review we aimed to characterize the use of AI in the analysis of EHR, and to critically appraise the adherence of each included study to the CONSORT-AI reporting guideline. A comprehensive search of three relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) from January 2010 to February 2023 was conducted. The included studies were evaluated for reporting quality based on the AI-specific items from the CONSORT-AI reporting guideline. Of the 4,968 articles identified by our search, 89 studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Most of the studies utilized AI for ocular disease prediction (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ41, 46.1%), and diabetic retinopathy was the most studied ocular pathology (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ19, 21.3%). The overall mean CONSORT-AI score across the 14 measured items was 12.1 (range 8-14, median 12). Categories with the lowest adherence rates were: describing handling of poor quality data (48.3%), specifying participant inclusion and exclusion criteria (56.2%), and detailing access to the AI intervention or its code, including any restrictions (62.9%). In conclusion, we have identified that AI is prominently being used for disease prediction in ophthalmology clinics, however these algorithms are limited by their lack of generalizability and cross-center reproducibility. A standardized framework for AI reporting should be developed, to improve AI applications in the management of ocular disease and ophthalmology decision making.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38953984/"}

The objective of this article is to establish the extent to which vision is either rod-or cone-dominated under night driving conditions. Visual thresholds are measured under lighting conditions that simulate urban lighting. Dark adaptation curves are obtained under three ambient lighting conditions ranging from low (0.1 cd/m) to high (5 cd/m) mesopic levels of retinal adaptation using circular discs of different sizes (1 degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees, and 5 degrees) presented at retinal eccentricities of 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees. The dark adaptation curves exhibit the classic inflection point between rod and cone activity for the lower levels of ambient illumination but a simple monophasic function for the high mesopic levels (>0.5 lux). Adaptation rates are four times faster for the higher compared with the lower illumination level and twice as fast for central compared with peripheral presentation. The data suggest that vision is mediated by cone pathways at 5 lux and by rod pathways at 0.5/0.1 lux. This shift does not profoundly affect sensitivity, but because rod pathways are known to be slower than cone pathways, it will certainly affect observers' ability to respond to rapidly changing viewing conditions such as are encountered when driving at night.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16127333/"}

The prevalence of each of the other ocular manifestations, with the exception of retinal vaso-occlusive disease, was consistently less than 5%. Retinal vasculitis, uveitis and isolated cotton wool spots tended to be associated with more active SLE disease.

While cells and tissues from the main parts of the eye and the visual cortex (VC) can be maintained in culture, and many computer models exist, the current non-animal approaches are severely limiting in the study of visual perception and retinotopic imaging. Some of the early studies with cats and non-human primates (NHPs) are controversial for animal welfare reasons and are of questionable clinical relevance, particularly with respect to the treatment of amblyopia. More recently, the UK Home Office records have shown that attention is now more focused on rodents, especially the mouse. This is likely to be due to the perceived need for genetically-altered animals, rather than to knowledge of the similarities and differences of vision in cats, NHPs and rodents, and the fact that the same techniques can be used for all of the species.

One classic example is spasmus nutans in which the eye oscillations are the primary cause, whereas head nodding is thought to be an operant conditional response that suppresses the eye oscillations to facilitate clear vision. The second example is a combination of head tremor and inadequate compensatory eye movements because of vestibular hypofunction leading to the illusion of pendular nystagmus - hence, the condition is called pseudonystagmus. Cerebellar degeneration in ataxia-telangiectasia or synchronized spontaneous discharge from the inferior olive and cerebellum in the syndrome of ocular palatal tremor with dystonia are examples of eye and head oscillations because of the impairment in cerebellar outflow. Infantile nystagmus syndrome also presents with eye and head oscillations, but here the relationship between the two types of oscillations differs among patients and is still unclear. The clinical features and putative pathophysiology of diverse disorders of the eyes and head that produce unwanted oscillations are reviewed.

With regard to this article hard arguments and ideas for solutions had to be found. A pilot study in 21 enterprises was realized (1602 employees with different visual work tasks). A test set of screening parameters (visual acuity, refraction, phoria, binocular cooperation and efficiency, accommodation range and color vision) were measured. The glasses and/or contact lenses worn were registered and the visual tasks analyzed. In work at visual display units (VDU) the eye movements were recorded and standardized questionnaires were given (health, stress, visual work situation). Because of the heterogeneity of the sample only simple statistics were applied: in groups of different visual work the complaints, symptoms, hassles and uplifts were clustered (SAS software) and correlated with the results of the visual tests. Later a special project in 8 companies (676 employees) was carried out. The results were published in [14]. Discomfort and asthenopic symptoms could be seen as an interaction of the combination of tasks and working conditions with the clusters of individual functionalisms, frequently originating in postural compromises. Mainly three causes for stress could be identified: 1. demands inadequate with regard to intensity, resolution, amount and/or time structure; 2. prevention of elementary perceptive needs; 3. entire use of partial capacities of the visual organ. Symptoms also were correlated with heteronomy. Other findings: influence of adaptation/accommodation ratio, the distracting role of attractors, especially in multitasking jobs; influence of high luminance differences. Dry eyes were very common, they could be attributed to a high screen position, low light, monotonous tasks and office climate. For some parameters a diurnal rhythm could be identified. Nowhere special programs for ageing employees were found: the right glasses; retinal problems and signs of destabilization of vision.

Complications were recorded for each patient at times of reexamination. Over the 5-year observation period, the 83 patients wore lenses for more than 26 months. The average duration of use of 2WFR lenses was 14.5¬±2.7 days/lens (n=83) and subsequently 1.03¬±0.12 days/lens (n=83) for DD lenses. Compliance with the duration of use was consistently good as monitored by requests for lens resupply in both wearing modalities. The subjective complaint of dryness tended to consistently show improvement by the change to DD wear: 18.1% vs. 30.1% (P=0.10, Fisher exact test). Among eye complications noted in each group, the occurrence of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) was significantly decreased in DD wear: 9.6% vs. 26.5% (P=0.008, Fisher exact test). The main reasons given by patients for changing to DD wear were (1) \"DD lens wear was more hygienic\" (78.6%) and (2) \"DD lens use is more convenient for travel/business trips\" (64.3%). Comments after the switch in wear were (1) \"easy and convenient\" (95.7%) and (2) \"I don't have to worry about expiration dates\" on solutions (57.1%). Overall, 95.7% of wearers making the change answered as \"satisfied\" and \"mostly satisfied.\" In the subscription membership program, which provided free lens replacement and/or reexamination, individual compliance with duration of wear in 2WFR wear cycles was good; however, these patients switching to DD wear tended to have improvement in their subjective complaints of dryness and objectively demonstrated a significant reduction of SPK at follow-up examinations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25996420/"}

Vitreal and intraretinal ERGs were recorded from eight dark-adapted, anesthetized Abyssinian cats. Brief bright flashes were used to elicit vitreal a- and b-waves. Longer, weaker flashes were used to elicit intraretinal b- and c-waves. Stages 1 through 4 of the disease were characterized ophthalmoscopically. Parameters of the Lamb and Pugh a-wave model (a(max), A, and t(eff)) for the Abyssinian cats were compared with those for normal cats. Light microscopy was used to count photoreceptor nuclei. The maximum a-wave amplitude, a(max), was significantly smaller in stage 1, and continued to decrease (stage 1: 50% of normal, stage 2: 28%, stage 3: 27%; and stage 4: unrecordable). There was a small, but not significant, decrease in the amplification constant A from 0.24 +/- 0.11 s(-2) in normal cats to 0.16 +/- 0.08 s(-2) in Abyssinian cats. The intraretinal b- and c-wave amplitudes decreased most dramatically during the early stage of the disease. Affected animals had fewer photoreceptors than unaffected Abyssinians or control animals. The number of photoreceptors declined most rapidly in the inferior periphery. The amplitudes of all ERG components were already reduced significantly by stage 1 and progressively declined. The lack of major changes in a-wave model parameters indicates that the degeneration is probably not due to a mutation in transduction proteins. Losses of photoreceptor function were larger than losses of photoreceptor nuclei.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16877442/"}

Interocular acuity differences were sensitive to such asymmetric eye disorders as strabismic amblyopia and unilateral ocular abnormalities and enabled monitoring of occlusion therapy for these conditions.

To develop DLS parameters which are appropriate for the control of post-op course after ophthalmologic surgery. METHODS, DESIGN: Three new DLS devices were tested in different post-op clinical settings such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), cataract surgery and retinal surgery. In a second step DLS was used to detect molecular changes in the cornea of 6 patients after photo refractive keratectomy (PRK) and 16 patients after photo astigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK). In PEX-patients cataract surgery changed the DLS signals of the anterior chamber and the lens in a specific way compared to the pre-op situation. Cataract patients without PEX had more scattering particles post-op and retinal surgery modified the DLS signal of the vitreous. Furthermore it was shown that the length of the corneal scattering vector l correlated with the process of the corneal wound healing after PARK. One and three months after surgery the lengths of the scattering vectors had increased significantly but returned to pre-op values twelve months post-op. The post-op transparency of eye segments such as the cornea, the vitreous and the anterior chamber depends primarily on the wound healing mechanisms. DLS seems to be a suitable method to control the corneal recovery after refractive surgery. The length of the scattering vector l correlates well with the wound healing after refractive surgery. However DLS-signals seem to contain information about the molecular composition of tissue too. Therefore further research is needed to refine the interpretation of the DLS signals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17673834/"}

Their potential to optimize the consultation process and diagnostic capabilities across range of ophthalmic subspecialties have yet to be fully explored. This study aims to investigate the performance of AI chatbots in recommending ophthalmic outpatient registration and diagnosing eye diseases within clinical case profiles. This cross-sectional study used clinical cases from Chinese Standardized Resident Training-Ophthalmology (2nd Edition). For each case, 2 profiles were created: patient with history (Hx) and patient with history and examination (Hx+Ex). These profiles served as independent queries for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 (accessed from March 5 to 18, 2024). Similarly, 3 ophthalmic residents were posed the same profiles in a questionnaire format. The accuracy of recommending ophthalmic subspecialty registration was primarily evaluated using Hx profiles. The accuracy of the top-ranked diagnosis and the accuracy of the diagnosis within the top 3 suggestions (do-not-miss diagnosis) were assessed using Hx+Ex profiles. The gold standard for judgment was the published, official diagnosis. Characteristics of incorrect diagnoses by ChatGPT were also analyzed. A total of 208 clinical profiles from 12 ophthalmic subspecialties were analyzed (104 Hx and 104 Hx+Ex profiles). For Hx profiles, GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and residents showed comparable accuracy in registration suggestions (66/104, 63.5%; 81/104, 77.9%; and 72/104, 69.2%, respectively; P=.07), with ocular trauma, retinal diseases, and strabismus and amblyopia achieving the top 3 accuracies. For Hx+Ex profiles, both GPT-4.0 and residents demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than GPT-3.5 (62/104, 59.6% and 63/104, 60.6% vs 41/104, 39.4%; P=.003 and P=.001, respectively). Accuracy for do-not-miss diagnoses also improved (79/104, 76% and 68/104, 65.4% vs 51/104, 49%; P<.001 and P=.02, respectively). The highest diagnostic accuracies were observed in glaucoma; lens diseases; and eyelid, lacrimal, and orbital diseases. GPT-4.0 recorded fewer incorrect top-3 diagnoses (25/42, 60% vs 53/63, 84%; P=.005) and more partially correct diagnoses (21/42, 50% vs 7/63 11%; P<.001) than GPT-3.5, while GPT-3.5 had more completely incorrect (27/63, 43% vs 7/42, 17%; P=.005) and less precise diagnoses (22/63, 35% vs 5/42, 12%; P=.009). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 showed intermediate performance in recommending ophthalmic subspecialties for registration. While GPT-3.5 underperformed, GPT-4.0 approached and numerically surpassed residents in differential diagnosis. AI chatbots show promise in facilitating ophthalmic patient registration. However, their integration into diagnostic decision-making requires more validation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39541581/"}

Shortage of eye care workers impedes effective implementation of prevention of blindness programs. The World Health Organization has identified education, partnership, leadership, financing, and policy as intertwined interventions that are critical to resolving this crisis on the long term. The VISION 2020 LINK between the College of Ophthalmology of Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in the United Kingdom aims to increase the quantity and quality of eye care training in East, Central, and Southern Africa through a focus on five strategic areas: fellowship examination for ophthalmologists, training the trainers, curriculum development for residents in ophthalmology and ophthalmic clinical officers, continuous professional development (CPD), and mentoring program for young ophthalmologists. This study examined how education and partnership can be linked to improve eye care, through an evaluation of this north-south link based on its own targets and established frameworks to guide north-south links. An exploratory qualitative case study design was used. Twenty-nine link representatives were recruited through purposive sampling and snowballing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview schedule that incorporated the components of a successful link from an existing framework. Documents pertaining to the link were also examined. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The findings revealed that the perception to the contribution of the link to eye care in the region is generally positive. Process indicators showed that the targets in three strategic objectives of the link have been achieved. Framework-based evaluation also showed that the link is successful. Mutual learning and development of friendships were the most commonly identified success factors. Inadequate awareness of the link by college members is a key challenge. The study concludes that the link is active and evolving and has achieved most of its targets. Further developments should be directed to influence health system strengthening in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa more strategically.

We administered structured surveys to six stakeholder groups, including eyecare providers, patients and older adult participants in the National Eye Survey of Trinidad and Tobago. We reviewed reports, registers and policy documents, and used a health system dynamics framework to synthesize data. In 2014, the population of 1.3 million were served by a pluralistic eyecare system, which had achieved 14 out of 27 Strategic Framework indicators. The Government provided free primary, secondary and emergency eyecare services, through 108 health centres and 5 hospitals (0.26 ophthalmologists and 1.32 ophthalmologists-in-training per 50‚Äâ000 population). Private sector optometrists (4.37 per 50‚Äâ000 population), and ophthalmologists (0.93 per 50‚Äâ000 population) provided 80% of all eyecare. Only 19.3% of the adult population had private health insurance, revealing significant out-of-pocket expenditure. We identified potential weaknesses in the eyecare system where investment might reduce avoidable blindness. These included a need for more ophthalmic equipment and maintenance in the public sector, national screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity and neonatal eye defects, and pathways to ensure timely and equitable access to subspecialized surgery. Eyecare for older adults was responsible for an estimated 9.5% (US$22.6 million) of annual health expenditure.

Nevertheless, an increase in the use of routine eye-care services and a decrease in medical eye-care services were observed following program implementation. The overall cost of providing eye-care services to patients decreased from 1.86 dollars to 1.36 dollars per member per month after the program started, largely owing to a reduction in spending associated with medical eye-care services.

The clinical importance of this complication is, consequently, controversial. This review examines the literature with the specific goal of identifying the most important ophthalmologic issues facing the hepatologist prescribing antiviral therapy. Accordingly, it assesses the incidence of interferon-associated retinopathy, as well as its risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and options for management using data from the observational studies. The likely benefit of a screening program, especially one targeting patients with the highest risk of developing interferon-associated retinopathy, is analysed. Atypical ophthalmologic adverse events occur less frequently than interferon-associated retinopathy during antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection. They often, however, lead to irreversible vision loss. We examine the reports of these adverse events - in individual case reports or case series and in the observational studies investigating interferon-associated retinopathy - to describe the spectrum of these adverse events, the likely outcome for patients and to highlight the most important areas of future clinical research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24363513/"}

The data show that primary care patients (seen by family/general physicians, internists, and pediatricians) with eye complaints constitute 2% of all patient visits and are predominantly for minor inflammatory (58%), traumatic conditions and foreign bodies (8.4%), visual disturbances (15.5%), and eyelid problems (3.9%). Conjunctivitis and corneal abrasion accounted for 54.4% of these diagnoses. Patients see ophthalmologists predominantly for vision problems (35.5%), eye exams (24.1%), and inflammatory conditions (24%). Refractive errors, cataracts, and glaucoma constituted 52.7% of ophthalmologist diagnoses. This study provides significant implications for curricular development. Medical schools, primary care residencies, and continuing medical education settings for primary care should emphasize in-depth knowledge of minor ocular inflammatory conditions, eye trauma, visual disturbances, and eyelid problems, as these areas encompass more than 85% of the eye problems seen by primary care physicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1936738/"}

We audited retrospectively surveillance for ocular disorders before and after the DSMIG-based guidelines were locally adopted in 1995. Results were compared for children born before and after the implementation of screening guidelines. A total of 81 children (43 females, 38 males) with Down syndrome were identified. After the DSMIG protocol, 34/36 children received a full ophthalmological examination in the neonatal period, compared with 9/27 children before 1995 (p<0.001). Neonatal screening resulted in the detection of cataracts in three infants. Mean age of first comprehensive ophthalmic screening outside the neonatal period was similar in the two groups (1y 6mo before guidelines vs 1y 9mo after), as were the proportion of children receiving preschool eye checks (27/30 before; 17/18 after). Overall, 65.7% children were screened in accordance with the guidelines, improving to 100% in recent years. At school age, 43% of the study population had significant refractive errors, with 27% having hypermetropia and astigmatism. Earlier prescription of glasses for refractive errors was seen (mean age 5y 6mo before guidelines; 3y 6mo after; p<0.001). Prevalence of other ocular disorders included strabismus (34/72, 47%), nasolacrimal duct obstruction (26/73, 35.6%), cataracts (5/64, 7.8%), and nystagmus (12/72, 16%).

This study evaluated the utility of these in providing specialist care to rural patients during the pandemic. Data from patients referred during the COVID-19 lock-down period (23 March 2020 to 5 June 2020) were analysed. If sufficient clinical information and imaging were available then ophthalmologists conducted home-based telephone consultations. If further ocular imaging or examination was required, then optometry-based video or hospital-based video were used. Data were analysed using ANOVA and two-sided t tests for continuous data and Chi Square statistics for categorical data (<i>p</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Majority of the 431 consultations were conducted via home telephone (38%) or optometry-based video (37%).

The ocular immune system has long been considered distinct, owing to the so-called 'immune privilege' of its component tissues. More recently, intravital imaging and transcriptomic techniques have reshaped scientific understanding of the ocular immune landscape, such as revealing the specialization of immune cell populations in the various tissues of the eye. As knowledge of the phenotypes of corneal and retinal immune cells has evolved, links to both the systemic immune system, and the central and peripheral nervous systems, have been identified. Using intravital imaging, T cells have recently been found to reside in, and actively patrol, the healthy human cornea. Disease-associated retinal microglia with links to retinal degeneration have also been identified. This Review provides an updated guide to the ocular immune system, highlighting current knowledge of the immune cells that are present in steady-state and specific diseased ocular tissues, as well as evidence for their relationship to systemic disease.

Our review shows that there is no compelling evidence to support the view that microsaccades (or, fixation saccades more generally) serve a necessary role in improving oculomotor control or in keeping the visual world visible. The role of the retinal transients produced by small saccades during fixation needs to be evaluated in the context of both the brisk image motions present during active visual tasks performed by freely moving people, as well as the role of selective attention in modulating the strength of signals throughout the visual field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19146321/"}

Different strategies are developed in parallel to reduce required light levels and improve information processing by targeting various cell types. For patients with vision loss due to optic atrophy, as in the case of glaucoma, optogenetic cortical stimulation is hampered by light absorption and scattering by the brain tissue. By contrast, ultrasound waves can diffuse widely through the dura mater and the brain tissue as indicated by ultrasound imaging. Based on our recent results in rodents, we propose the sonogenetic therapy relying on activation of the mechanosensitive channel as a very promising vision restoration strategy with a suitable spatiotemporal resolution.

These factors are difficult to measure during routine ophthalmic examination but can be assessed during questionnaires on quality of life. MARKERS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN OPHTHALMOLOGY: Various quality of life questionnaires have been developed in ophthalmology because the non-specific generic instruments appear inadequate. The SF 36 and SF 20 scales, which are generic instruments widely used in many fields, do not adequately explore the problems related to vision. The first efficient instrument is the VF 14, which is a questionnaire specific to ophthalmic diseases, developed by C. Mangione in 1992. This self-administered questionnaire permits calculation of a 0 to 100 score exploring 5 dimensions (long-sight acuity, near-sight acuity, unclear sight, and driving during the day and at night) during 14 activities with 18 questions. It was translated and adapted into French by Gresset in 1997. Today it is the most commonly used questionnaire in ophthalmology, particularly in the assessment of efficacy and impact in surgery. Along the other specific questionnaires developed, there is the NEI-VQF which was created in 1995 to assess vision and the impact of visual problems on the quality of life of patients, independently of an ophthalmic pathology. Many studies have been conducted on various diseases that affect vision, such as diabetes or hypertension. THE LIMITS OF EXISTING INSTRUMENTS: The specific scales appear far more sensitive and specific than generic scales with regard to ophthalmic problems, but they provide less information on the general status of the patient, except for the NEI-VQF. They are limited in some parameters and do not, unfortunately, take into account the patient's age. No specific scale has been developed for children or adolescents, although the impact of vision on daily life is fundamental. The complexity of vision means that the elaboration of an ideal instrument is difficult. However, in the meantime, it is essential that the practitioners continue to use and to test the instruments available in order to improve with regard to pathologies, or in particular sub-groups of the population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12426979/"}

The visual functions, acuity, peak letter contrast sensitivity, visual field extent, glare disability, color confusion, motion sensitivity, spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity, scanning ability, and figure-ground discrimination were measured to determine their ability to predict mobility performance of visually impaired adults on indoor hallway and outdoor residential travel routes under photopic and mesopic lighting conditions. Time to complete routes and number of mobility incidents were significantly increased under mesopic conditions. Depending on the task, lighting conditions, and performance measure, predictive models consisting of 4 vision variables were able to account for 30 to 42% of the variance in overall performance. The two most important variables in these models were visual field extent and scanning ability, followed by color confusion, grating contrast sensitivity, or spatial resolution. Reducing illumination levels from photopic to mesopic has an adverse effect upon mobility in older visually impaired adults. The aspects of vision which best predict performance include measures of sensory and perceptual visual function. The results compare well with those obtained under controlled laboratory conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9703043/"}

Residual visual functions and functional vision after macular vision loss are mostly defined by 3 major components: scotoma characteristics, preferred retinal loci (PRLs) and oculomotor control. Microperimetry may be proven superior as a method to standard automated perimetry (SAP) for residual visual function assessment. During microperimetry stimuli are projected directly on the retina with accurate test-retest of the same retinal point monitored by eye tracking technology. Microperimeters offer also abilities to determine accurately the location of a PRL. Recent research reveals also that fixation stability estimates in low vision cases are reliable predictors of visual acuity estimates. Fixation stability estimates provided automatically by the microperimeters are based on proprietary algorithms and provide reasonable estimates very close to BCEA values calculated from raw data. More and more microperimeters are used in clinical retina practice to assess more accurately the impact of diseases or of interventions on the retina. Microperimeters are also in use more often in glaucoma practices and it seems evident that the main usage for microperimeters is destined to monitor glaucoma damaged residual visual functions and functional vision. In addition identification of eccentric location of PRLs and fixation stability estimates at the PRL in low vision patients offers the LVR practitioner the option to use the best residual visual function available for rehabilitation. For mainstream ophthalmology many indicators point to the fact that microperimeters may take the lead role played by SAP in the last decades. For vision rehabilitation practitioners the advent of multiple choices for microperimetry portends the introduction of modern rehabilitation concepts in most clinical practices. Both developments seem to happen sooner, rather than later as expected by most.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24093179/"}

Measures of temporal sensitivity or delay were made: S- and L-cone temporal acuity (critical flicker fusion, or CFF), S-cone temporal contrast sensitivity, and S-cone delay. ESCS observers showed uniform enhancements of S-cone CFF of between 0.85 and 6.25 Hz, but reductions in L-cone CFF. They also showed higher S-cone temporal contrast sensitivities at medium and high S-cone adaptation levels, with sensitivity functions that peaked near 7.5 Hz but fell off at lower and higher frequencies. In contrast, the mean normal function was flat at low frequencies and fell off only at high frequencies. The S-cone signal, as in the normal, is subject to large phase delays. We interpret the enhancements in CFF as increases in S-cone number in ESCS of between 1.39 and 11.32 times normal density (with a mean of 3.48). The peaked ESCS contrast-sensitivity functions are consistent with S-cone signal interactions that increase sensitivity at intermediate frequencies through constructive interference but decrease it at lower and higher frequencies through destructive interference. Measurements of S-cone delays relative to L- and M-cone signals show that the predominant S-cone signals in ESCS are negative and delayed as in normal observers, but reveal another faster, positive S-cone signal. This signal is also likely to be the cause of constructive and destructive interference in the contrast-sensitivity data of ESCS observers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24425859/"}

Implementation and sustainability of TECS from 2015 to 2022 were examined along with the sociodemographic characteristics of veterans served through TECS in¬†2021. Veteran patients seen in TECS nationwide. Characteristics, disease prevalence and diagnoses, implementation success rate, sustainability rate, and preliminary analysis of outcomes and disparity. Per quarter from 2015 to 2022, TECS sites were classified as implementing, active, or sustained. Standard query language was used to determine sociodemographic data, and logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with VT eye diagnosis. A total of 21 712 Veterans, 52.1% rural or highly rural, were served by TECS in 2021. The average age was 64.7 years, with women comprising 10.9% of the population served. From 2015 to 2022, of the 67 TECS sites initiated, 6 were implementing with 51 of 61 initiated sites still operational in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022 (83.6% success rate). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts were more prevalent in rural and highly rural populations (7.6% and 11.3%, and 48.8% and 55.0%, respectively) versus urban populations (5.8% and 47.8%); glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (DR) had the opposite association. The prevalence of any type of VT eye disease was lowest in the Mountains/Central region (0.54%) and highest in the Southeast region (3.2%) of the United States. Rural and highly rural residents were 1.3 and 2.5 times as likely, respectively, to be diagnosed with a VT eye disease than urban residents. Implementation and sustainability of TECS have been promising. The data provide key information that can be used to improve the deployment of TECS and similar programs, along with the possible future direction of TECS. Moreover, experience from one national ocular telehealth program clearly illustrates that telemedicine can address eye care disparities in the Veteran population and may be used for other vulnerable groups as well.

An ophthalmologist examined the anterior and posterior segment and took fundus pictures. Two hundred sixty eight priests and novices were examined. Their age ranged between 12 and 88 years with a mean of 48.5 years. Most priests and novices had normal vision (20/20-20/40 - 67.54%). No priest and novices had bilateral blindness. Almost half (48.13%) had eyeglasses and 2.24% had bilateral low vision. Unilateral low vision and unilateral blindness were 3.73% and 3.36%. One eye blindness and one eye low vision was only 0.37%. Refractive error was the leading cause of visual impairment (22.39%), followed by cataract (17.54%), glaucoma (5.97%), vitreo-retinal diseases (1.49%), and glaucoma suspected (occludable angle and ocular hypertension) (3.35%). Fifty five priests (20.52%) were referred for further investigation and treatment. Because the mean age of the priests and novices in this survey was only 48.5 years, the prevalence of visual impairment was low. Most of the cases were avoidable or preventable.

Though individual effects are highly variable, most recipients report improved vision in everyday life. To describe such effects, visual navigation tests are now frequently used in clinical trials. However, it is still unclear how their results should be interpreted compared to conventional parameters of visual function. Seven LCA patients underwent a multi-luminance visual navigation test (Ora-VNCTM) before and 3 months after receiving Luxturna gene therapy. Their performance was rated based on the luminance level at which they passed the course. Differences between the first and second test were correlated to changes in visual acuity, full-field stimulus thresholds, chromatic pupil campimetry, and dark-adapted perimetry. A few patients displayed notable improvements in conventional measures of visual function whereas patients with advanced retinal degeneration showed no relevant changes. Independent of these results, almost all participants improved in the visual navigation task by one or more levels. The improvement in the mobility test was best correlated to the change in full-field stimulus thresholds. Other measures of visual functions showed no clear correlation with visual navigation. In patients who passed the test's more difficult levels, improved visual navigation can be attributed to the reactivation of rods. However, the performance of patients with low vision seemed to depend much more on confounding factors in the easier levels. In sum, such tests might only be meaningful for patients with better preserved visual functions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37768368/"}

However, there is limited research assessing the diagnostic accuracy of face-to-face teleophthalmology consultation. This systematic review aims to determine if real-time teleophthalmology provides comparable accuracy to face-to-face consultation for the diagnosis of common eye health conditions. Methods A search of PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane databases and manual citation review was conducted on 6 February and 7 April 2016. Included studies involved real-time telemedicine in the field of ophthalmology or optometry, and assessed diagnostic accuracy against gold-standard face-to-face consultation. The revised quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool assessed risk of bias. Results Twelve studies were included, with participants ranging from four to 89 years old. A broad number of conditions were assessed and include corneal and retinal pathologies, strabismus, oculoplastics and post-operative review. Quality assessment identified a high or unclear risk of bias in patient selection (75%) due to an undisclosed recruitment processes. The index test showed high risk of bias in the included studies, due to the varied interpretation and conduct of real-time teleophthalmology methods. Reference standard risk was overall low (75%), as was the risk due to flow and timing (75%). Conclusion In terms of diagnostic accuracy, real-time teleophthalmology was considered superior to face-to-face consultation in one study and comparable in six studies.

Controlling the elongated eye axis is a key factor in preventing the complications of pathological myopia. Posterior scleral reinforcement is the main surgical method to delay the elongation of the eye axis and treat the posterior scleral staphyloma. Although most studies have confirmed that posterior scleral reinforcement is effective in delaying axial elongation and treating myopia, some scholars hold negative views on this surgery.

The effect of changes in the light/dark cycle on myopia development has been studied only in the avian eye, mainly that of the domestic fowl. In the eyes of chicks reared from hatching to maturity under continuous illumination, the following findings were reported: myopia, astigmatism, increases in axial length and equatorial width, shallow anterior chamber, increase in corneal diameter, reduction of corneal curvature, increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP), low outflow facility, reduction in aqueous space, buphthalmos, macrophthalmos and glaucoma. The above mentioned changes were consistent in the majority of the studies. In a few experiments where a change in one of the above mentioned parameters was not found, no tendency for the opposite condition was reported. When the illumination level of the visual environment was changed in the avian eye there was an increase in the total size of the eye as well as exophthalmos. Other parameters were not examined. It is quite possible that myopia and eye enlargement in avians are caused by entirely different processes than myopia and eye enlargement in mammals since they can be induced either by changes in the diurnal rhythm or by low intensity light. The involvement of the pineal gland in the control of eye growth in avians is therefore possible. The effect of continuous dark rearing was studied in the avian and in the mammalian eye. In developing chicks reared in continuous darkness some enlargement of the eye took place, but a condition of hyperopia was found as opposed to the expected myopia. This result is in agreement with the results of experiments performed on monkeys and cats reared from infancy to adulthood in complete darkness. The effect of near vision conditions during growth was studied in monkeys, cats and chicks confined to small chambers, cages or rooms. A slight myopia was usually obtained in all of the above species but the incidence of myopia increased consistently in the experimental animals compared to the normal controls. The effect of optically restricting the visual field during growth was studied in chicks. Using special occluders, the eyes of the chicks were exposed only to the frontal fields of vision. This manipulation induced a considerably high myopia and an increase in the axial length of the eye and in the depth of the anterior chamber. Removal of the occluders resulted in a reversal of the induced myopia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6713963/"}

Increasing evidence indicates that homeostatic plasticity (i.e., the drive of a neural system to stabilize its function) can, in principle, preserve retinal function in the face of major perturbations, including neurodegeneration. Here, we review the circumstances and events that trigger homeostatic plasticity in the retina during development, sensory experience, and disease. We discuss the diverse mechanisms that cooperate to compensate and the set points and outcomes that homeostatic retinal plasticity stabilizes. Finally, we summarize the opportunities and challenges for unlocking the therapeutic potential of homeostatic plasticity.

Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas, USA. A retrospective chart review of all patients who had cataract extraction complicated by vitreous loss from 1997 through 1999 was conducted. All surgery was performed by third-year ophthalmology residents. In 1400 cataract surgeries, 63 cases of vitreous loss (rate 4.5%) were identified. One case had less than 1 month of follow-up and was excluded from further analysis. Of the 62 remaining cases, 53 had phacoemulsification, 7 extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), 1 phacoemulsification converted to ECCE, and 1 intracapsular cataract extraction. Thirty-two eyes had a sulcus-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) implanted, 20 an anterior chamber IOL, and 7 a PC IOL in the capsular bag; 3 eyes were left aphakic at the time of initial surgery. Overall, 77% of patients had a postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or better. Of the 14 patients who did not have a BCVA of 20/40 or better, 9 had preexisting ocular pathology affecting vision. If these 9 patients are excluded, 91% of patients with vitreous loss had a BCVA of 20/40 or better. Six patients (10%) developed clinical cystoid macular edema. No patient with vitreous loss developed a retinal detachment or endophthalmitis. Good visual acuity can be achieved after resident cataract surgery complicated by vitreous loss.

The dark-adapted (DA) ERGs were performed to a series of white flashes (range 0.006-30.0¬†cd¬†s¬†m<sup>-2</sup>) and two red flashes. The DA ERGs to higher stimulus intensities (3.0, 10.0 and 30.0¬†cd¬†s¬†m<sup>-2</sup>) were tested using a range of inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) of up to 60¬†s.

The review deals with the question of the transmission of electrical changes in visual path voltage under physiological and pathological conditions. In particular, it points to feedback autoregulatory damage not only of primarily altered cellular structures, but of all other, both horizontally and vertically localized. Based on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological methods, it shows the pathology of the entire visual pathway in three eye diseases: retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. The thesis also provides an overview of possible systems that are used to replace lost vision, from epiretinal, subretinal, suprachoroidal implants, through stimulation of the optic nerve, corpus geniculatum laterale to the visual cortex.

Eye-related words and phrases (n-grams) occurring in English books at a frequency of 0.00001% for at least 25 years between 1790 and 2008 were identified from the Google n-gram database by searching for 254 strings such as eye or ophth. The first known English use of these n-grams was identified from historical articles and from multiple digital resources. Eye color was not commonly described as brown or green before 1840. Many common bigrams, such as bright eyes, suggested light emanating from the eyes, consistent with the extramission theory of vision. Based on word frequency, the impact of the revolutionary 1850 ophthalmoscope exceeded that of the stethoscope for 60 years. Glaucoma was not commonly written until the ophthalmoscope permitted visualization of the characteristic optic neuropathy. Green spectacles gave way during the early 1900s to dark glasses, subsequently renamed sunglasses. Until the mid-1900s, an eye surgeon was more often described as an oculist than an ophthalmologist, and inflamed eyes were said to experience ophthalmia more often than uveitis. Macular degeneration was rarely written about for more than a century after 1850 because it was labeled choroiditis. Of the 135 n-grams in the dictionary, an earlier written instance was identified in 92 cases (68%).

Genetic eye disorders in pediatric patients often lead to severe visual impairments. Therefore, a challenge of gene therapy is to provide better vision to these affected children. In recent years, inherited retinal diseases, inherited optic neuropathies, and corneal dystrophies have dominated discussions to establish gene and cell replacement therapies for these diseases. Gene therapy involves the transfer of genetic material to remove, replace, repair, or introduce a gene, or to overexpress a protein, whose activity would have a therapeutic impact. For the majority of anterior segment diseases, these studies are still emerging at a preclinical stage; however, for inherited retinal disorders, translation has been reached, leading to the introduction of the first gene therapies into clinical practice. In the past decade, the first gene therapy for biallelic RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy has been developed and the FDA and EMA both approved ocular gene therapy. Other promising approaches by intravitreal injection have been investigated such as in CEP290-Leber congenital amaurosis. Various techniques of gene therapies include gene supplementation, CRISPR-based genome editing, as well as RNA modulation and optogenetics. Optogenetic therapies deliver light-activated ion channels to surviving retinal cell types in order to restore photosensitivity. Beyond retinal function, ataluren, a nonsense mutation suppression therapy, enables ribosomal read-through of mRNA containing premature termination codons, resulting in the production of a full-length protein. An ophthalmic formulation was recently evaluated with the aim of repairing corneal damage, pending new clinical studies. However, various congenital disorders exhibit severe developmental defects or cell loss at birth, limiting the potential for viral gene therapy. Therefore mutation-independent strategies seem promising for maintaining the survival of photoreceptors or for restoring visual function. Restoring vision in children with gene therapy continues to be a challenge in ophthalmology. ¬© 2023 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of French Society of Pediatrics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043982/"}

A psychophysical procedure was used for measuring reading speed that has proven reliable and sensitive to visual factors in previous research. Data were collected for character sizes ranging from .15 degrees to 12 degrees. Research revealed that old subjects who were free of eye disease read as fast as the young subjects for character sizes ranging from .3 degrees to 1.0 degrees. This is the range in which reading speed is maximum for young subjects. Research also revealed that old subjects showed a deficit when reading text composed of very small or very large characters. Their speeds dropped to about 70% of the young adult speeds. These deficits may be due to age-related losses in visual contrast sensitivity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1940088/"}

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current applications and future potential of AI in ophthalmology. AI algorithms, particularly those utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have demonstrated remarkable success in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma with precision comparable to, or exceeding, human experts. Furthermore, AI is being utilized to develop personalized treatment plans by analyzing large datasets to predict individual responses to therapies, thus optimizing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. In surgical applications, AI-driven tools are enhancing the precision of procedures like cataract surgery, contributing to better recovery times and reduced complications. Additionally, AI-powered teleophthalmology services are expanding access to eye care in underserved and remote areas, addressing global disparities in healthcare availability. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and algorithmic bias. Ensuring robust data governance and ethical practices is crucial for the continued success of AI integration in ophthalmology. In conclusion, future research should focus on developing sophisticated AI models capable of handling multimodal data, including genetic information and patient histories, to provide deeper insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Also, collaborative efforts among governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and technology companies are essential to deploy AI solutions effectively, especially in low-resource settings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40142244/"}

We used real-time eye tracking to ensure gaze-contingent display and examined visual crowding in patients with horizontal concomitant strabismus (both esotropia and exotropia) but without amblyopia and age-matched normal controls. Nineteen patients with exotropia (12 men, mean ¬± SD = 22.89 ¬± 7.82 years), 21 patients with esotropia (10 men, mean ¬± SD = 23.48 ¬± 6.95 years), and 14 age-matched normal controls (7 men, mean ¬± SD = 23.07 ¬± 1.07 years) participated in this study. We found that patients with strabismus without amblyopia showed significantly larger critical spacing with nasotemporal asymmetry in only the radial axis that related to the strabismus pattern, with exotropia exhibiting stronger temporal hemifield crowding and esotropia exhibiting stronger nasal hemifield crowding, in both the deviated and fixating eyes. Moreover, the magnitude of crowding change was related to the duration and degree of strabismic deviation. Using visual crowding as a psychophysical index of cortical organization, our study demonstrated significantly greater peripheral visual crowding with nasotemporal asymmetry in only the radial axis in patients with strabismus without amblyopia, indicating the existence of hemifield- and axis-specific miswiring of cortical processing in object recognition induced by long-term adaptation to ocular misalignment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652265/"}

The increase in life expectancy of SCD patients in recent years has led to the emergence of more complications of the disease, e.g. ocular, which in the past were uncommon. This review describes current knowledge of the ocular manifestations of patients with SCD. SCD can affect virtually every vascular bed in the eye and can cause blindness in the advanced stages. The most significant ocular changes are those which occur in the fundus, which can be grouped into proliferative sickle retinopathy, and non-proliferative retinal changes based on the presence of vascular proliferation. This distinction is important because the formation of new vessels is the single most important precursor of potentially blinding complications. Although various systemic complications of SCD are known to be more common in patients with the Hb SS genotype, visual impairment secondary to proliferative sickle retinopathy is more common in patients with the Hb SC genotype. There is also an increase with age in the incidence and prevalence rates of all ocular complications of SCD. It is therefore recommended that all patients with SCD undergo periodic ophthalmological screening from the age of 10 years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20196930/"}

Posterior uveitis in particular, which may manifest as insidious, painless vision loss, may first be identified by a careful review of systems by a dermatologist. Understanding uveitis and its associations with certain skin findings and drugs will help enable identification and triage of patients in need of ophthalmic care. An overview of uveitis is provided, including its epidemiology, etiologies, classification, presenting signs and symptoms, general management, and complications. Next, dermatologic diseases that may be associated with uveitis are reviewed with a focus on how uveitis is most likely to present. Lastly, drugs used by dermatologists and less common dermatologic diseases associated with uveitis are reviewed. Multidisciplinary management is necessary for patients with both skin disease and ocular complications such as uveitis.

There is evidence that a review of patient harm related to eye care and the associated patient safety incidents is needed. We aimed to characterise patient safety incidents involving eye care by: identifying the most frequently reported incidents involving clinical care; and characterising the nature of incidents leading to severe vision loss. The data comprised patient safety incidents reported between 2018 and 2022 to the National Reporting and Learning System and the NHS England Learn from Patient Safety Events system. Reports were searched for eye-related terms (ICD-11) and those reports relating to implementation of care and clinical assessment were included. A descriptive analysis was undertaken to characterise the most frequent incident types and their contributory factors, followed by a thematic analysis of incidents relating to severe vision loss. Of the 836 reports identified, insufficient care (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ416) and delayed diagnosis (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ234) featured most. Patient harm occurred related to vision loss (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ449), delays in treatment (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ182), and disease progression (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ121). Among 220 reports that resulted in severe vision loss, patients with Glaucoma and Age-related Macular Degeneration were impacted by delays in monitoring and management, loss to follow-up, disease progression due to insufficient care and system failures. In this characterisation of eye-related incident reports in a national population, potential areas of interest toward safer eye care include addressing delays in patients receiving care and insufficient care such as inconsistent monitoring in glaucoma.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39948402/"}

This is based on the assumption that influential research is widely cited by other scientists and clinicians. With the advent of the Internet, Journal Citation Reports from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI-JCR) have become widely available to individuals and institutions. In an increasingly competitive research environ-ment, aspects of citation analysis have been suggested as simple proxy, objective measures to evaluate the research quality of a journal, published articles, research institutions and even individual researchers. This review article provides an overview of citation analysis, including definitions, uses of these reports, and related controversies and potential abuses. As it has become the most commonly used indicator, there is a particular focus on the use of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). This is a widely quoted measure indicating the frequency with which the average article published in a journal of interest will be quoted within a specified time frame that therefore allows approximate comparisons of journals within a particular field of interest. Given the relative paucity of information in this area, emphasis is placed on citation analysis within ophthalmology, in particular in regard to the 43 ophthal-mology, vision science and optometry journals that are listed in the ISI-JCR 2001 reports.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12580889/"}

A secondary aim was to evaluate the association of utility indices with demographic profile and waiting time. Consecutive patients that had been waiting for ophthalmology care answered the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The questionnaire was administered when patients arrived at the clinics for their first visit. We derived a utility index (VFQ-UI) from the patients' responses, then calculated the correlation between this index and waiting time and compared utility across demographic subgroups stratified by age, sex, and care setting. 536 individuals participated in the study (mean age 52.9¬±16.6 years; 370 women, 69% women). The median utility index was 0.85 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.70-0.92; minimum 0.40, maximum 0.97). The mean VFQ-25 score was 70.88¬±14.59. Utility correlated weakly and nonsignificantly with waiting time (-0.05, P = 0.24). It did not vary across age groups (P = 0.85) or care settings (P = 0.77). Utility was significantly lower for women (0.84, IQR 0.70-0.92) than men (0.87, IQR 0.73-0.93, P = 0.03), but the magnitude of this difference was small (Cohen's d = 0.13).

The temporal MTF of controls showed \"band-pass\" filter properties, having a peak sensitivity at about 15 Hz at 1,000 trolands of mean retinal illuminance. As the retinal illuminance was reduced, the sensitivity decreased, first at high temporal frequencies, then the peak sensitivity decreased. Finally at low temporal frequencies the sensitivity decreased and the peak shifted toward the lower frequency. In retinal diseases, abnormal temporal MTF was detected, and the curves were very similar to those of normal controls when retinal illuminance was reduced. These patterns were not specific to any retinal diseases, and the severity of the condition seemed to determine the pattern. In optic neuritis, an attenuated sensitivity was detected in all frequency ranges; however, the degree of attenuation was more severe than that found in retinal diseases even when the visual acuity was similar. At the convalescent stage, the low frequency sensitivity was restored first, and high frequency loss was observed even when the visual acuity was recovered to 1.0. Two amblyopic patients showed an attenuated sensitivity in the high and intermediate frequency ranges, and in one case sensitivity was attenuated in all frequencies. Three other patients showed normal sensitivity. By occlusion of the nonamblyopic eye, recovery of the sensitivity was observed in one patient whose visual acuity improved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6748365/"}

More recently, however, extrasteroidal mechanisms, through which ACTH exerts anti-inflammatory processes, have been described. This has renewed hope that ACTH can combat inflammatory conditions even when resistant to steroids. This review article summarizes the literature on the use of ACTH in ocular disease. Unfortunately, much of the data regarding the clinical utility of ACTH are outdated, with many studies published in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of these older studies are inconsistent or incomplete with their reporting, making it difficult to ascertain the meaning of the outcomes. Despite the limitations, 2 important trends are evident. First, when used to treat an inflammatory disease, ACTH can be effective at decreasing or eliminating ocular inflammation, even in a refractory disease resistant to multiple treatment modalities. Second, adverse effects of ACTH are rare and are most likely to be reported with relatively high doses of ACTH therapy. Taken as a whole, these studies offer initial promising data that ACTH may be a safe and effective alternative in refractory ocular inflammatory disease. However, they highlight an important lack of prospective data to more rigorously understand the true safety and efficacy of this therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762596/"}

This systematic review focuses on the applications of OCE in the anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, iris, and crystalline lens, and its clinical relevance in diagnosing and managing ocular diseases. A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA framework to identify studies published between 2014 and 2024. The review included studies that reported intrinsic biomechanical properties of anterior segment tissues measured using OCE. Databases searched included Scopus, Pub Med, and IEEE Xplore. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. The review found that OCE has been used to measure intrinsic biomechanical parameters such as Young's modulus and shear modulus in ocular tissues. OCE has been utilised to assess corneal stiffness in keratoconus, lens elasticity in presbyopia and cataract formation, and iris biomechanical changes under different lighting conditions. The studies demonstrated that OCE could detect subtle biomechanical changes associated with ocular diseases and measure treatment efficacy, such as collagen crosslinking for keratoconus management. The findings highlight the potential of OCE to enhance clinical diagnostics and patient care by providing detailed insights into the biomechanical properties of ocular tissues. However, variability in measurement techniques, the complexity of the method and reliance on animal models limit the current clinical translation of OCE. Standardised measurement protocols and further development and<i>in vivo</i>validation are needed to overcome these barriers. OCE shows promise as a valuable non-invasive tool for high-resolution assessments of tissue biomechanics, which can subsequently support the diagnosis and management of ocular diseases. Future research should focus on standardising OCE methods and integrating them into clinical practice to fully realise their potential in improving patient outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40328290/"}

Thus, it is hard to predict in which patient the eyes will be involved and what the outcome will be. In this study we assessed various risk factors for eye involvement and attempted to predict the visual outcome in our patient population in Turkey. Data from a total of 224 patients with BD, diagnosed between 1982 and 1996, were analyzed retrospectively. A detailed physical examination and ophthalmologic work up were performed on each patient. Factors that might contribute to eye involvement were investigated, after which prognostic factors for vision were evaluated. Eighty-eight patients had eye involvement during a median follow-up of 32 months. The risk of involvement was highest within the first year of diagnosis. Young age was the most significant factor for eye involvement (P < 0.0001), but vascular thrombosis, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and male gender were other risk factors (P < 0.001; P < 0.01; and P < 0.05, respectively). The most important determinant for the prognosis of vision was CNS involvement (P < 0.0001). Vascular thrombosis and an age of < or = 32 were other risk factors for visual impairment (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). The risk of eye involvement and prognosis for vision were similar with different treatment regimens (P > 0.05). It is suggested that the first 2 years after diagnosis is the most critical period for eye involvement, and conventional forms of therapy generally are unsuccessful in preventing such involvement. It seems reasonable to treat patients who are at increased risk for eye involvement more aggressively, especially within the first 2 years of disease onset.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9111266/"}

In summary, this chapter confirms-and offers opportunities for future research into-the contribution of vision and attention to safe driving.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33832685/"}

Almost all the latter physicians were general ophthalmologists. The decision to treat macular edema was highly dependent on the quality of the patient's vision. The percentage who \"usually\" or \"almost always\" recommend laser treatment for macular edema was 24% when the patient's vision was excellent, 63% when vision was mildly compromised, but 73% when vision was significantly compromised.

The instrument allowed the observation of light reflected at the fundus. The development of this device was one of the major advancements in ophthalmology. Yet ophthalmoscopy allows only qualitative observation of the eye. Since 1950 attempts were made to address the challenging, quantitative assessment of the amount of light reflected by the fundus. At first, only comparative measurements were possible, applied in the study of macular and visual pigments. With improvements in light detecting techniques, and with the advent of microprocessors, the measurement of spectral and spatial distribution of the reflectance became feasible. This led to the development of models that explained the observed wavelength dependence and the directional behavior of light reflected from the fovea. The models allowed a quantitative assessment of many parameters on absorption and reflection by structures in the human eye. This paper provides a review of both the experimental and theoretical progress, and summarizes the results of fundamental and clinical research using fundus reflectometry.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12604057/"}

If prolonged lifespan is selected for in humans, physiological aging, including reproductive and somatic senescence, might be different for Pan and Homo. But it seems that the parameters of reproductive senescence, such as the age of having their final offspring and the number of years between generations, are not very different between chimpanzee and human females [4].

This transformation triggers cascades of events, i.e., activation of transducin and cGMP photodiesterase, decrease of cGMP, closure of cGMP-gated channels, and generation of active potential. Activated rhodopsin is then inactivated and uncouples all-trans-retinal, which is metabolized to all-trans-retinol and transferred to the retinal pigment epithelium, where it is re-isomerzed to form 11-cis-retinal. The 11-cis-retinal returns to the photoreceptor outer segments and regenerates rhodopsin. Many of the players in these two pathways are also essential for survival and maintenance of photoreceptors.

However, the limited output formats of these methods lead to poor human-computer interaction and low clinical applicability value. Thus, ophthalmic visual question answering is worth studying. Unfortunately, no practical solutions exist before Large Language Models(LLMs). In this paper, we investigate the ophthalmic visual diagnostic interaction problem. We construct an ophthalmology large language-and-vision assistant, OphGLM, consisting of an image encoder, a text encoder, a fusion module, and an LLM module. We establish a new Chinese ophthalmic fine-tuning dataset, FundusTuning-CN, including the fundus instruction and conversation sets. Based on FundusTuning-CN, we establish a novel LLM-tuning strategy to introduce visual model understanding and ophthalmic knowledge into LLMs at a low cost and high efficiency. Leveraging the pre-training of the image encoder, OphGLM demonstrates strong visual understanding and surpasses open-source visual language models in common fundus disease classification tasks. The FundusTuning-CN enables OphGLM to surpass open-source medical LLMs in both ophthalmic knowledge and interactive capabilities. Our proposed OphGLM has the potential to revolutionize clinical applications in ophthalmology.

Steroids and/or laser photocoagulation and/or surgery have been tried for almost every condition with little or no understanding of the underlying disease. Over the past several years vision researchers have uncovered molecular components of processes, such as visual transduction and the visual cycle, that are critical for visual function, and identified other molecules that lead to dysfunction and disease processes such as neovascularization and macular edema. It is becoming clear that dysregulation of certain molecules can have major effects on retinal structure and function. Studies in animal models have suggested that inhibiting or augmenting levels of a single molecule can have major effects in complex disease processes. Although several molecules probably contribute to neovascularization and excessive vascular permeability in the eye, blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has remarkable beneficial effects in animal models that have now been proven to apply to human diseases in clinical trials. Intraocular injection of VEGF antagonists has revolutionized the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and macular edema and serves as a model of targeted ocular pharmacotherapy. Significant progress elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of several disease processes in the eye may soon lead to new treatments following the lead of VEGF antagonists. Initial treatments that provide benefit from frequent intraocular injections are likely to be followed by sustained delivery of drugs and/or prolonged protein delivery by gene transfer.

Patients were recruited at the Kellogg Eye Center from October 1, 2015, to January 31, 2016. Patients were eligible to be included in the study if they were 18 years or older. Concordance of symptoms reported on an ESQ with data recorded in the EMR. Agreement of symptom report was analyzed using Œ∫ statistics and McNemar tests. Disagreement was defined as a negative symptom report or no mention of a symptom in the EMR for patients who reported moderate to severe symptoms on the ESQ. Logistic regression was used to investigate if patient factors, physician characteristics, or diagnoses were associated with the probability of disagreement for symptoms of blurry vision, pain or discomfort, and redness. A total of 162 patients (324 eyes) were included. The mean (SD) age of participants was 56.6 (19.4) years, 62.3% (101 of 162) were female, and 84.9% (135 of 159) were white. At the participant level, 33.8% (54 of 160) had discordant reporting of blurry vision between the ESQ and EMR. Likewise, documentation was discordant for reporting glare (48.1% [78 of 162]), pain or discomfort (26.5% [43 of 162]), and redness (24.7% [40 of 162]), with poor to fair agreement (Œ∫ range, -0.02 to 0.42).

The modified moisture chamber allows an individual adaptation to the periocular shape of the face and rises the level of the monoculus for about 7 mm. The internal relative humidity was for eight hours at 98% in both test persons and patients. All test persons felt more comfortable with the modified moisture chamber on their skin. The presented modified moisture chamber is a derivative of the commercial monoculus bandage for patients with sensitive protrusio bulbi.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10198880/"}

The study employed a number of visual stimuli designed to isolate the processing of various stimulus attributes. We measured absolute contrast detection thresholds and functional contrast sensitivity by using Landolt ring stimuli. This psychophysical Landolt C-based contrast test of detection and gap discrimination allowed us to test parafoveally at 6 ¬∞ from fixation and foveally by employing interleaved testing locations. First-order motion perception was examined by using moving stimuli embedded in static luminance contrast noise. Red/green (RG) and yellow/blue (YB) colour thresholds were measured with the Colour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test, which utilises random dynamic luminance contrast noise (¬± 45 %) to ensure that only colour and not luminance signals are available for target detection. Subjects were normal controls (n = 65) and glaucoma patients with binocular visual field defects (n = 15) classified based on their Humphrey Field Analyzer mean deviation (MD) scores. The impairment of visual function varied depending on the stimulus attribute and location tested. Progression of loss was noted for all tests as the degree of glaucoma increased. For subjects with mild glaucoma (MD -0.01 dB to -6.00 dB) significantly more data points fell outside the normal age-representative range for RG colour thresholds than for any other visual test, followed by motion thresholds. This was particularly the case for the parafoveal data compared with the foveal data. Thus, a multifaceted measure of binocular visual performance, incorporating RG colour and motion test at multiple locations, might provide a better index for comparison with quality of life measures in glaucoma.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23812834/"}

Extensive literature research is made and contacts with institutions for history of medicine as well as medico-historians in the field of ophthalmology. His contributions to ophthalmology were multiple. Von Graefe was the first to introduce iridectomy in acute glaucoma treatment, initiated visual field testing and developed the first tonometer. He made the first classification of glaucoma. Von Graefe was the ophthalmologist who created a special knife for cataract surgery. He was also the first to use Helmholtz' ophthalmoscope. He founded the first ophthalmological society in the world and the second ophthalmology journal which has been published continously up to now. In 1852 he founded famous private eye clinic in Berlin, where he treated many eye patients and educated many prominent ophthalmologists. At the age of 29 he became associate professor of ophthalmology, the first with such a title in Germany. Albrecht von Graefe was founder of modern ophthalmology and separated it from surgery. Graefe's contacts, correspondency and meetings at ophthalmological congresses with his teachers, assistants, collegaues also contributed to international co-operation and internationalization in ophthalmology. Although Albrecht von Graefe died before 150 years, he still provokes great admiration and respect in the world of ophthalmology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31912404/"}

Inherited deafness (ID) appears to be associated with the fewest visual anomalies. Congenital rubella (CR) had the greatest prevalence and was associated with the broadest spectrum of ocular and visual problems. It appears to have a significant effect on corneal curvature as well as being associated with anomalies of other organ systems. Children who had had CR, neonatal sepsis (NS), and Rh incompatibility (Rh) all showed higher rates of strabismus and amblyopia. Those who were deaf from meningitis (MEN) or NS showed a tendency to be more hyperopic, whereas the sample with Rh showed a trend toward myopia. The CR children had the broadest range of spherical refractive errors of all the causes of deafness. Children in schools for the deaf are generally those with substantial or profound hearing loss and thus are more likely to have an accompanying vision impairment. Knowledge of the effect on vision of the causes of deafness should aid practitioners in identifying and detecting similar effects on vision when mild or moderate deafness does not require a child's attendance at schools for the deaf.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3766697/"}

Physicians on Iceland are not obliged to report a person no longer fulfilling the visual requirements, as in other Nordic countries. In Denmark, Finland and Norway a person may apply for dispensation from the requirements by performing a practical driving test. In Sweden, a person applying for dispensation can undergo a traffic simulator test. Because of the national legislation in the Nordic countries, a person with a visual impairment may be given different permissions depending on which country they live in.

Homonymous visual field disorders, impaired elementary visual capacities (e.g. acuity, contrast sensitivity, convergent fusion, oculomotor disorders), visual neglect, Balint-Holmes syndrome or dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) are the most frequent causes of such disorders. Efficient visual search is necessary to select salient stimuli and bring them onto the fovea in order to perform an in-depth analysis. Visual search is not only an indispensible capacity for visual activities in vocational and private life but is also important for many motor and cognitive abilities such as reaching, grasping, standing, spatial perception, route navigation as well as mobility. Despite this importance no comprehensive system exists for the standardized assessment and treatment of visual search disorders in the German-speaking area.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Seven patients suffering from Alport syndrome were referred to the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Debrecen between January 1st, 2014, and December 31st, 2015. All patients underwent slit lamp evaluation and dilated fundus biomicroscopy, with special attention paid to lenticonus and retinal changes. IOL Master, Pentacam HR, and ultrasound biomicroscopy were performed to assess keratometry, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens size, and axial length data. RESULTS One patient out of seven had ocular symptoms. Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPMD) and dot-and-fleck retinopathy were seen. Meanwhile, although keratoconus was not proven, remarkable astigmatism with high myopia was detected. The other six patients were found to have a significantly smaller lens diameter (an average of 7.82¬±0.66 mm, p=0.035) compared to normal controls (an average of 8.65¬±0.46 mm). Lenses also tended to be thicker in Alport patients (3.48¬±0.19 mm) compared to controls (3.4¬±0.2 mm), although the difference was not significant (p=0.394). The power of the lens also showed a significant difference (p=0.026), with Alport patients having lower lens power. CONCLUSIONS Alport syndrome patients without classical ophthalmological findings have smaller crystalline lens diameter and lower lens power. These signs may support the diagnosis of Alport syndrome. Ophthalmologists should not only seek for the known classic signs, but also the parameters of the crystalline lens, especially if genetic testing is not available.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30919828/"}

Hydrogel lenses are demonstrated to maintain a low inflammatory response and infection risk profile during daily wear, which in the case of etafilcon A, may be related to its low modulus, and the naturally-protective, anti-microbial, non-denatured lysozyme absorbed into the lens from the tear fluid. Although improved corneal physiology from decreased hypoxia with silicone hydrogel lenses is well accepted, equivalent levels of corneal oxygenation are maintained during daily wear of low to medium powered hydrogel lenses, which do not impede the daily corneal de-swelling process, and do not induce clinically significant changes in ocular health.

This review focuses on the studies that have been carried out in our laboratory on CaN, and specifically CaN's involvement in the eye. We demonstrated that CaN is localized in various eye tissues (cornea, iris, ciliary body, vitreous body, retina, choroid, sclera, and optic nerve) and that both its protein expression and activity were observed in high amounts in the retina, optic nerve and cornea. Recently, we have cloned and characterized the CaN A and B subunits in the bovine retina.

Unfortunately, patients are less likely to seek care as they age, which may be the result of significant travel and time burdens associated with going to an eye clinic in person. A new method of eye-care delivery that mitigates distance barriers and improves access was developed to improve screening for potentially blinding conditions. We present the quality data from the early experience (first 13 months) of Technology-Based Eye Care Services (TECS), a novel ophthalmologic telemedicine program. With TECS, a trained ophthalmology technician is stationed in a primary care clinic away from the main hospital. The ophthalmology technician follows a detailed protocol that collects information about the patient's eyes. The information then is interpreted remotely. Patients with possible abnormal findings are scheduled for a face-to-face examination in the eye clinic. Any patient with no known ocular disease who desires a routine eye screening examination is eligible. Technology-Based Eye Care Services was established in 5 primary care clinics in Georgia surrounding the Atlanta Veterans Affairs hospital. Four program operation metrics (patient satisfaction, eyeglass remakes, disease detection, and visit length) and 2 access-to-care metrics (appointment wait time and no-show rate) were tracked. Care was rendered to 2690 patients over the first 13 months of TECS. The program has been met with high patient satisfaction (4.95 of 5). Eyeglass remake rate was 0.59%. Abnormal findings were noted in 36.8% of patients and there was >90% agreement between the TECS reading and the face-to-face findings of the physician. TECS saved both patient (25% less) and physician time (50% less), and access to care substantially improved with 99% of patients seen within 14 days of contacting the eye clinic, with a TECS no-show rate of 5.2%. The early experience with TECS has been promising. Tele-ophthalmology has the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce cost, and significantly improve access to care. Although further study is necessary, TECS shows potential to help prevent avoidable vision loss.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28081944/"}

Binocular distance visual acuity was categorized as normal (20/12.5-20/25), near normal (20/32-20/63), moderate (20/80-20/160), severe (20/200-20/400), profound (20/500-20/1000), and total blindness (20/1250 to no light perception). Both Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test and the sign test of matched pairs were used to compare estimated functional vision measures between DR cases and controls. Cases ranged in age from 19 to 90 years (mean age, 67.5), and 59% were women. The mean visual acuity (logMar scale) was 0.7. Based on the Wilcoxon signed rank test analyses and after adjusting the probability for multiple comparisons, there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) between patients with DR and control subjects in any of four functional visions. Furthermore, diabetic retinopathy patients did not differ (P > 0.05) from their matched counterparts in goal-level vision-related functional ability and total visual ability.

Based on this data, we propose an auxiliary diagnostic model based on a contrastive graph attention network (CGAT-ADM), which uses the patient's diagnostic results as anchor points and achieves auxiliary medical record diagnosis services through graph clustering. By implementing contrastive methods and feature fusion of node types, text, and numerical information in medical records, the CGAT-ADM model achieved an average precision of 0.8563 for the top 20 similar case retrievals, indicating high performance in identifying analogous diagnoses. Our research findings suggest that medical record management systems underpinned by multimodal knowledge graphs significantly enhance the development of AI services.

Prospective case series. Thirty-four eyes of 30 patients with lacrimal passage obstruction were enrolled. Before and 1¬†month after lacrimal passage intubation, functional visual acuity (FVA), higher-order aberrations (HOAs), lower tear meniscus, and tear clearance were assessed. An FVA measurement system was used to examine changes in continuous visual acuity (VA) over time, and visual function parameters such as FVA, visual maintenance ratio, and blink frequency were obtained. Sequential ocular HOAs were measured for 10 seconds after the blink using a wavefront sensor. Aberration data were analyzed in the central 4¬†mm for coma-like, spherical-like, and total HOAs. Fluctuation and stability indices of the total HOAs over time were calculated. Lower tear meniscus was assessed by anterior segment optical coherence tomography. After lacrimal passage intubation, visual function significantly improved, as indicated by improved FVA (P¬†= .003) and visual maintenance ratio (P < .001). Blink frequency decreased significantly after treatment (P¬†= .01). Optical quality significantly improved, as indicated by a decrease in coma-like aberrations (P¬†= .003), spherical-like aberrations (P¬†= .018), and total HOAs (P¬†= .001).

The prevalence of asthenopia in such workers is rather high, between 40 and 80%. The considerable specificity of the symptoms and the shortcomings in assessment of exposure in most of the research done so far has meant that no clear and unequivocal causal relationship between work involving intense visual effort and onset of asthenopia has been established. Nevertheless, from an analysis of the literature three main guidelines for a correct ergophthalmologic assessment can be identified: a) ophthalmologic assessments that will detect any transitory inefficiencies of the accommodation and convergence system; b) specific analysis of the technical and illumination conditions with special attention to the distribution of the natural and artificial light sources; c) quantification of airborne pollutants that have a potential irritative effect on the \"ocular surface\".

In this context, zebrafish as an animal model organism not only address these needs but can in many respects reflect the human situation better than the current rodent models. Over the past decade, zebrafish have become an established model to study a variety of human diseases and are more recently becoming a valuable tool for the study of human ophthalmological disorders. Many human ocular diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration have already been modelled in zebrafish.

Psychosomatic phenomena in ophthalmology are probably under-diagnosed, which may reduce therapeutic effectiveness, decrease patient and physician satisfaction, and increase health costs due to multiple consultations and prescriptions. The aims of this study were to describe patients with unexplained visual/ocular symptoms (UVOS), and to estimate the prevalence of psychological distress (PD) among them. Consecutive adults with UVOS were recruited over a 12 month period. Complete medical history and ocular examination were performed to rule out organic disease. Psychological Distress was defined by the presence of one or more of the following criteria: psychiatric diagnosis, use of psychotropic medication, psychosomatic disease in other organs, and biographical crisis in the last 6 months. Results were compared with a control group. A total of 39 cases of UVOS were recruited, corresponding approximately to 3% prevalence. The large majority (74%) were female. The mean age was 41.8 years. The most common complaints were ocular surface irritation symptoms (51%) and unspecific visual disturbances (17%). At least 1 of the PD criteria was found in 100%, including 46.2% with psychiatric comorbidity, 48.7% with psychotropic medications, 64% with psychosomatic disease in other organs, and 48.7% with recent life-stressful events. PD indicators were statistically higher compared with control group (P<.05). There was a high frequency of PD indicators in patients with UVOS.

Special challenges are presented by the replacement or repair of highly specialized but scarce tissue within the constraints of transparency, tissue shape and alignment, tissue borders and pressure maintenance. Many, mostly destructive, surgical procedures were developed prior to an understanding of underlying pathophysiology. For a number of conditions, both reconstructive and destructive procedures co-exist, yet there are few guidelines as to the better approach. Because the consequences of these procedures may take many years to surface (consistent with a stem cell role in long-term tissue maintenance), guidance may be provided by the elucidation of underlying principles from these approaches. Illustrative examples from clinical, basic research and biotechnology, particularly relating to pterygium, ocular surface squamous neoplasia, dry-eye syndrome, corneal rehabilitation and replacement, cataract surgery, strabismus surgery and bionic eye research, are described. An unexpected consequence of bionic device development has been an appreciation of the sophistication of tissues being replaced, given the limitations of available biomaterials. Examples of how this has provided insights into ocular disease will be illustrated. Stem cell and biomaterial technologies are starting to impact at a time when cost-effectiveness is under scrutiny. Both efficacy and cost will need to be considered as these interventions are introduced. It appears that the paradigm shift rate is accelerating and there is evidence of this in ophthalmology.

Contrast sensitivity varied significantly with spatial frequency, age, and level of external noise. By adopting a nonlinear observer model, we decomposed contrast sensitivity into inefficiencies in internal additive noise, internal multiplicative noise, perceptual¬†template gain, and/or system non-linearity. Model analysis revealed that aging impacts both internal additive noise and perceptual template gain, and such age-related degradation is tuned to spatial frequency, which is also a good predictor to discriminate old from young.

Patient perspectives on barriers to accessing eye care and reasons they choose to seek care or not are presented. Health system barriers identified by health and eye care providers are also presented. Additionally, key enablers for improving access to eye care through primary care services are identified. Primary health care services have an important role in Indigenous eye health. There is a critical role for primary care in the coordination of the patient journey and cooperating with other services to improve access to comprehensive eye care. Through improved provision of primary eye care, monitoring of Indigenous eye health indicators and supporting patients to access eye care, it is possible to close the gap for vision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23586574/"}

Spontaneous visual recovery was defined as a two or more line improvement in Snellen acuity after a minimum of 12 months of stable visual reduction to 20/70 or less, secondary to central disciform scarring. Ten cases of spontaneous visual recovery were found. Eight patients had recovery of vision only when visual acuity was reduced to 20/80 or less in the fellow eye. One patient experienced spontaneous recovery without visual loss in the fellow eye. Another patient experienced spontaneous visual recovery 57 months after xenon photocoagulation in the study eye. This group of patients was compared to 14 similar patients who did not experience spontaneous recovery when visual acuity was reduced to less than 20/80 in the fellow eye. Compared to the nonrecovery group, patients experiencing spontaneous visual recovery in OHS were younger at the time of visual loss in the fellow eye (30 years vs. 48 years, p less than 0.01); had a shorter interval of visual loss prior to visual loss in the fellow eye (44 months vs. 150 months, p less than 0.10); had smaller diameter scars (1,711 microns vs. 3,078 microns, p less than 0.05); and had shorter distances from the foveal center to adjacent normal retina (267 microns vs. 846 microns, p less than 0.01).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3602600/"}

Cross-sectional, clinic-based study. Diabetic patients 18 years of age or older were recruited consecutively from an urban tertiary and community hospitals and from a rural clinic in Guangdong, China.

Self-reported or chart history of an eye examination ever or within the preceding 12 months. The participation rate among 889 eligible subjects was 92.7%. Among 824 participants (mean age, 62.6+/-12.9 years; 58.8% female), 550 (66.7%) had not been examined in the last year as recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and 356 (43.2%) had never been examined. For the rural hospital, these figures were 81.1% and 68.7%, respectively. In regression analyses, factors associated with having an eye examination in the last year were: attendance at urban hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 3.46 [P<0.001] and 1.76 [P = 0.021] for the tertiary and community hospitals, respectively, compared with the rural clinic), higher DR knowledge score (OR, 1.24; P = 0.001), greater concern about vision loss (OR, 1.22; P = 0.007), and recommendation of regular eye examinations by the provider (OR, 2.36; P = 0.011). Predictors of ever having an eye examination were similar. Monthly income and health insurance status were not predictive of being examined.

These photoreceptor cells are exquisitely sensitive and have adaptive mechanisms in place to maintain optimal function and to overcome dysfunctional states. One adaptation rod photoreceptor cells exhibit is in the packing properties of rhodopsin within the membrane. The mechanism underlying these adaptations is unclear. Mouse models of congenital stationary night blindness with different molecular causes were investigated to determine which signals are important for adaptations in rod photoreceptor cells. Night blindness in these mice is caused by dysfunction in either rod photoreceptor cell signaling or bipolar cell signaling. Changes in the packing of rhodopsin within photoreceptor cell membranes were examined by atomic force microscopy. Mice expressing constitutively active rhodopsin did not exhibit any adaptations, even under constant dark conditions. Mice with disrupted bipolar cell signaling exhibited adaptations, however, they were distinct from those in mice with disrupted phototransduction. These differential adaptations demonstrate that although multiple molecular defects can lead to a similar primary defect causing disease (i.e., night blindness), they can cause different secondary effects (i.e., adaptations). The lighting environment or signaling defects present from birth and during early rearing can condition mice and affect the adaptations occurring in more mature animals. A comparison of effects in wild-type mice, mice with defective phototransduction, and mice with defective bipolar cell signaling, indicated that bipolar cell signaling plays a role in this conditioning but is not required for adaptations in more mature animals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533975/"}

Of 121 patients still living, 74 (61%) attended the reexamination. After exclusions, data from 62 patients were analyzed. The VF-14 score, plus global assessment scores of satisfaction with vision and quality of vision, in which patients graded the subjective level of difficulty with their vision, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity, the area of the AMD lesion, and the shortest distance and direction from the center of the fovea to the edge of the subfoveal lesion, were analyzed. The VF-14 score correlated significantly with BCVA (P <.01), contrast sensitivity (P <.01), and global assessment scores (P <.01), showing stronger correlations with global assessment scores than did BCVA. In multivariate regression analysis, the global assessment scale of overall quality of vision and BCVA in the better eye were significant predictors (P <.001) of the variability in the VF-14 score.

These units are equipped with a slit lamp and a fundus photography system, and are managed by trained optometrists. Communication with ophthalmologists at base hospitals is facilitated through apps, namely Skype and Remidio. Data collected from 41 such units across 9 states over 18 months, from April 2022 to September 2023, were analysed. A total of 1,91,194 patients were examined during this time.

The mean spherical equivalent, determined by cyclopentolate retinoscopy, for the entire group was--2.9 diopters and did not change significantly with age. However, in 3-year-old children and younger, myopia progressed in eyes with greater than or equal to 1 diopter of cylinder and tended to increase through age 8 years in those having greater than or equal to 3 diopters of cylinder. Also, astigmatic errors greater than or equal to 1 diopter, especially of oblique orientation, were associated with higher degrees of myopia than nonastigmatic errors. These data from myopic children suggest that uncorrected astigmatism during a period of visual immaturity influences the course of myopia. Thus, naturally occurring astigmatic errors, that are frequent among infants and young children, appear to have a role similar to the vision blurring perturbations that trigger the development of myopia in young animals. Ascertainment and full correction of these refractive errors in young children may be important in assuring the best possible vision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7099549/"}

In this review, we focus on minimally invasive strategies for the delivery of ES and accordingly summarize the current literature on transcorneal, transorbital, and transpalpebral ES in both animal experiments and clinical studies. Various mechanisms are believed to underlie the effects of ES, including increased production of neurotrophic agents, improved chorioretinal blood circulation, and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines. Different animal models have demonstrated favorable effects of ES on both the retina and the optic nerve. Promising effects of ES have also been demonstrated in clinical studies; however, all current studies have a lack of randomization and/or a control group (sham). There is thus a pressing need for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern clinical success and optimization of stimulation parameters in animal studies. In addition, such research should be followed by large, prospective, clinical studies to explore the full potential of ES.

To conduct the visual screening, evaluate eye health status and ocular abnormalities; to correct refractive errors among school novices of the Buddhist Scripture Schools. A survey of refractive errors was conducted in 76 Buddhist Scripture schools in the Bangkok Metropolitan area between October 2005 and September 2007. The novices whose ages were between 9 and 20 years were included in the present study. Refraction and eye examinations were performed by ophthalmic nurses, optometrists, and the health personnel team, resulting in novices with refractive errors receiving custom-made eyeglasses, without charge along with eye health education.

Line-of-sight coordinates on the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes, refractive, topographic, and aberrometric parameters were evaluated. All parameters were compared between groups, and correlations were analyzed for the study group. In the study group, the LoS significantly shifted to the superotemporal direction compared with the control group (P=0.022 and P=0.008 respectively). The shift on y-axis was correlated with mean cylindrical refractive error (r=-0.283, P=0.011), total root mean square (RMS) (r=0.321, P=0.004), higher-order aberration RMS (r=0.300, P=0.007), vertical coma (r=0.430, P<0.001), and vertical trefoil values (r=-0.455, P<0.001).

In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed.

However, there is little evidence on the factors enabling or constraining sustainability. Diffusion of innovation theory can help explain how the continuation of activities is related to the attributes of innovations. Innovations are characterised by five attributes: (i) relative advantage; (ii) compatibility; (iii) complexity; (iv) triability; and (v) observability. An eye care programme was selected as a case study. The programme was implemented in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana and had been funded over a ten-year period by an international organisation. Sustainability in the study was defined as the level of continuation of activities after the end of international funding. Measuring the continuation of activities involved checking whether each eye care activity continued (i.e. out-patient consultation, cataract surgery, outreach, school health, and statistics) or was interrupted after the end of Swiss Red Cross funding the 11 district hospitals where the programme was implemented. The results showed a relationship between the level of sustainability and the attributes of every activity. The activities with the lowest score for the attributes were less sustained. School health screening was the least sustained activity after the end of international funding. This activity also held the smallest score in terms of attributes: they were the most incompatible and most complex activities, as well as the least triable and observable activities, amongst the four district activities. In contrast, compared to the three other district activities, facility-based consultations were more likely to be routinised because they were perceived by the hospital managers as very compatible, and not complex. Using diffusion of innovations theories can help predict the sustainability of specific activities within a health programme. The study also highlighted the need for disentangling the various components of a health programme in order to identify which activities are more likely to be continued within a health system. The same methodology could be used in a different setting and could help predict which innovations are more likely to be adopted and maintained over time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24552212/"}

A decision-analytic model (decision tree) with a one-year time horizon was constructed to portray alternative future patient referral pathways for people examined in optometry stores for suspected ocular posterior segment eye disease. The main outcomes were total healthcare costs per patient, average waiting time from eye examination in store until the start of treatment or end of referral pathway, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. The economic evaluation compares the general ophthalmologist referral pathway (GO-RP) with a potential reimbursement model for the optometrist-assisted teleophthalmology referral pathways (R-OTRP) and a procurement model for the optometrist-assisted teleophthalmology referral pathways (P-OTRP). The cost per individual with suspected ocular posterior segment eye disease was estimated to be ¬£116 for GO-RP and ¬£75 and ¬£94 for P-OTRP and R-OTRP respectively.

A normally functioning vestibulo-ocular reflex is necessary but not sufficient for optimum visual acuity during head motion. Studies of dynamic visual acuity, the acuity achieved during relative motion of visual targets or of the observer, indicate that motion of images on the retina markedly compromises vision. The vestibulo-ocular reflex normally provides a substantial measure of stabilization of the retina during head movements, but purely vestibular compensatory eye movements are not sufficiently precise for optimal vision under all circumstances. Other mechanisms, including visual tracking, motor preprogramming, prediction, and mental set, interact synergistically to optimize the gain (eye velocity divided by head velocity) of compensatory head movements. All of these mechanisms are limited in their capacity to produce effective visual-vestibular interaction at higher rotational frequencies and velocities. It is under these conditions that vestibular deficits give rise to symptoms of oscillopsia. Patients having vestibular lesions exploit mechanisms of visual-vestibular interaction to compensate by substitution for deficient vestibular function. Thus, for accurate topographic clinical diagnosis of vestibular lesions, testing conditions should isolate purely vestibular responses. This may be done by testing reflex eye movements during passively generated rotations in darkness, or perhaps by testing during other types of motion under conditions of extreme frequency and velocity sufficient to attenuate the effects of visual-vestibular interaction.

Recent advances in molecular genetics and cell biology are elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders and are helping to identify new therapeutic approaches, such as gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and optogenetics. Several of these approaches have entered the clinical phase of development. Artificial replacement of dying photoreceptor cells using retinal prostheses has received regulatory approval. Precise retinal imaging and testing of visual function are facilitating more efficient clinical trial design. In individual patients, disease stage will determine whether the therapeutic strategy should comprise photoreceptor cell rescue to delay or arrest vision loss or retinal replacement for vision restoration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27928030/"}

Drawing on genomic advances to improve molecular diagnosis, such as next-generation sequencing, and basic and translational research to develop novel therapies, application of genetic technologies in ophthalmology now heralds development of gene replacement therapies for some inherited monogenic eye diseases. It also promises to alter prediction, diagnosis and management of the complex disease age-related macular degeneration. Personalized ophthalmology is underpinned by an understanding of the molecular basis of eye disease. Two important areas of focus are required for adoption of personalized approaches: disease stratification and individualization. Disease stratification relies on phenotypic and genetic assessment leading to molecular diagnosis; individualization encompasses all aspects of patient management from optimized genetic counseling and conventional therapies to trials of novel DNA-based therapies. This review discusses the clinical implications of these twin strategies. Advantages and implications of genetic testing for patients with inherited eye diseases, choice of molecular diagnostic modality, drivers for adoption of personalized ophthalmology, service planning implications, ethical considerations and future challenges are considered. Indeed, whilst many difficulties remain, personalized ophthalmology truly has the potential to revolutionize the specialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24665880/"}

Adult male Long-Evans rats were either untreated or treated with malathion alone (two drops per day in each eye), bait alone (six drops per day in each eye) or malathion and bait (six drops per day in each eye). The dose levels of malathion alone and malathion and bait were chosen based on pilot work and provided approximately equivalent amounts of active ingredient. The rats were treated 5 days a week for 4 weeks. During the final week of treatment, the rats were implanted surgically with cranial recording electrodes overlying the visual projection area of the cerebral cortex. Visual pattern-evoked potentials (PEPs) were elicited with vertical sinusoidal gratings at three levels of stimulus spatial frequency (0. 08, 0.16 and 0.32 cycles per degree) and three levels of visual contrast (0.15, 0.30 and 0.60). After spectral analysis of the PEP waveforms, the amplitude and phase at the stimulus rate (F1) and the first harmonic (F2) were determined. Although F1 and F2 parameters were influenced significantly by manipulation of the stimulus parameters, no significant differences were observed that could be attributed to treatment with the test substances. In addition, an ophthalmological examination of the eyes and a light microscopic evaluation of ocular tissues, including retina and optic nerve, revealed no treatment-related lesions. The dose levels used in this study were high-approximately 84000 times the exposure per unit surface area expected from aerial spraying-and yet the visual function of the treated subjects was apparently normal. This study identified no significant toxicological concerns regarding direct ocular contact exposure to malathion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10547628/"}
{"id": "30215243", "title": "Simulation in Ophthalmic Training.", "text": "Vision impairment and blindness arise both as a cause, and a consequence, of poverty. Achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in providing universal access and equity in eye care, both within and between among countries, remains challenging. A severe shortage of eye care providers is creating unnecessary blindness and vision impairment in developing communities worldwide. Education and training develops and strengthens the capacity of emerging nations to contribute to global eye health and the World Health Organization Development Goals in an effective and sustainable way. Although relative to other medical professions, adoption of simulation in ophthalmic training has been relatively slow, simulation potentially offers reduced training costs, increased accessibility, objective measurement of training outcomes, and improvements in patient safety during and after clinician training, all of which can help address the global burden of vision impairment and blindness. Simulation training offers advantages over apprenticeship models, the traditional mode of transferring knowledge and skills in medicine and health, which suffers from imperfect transference due to inherent biases, heuristic and idiosyncratic expectations of experts, and subjective measures of outcomes. Simulation does not completely do away with these confounders because it is made to fit into established curricula, making it difficult to measure effectiveness of the simulation in isolation. The power of simulation training for resource-limited regions and countries is immense in offering cost-effective training in-country; however, it is important that any such tools are developed within the context of the limitations in situ.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30215243/"}

Drug therapy at the turn of the century was empiric, palliative, and often toxic. The development of ocular pharmacology during the 20th century provided the basis for a rational therapeutic approach to ocular disease. Foremost among the therapeutic developments were antibiotics, due to their potential to cure conditions that frequently resulted in blindness. Second, other therapeutic classes provided palliative therapy for chronic diseases, and thus decreased morbidity. For example, drugs specifically targeting many different aspects of glaucoma have had remarkable success controlling intraocular pressure and forestalling development of blindness. In addition, other new approaches provided palliative therapy for nonblinding conditions and effective adjuncts to surgical procedures. Antiallergy and anti-inflammatory drugs greatly increased patient comfort and facilitated treatment of allergic and inflammatory reactions. Local anesthetics and analgesia reduced patient discomfort during surgery. Other adjunct drugs improved surgical outcomes by reducing inflammation and infectious complications. The 21st century will undoubtedly provide novel approaches to address many of today's therapeutic dilemmas. Photodynamic therapy, growth factors, antisense technology, and genetic-based therapies all show great promise. Many of the conditions that are only treated palliatively today will be curable in the next century using many of these pharmacological advances.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10975070/"}

Over the past two decades, a plethora of PRO instruments have been developed to assess the impact of eye diseases and their treatments. Despite this large number of instruments, significant shortcomings exist for the measurement of ophthalmic quality of life (QoL). Most PRO instruments are short-form instruments designed for clinical use, but this limits their content coverage often poorly targeting any study population other than that which they were developed for. Also, existing instruments are static paper and pencil based and unable to be updated easily leading to outdated and irrelevant item content. Scores obtained from different PRO instruments may not be directly comparable. These shortcomings can be addressed using item banking implemented with computer-adaptive testing (CAT). Therefore, we designed a multicenter project (The Eye-tem Bank project) to develop and validate such PROs to enable comprehensive measurement of ophthalmic QoL in eye diseases. Development of the Eye-tem Bank follows four phases: Phase I, Content Development; Phase II, Pilot Testing and Item Calibration; Phase III, Validation; and Phase IV, Evaluation. This project will deliver technologically advanced comprehensive QoL PROs in the form of item banking implemented via a CAT system in eye diseases.

These disease processes may selectively damage certain parts of the retina or optic nerve, and the specific areas that are damaged may have implications for the design of potential therapeutic visual prosthetic devices. Outer retinal diseases include age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, and retinitis pigmentosa. Although the retinal photoreceptors may be lost, the inner retina is relatively well-preserved in these diseases and may be a target for retinal prosthetic devices. Inner retinal diseases include retinal vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal venous occlusive disease, and retinopathy of prematurity. Other retinal diseases such as ocular infections (retinitis, endophthalmitis) may affect all retinal layers. Because the inner retinal cells, including the retinal ganglion cells, may be destroyed in these diseases (inner retinal or whole retinal), prosthetic devices that stimulate the inner retina may not be effective. Common optic nerve diseases include glaucoma, optic neuritis, and ischemic optic neuropathy. Because the ganglion cell nerve fibers themselves are damaged, visual prosthetics for these diseases will need to target more distal portions of the visual pathway, such as the visual cortex. Clearly, a sound understanding of retinal and optic nerve disease pathophysiology is critical for designing and choosing the optimal visual prosthetic device.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14616515/"}

One hundred and thirty-three primary care doctors replied to the questionnaire of whom 35% were fundholders and 47% in training practices. Only 22% of all respondents felt their undergraduate ophthalmic medical education to be adequate. However, 83% of the 86 primary care doctors who had attended postgraduate update courses in ophthalmology felt these to be adequate.

Seventy-one per cent of respondents reported having access to dilating agents but only 61% felt confident using them. Understanding of two key ophthalmic terms was also poor. Despite the general satisfaction, attendance of postgraduate update courses did not appear to alter facilities, confidence or understanding. It is apparent that most primary care doctors view their undergraduate ophthalmic medical education as inadequate and this is reflected in their confidence and understanding. Postgraduate courses, although more favourably received, do not appear to after these findings.

Important findings include the association of L/M opsin mutations with familial high myopia, axial hyperopia produced in response to form deprivation in moderate outdoor lighting levels, effective control of myopia by diffusion optics technology spectacle lenses designed to reduce retinal contrast, and all current defocus-based optical treatments which inadvertently reduce image contrast. In this review, clinical trial results of optical myopia treatment strategies that manipulate retinal contrast are considered in context of animal research outcomes. In conclusion, research suggests mild reductions in retinal contrast can slow myopia progression in children and may also have a role in defocus-based optical therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37264581/"}

Many \"omics\" studies have been developed over the last decade. Metabolomic analysis enables dynamic measurement of the metabolic response of a living system to a variety of stimuli or genetic modifications. Important targets of metabolomics is biomarker development and translation to the clinic for personalized diagnosis and a greater understanding of disease pathogenesis. The current review highlights the major aspects of metabolomic analysis and its applications for the identification of relevant predictive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for some ocular diseases including dry eye, keratoconus, retinal diseases, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. To date, possible biomarker candidates for dry eye disease are lipid metabolites and androgens, for keratoconus cytokeratins, urea, citrate cycle, and oxidative stress metabolites. Palmitoylcarnitine, sphingolipids, vitamin D related metabolites, and steroid precursors may be used for distinguishing glaucoma patients from healthy controls. Dysregulation of amino acid and carnitine metabolism is critical in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Further work is needed to discover and validate metabolic biomarkers as a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of ocular diseases, to provide knowledge on their etiology and pathophysiology and opportunities for personalized clinical intervention at an early stage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32690974/"}

Acceptance of V codes was then tracked for an 8-month period and analyzed 1 year later to provide a set of closed accounts.

{"id": "22621741", "title": "Therapeutic applications of ultrasound in ophthalmology.", "text": "Therapeutic ultrasound, although less well known than ultrasound for diagnostic imaging, has become a topic of growing interest in ophthalmology. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of glaucoma and ultrasonic drug delivery are the two main areas of research and potential clinical applications. For the treatment of glaucoma, the specific advantage of HIFU, particularly when compared to the laser, is that the energy can be focused through optically opaque media, especially through the sclera which is a strongly light-scattering medium. HIFU is therefore a possible method for partial coagulation of the ciliary body (an anatomical structure responsible for the production of the liquid filling the eye) and, hence, reducing intraocular pressure and the risk of glaucoma. Ocular drug bioavailability also remains a challenge, being limited by multiple barriers to drug entry and lacrimal drainage, and making it difficult to achieve a sufficient drug concentration for numerous diseases of the front and back of the eye. As the front wall of the eye (cornea and anterior sclera) is a pathway for topically applied drugs, locally applied ultrasound has been proposed as a way of enhancing the delivery and activity of drugs and genes. Despite the fact that experimental studies seem to confirm the potential benefit of ultrasound ocular drug delivery, there is still a lack of clinical evidence. The aim of this contribution is to provide an update on recent advances in the field of therapeutic ultrasound in ophthalmology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22621741/"}

Based on clinical studies using optical defocus to regulate ocular growth and refractive changes through visual feedback, we hypothesize that early wearing of peripheral myopic defocusing spectacles in children with high risk of myopia may slow the process of emmetropization and even prevent the onset of myopia by inducing more peripheral myopic defocus. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the wearing of peripheral focus-out glasses can be effective in delaying emmetropization in non-myopic children aged 6-8¬†years. The study is a 2-year randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 subjects will be randomized into the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group will be fitted with direct emmetropia with focus-out glasses (DEFOG) to guide the emmetropization process. The control group will not receive any treatment and will serve as a blank control group. The primary aim is to determine whether non-myopic children wearing DEFOG lenses are superior to those who do not receive any intervention on the progression of cycloplegic objective refraction over 2¬†years. This is the first randomized controlled trial aiming at myopic prevention by non-invasive intervention in non-myopic children. This study aims to initially investigate whether wearing peripheral focus-out glasses can effectively delay the process of emmetropization in children aged 6-8¬†years with high risk of myopia, which might give potential clues for further exploration on early prevention of myopia.

The aim of this study was to describe consultations and referral patterns to ophthalmologists in private practice in Denmark. Forty-four out of 143 practising ophthalmologists agreed to fill out a short questionnaire on a random sample of their patients. They recorded 1844 consultations. Forty percent of contacts were appointments arranged by the ophthalmologist, 35% were self-referred, 13% were referred by their GP and 12% by others. Cataract, glaucoma and refraction anomalies accounted for 51% of all diagnoses. The distribution of reasons for encounter and diagnoses among self-referred patients and patients referred by their GP does not argue in favour of a change from the present system with free self-referral to a system with gatekeeping by GPs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9492626/"}

Several ocular manifestations like dry eye, retinopathy, and choroidopathy have been linked with specific systemic manifestations like lupus nephritis or CNS disease. Furthermore, the presence of ocular manifesattions can correlated with the severity of SLE. Finally, some medications used in the treatment of uveitis can present with lupus-like disease. Therefore, communication between the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist is vital. Ocular and systemic manifestations of SLE can be linked by common pathological processes including immune complex deposition, complement fixation, and vascular injury. Recent research correlating ophthalmic imaging with SLE disease has yielded heterogeneous results likely due to the clinical heterogeneity of SLE, but molecular technologies have and will continue to yield contributions to the emergence of new therapeutics for the treatment of SLE. Ocular manifestations are prevalent in patients with SLE. The association with certain manifestations and other disease manifestations highlights the importance of collaboration between the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist. Additional research utilizing clinico-molecular techniques will likely continue to improve our knowledge in the treatment of SLE in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34545846/"}

Review of published experimental and clinical studies. A review was undertaken of the work of multiple investigators leading to the invention of the laser, its biophysical effects on ocular tissues from which it derives its name (light-amplified stimulation of emitted radiation), and the development of various laser-based devices and methods to treat common ophthalmologic disorders, with particular emphasis on new and emerging retinal and anterior segment applications. Because the eye is optimized for the transmission of light and its transduction into neural signals, lasers are particularly well suited for ophthalmic therapy. This fact and the high demands for precision in therapy have inspired the development of highly sophisticated laser systems that have impacted the treatment of common diseases. These include diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal venous occlusive disease, retinopathy of prematurity, and optical aberrations including ametropia, cataract, and glaucoma, among others. Recent developments in scanning laser systems, including image-guided systems with eye tracking, real-time feedback, and ultra-short pulse durations, have enabled increased selectivity, precision, and safety in ocular therapy. However, improved outcomes have been associated with increased cost of medical care, and attention to and optimization of their cost effectiveness will continue to be required in the future. The invention and evolution of modern ophthalmic lasers have enhanced therapeutic options and can serve as a heuristic model for better understanding the process of innovation, including the societal benefits and also unintended consequences, including increased costs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24699157/"}

Documenting patient abilities and functional vision (how the person functions) is distinct from the measurement of visual functions (how the eye functions) and also from the assessment of quality of life. All three areas are important, but their assessment should not be mixed. Observation of task performance offers the most objective measure of functional vision, but it is time-consuming and not feasible for many tasks. Where possible, timing and error rates provide an easy score. Patient response questionnaires provide an alternative. They may save time and can cover a wider area, but the responses are subjective and proper scoring presents problems. Simple Likert scoring still predominates but Rasch analysis, needed to provide better result scales, is gaining ground. Selection of questions is another problem. If the range of difficulties does not match the range of patient abilities, and if the difficulties are not distributed evenly, the results are not optimal. This may be an argument to use different outcome questions for different conditions. Generic questionnaires are appropriate for the assessment of generic quality of life, but not for specific rehabilitation outcomes. Different questionnaires are also needed for screening, intake and outcomes. Intake questions must be relevant to actual needs to allow prioritization of rehabilitation goals; the activity inventory presents a prototype. Outcome questions should be targeted at predefined rehabilitation goals. The Appendix cites some promising examples. The Low Vision Intervention Trial (LOVIT) is an example of a properly designed randomized control study, and has demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of vision rehabilitation. It is hoped that further similar studies will follow.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20039847/"}

Studies on issues relating to 'work and vision' have predominantly addressed industrial accidents and the toxic effects of exposure to chemical and physical agents, with secondary prevention being more common than primary prevention. In recent years, the huge transformations implemented in workplaces, mainly due to computer-based technologies, demand a progressively higher efficiency of the eye and the related nervous system components that co-ordinate eye movements and accommodation. At the moment these aspects are managed by medical, psychosocial and a variety of technical disciplines, without any shared criteria, terminology and method. Objectives of the Committee are: to investigate holistically the many possible hazards associated to the occupational visual performance; to come to a consensus on terminology, risk assessment and health surveillance procedures. The present status of research and practice in ergophthalmology does not allow for clear-cut decision about health risk and nor is there a clear direction on the prevention of work-related ocular and visual disturbances and disorders. Specifically, at least three determinants must be objectively considered, namely: (a) visual effort; (b) environmental agents; (c) individual characteristics. Although criteria exist for the evaluation of some of these determinants, a greater refinement is necessary 'for a good working life' of the visual apparatus.

A beagle with CSNB obtained from a commercial research dog supplier in the USA and matched control dogs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ3) underwent examination, refraction, ocular imaging, assessment of visual navigation ability and detailed electroretinography (ERG). Retrospective review of ERGs in two independent groups of inbred (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ15 and 537, respectively) and one group of outbred dogs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ36) was used to estimate CSNB frequency in these populations. In the affected dog, there were absent dark-adapted b-waves in response to dim-light flashes, severely reduced dark-adapted b-waves in response to bright-light flashes, and normal light-adapted b-waves with a-waves that had broadened troughs. Long-flash ERGs confirmed a markedly reduced b-wave with a preserved d-wave, consistent with cone ON-bipolar cell dysfunction. There was evidence of normal rod photoreceptor a-wave dark adaptation, and rapid light adaptation. In the wider beagle populations, five inbred beagles had a b/a wave ratio of <‚Äâ1 in dark-adapted bright-flash ERG, whereas no outbred beagles had ERGs consistent with CSNB. The identified dog had clinical findings consistent with complete type CSNB, similar to that described in the Japanese colony.

In this report, we present the findings from a national survey of the scope of practice of optometrists working in the UK HES. A survey was designed to incorporate questions on the provision of core services before seeking detailed information on the scope of practice within extended roles to include: ophthalmic sub-specialist areas where optometrists currently practice; the undertaking of specific procedures within these services; the relative autonomy of practice within these extended roles; and the training and accreditation requirements for working within extended roles. SurveyMonkey was used to disseminate the survey to the head of optometry in 79 HES units throughout the UK. Responses were received from 70 of the 79 (89%) survey invitations. A substantial majority of respondents (N = 67/70, 96%) indicated that optometrists undertook extended roles. Glaucoma is the leading extended role service provided by optometrists (92% of respondents providing extended role services), with roles in macula (71%), medical retina/diabetes (67%), cataract (55%) and corneal services (55%) also being relatively common. A wide variety of clinical procedures or interventions are undertaken as part of these services, which for a small number of optometrists now also includes the undertaking of specific laser procedures. There is evidence for a significant degree of autonomy within these extended roles. The primary mode of training is an 'apprentice' model, incorporating sessions worked under supervision in ophthalmology clinics. Methods of accreditation for optometric participation in extended role services are varied. While optometrists working within the UK HES continue to undertake the traditional clinical roles of refraction, clinically necessary contact lenses, and low vision rehabilitation, it is clear that these professionals now undertake a wide range of extended clinical roles, with a transformed scope of practice now incorporating diverse roles traditionally undertaken by medical practitioners.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26555386/"}

The Nikon autokefractor/keratometer was used to measure the refractive error and keratometric changes. Visual acuity was measured using computerized high and low contrast charts and the subjects completed visual analog scales characterizing their vision on a daily basis. Measurements were performed at baseline (before lens insertion before sleep), immediately after lens removal the next morning and at 1, 3, 7, and 14 hours after eye opening. Measurements were made on the days following 1, 4, 10, and 28 nights of lens wear. After 72 hours of no lens wear, these parameters were again measured to assess corneal recovery. : The pretreatment manifest refraction (mean of OD and OS +/- standard deviation [SD]) was -2.72 DS +/- 1.06 and -0.55 DC +/- 0.40. Myopic spherical equivalent refractive error (+/- SD) decreased by 1.30 DS +/- 0.53 (range 0-3 D) immediately after lens removal on day 1 and by 2.59 DS +/- 0.77 by day 28 (range 1.25-3.88 D).

All cases seen in Galway University Hospital eye emergency service over five consecutive weeks in 2012 were recorded and analyzed. Four hundred and eight cases were seen in total. 312 (76.5 %) were seen during normal working hours and 96 (23.5 %) after-hours. 33.3 % of cases were inflammatory and 31.9 % traumatic. Anterior uveitis [39 cases (9.6 %)] and corneal abrasion [37 cases (9.1 %)] were the most common diagnosis, while bacterial keratitis [9 cases (2.2 %)] and globe rupture/penetration [4 cases (1 %)] were the most serious. 85.6 % of patients were seen within 30 h from referral. A&E department was the main referral source (35 % of cases seen during normal hours and 70.8 % of those seen after-hours). 42.5 % of patients needed to be followed-up in the clinics. Seventy-two patients (17.6 %) were seen after 5 pm, Monday to Monday. Twenty-one were traumatic, 4 required admission and only 9 were deemed inappropriate after assessment. Serious eye pathology presents after normal working hours. The triage process results in lower number of minor complaints being referred to the service. Compared to a walk-in casualty, a triaged service manages greater percentage of complex pathology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24381063/"}

Different forms of retinal diseases occur in specific breed(s) caused by mutations segregating within each isolated breeding population. While molecular studies to find genes and mutations underlying retinal diseases in dogs have benefited largely from the phenotypic and genetic uniformity within a breed, within- and across-breed variations have often played a key role in elucidating the molecular basis. The increasing knowledge of phenotypic, allelic, and genetic heterogeneities in canine retinal degeneration has shown that the overall picture is rather more complicated than initially thought. Over the past 20¬†years, various approaches have been developed and tested to search for genes and mutations underlying genetic traits in dogs, depending on the availability of genetic tools and sample resources. Candidate gene, linkage analysis, and genome-wide association studies have so far identified 24 mutations in 18 genes underlying retinal diseases in at least 58 dog breeds. Many of these genes have been associated with retinal diseases in humans, thus providing opportunities to study the role in pathogenesis and in normal vision. Application in therapeutic interventions such as gene therapy has proven successful initially in a naturally occurring dog model followed by trials in human patients. Other genes whose human homologs have not been associated with retinal diseases are potential candidates to explain equivalent human diseases and contribute to the understanding of their function in vision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22065099/"}

This narrative review focusses on the application of GANs in ophthalmology, in order to provide a critical account of the current state and ongoing challenges for healthcare professionals and allied scientists who are interested in this rapidly evolving field. We performed a search of studies that apply generative adversarial networks (GANs) in¬†diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of eight eye diseases. These disparate tasks were selected to highlight developments in GAN techniques, differences and common features to aid practitioners and future adopters in the field of ophthalmology. The studies we identified show that GANs have demonstrated capacity to: generate realistic and useful synthetic images, convert image modality, improve image quality, enhance extraction of relevant features, and provide prognostic predictions based on input images and other relevant data. The broad range of architectures considered describe how GAN technology is evolving to meet different challenges (including segmentation and multi-modal imaging) that are of particular relevance to ophthalmology. The wide availability of datasets now facilitates the entry of new researchers to the field.

As the U.S. population grows older, such information is crucial in planning strategies for treatment and prevention of eye disorders as well as in identifying potential problems in access and use of eye care. Using the 1990 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data, a descriptive statistical analysis was employed to profile the possible variations in eye care-related office visits to ophthalmologists and other physicians across demographic groups. In 1990, a total of 49.3 million visits that were related primarily to an ocular disorder were made to physicians' offices; 43.8 million (89 percent) of these were visits to ophthalmologists and 5.4 million (11 percent) to other physicians. Use of ambulatory eye care varied across demographic subgroups. Those ages 65 or older had a substantially higher rate of eye care related outpatient visits per 1,000 persons per year compared with the rest of the population (743.6 per 1,000 versus 118.5 per 1,000, P < 0.001). Women had a higher rate than men (216.0 per 1,000 versus 177.0 per 1,000, 0.01; P < 0.05). Blacks had a substantially lower rate than whites (143.2 per 1,000 versus 194.6 per 1,000, 0.001; P < 0.01). Those who visited ophthalmologists' offices also differed from those who visited other physicians' offices in terms of their age, sex, race, health insurance status, and disease characteristics. It is important to devote increased attention to the prevention of vision loss among the population groups that have a higher risk of developing eye diseases and that also may have underused or have less access to care.

We developed the Greek version of the instrument using forward and backward translation. One hundred-eighty-six patients responded to the questionnaire. To examine reliability, Cronbach's alpha for each subscale was used as an index of internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients. Regarding construct validity, both convergent and discriminant validities were calculated by means of multi-trait analysis. Rasch analysis was used to estimate the visual ability required by each item for a particular response, and each patient's visual ability. Correspondingly, instrument validity was evaluated by estimating the distribution of residuals for item and subject measures. Four patient groups were studied, each including participants with a single cause of visual impairment. Group 1 consisted of 84 glaucoma subjects. Group 2 included 30 subjects with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD); group 3 included 25 subjects with dry-eye syndrome, whereas group 4 included 18 cataract patients. Twenty-nine healthy individuals comprised the control group. NEI-VFQ scores (mean +/- SD) for the glaucoma, ARMD, dry-eye, cataract and control groups were: 76.9 +/- 20.2, 70.9 +/- 20.2, 81.6 +/- 16.5, 73.5 +/- 24.0 and 93.7 +/- 8.9 respectively. Item analysis revealed no significant data skewing. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.678 to 0.926, with most subscales having high internal consistency. Intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.717 to 0.910 for all subscales. All items passed the convergent and discriminant validity tests. Strong correlations were detected between visual acuity and \"general vision\", \"distant activities\" and \"near activities\" subscales. Significant correlations were also detected between visual field deficits and the \"peripheral vision\" and \"general vision\" subscales. Rasch analysis revealed potential weaknesses of the instrument that are associated with the assumptions of the model itself. Specifically, low precision of the \"agreement\" items was detected in the estimation of visual ability. Twenty-three percent of the subjects had fit statistics that fell outside the tolerance box. Although traditional validation methods indicated that the Greek version of the NEI-VFQ-25 is a valid and reliable instrument for VS-QoL assessment, Rasch analysis detected significant misfits to the model, especially of the \"agreement\" items.

Pre-vocational ophthalmology training for General Practitioner (GP) trainees is limited. AIM To describe the rate, nature and associations of ophthalmic problems managed by Australian GP trainees, and derive implications for education and training. METHODS Cross-sectional analysis from an ongoing cohort study of GP trainees' clinical consultations. Trainees recorded demographic, clinical and educational details of consecutive patient consultations. Descriptive analyses report trainee, patient and practice demographics. Proportions of all problems managed in these consultations that were ophthalmology-related were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Associations were tested using simple logistic regression within the generalised estimating equations (GEE) framework. RESULTS In total, 884 trainees returned data on 184,476 individual problems or diagnoses from 118,541 encounters. There were 2649 ophthalmology-related problems, equating to 1.4% (95% CI: 1.38-1.49) of all problems managed. The most common eye presentations were conjunctivitis (32.5% of total problems), eyelid problems (14.9%), foreign body (5.3%) and dry eye (4.7%). Statistically significant associations were male trainee; male patient and patient aged 14 years or under; the problem being new and the patient being new to both trainee and practice; urban and of higher socioeconomic status practice location; the practice nurse not being involved; planned follow up not arranged; referral made; in-consultation information sought; and learning goals generated. DISCUSSION Trainees have comparable ophthalmology exposure to established GPs. However, associations with referral and information-seeking suggest GP trainees find ophthalmic problems challenging, reinforcing the critical importance of appropriate training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29530153/"}

Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and neuroprotective properties, making it a promising candidate for ocular therapy. However, its clinical use is hindered by low aqueous solubility, poor bioavailability, and rapid systemic elimination. This review comprehensively highlights advances in curcumin delivery systems aimed at overcoming these challenges. Emerging platforms, including proniosomal gels, transferosomes, and cyclodextrin complexes, have improved solubility, permeability, and ocular retention. Nanoparticle-based carriers, such as hybrid hydrogels and biodegradable nanoparticles, enable sustained release and targeted delivery, supporting treatments for posterior segment diseases like diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. For anterior segment conditions, including keratitis and dry eye syndrome, cyclodextrin-based complexes and mucoadhesive systems enhance corneal permeability and drug retention. Mechanistically, curcumin modulates key pathways, such as NF-Œ∫B and TLR4, reducing oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Emerging strategies like photodynamic therapy and neuroprotective approaches broaden their application to eyelid conditions and neuroinflammatory ocular diseases. These advancements address curcumin's pharmacokinetic limitations, supporting its clinical translation into ophthalmic therapies. This work underscores curcumin's potential in ocular disease management and advocates clinical trials to validate its safety, efficacy, and therapeutic relevance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39942561/"}

The tear film has various roles in the lubrication, protection from the external environment, and nutrition of the cornea; it is also involved in the modulation of the optical properties of the eye. Tear composition reflects the physiological condition of the underlying tissues. Therefore, the tear fluid is useful in the evaluation of health and disease states and it is a valuable source of biomarkers for objective analysis of ocular and systemic diseases. The relatively high protein concentration of this fluid and the ease of noninvasive sample collection make it suitable for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Efforts in proteomics research have positively affected to the field of ophthalmology, and the knowledge on the tear proteome has expanded considerably in the last few years. Nevertheless, despite a large amount of available data and the many biomarkers proposed for several eye and systemic diseases, the extent of translation to well-characterized and clinically useful tools has been largely insufficient. As for most of other biofluids, the road from discovery to clinical application is still long and full of pitfalls. In this review, we discuss the proteomic approaches used in the characterization of tear protein and peptide content, recapitulating the main studies and the progress done. We also present a brief summary of the path from discovery to clinical application of tear protein markers, with some representative examples of translation from the bench to the bedside. In this review we cover the most relevant proteomic approaches used in the characterization of the tear proteome, and for the first time we also focus in advances performed in the nowadays emerging peptide content characterization.

His pioneering biometric results have been largely confirmed by modern studies. Those on the changes in the crystalline lens with age are particularly striking and suggest that these ocular aging effects have changed little over the last 300 years.

We identified 20 studies evaluating services for Indigenous populations in Australia (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9), Canada (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ7), and the United States of America (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4). Common services included diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening through fundus photographs acquired in local primary health care clinics (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ7) or by mobile teams (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ6), and general eye care through teleophthalmology (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2), outreach ophthalmology (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2) or an Indigenous health care clinic optometrist (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1). These services were economically favourable in 85% of comparisons with conventional alternatives, mainly through reduced costs of travel, in-person consults, and vision loss. Only four studies assessed the benefits of increased patient uptake. Only five included patient evaluations, but none integrated these into their quantitative analysis. Methodological issues included no stated economic perspective (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ10), no sensitivity analysis (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ12), no discounting (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ9), inappropriate measurement of costs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ13) or outcomes (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ5), and unjustified assumptions (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ15). Several Indigenous eye care services are cost-effective, particularly remote DR screening. Other services are promising but require evaluation, with attention to avoid common methodological pitfalls. Well-designed evaluations can guide the allocation of scarce resources to services with demonstrated effectiveness and sustainability.

To fill this gap, we characterize trends in ophthalmology-related patents in the United States from 2005 to 2020. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Publicly available patent data from the US Patent and Trademark Office was analyzed with the R programming language. Ophthalmology-related patents were identified with a keyword search of their titles and claims text. Temporal trends were assessed with the Mann-Kendall trend test (Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05, two-sided). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of 4.5 million collected patents, some 21,000 (0.5%) were ophthalmology related. The number of annually granted ophthalmology patents increased over time (Mann-Kendall test: <i>z</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.91; <i>P</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), from 619 patents released in 2005 to 2,019 patents in 2020. Patent counts also increased over time for all ophthalmic subspecialties except oculoplastics, with steepest rises in retina (<i>z</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.91; <i>P</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and cornea (<i>z</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.64; <i>P</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The most cited patents were in biocompatible intraocular implants and implantable controlled-release drug delivery systems, which underscores particular advancement in therapeutic efficacy and safety in devices used in the treatment and management of common yet debilitating eye conditions. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This exploratory analysis reveals hotspots for ophthalmology-related innovation in the United States that may predict current and future growth trends in device development and pharmacologic advancement in ophthalmology, paving the way for more diverse and effective treatment options for preserving vision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37192496/"}

A total of 169 consecutive patients (217 eyes) with vitreoretinal disease presenting with a history of photopsias. A total of 217 eyes with photopsias in 169 patients were evaluated. Photopsia assessment included (1) laterality (unilateral, bilateral but not simultaneous, bilateral, and simultaneous); (2) morphology (flash, zig-zag, strobe, scintillating scotoma, twinkling, other); (3) color (white, silver, yellow, combination, other); (4) location (temporal, central, other); (5) duration (quick, prolonged, constant, other); (6) frequency; (7) diurnal appearance (day, night, both); (8) stimuli (turning head or eyes, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, other); and (9) associated systemic or ocular signs and symptoms (headache, numbness, weakness, vertigo, syncope, diplopia, hypotension, floaters, other). Clinical photopsia features correlated with the causes of photopsias. Thirty-two photopsia causes were identified. The top 16 included posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in 39.7% of eyes; retinal tear in 8.9% of eyes; neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 7.9% of eyes; rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in 7.5% of eyes; classic and ophthalmic migraine in 6.5% of eyes; hypoglycemia in 2.8% of eyes; vertebrobasilar insufficiency in 2.8% of eyes; non-AMD choroidal neovascularization in 2.3% of eyes; retinitis pigmentosa in 1.9% of eyes; severe cough in 1.9% of eyes; central serous chorioretinopathy in 1.4% of eyes; intraocular lens reflections in 0.9% of eyes; blue field entoptic phenomenon in 0.9% of eyes; Charles Bonnet syndrome in 0.9% of eyes; digitalis in 0.9% of eyes; and metastatic adenocarcinoma to the brain in 0.9% of eyes. The photopsias associated with PVD are typically quick (96%), with lightning/flash morphology (96%), white (87%), temporally located (86%), associated with new-onset floaters (85%), preferentially seen in dark (90%) rather than lighted environments (29%), and often initiated by head/eye movements (60%). Retinal detachment had a similar profile, but with more nontemporal photopsias (40%) (P = 0.01). The photopsias from neovascular AMD are more centrally located (83%), quick and repetitive (79%), seen in light (73%) and dark (63%) environments, have no inciting stimuli (84%), and are more likely to be nonwhite (40%).

The indirect ophthalmoscopes tested appear to be \"safe\" under moderate voltage settings, provided exposure is reasonably brief. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the fundus, however, merits caution. It produces a three-times-higher retinal irradiance than the indirect ophthalmoscope. Overhead surgical lamps produce a retinal irradiance about one-third that of the indirect ophthalmoscope (for clear media and dilated pupil). This could be dangerous, since an operation may take long enough to exceed the maximal permissible exposure by several orders of magnitude.

A small aperture limits the width of light beams entering the eye, thus increasing the depth of focus. The pinhole effect has also been used in spectacles, contact lenses, corneal inlays, and intraocular lenses (IOLs) to improve reading by compensating for loss of accommodative function. Pinhole spectacles improve near visual acuity, but reduce reading speed, increase interblink interval, and decrease tear break-up time. For contact lenses and IOLs, pinhole devices are usually used in the nondominant eye, which allow compensation of various refractive errors and decrease spectacle dependence. Pinhole corneal inlays are implanted during laser in situ keratomileusis or as a separate procedure. Pinhole IOLs are gaining popularity, particularly as they do not bring a risk of a local inflammatory reaction as corneal inlays do. Disadvantages of using the pinhole effect include high susceptibility to decentration, decrease in retinal luminance levels, and difficulties in performing fundus examinations or surgery in eyes with implanted devices. There are also concerns regarding perceptive issues with different retinal illuminances in the 2 eyes (the Pulfrich effect).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38133648/"}

Using partial correlation coefficients, we found that when we corrected for the amount of recession from the insertion, there was not a significant correlation between the response to surgery and the amount the muscles were recessed from the corneoscleral limbus. This suggests that the apparent correlation between the response to surgery and the amount of recession from the corneoscleral limbus simply reflects that the greater the recession from the corneoscleral limbus, the farther the muscle is likely to end up posterior to the insertion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2597066/"}

By comparison, serendipity can lead to new directions that branch into different paths. Herein, I describe a diverse series of findings that were motivated by hypotheses, but driven by serendipity. I summarize how investigations into vision-guided ocular growth in the chick eye led to the identification of glucagonergic amacrine cells as key regulators of ocular elongation. Studies designed to assess the impact of the ablation of different types of neurons on vision-guided ocular growth led to the finding of numerous proliferating cells within damaged retinas. These proliferating cells were M√ºller glia-derived retinal progenitors with a capacity to produce new neurons. Studies designed to investigate M√ºller glia-derived progenitors led to the identification of a domain of neural stem cells that form a circumferential marginal zone (CMZ) that lines the periphery of the retina. Accelerated ocular growth, caused by visual deprivation, stimulated the proliferation of CMZ progenitors. We formulated a hypothesis that growth-regulating glucagonergic cells may regulate both overall eye size (scleral growth) and the growth of the retina (proliferation of CMZ cells). Subsequent studies identified unusual types of glucagonergic neurons with terminals that ramify within the CMZ; these cells use visual cues to control equatorial ocular growth and the proliferation of CMZ cells. Finally, while studying the signaling pathways that stimulate CMZ and M√ºller glia-derived progenitors, serendipity led to the discovery of a novel type of glial cell that is scattered across the inner retinal layers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21960640/"}

The first member of the VEGF(xxx)b family to be isolated was VEGF(165)b. It can significantly reduce preretinal neovascularization without inhibition of physiological intraretinal angiogenesis.

Patients newly diagnosed with Beh√ßet's disease, seen from January 1990 to December 1998 at H√¥pital Jules Gonin, La Source Eye Center, and the Division of Immunology and Allergy, University of Lausanne, were analyzed. The Japanese diagnostic criteria for Beh√ßet's disease were used and both complete and incomplete forms were included. Incidence, proportion of cases with ocular involvement, and the characteristics of ocular disease were determined. During the follow-up period, a total of 35 Beh√ßet's patients were seen in the three study centers. Twenty-five of these patients had ocular involvement. The incidences of Beh√ßet's disease and Beh√ßet's ocular disease in the western part of Switzerland, with a referral population of roughly 600000 persons, were 0.65 and 0.46 per 100000 per year, respectively.

The most frequent sign was oral aphthous involvement (86%), followed by ocular manifestations (72%). The HLA-B51 antigen was present in 66% of the patients with ocular involvement. Panuveitis was present in 20/25 patients (80%), anterior uveitis in 3/25 patients, and posterior involvement in 2/25 patients. Twenty-two patients (88%) had systemic treatment that always included corticosteroids; it was associated with other treatments in 17/22 patients.

This alternative gene therapy consists of multiple elements including the choice of target retinal cells, optogenetic tools, and gene delivery systems. Currently, there are various options for each element, all of which have been developed as a product of technological success. In particular, the performance of optogenetic tools in terms of light and wavelength sensitivity have been improved by engineering microbial opsins and applying human opsins. To provide better post-treatment vision, the optimal choice of optogenetic tools and effective gene delivery to retinal cells is necessary.

Fifty consecutive eyes (50 patients) with ARMD and subfoveal neovascularization who underwent a FMT in our department from January 1999 to July 2000 are included in this study. Compensatory muscle surgery, as described by Eckardt and associates, was performed on all the eyes. The median follow-up is 21 months (range, 12 to 36; SD, 5.4). The best-corrected postoperative visual acuity (BCVA) was improved by 2 or more Snellen lines in 33 eyes (66%) and remained stable (+/-1 line) in 14 eyes (28%). Only 3 eyes (6%) experienced a deterioration of the BCVA of 2 or more lines. The final BCVA was 20/50 or better in 32% of the cases; only 8 eyes (16%) had a final BCVA < 20/200.

Although the underlying mechanism is obscure, a slowly progressive \"creeping\" chronic angle-closure is postulated, but gonioscopic evaluation is difficult due to the shallow anterior chamber, with grade I and slit angles. Response to medical treatment is poor and miotics may even make the condition worse by producing relative pupillary block and by relaxing the lens zonule. Ordinary glaucoma surgery is to be avoided in nanophthalmos because of the fear of postoperative ciliary-block malignant glaucoma. Periopheral iridectomy performed in five eyes at an advanced stage of the chronic angle-closure did not facilitate glaucoma control in three eyes, and in two eyes in which the operation was combined with posterior sclerotomy, the eyes became blind from vitreous hemorrhage. Lenx extraction in five eyes controlled the glaucoma but was followed by choroidal effusion and nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachements in two eyes and blindness in another eye when combined with a posterior sclerotomy. No firm therapeutic recommendations can be made on the basis of the author's experience in the six reported cases. Conventional medical therapy seems ineffectual even when begun early in the glaucoma. Conventional glaucoma surgery must be performed early, before permanent damage to the outflow mechanism occurs but removal of the lens must be anticipated. The surgeon must also remain aware of the high incidence of serious posterior-segment complications which inexplicably follow glaucoma or lens surgery in nanophthalmos, as described by Brockhurst.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1246819/"}

The goal of this study was to characterize the development of visual texture segregation using texture segregation visual evoked potentials (tsVEPs) in children born full-term and children born preterm without major neurological impairment. Forty-five full-term and 43 preterm children were tested at either 12, 24 or 36 months of age (corrected age for prematurity at 12 and 24 months old). VEPs were obtained using two lower-level stimuli defined by orientation (oriVEP) and two higher-level stimuli defined by texture (texVEP). TsVEP was obtained by dividing by two the subtraction of oriVEP from texVEP. Results show a clear maturation of the processes underlying visual texture segregation in the full-term group, with a significant N2 latency reduction between 12 and 36 months of age for all conditions. Significant N2 amplitude reduction was observed for oriVEP between 12 and 24 months, as well as for texVEP between 12 and 24 months, and 12 and 36 months. Comparison between full-term and preterm children indicated significantly lower N2 amplitude for the preterm group at 12 months for oriVEP and texVEP. These differences were no longer apparent at 24 months of age, suggesting that children born preterm catch up with their full-term counterparts somewhere between 12 and 24 months of age. Our results appear to reflect a maturational delay in preterm children in both lower-level and higher-level visual processing during, at least, early childhood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25976298/"}

Current ophthalmic applications of PBM can be categorised into established and exploratory therapies, differentiated primarily by the attainment of regulatory approval. Established applications of PBM include the treatment of dry eye disease and nonexudative age-related macular degeneration, while the use of PBM is still largely exploratory in conditions such as diabetic macular oedema and retinopathy of prematurity. Regardless of the level of regulatory authorisation, the application of PBM in each ophthalmic condition presents with distinct challenges requiring further research for comprehensive validation.

The deficits seen in strabismic amblyopes raise the possibility that the neural impairment in amblyopia is derived from a single continuum, varying in degree. The absence of stimulation of the size-selective detectors processing high spatial frequencies accounts for the shape of the contrast sensitivity curve in congenital nystagmus. Glaucomatous or multiple sclerosis patients show early deficits in medium range spatial frequencies where the sensitivity is the highest.

Expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and M√ºller glia, the retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) can act as an alternative visual cycle photoisomerase, photogenerating 11cRAL in bright light conditions. While named a G protein-coupled receptor, RGR has no known coupled G protein. In the photoisomerase process, RGR bound all-trans-retinal (atRAL) is converted to 11cRAL. Here, we review how this core reaction integrates into RPE and M√ºller cell visual cycles. Significantly, mutations in human RGR are associated with inherited retinal degeneration and age-related macular degeneration, ocular diseases impairing vision.

For nucleic acid ligands in general, and aptamers in particular, the eye has historically been an attractive site for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we recount the discovery and early development of three aptamers designated for use in ophthalmology, one approved (Macugen), and two in late-stage development (Fovista and Zimura). Every one of these molecules was originally intended for other indications. Key improvements in technology, specifically with regard to libraries used for in vitro selection and subsequent chemical optimization of aptamers, have played an important role in allowing the identification of development candidates with suitable properties. The lessons learned from the selection of these molecules are valuable for informing us about the many remaining opportunities for aptamer-based therapeutics in ophthalmology as well as for identifying additional indications for which aptamers as a class of therapeutics have distinct advantages.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26757406/"}

The ophthalmological examination was performed using the semi-automated devices, VX 650 and Eye Refract, by the medical and paramedical staff of the penitentiary, who were not qualified in ophthalmology. The primary endpoint was a composite feasibility criterion, allowing validation of the telemedicine encounter. It assessed a combination of interpretable intraocular pressure, fundus photography, slit-lamp examination and consistent visual acuity. Ninety-six patients participated in the study, with a mean age of 41years. The primary endpoint was achieved for 78 telemedicine encounters (81.3%). Sixty-two encounters (64.6%) were validated without the need for an in-person consultation. In our study, 34 patients (35.4%) required a second, in-person examination. This was mainly due to two criteria for requesting an in-person visit (iridocornealangle analysis and subjective refraction errors).

Pre-tested questionnaires were administered to all district-level blindness officials and ophthalmology training institutions during April 2002-March 2003. Supplementary data sources were used wherever necessary. Data analysis was done in Stata 8.0. Projections of the existing ophthalmologists and dedicated eye beds were made for the entire country using the mean, median and range for each individual state. The response rate was 89.3%. More than half the eye care facilities were located in the private sector. Sixty-nine per cent of the ophthalmologists were employed in the private and non-governmental sectors; 71.5% of all dedicated eye beds were managed by these two sectors. Five states (Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) had half the practising ophthalmologists in India. There was a wide disparity in access to ophthalmologists and dedicated eye beds across the country. Using the median to obtain medium projections, it is estimated that there are 9478 practising ophthalmologists and 59 828 dedicated eye beds in India. India will be able to meet the requirements for trained ophthalmologists and dedicated eye beds to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. Some states will need special attention.

It has devastating effects on quality of life and independence and is becoming a major public health concern. Current treatment options are limited and most aim to slow progression rather than restore vision; therefore, early detection to identify those patients most suitable for these interventions is essential. In this work, we review the literature encompassing the investigation of visual function in ARM in order to highlight those visual function parameters which are affected very early in the disease process. We pay particular attention to measures of acuity, contrast sensitivity (CS), cone function, electrophysiology, visual adaptation, central visual field sensitivity and metamorphopsia. We also consider the impact of bilateral late ARM on visual function as well as the relationship between measures of vision function and self-reported visual functioning. Much interest has centred on the identification of functional changes which may predict progression to neovascular disease; therefore, we outline the longitudinal studies, which to date have reported dark-adaptation time, short-wavelength cone sensitivity, colour-match area effect, dark-adapted foveal sensitivity, foveal flicker sensitivity, slow recovery from glare and slower foveal electroretinogram implicit time as functional risk factors for the development of neovascular disease. Despite progress in this area, we emphasise the need for longitudinal studies designed in light of developments in disease classification and retinal imaging, which would ensure the correct classification of cases and controls, and provide increased understanding of the natural course and progression of the disease and further elucidate the structure-function relationships in this devastating disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16580242/"}

{"id": "12361166", "title": "Aberration generation by contact lenses with aspheric and asymmetric surfaces.", "text": "We explored the potential of aberration correction in the human eye by using a new generation of soft contact lenses with aspheric and asymmetric surfaces. Soft contact lens samples were designed with one asymmetrical surface (front) and one spherical (back) to produce predetermined amounts of desired pure defocus, astigmatism, trefoil, coma, and spherical aberration. Contact lens wavefront aberrations were measured ex vivo using a Fizeau-Tolanski interferometer and compared with the in vivo wavefronts obtained by subtracting the aberrations of the eye with and without the contact lenses. These second set of measurements were obtained using a Shack-Hartmann sensor. We found that an aberration-free contact lens sample induced in the eye a small amount of residual aberration. We obtained a good match between the ex vivo and in vivo wavefront measurements for most of the samples of the contact lenses. The aberrations generated by soft contact lenses on the eye were predictable. Rotations and translations of the contact lenses with respect to correct position on the eye were, however, the main limitation for precise correction of the ocular aberrations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12361166/"}

Development of practice algorithms.", "text": "Appropriate access to the best quality of vision care is enhanced when patients receive eye care services from the right professional, at the right time, and in the right place. This paper, the first in a two-part series, describes the development of an integrated framework for vision care delivery. Specifically, two patient-centred vision care algorithms for the multidisciplinary management of diabetic retinopathy and the red eye are outlined, and the process that resulted in their development is described. The method used relies on a description of a multidisciplinary collaboration that occurred among ophthalmologists, optometrists, general practitioners and representatives of the Nova Scotia Department of Health with the aim of developing an integrated patient-focused multidisciplinary framework for vision care delivery. The process of collaborative negotiation among the four groups resulted in the development of multidisciplinary algorithms for the screening of patients with diabetes mellitus and the treatment of those presenting with a red eye. Professional scope of practice has always been a contentious issue among health care professions. However, where parties agree to work within an atmosphere of respect and to accept guidance in areas of disagreement from a third party respected by all, compromise is possible. The result was the development of two vision care algorithms and ongoing efforts on the development of other algorithms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15180137/"}

Results show that the various viewing conditions which arise (depending on whether or not the refractive correction is worn) can differ considerably. The uncorrected unaccommodating myope has a greater EVP than the equivalent power of the magnifier if he chooses a magnifier-to-eye distance shorter than the focal length of the magnifier. In this situation, field of view is also enhanced. The uncorrected unaccommodating hyperope using a magnifier-to-eye distance longer than the focal length of the magnifier achieves a stronger EVP than the equivalent power of the magnifier. However, field of view is then reduced. For the uncorrected unaccommodating spherical ametrope, the use of a magnifier-to-eye distance corresponding to the focal length of the magnifier seems to be a good compromise between EVP, field of view, and working distance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1436998/"}

Retrospective noncomparative analysis of a consecutive case series with patient recall and examination. Eleven patients (six female, five male, median age, 9.6 years; range, 1-29 years) with 12 limbal dermoids in 11 eyes operated on between 1995 and 1998 were identified from the eye bank database at the Singapore National Eye Centre. Case records, photographs, and eye bank data were examined. Patients not already seen by the authors within the previous 3 months were recalled and examined. Descriptive data: size and location of the dermoid, presence of lipid keratopathy; visual acuity; refraction and astigmatism, vector analysis, surgically induced refractive change; corneoscleral and limbal match, haze, vascularity; graft integrity, clarity, vascularization, and rejection episodes. Most (7 of 11) patients had single inferotemporal limbal dermoids, although one patient had two dermoids in one eye. Median follow-up time was 21.6 months (range, 9.0-46.4 months). Most (8 of 11) patients had good or excellent cosmetic results with minimal interface haze and no vascularization. Two cases with previously excised lesions had postoperative vascularization develop. One of these cases had graft infection develop, underwent subsequent debridement, and has an opaque graft. Best-corrected visual acuity was maintained or slightly improved in 9 of 11 patients. For the group and most individual patients, mean astigmatism, spherical equivalent, and refraction, as assessed by surgically induced refractive change and h-vector analysis, were not significantly changed. Lamellar keratoplasty as primary surgery for limbal dermoids gave good cosmetic results. However, improvement in refractive, astigmatic, and visual status is not guaranteed, and these procedures should be viewed more cautiously, although established good vision was maintained in our series.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11581063/"}
