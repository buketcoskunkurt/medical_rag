This is, in part, owing to constantly changing treatment patterns; but at the same time, the underlying framework that determines standards of care is continuously evolving. This situation presents clear challenges for all practicing physicians, including ophthalmologists. Complicating the issue of defining a standard of care are the confusing origins and lexicon used to describe 3 related yet distinct ideas: standard of care, practice guidelines, and gold standards. Indeed, each of these terms is defined and influenced by many stakeholders both inside and outside the health care system. The term standard of care is one example that, although used frequently as a medical term, is often decided by courts and industry. Ophthalmology itself has provided one of the most influential cases in standard-of-care law history (Helling v Carey), which standardized the routine use of tonometry after the plaintiff lost vision because of a delayed glaucoma diagnosis. But even the courts' current view of standard of care is far different than it was at that defining moment in eye care history. Today, health care professionals typically equate standard of care with best clinical practices, and yet the law specifies a standard of minimal competence when determining standard of care. These competing definitions are, at best, misleading and, at worst, counterproductive. This narrative review examines how medical guidelines are developed, formalized, communicated, and adopted in the United States. It seeks to clarify ophthalmologists' understanding of the related but distinct ideas of standard of care, practice guidelines, and gold standards.

Neurotrophic keratopathy is not primarily an inflammatory condition, as suggested by the term ‟neurotrophic keratitis.\" The epitheliopathy in this condition is a consequence of the dysregulated epithelial cell migration, differentiation, and homeostasis that occurs with denervation of the ocular surface. Although this epitheliopathy may be complicated by poor lid closure, or rarely, aqueous tear deficiency, most of these eyes are not dry and do not require exogenous lubrication for comfort, prophylaxis, or healing. The use of topical agents in these eyes inevitably leads to unrecognized iatrogenic injury, with poor outcomes because of inherently poor wound healing and delays in seeking medical care. Tarsorrhaphy is a time-honored method of protecting the neurotrophic cornea, shielding the eye from iatrogenic injury.

Alternatively, it is conceivable to search, in an undirected screening approach, for chemical compounds affecting disease outcome. For both approaches, there is an urgent need for in vitro and, ideally, in vivo disease models that adequately reflect the site of pathology. Currently available animal models possess limitations as they often develop only defined aspects of disease. Primary cell cultures, derived from the posterior pole of the eye, can only be obtained after invasive surgery or are available post mortem, but due to rapid cell senescence are not suited for long-term analysis. Immortalized retinal cell lines, on the other hand, differ in many aspects from native cells. In this situation, a promising alternative could arise from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This cell species can be generated via non-invasive techniques, they are patient-specific, can be propagated indefinitely, and theoretically can be differentiated in all types of retinal cells due to their pluripotent capacities. Importantly, the iPSC-derived retinal cells greatly resemble native cells in many characteristic traits. In this review we present a selection of established in vivo und in vitro models for retinal degenerative disease. We also discuss the potential of iPSCs for personalized in vitro modelling and provide an overview of existent iPSC-derived cell types of the posterior pole, particularly for cells of the retinal pigment epithelium.

{"id": "40120030", "title": "Innovative approaches to treatment of eye diseases: advances in stem cell therapy use in ophthalmology.", "text": "The human eye, a photo-sensory organ with an array of neuronal and tissue networks, remains susceptible to damage from various diseases and disorders despite its being a flawless masterpiece. It is estimated that over 2 billion people suffer from vision loss with common causative factors such as; age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and infections amongst others. The use of Orthodox procedures has only helped mitigate the pathology; however, it doesn't serve any substantial curative purpose. More recently, the incorporation of new therapies via ocular delivery of nanomaterials and stem cell intervention has helped to change tides in the treatment of various ophthalmic pathologies. This review provides an overview of the current trends and breakthroughs in ophthalmology via stem cell therapy, with emphasis on its types, mechanisms, applications, and benefits. Mesenchymal stem cells which can arise from embryonic or adult origin possess some immunomodulatory effects that contribute to the therapeutic relevance of the MSCs and the ability to evade rejection from the host. However, the major drawback has been uncontrolled growth which can result in unintended side effects. Moreso, religious and ethical issues concerning the employment of MSCs from embryonic origin have also hindered clinical progression with its use. The use of stem cell therapy in the treatment of eye pathologies which is still undergoing clinical trials has shown to be a more viable treatment approach in ophthalmology as it targets retinal degenerative diseases thereby offering novel pathways for vision restoration. And also serves as a revolutionary alternative for treating severe ocular diseases. Stem cell delivery techniques might be quite cumbersome as the eye is a very delicate organ. The therapeutic interventional technique employed is aimed to ensure the reduction or absence of undesired effects in the deposition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) being the stem cells. Techniques such as hydrogel-based injectables, which offer delivery of the APIs to the desired site of action without change in the physicochemical properties of the drug molecule, the scaffold delivery techniques, and the use of 3D bio-printing which can be used to develop scaffolds for retinal degeneration. The employment of artificial intelligence and machine learning in stem cell therapy has shown to be very fast and efficient in stem cell delivery and preventing likely human errors. Unlike conventional treatments that often focus on managing symptoms, stem cells have the unique ability to repair and regenerate damaged tissues, addressing the root causes of the diseases. However, limitations due to economic, regulatory, and ethical challenges have posed barriers to advancing stem cell therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120030/"}

More than about 2/3 are working in urban areas and less than 1/2 in rural areas. There were no eye sub-specialists like retina or paediatric ophthalmologists at all. The reason for the lack of eye doctors and ophthalmic technicians is the prolonged war conditions in Afghanistan as well as professional migrations and missing good management. One of two clinics in Northern Afghanistan was able to practice intraocular operations. Because of the incredible situation in old reconstructed buildings, there was no evidence of clinical hygiene, but nevertheless they performed mainly cataract and glaucoma surgery. Despite the ridiculous situation of hygiene in the theatre, there was not a higher rate of intraocular infections. The international assistance mission (IAM) NOOR project has been the most successful programme in eye care in Afghanistan since war started 30 years ago. There is a need for more support in Government centres with the help of ISAF initiating funds and technical equipment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19206042/"}

Many patients are self-referred or referred non-specifically by other physicians. Ophthalmologic practice is like primary care, with a large throughput of patients, many of whom are normal. The ophthalmologist uses sophisticated instruments and does lengthy and difficult examinations in the private office, when gathering data on which to base medical judgments in the search for patients with serious disease.

In this work, the main focus was on the experiences and assessments of teachers in ophthalmology during the winter semester 2020/2021. By means of two anonymous surveys via online questionnaires, the lecturers in ophthalmology of German university hospitals as well as internal and external lecturers and staff members of the student teaching of the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center Mainz were asked about their experiences with the implementation of digital teaching. In this context 95% of the teaching staff of ophthalmology departments of university hospitals in Germany stated that they had established digital teaching concepts at the latest since the corona pandemic. Hybrid formats with a proportion of face-to-face teaching were used by 68%. A wide variety of teaching formats were used. Difficulties were also encountered, particularly in interaction with students. Despite predominantly digital teaching, examinations continued to be held in face-to-face settings; only 18% of respondents stated that they had conducted online examinations. In the future, 86% of respondents want to integrate digital formats into their teaching concepts and establish them as a supplement to existing face-to-face teaching.

Training can mitigate the associated problems in the future, but currently only 42% of practices provide training. A survey of a sample of large ophthalmic centers was conducted to test the hypothesis that larger practices and MVZs provide disproportionate training. In addition, an interaction between ownership (physician-owned (äE); third-party owned (F)) and training engagement was evaluated. In a questionnaire-based complete survey (2022) of large ophthalmic centers of different ownerships organized in a network, the training rate by main operating site (HBS), the number of MFA trainees (MFA-A) per HBS, staffing problems and planned change in training commitment were collected. The distribution measures of the quantitative data were analyzed overall and separately by sponsoring organization and tested for significance.Results were compared to data from a representative survey (2020/2021) of all practices and MVZs. In order to determine the proportion of all ophthalmic MFA-A accounted for by the sample, their total number was determined in an extrapolation. The training rate of the total of 100 HBS of the 14 surveyed centers (11 äE, 3 F) of the sample was 82% (äE: 93%, F: 79%), which was higher than the representative survey (41%). In the sample, there were on average 5.9 MFA-A per HBS (äE: 5.6, F: 7.1), in the comparative survey 1.5. 50% of the centers in the sample reported staffing problems, 25% wanted to expand their training commitment; the comparative values of the representative survey were 11% for both parameters. Stratified by sponsorship, neither training rate nor MFA-A per HBS showed significant differences. According to projections, there were nearly 1,966 MFA-A working in ophthalmology in 2021, of which 19.5% were at centers in the study population. Of all the MFA-A in the sample, 71% were at the significantly larger centers by number of HBS owned by third-party.

Survival of professions, be they classically or economically defined, is linked to societal needs, a profession's unique commitment and ability to provide services to society, and the profession's maintenance of knowledge as well as skill-based services. Historical evidence has shown erosion of a profession's power consequent to capitalist influences, government influences, access of skills by less trained individuals, and elitist posturing by a profession. Comparative evidence has shown societal acceptance of an escalation of salaries for designated superstars, increasing roles and influence of managerial personnel, and trivialization of values other than economic ones.

Our dataset comprised 260 multiple-choice questions sourced from two question-answer banks designed to assess ophthalmic knowledge: the American Academy of Ophthalmology's (AAO) Basic and Clinical Science Course (BCSC) Self-Assessment program and OphthoQuestions. Our RAG pipeline retrieves documents in the BCSC companion textbook using ChromaDB, followed by reranking with Cohere to refine the context provided to the LLMs. Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-4-turbo and 3 open-source models (Llama-3-70B, Gemma-2-27B, and Mixtral-8 × 7B) are benchmarked using zero-shot, zero-shot with Chain-of-Thought (zero-shot-CoT), and RAG. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy on the two datasets. Quantization is applied to improve the efficiency of the open-source models. Effects of quantization level are also measured. Using RAG, GPT-4-turbo's accuracy increased by 11.54% on BCSC and by 10.96% on OphthoQuestions. Importantly, the RAG pipeline greatly enhances overall performance of Llama-3 by 23.85%, Gemma-2 by 17.11%, and Mixtral-8 × 7B by 22.11%. Zero-shot-CoT had overall no significant improvement on the models' performance. Quantization using 4 bit was shown to be as effective as using 8 bits while requiring half the resources. Our work demonstrates that integrating RAG significantly enhances LLM accuracy especially for smaller LLMs. Using our RAG, smaller privacy-preserving open-source LLMs can be run in sensitive and resource-constrained environments, such as within hospitals, offering a viable alternative to cloud-based LLMs like GPT-4-turbo.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40938068/"}

A retrospective analysis was conducted of the performance of 1046 American Board of Ophthalmology diplomates on Practice Improvement Modules between September 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. The mean baseline scores for each process or outcome measure on a medical record abstraction were calculated before and after the practice improvement activity. Paired t tests were used to assess improvement before and after the activity. Diplomates' comments and ratings of the usefulness of the activity in assisting them with quality improvement were also analyzed. Diplomate performance on process and outcome measures before and after a performance improvement activity and diplomate satisfaction that the activity met the stated goals of assistance with quality improvement in their practices. The 1046 American Board of Ophthalmology diplomates completed 1408 Practice Improvement Modules. When measures with participation by at least 20 diplomates were analyzed, there was improvement in 24 of 30 individual process measures (80.0%; 95% CI, 61.4%-92.3%) and in 7 of 18 individual outcome measures (38.9%; 95% CI, 17.3%-64.3%) chosen for improvement by diplomates. Analysis of the mean results for each diplomate on process measures chosen for improvement showed gains occurring in 9 of 12 modules and, for outcomes chosen for improvement, in 6 of 12 modules with at least 20 participants. A total of 826 of 1115 modules (74.1%) assessed by diplomates were rated from good to excellent; positive comments outnumbered negative ones by a ratio of 5:1. Quantitative and qualitative analyses, while limited by self-report that has not been validated, suggest that the American Board of Ophthalmology's Maintenance of Certification Part 4 can help diplomates improve quality on process, and to a lesser extent, outcome measures. Findings of this study may provide a basis to improve this activity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27442056/"}

It is a compendium of 600 extremely interesting pathological cases, some of them in form of letters to close colleagues. Ophthalmology is represented by quite a big chapter, one of them reports a successfully performed exenteratio orbitae because of a tumor. Further parts, for example, describe special ophthalmic twizzers with certain fixing mechanisms and some kind of an operation table equipped by an adjustable prop for the operator's arm. Fabricius points out that after perforation of the eye the loss of aqueous humour is not consequently noxious.

Facing a decreasing number of applications--in contrast to the need and importance of widespread ocular diseases--the working group \"young academics\" of the Deutsche Ophthalmologische Gesellschaft (DOG) assessed the perception of funding programmes and grants available. Young ophthalmologists think that they have poor prospects to receive funding by a DFG proposal. In comparison, specialist funding quotas show a stable development within the neurosciences over the last years. The sum of requested funding has a strong correlation with the total amount actually paid. By clarifying the number of funded proposals, the better transparency and communication for the existing programmes should improve the cooperativeness, the funding rate and number of applications in future.

In a video-based analysis by two fellowship-trained pediatric ophthalmologists, 42 surgical videos of pediatric ophthalmology consultants and 34 videos of fellows in training were graded based on the International Council of Ophthalmology's Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubrics (ICO-OSCAR). Six steps in surgery were analyzed: wound construction, anterior continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis, irrigation and aspiration, intraocular lens implantation, primary posterior capsulorrhexis with anterior vitrectomy, and wound suturing. Cohen's Kappa was used to rate inter-observer agreement. Cohen's Kappa scores ranged from 0.6 to 0.8. The median scores for surgical steps for both analyzed groups were similar. The mean duration of surgery was shorter for consultants (24 minutes, range: 10 to 45 minutes) than for fellows (40 minutes, range: 15 to 70 minutes). The median age of patients operated on by consultants was younger (24 months, range: 2 to 180 months) than fellows (58 months, range: 10 to 150 months).

{"id": "29140824", "title": "Beginnings of Astigmatism Understanding and Management in the 19th Century.", "text": "Within the last 200 years, the perception of astigmatism has evolved from that of an infrequent and peculiar defect of the eye to a distortion almost as common as spherical refractive errors. Most of the significant findings on this condition were made in the 19th century, including the first description by Thomas Young (1773-1829) and the introduction of the treatment methods used today. The purpose of this study was to investigate the milestones in the understanding and management of astigmatism that occurred up to the year 1900. This fascinating history illustrates how knowledge evolves across time, geographical areas, and interdisciplinary boundaries. The first article looking at the use of a cylindrical lens to correct astigmatism was written by George Airy (1801-1892) in 1825. The term \"astigmatism\" was introduced in by William Whewell (1794-1866) in 1846. Methods for subjective and objective evaluation were subsequently established, including the introduction of a cross cylinder, keratoscope, astigmatic dial, and the development of retinoscopy and ophthalmoscopy. In the last two decades of the 19th century, the first attempt to alter the refraction in astigmatic patients by changing the shape of the cornea was made. It must be noted that diverse challenges were encountered in this field on the way to the development of a treatment, including the technical manufacture of a lens, the precise measurement of the refractive error, and understanding the optical properties of the eye. The importance of the 19th century was that interdisciplinary cooperation, such as that seen in this study, between physicists and astronomers, and mathematicians and physicians, led to the development of comprehensive knowledge on astigmatism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29140824/"}

The software system was primarily developed for private practices and cannot therefore meet the different requirements of various clinics out of the box. The purpose of this study was to identify features of the EMR beyond purely paper replacement that can assist in the clinical workflow and whether these features can be implemented in a running system. The EMR was specifically individualized with respect to the work processes and documentation requirements of the Department of Ophthalmology at the UKS. In addition to a seamless integration into the hospital information system (HIS) the modifications included changes in the structure and visual presentation of the EMR as well as functional extensions. An internet-based platform was set up to enable a direct exchange of appointments and patient data with specialist practices. Due to the introduction of a so-called ghost list the position of patients within the hospital who are allocated to a physician, e.g. for diagnostics, can be reconstructed at any point in time. The logging of the individual treatment times enables tracking of patient flow within the clinic and a reduction of waiting times. Existing paper documents particularly for the graphic recording of findings, such as sketches, are digitalized eliminating the need to scan documents. The UKS.AUGEN.NETZ is an internet-based portal to facilitate direct organization of appointments with specialist practitioners and for the exchange of digital examination data and medical correspondence. The permanent close cooperation between employees of the Department of Ophthalmology at the UKS and the manufacturer of the software enables a continuous optimization of the EMR in a fully operational clinical workflow. In addition, the web-based interface improves the cooperation between the hospital and private practices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30915525/"}

In small groups the students deepen their theoretical knowledge and learn more about ophthalmological diagnostic standard procedures. The \"objective structured clinical examination\" (OSCE) is known as a useful tool in the assessment of clinical skills. The OSCE is a well-established and valid examination method, but also time-consuming and costly. In form of a trial the OSCE was launched during the optional activity \"Look into my eyes, baby\"; in the summer semester 2009. By means of four examination areas established diagnostic methods in ophthalmology were tested. During the tests two simulation patients as well as two phantom heads for ophthalmological examinations were assessed. The preparation of the examination materials occurred in close collaboration with the department of ophthalmology and the division exam development of our university. In the assessment of the examinations a high value was set on good communication skills between students and simulation patients as well as on the professional handling of the student tasks. After the examinations the acceptance of the test methods was evaluated using a focused group interview between the students of the optional activity and the participating examiners. We performed two OSCEs involving three students each in the last two semesters. The OSCE was to a great extent time- and resource-consuming, due to the intensive pre- and post-reviewing and the time students needed to pass the various examination areas. Students and examiners as well confirmed the validity of the assessment and acknowledged a positive effect on the students learning behaviour. The teaching staff members are willing to accept the OSCE, especially when the assessment procedures are thoroughly planned and well structured. The acceptance of the students can be achieved by providing valid assessment and reviewed teaching conditions. The high input in personnel and instrumental resources for the assessment and the student's individual supervision should be critically discussed in the light of the efficacy of the additional ongoing hospital and outpatient services and the personnel-relevant education budget assigned to the department of ophthalmology of a university.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21108167/"}

Review of published experimental and clinical studies. A review was undertaken of the work of multiple investigators leading to the invention of the laser, its biophysical effects on ocular tissues from which it derives its name (light-amplified stimulation of emitted radiation), and the development of various laser-based devices and methods to treat common ophthalmologic disorders, with particular emphasis on new and emerging retinal and anterior segment applications. Because the eye is optimized for the transmission of light and its transduction into neural signals, lasers are particularly well suited for ophthalmic therapy. This fact and the high demands for precision in therapy have inspired the development of highly sophisticated laser systems that have impacted the treatment of common diseases. These include diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal venous occlusive disease, retinopathy of prematurity, and optical aberrations including ametropia, cataract, and glaucoma, among others. Recent developments in scanning laser systems, including image-guided systems with eye tracking, real-time feedback, and ultra-short pulse durations, have enabled increased selectivity, precision, and safety in ocular therapy. However, improved outcomes have been associated with increased cost of medical care, and attention to and optimization of their cost effectiveness will continue to be required in the future.

However, in cases with protrusio bulbi or pronounced chemosis conjunctivae direct damaging contact of the cornea or conjunctiva on the one hand and the inside of the moisture-chamber-bandage on the other hand are possible. Since commercial moisture-chamber-bandages are not available with different internal radii, new methods are necessary to increase the distance between the bandage and the eye. A special pressure relieving foam dressing used in the therapy and prophylaxis of decubitus was prepared in such a way that a periocular attachment was enabled and an opening for the eye was left blank. This central opening was covered with a commercial moisture-chamber-bandage. Five test persons and two ventilated patients with protrusio bulbi and manifest lagophthalmus were treated with the modified moisture chamber. The relative humidity within the bandage was measured. The modified moisture chamber allows an individual adaptation to the periocular shape of the face and rises the level of the monoculus for about 7 mm. The internal relative humidity was for eight hours at 98% in both test persons and patients. All test persons felt more comfortable with the modified moisture chamber on their skin. The presented modified moisture chamber is a derivative of the commercial monoculus bandage for patients with sensitive protrusio bulbi.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10198880/"}

Effective use of digital technologies, such as automated semantic speech recognition (ASR) with automated extraction of diagnostically relevant information can provide a solution. The aim was to determine the extent to which ASR in conjunction with semantic information extraction for automated documentation of the doctor-patient dialogue (ADAPI) can be integrated into everyday clinical practice using the IVI routine as an example and whether patient care can be improved through process optimization. In a prospective monocentric study at the Sulzbach Eye Clinic, 50 patients were included in the period from 2020 to 2022. As part of a project funded by the \"Zentrale Initiative des Mittelstandes\" (ZIM), a demonstrator was developed with the consortium partners and integrated into the hospital information system (HIS). For qualitative and quantitative evaluation, a survey of patients was carried out using a questionnaire before and after implementation of the ADAPI module, supplemented by a determination of acceptance and possible time saving for users. The ADAPI module was successfully integrated into the HIS. The documentation of the findings and connection of the subsequent processes could be automated. An improvement in the DPC was reported for 13/50 patients (26%). The majority 35/50 (70%) did not notice any subjective change. The average duration of the conversation in the area of conventional documentation was 4.46 min (1-10 min) and 3.9 min with ADAPI (1-10 min). With respect to the quality of the conversation within the DPC, no relevant differences could be shown with both types of documentation; however, larger case numbers and other areas of application still need to be evaluated. In the long term, the use of automated documentation solutions will sustainably improve the efficiency, completeness and consistency of clinical documentation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39812666/"}

Of the participants 68 % were female,32 % were male (mean age 31.8 years), one third of the participants had children, 44.6 % worked at university institutions, 54.4 % at non-university institutions and 45.5 % considered themselves as well-trained. Deficits during residency training were seen in the field of neuro-ophthalmology and ophthalmic surgery. The evaluation of the residency in total revealed an overall average grade of 2.9 (\"satisfactory\"). Of the physicians 35.5 % reported to be actively involved in research projects and 21.9 % reported pursuing an academic career. Almost 50 % of the participant residents aimed to work in a private practice after residency and 15 % aimed to work at an university hospital. The present survey revealed representative data because of the acceptable return rate and participating residents from all different educational levels (1st to 5th year).

Mono-disperse solutions, poly-disperse solutions, gels, post mortem porcine and human eyes as well as healthy volunteers were studied. The detected signals were inverted into autocorrelation functions. We constructed three DLS devices appropriate for in vitro as well as in vivo examinations. In mono disperse solution precise disintegration rates could be calculated. In poly-disperse solutions, in gel and in the vitreous the results did not correlate with movements of individual particles but we could calculate characteristics of the complete scattering system. In vivo measurements demonstrated that DLS can be used in all human eye segments. DLS is a unique technique. With DLS the molecular composition of eye segments can be studied in living subjects. This can be used to understand the molecular basis of severe eye diseases. The presented data demonstrate that DLS delivers reproducible data from all eye segments. It is possible to study the molecular structures of eye segments in living subjects. The developed devices were proved successfully in vitro as well as in vivo. Limitations are the low specificity of DLS and its sensitivity to background noise.

The 10 most highly viewed pediatric and congenital cataract procedural videos published within the past 10 years were independently reviewed by three separate board-certified, fellowship-trained, practicing pediatric ophthalmologists. Videos were assessed for surgical competency on a 5-point Likert scale in six key areas as outlined in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's congenital cataract surgery guidelines. The teaching quality of the videos was also subjectively assessed based on multiple measures. The mean overall score was 3.93 ± 0.94 (range: 2.67 to 4.67). Only one video failed to receive an overall score of greater than 3, indicating incompetent overall surgical performance. No other video failed to have a mean competent score for any single individual technique. One video demonstrated potential patient safety concerns. Eighty percent of videos had adequate or better picture quality. Of the 10 most popular pediatric cataract surgical videos published on YouTube, all but one displayed competent overall surgical technique. Although viewers must always be wary because unvetted and potentially harmful videos may be published on the platform at any time, if used correctly, surgical content published on YouTube can be a helpful tool for ophthalmologic trainees. <b>[<i>J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus</i>. 2022;59(3):200-203.]</b>.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928771/"}

At least 1 NANOS member was contacted for each non-US nation in the NANOS membership roster. If there were multiple NANOS members from 1 country, multiple were contacted. If responses were received from more than 1 person from a single country, the first response received was used as the source data. The survey (in English) was emailed to 47 NANOS members from 31 countries. Twenty responses were received representing members from 15 nations. In all 15 nations, at least half of the neuro-ophthalmologists were trained as ophthalmologists. In 60% of nations, at least half of the neuro-ophthalmologists were trained internally, whereas in 33% of countries, at least half were trained in the United States. The number of physicians who practiced a significant amount of neuro-ophthalmology ranged from low (0.08/million, India) to high (3.10/million, Israel). Countries having the highest percentage of neuro-ophthalmologists exclusively practicing neuro-ophthalmology also were those with better patient access to neuro-ophthalmic care. Requirement of approval to see a neuro-ophthalmologist or for imaging studies requested by neuro-ophthalmologists was not typical. In most nations, academic neuro-ophthalmologists were paid a straight salary. In no nation were neuro-ophthalmologists paid more than another ophthalmic subspecialty. Individual national health care system designs and compensation models have had a profound influence on the rewards and challenges that face neuro-ophthalmologists. There seems to have been a connection between recognition of the discipline, financial rewards of neuro-ophthalmic practice, conditions that permit full-time neuro-ophthalmic practice, and patient access to care. A higher percentage of gross national product for health care did not seem to insure an adequate supply of neuro-ophthalmologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29286948/"}

Some 250 years after Georg Bartisch, Ammon reestablished Dresden as a major center of ophthalmology, through the creation of a teaching institute, the publication of influential periodicals, and his personal publication of important monographs and journal articles. Ammon's Zeitschrift für die Ophthalmologie (founded 1830) was only the third journal in history that had been entirely devoted to ophthalmology. His prize-winning treatise, De Iritide (1835), correctly categorized iritis and gave a detailed description of sympathetic ophthalmia. His beautiful color-plate atlas, Klinische Darstellungen (1838-1841), contains landmark descriptions of congenital eye anomalies and has been described by Norman as 'the best summary of the knowledge of diseases of the eye prior to the introduction of the ophthalmoscope.' Ammon made most of his literary contributions in ophthalmology but he also contributed to another emerging field, plastic surgery. His monograph, Die plastische Chirurgie (1842), critically and comprehensively surveyed the entire history and current practice of plastic surgery, one of the very first textbooks to achieve this goal. In his last monograph (1858) Ammon returned to the subject of embryology of the human eye and drew upon his 30 years of study. Before his death, two of his last papers reported ophthalmoscopic observations, demonstrating his exploration of the frontiers of ophthalmology that characterized his entire career.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11108119/"}

This study was a retrospective, observational study conducted in a tertiary eye care hospital in India. The study was conducted from March 2018 to October 2019 based on a structured phacoemulsification training program introduced in January 2019. The trainees enrolled in the phacoemulsification training program were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 33), who underwent training before the introduction of the structured program, and Group 2 (n = 29), who underwent the training after the introduction of the structured training program. Each trainee performed 20 cases. Group 1 training consisted of wet-lab and phacoemulsification surgeries. Group 2 training program comprised three modules over 5 weeks and a preassessment examination. Premodule 1 imparted cognitive skills; Module 1 was on structured wet-lab, Module 2 was about phacoemulsification step surgery, and Module 3 had independent complete surgeries. Group 2 also underwent compulsory Observation of cases being performed in the operation theater, surgical video recording review, and formative feedback. Mean OSCAR score comparison was done for both the groups. The OSCAR score was also calculated case-wise to obtain the learning curve with respect to the entry and exit levels, by classifying the trainees in each group as Novice, Beginner, Advanced Beginner, or Competent. A comparison of the posterior capsular rupture (PCR) rates and vision at discharge of all the cases was done. Group 2 had a significantly better mean OSCAR score than Group 1 (4.03 and 3.43, respectively; P < 0.001). The PCR rate of the cases was significantly lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 (9.14% and 20.30%, respectively; P < 0.001).

All consecutive POAG new patient visits were reviewed from each study site to determine physician adherence to the 13 major examination elements of the PPP. In phase 1 of the study, physician adherence rates for each of the recommended examination elements were combined and averaged for all groups. Averages for the collaborative were reported to each site, and each physician received his or her individual adherence rates. Physicians discussed strategies to improve overall adherence to the PPP. Adherence rates were collected in phase 2 to determine if feedback and sharing of strategies resulted in improved adherence.

We compared the performance of ChatGPT-4 in French and English on open-ended prompts using multimodal input data from retinal cases. GPT-4 was prompted in English and French using a public dataset containing 67 retinal cases from the ophthalmology education website OCTCases.com. The clinical case and accompanying ophthalmic images comprised the prompt, along with the open-ended question: \"What is the most likely diagnosis?\" Systematic prompting was used to identify and compare relevant factor(s) contributing to correct and incorrect responses. Diagnostic accuracy was the primary outcome, defined as the proportion of correctly diagnosed cases in French and English. Diagnoses were compared with the answer key on OCTCases to confirm correct or incorrect responses. Clinically relevant factors reported by the LLM as contributory to its decision-making were secondary endpoints. The diagnostic accuracies of GPT-4 in English and French were 35.8% and 28.4%, respectively (χ<sup>2</sup>, P=0.36).

Hippocrates and his followers were the first to introduce the hypothesis of a hereditary condition. Many ancient Greek physicians like Galen (ca 2nd AD) provided several definitions, while Paul of Aegina (625-690 AD) was the scholar who introduced a method to treat it. Paul used a full face mask and an oil lamb to guide the eyeballs toward the desired direction. It seems that this approach endured for centuries to come. During 11th century AD in Constantinople, the Byzantine scholar and politician Michael Constantine Psellus (ca 1020-1105 AD) composed a series of philosophical, religious, political and scientific treatises. Among his work stands a medical iambic didactic poem of 1732 lines, in which he had mentioned strabismus. Although he was not an oculist, he had managed to define strabismus. His definition was noted as such, \"Strabismus is caused by a spasm of the bodies which move (the eye balls) and the oblique tendency of the muscles\". Psellus was aware of the knowledge of the past and recorded what was still valid at that era, presenting a memorable definition.

The new building was the culmination of a decade of planning, persuasion, perseverance, and compromise. The previous facility was physically connected to the Harper Hospital in the Detroit Medical Center and began operation in 1974. A campaign to expand the Kresge Eye Institute started in 1979 when the dean of the medical school and the majority of the administrators and trustees agreed that expansion was justified, but there were many political and economic obstacles. After ten years of negotiation, when the situation seemed hopeless, fiscal problems threatened to close the Hutzel Hospital, a component of the Detroit Medical Center. The Medical Center Board agreed with the Hutzel Hospital trustees to sustain the Hutzel Hospital by transforming the hospital into a specialty hospital containing only three services: ophthalmology, orthopedics, and obstetrics. A new Kresge Eye Institute was approved on the condition that it be moved from the Harper Hospital to the Hutzel Hospital. By 1989, a four-story building connected to the Hutzel Hospital was completed. Although economic and political factors were more important than medical needs in obtaining the new building, the result was an institution of the appropriate size and scope to serve the ophthalmic needs of metropolitan Detroit and the Wayne State University School of Medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9476609/"}

The result of this favourable combination was the invention of the ophthalmoscope and the Handbook of Physiologic Optics. Those were the foundations of all physiological aspects of ophthalmology, which were taken up and completed by A. v. Graefe and his colleagues. The ophthalmoscope was invented on the occasion of his university-courses, when Helmholtz tried to explain the theory of the red reflex of the pupil. Stimulated by Helmholtz in the following year Ruete developed the method of indirect ophthalmoscopy. This method at once was simplified again by Helmholtz in an extraordinary way. These two publications by Helmholtz contain all further developments involved with the ophthalmoscopy as an anticipation. The Handbook of Physiologic Optics is the first encyclopedic monography of this topic. Many new inventions are extremely valuable for the practical requirements of ophthalmologists. The first chapter about dioptrics contains the description of the Ophthalmometer, a new instrument to measure the astigmatism. In the chapter about visual sensations a clear survey about light- and colour sense is given. The colour deficiencies which were found during the decades before are introduced as the most important arguments for the three-component-theory of human colour vision. The prototype of a telestereoscope is demonstrated in the third chapter about visual perception.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7996814/"}

He learned from him about treatment and examinations of the eye and the skills of various ophthalmic operations, and organization of work in his eye hospital. After that he founded the famous private Eye Clinic in Berlin, and became one of the greatest ophthalmologists of the 19th century.

Ocularists are now embarking on this fourth stage, but have considerable challenges to face before this stage is realized. Between ocularists and ophthalmologists there is a need for a genuine alliance in education as well as in health care delivery.

Perspective. Selected articles in ophthalmology and non-ophthalmology medical literature were reviewed, and commentary is provided based on the authors' experiences. Investment in ophthalmology appeals to private equity firms because of high procedural volumes, fragmented private practices, opportunities for real estate ownership, and an aging population in need of eye care. As a result, acquisition of private practices by large private equity companies has swelled since 2015. Metropolitan areas and practices that possess ambulatory surgical centers or a high proportion of retina surgeons receive the greatest investment. However, little objective data exist regarding the benefits of this trend. Initial research suggests that private equity ownership may have a negative impact on patient care through greater costs, shorter appointments, and fewer Medicare/Medicaid patients seen. Skeptics of private equity also highlight concerns that include financial risk falling primarily on the acquired practice itself, a short-term business approach that rewards profit maximization, and the erosion of physician autonomy. Furthermore, young ophthalmologists express reservations about working for private equity firms. In all, 78% of trainees indicated that they would not consider employment by a private equity-owned practice, and 81.4% of vitreoretinal fellows voiced concerns about autonomy and job security. Proposed legislation aimed at limiting private equity acquisitions is currently under review at the statewide level, adding additional uncertainty to the future of private equity involvement in ophthalmology. Although investment by private equity offers potential financial rewards and operational improvements for practices, it also raises significant concerns reminiscent of those experienced by physician practice management companies in the 1990s. Non-anecdotal data are needed to assess the benefits and future of private equity involvement in ophthalmology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39369930/"}

Previously he had referred to these as type I movements. Javal had used the term 'saccade' in 1879, when describing experiments conducted in his laboratory by Lamare. Accordingly, Javal has been rightly credited with assigning the term to rapid eye movements. In English these rapid rotations had been called jerks, and they had been observed and measured before Lamare's studies of reading. Rapid sweeps of the eyes occur as one phase of nystagmus; they were observed by Wells in 1792 who used an afterimage technique, and they were illustrated by Crum Brown in 1878. Afterimages were used in nineteenth-century research on eye movements and eye position; they were also employed by Hering in 1879, to ascertain how the eyes moved during reading. In the previous year, Javal had employed afterimages in his investigations of reading, but this was to demonstrate that the eyes moved horizontally rather than vertically. Hering's and Lamare's auditory method established the discontinuous nature of eye movements during reading, and the photographic methods introduced by Dodge and others in the early twentieth century enabled their characteristics to be determined with greater accuracy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12974565/"}

Tele-ophthalmology, or the use of telemedicine for ophthalmology, has emerged as a promising solution to improve access to eye care services, particularly for patients in remote or underserved areas. Despite its potential benefits, tele-ophthalmology faces significant challenges, including the need for high volumes of medical images to be analyzed and interpreted by trained clinicians. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in ophthalmology, capable of assisting clinicians in diagnosing and treating a variety of conditions. Integrating AI models into existing tele-ophthalmology infrastructure has the potential to revolutionize eye care services by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and increasing access to specialized care. By automating the analysis and interpretation of clinical data and medical images, AI models can reduce the burden on human clinicians, allowing them to focus on patient care and disease management.

The 1980 Graduate Medical Educational National Advisory Committee forecasted a surplus, while the 1978 American Academy of Ophthalmology predicted a deficit. Utilization-based models may slightly underestimate future ophthalmologist requirements. However, analysis of the factors that will influence future use suggests that need-based models are likely to overestimate the requirements. It is risky to accept the need-based model projections because of the high cost of a surplus, which include not only the expenses of training unneeded ophthalmologists but also the cost of their decreased exposure to disease and of declining physician morale, acumen, and thresholds for surgical procedures. Because free market mechanisms are ineffective in governing the supply of health providers, it will be necessary for the profession itself to review the current and projected supply and to set limits on the number of persons in training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7055469/"}

In each case, the standard deviation of the five values was taken as a metric of the test variability.

Perspective. Review, analysis, and discussion of the implications of selected pertinent literature. Physicians often have voluntary financial relationships with industry based on behaviors and motivations that include entitlement, recognition, belonging, and money. The pharmaceutical and device industry spends billions of dollars annually in marketing to physicians. The sophisticated marketing plan seeks access to physicians through gifting mechanisms to ingratiate them and to influence them to prescribe industry's drugs and to purchase its products. Despite widely accepted studies that demonstrate that industry's marketing activities influence physicians' medical practice behavior to the detriment of patients and the public, physicians persist in voicing myths to justify their partaking of industry's largesse. Many physicians believe that their voluntary financial conflicts of interest with industry can be managed by simply disclosing them and by \"being honest.\" Yet there is no support from well-conducted studies to support the effectiveness of this approach. Medical organizations and academic institutions are the ones to take the lead in recognizing that these voluntary financial conflicts of interest are unacceptable and should be stopped. Such conflicts mainly relate to the acceptance of gifts and money that are designed to influence behavior and are a form of financial coercion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18538299/"}

Except for confocal, these are difficult to apply to the eye in vivo, as are the interference methods available in microscopes. However, interferometry in the form of coherence tomography is now a major ophthalmic method which has diverged from microscopy.

Without such co-operation there is the risk that patients fall between stools and neither condition is adequately treated. Medical specialties in which eye conditions are particularly prominent include dermatology, endocrinology, neurology, rheumatology, and cardiovascular diseases. The advantages of joint clinics in medicine and ophthalmology were demonstrated by Professors Alex Crombie and Pat Kendall-Taylor for Graves' disease, by Mr Philip Murray and Dr David Young for uveitis, and by Professor Eva Kohner for diabetes.

But the example of what happened to one local ophthalmology unit suggests what may go wrong when entrepreneurial activity is applied in a market that does not work perfectly. In 1991-2 the unit had a high workload but also comparatively high prices (because of crude pricing in the local hospital); because of pressure of work the waiting times lengthened and general practitioners increasingly complained about the service. The staff in the unit reopened a longstanding debate about the need for a third consultant ophthalmologist, but neither the purchasers (including fundholders) nor the provider unit were able to fund the post. Fundholders in a neighbouring district, however, together with that district health authority, decided to place their contracts elsewhere for the following year. Although the withdrawal of contracts jeopardised the clinical and financial viability of the ophthalmic unit, patients continued to use the service. When general practitioners in the district realised that their local service might collapse they pressed to keep the service open. The fundholders and the host purchaser finally agreed to fund a third consultant and drew up standards for the service. As a result the waiting times fell and the service is now described as \"excellent.\" Short term market decisions may have unforseen long term implications for services to patients. This needs to be addressed as part of the evolution of the reformed NHS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8281064/"}

Gruening came to the United States from Posen in Prussia and soon afterwards joined the Union army. From Appomattox he returned to New York for completion of his medical studies. He went to Europe and studied with such notables as von Graefe and Helmholtz. He did cataract surgery with a Graefe knife, with a nurse at times holding his beard out of the way. He also did ear, nose, and throat surgery. There is a drawing of him doing a mastoid operation on a child with Abraham Jacobi, the father of American pediatrics, watching him. While at Mt. Sinai, William Wilmer participated in the transplant of a rabbit eye into a patient, but went on to achieve greater things in the field. When Gruening died, Wilmer wrote that next to his own father he respected Gruening more than any man he knew. Emil's son Ernest became Governor of Alaska and Senator from Alaska.

The patient applications to the arbitration committee of the medical association of North-Rhine (\"Gutachterkommission Nordrhein\") for review of MM in the field of ophthalmology in the years 1999-2010 were analyzed statistically. In the years 1999-2010 a total of 583 cases were related to ophthalmology (3% of all cases) and in 122 cases (21%) MM was recognized by the committee. In 61% of the cases MM was caused by errors in diagnosis, in 24% by errors in processes and in 15% by errors in surgical procedures. The proportion of ophthalmological cases in the total number of MM cases is low. Most errors in diagnosis are caused by the lack of basic diagnostic on examination procedures. Errors in processes are caused by instrumental errors and deficient communication. An important reason for errors in surgical procedures is a deficient management of complications. A standardized workflow of medical examinations and a quality management can help to avoid MM.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22972176/"}

Videokeratography in seven of the eight fellow eyes displayed a pattern of inferior steepening suggesting \"early keratoconus.\" All seven eyes had a positive \"I - S value,\" a quantitative measure, indicating increased dioptric power below the corneal apex.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current applications and future potential of AI in ophthalmology. AI algorithms, particularly those utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have demonstrated remarkable success in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma with precision comparable to, or exceeding, human experts. Furthermore, AI is being utilized to develop personalized treatment plans by analyzing large datasets to predict individual responses to therapies, thus optimizing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. In surgical applications, AI-driven tools are enhancing the precision of procedures like cataract surgery, contributing to better recovery times and reduced complications. Additionally, AI-powered teleophthalmology services are expanding access to eye care in underserved and remote areas, addressing global disparities in healthcare availability. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and algorithmic bias. Ensuring robust data governance and ethical practices is crucial for the continued success of AI integration in ophthalmology. In conclusion, future research should focus on developing sophisticated AI models capable of handling multimodal data, including genetic information and patient histories, to provide deeper insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Also, collaborative efforts among governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and technology companies are essential to deploy AI solutions effectively, especially in low-resource settings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40142244/"}

The advent of neuroimaging in 1895 with the development of X-ray technology enabled the living brain to be visualized, including the intraorbital and intracranial visual pathways. This has been augmented with the development of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. A literature review of the history of neuroimaging of the visual axis was completed from the time of antiquity to the present day. The ability to visualize intracranial and orbital anatomy has been completely transformed. Imaging the visual axis has become faster, easier, and more precise allowing earlier diagnosis and management of a multitude of neuro-ophthalmic conditions. As we look to the future of neuroimaging, there is momentum to improve techniques enabling the assessment of microstructural architecture, metabolic and functional changes, and genetic biomarkers of disease. The development of high-resolution, multiplanar neuroimaging revolutionized the ability to visualize neuro-ophthalmic anatomy and pathology. Continued research will expand our ability to integrate the metabolic, anatomic, and connectivity profiles of the visual system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40361289/"}

However, there is little evidence on the factors enabling or constraining sustainability. Diffusion of innovation theory can help explain how the continuation of activities is related to the attributes of innovations. Innovations are characterised by five attributes: (i) relative advantage; (ii) compatibility; (iii) complexity; (iv) triability; and (v) observability. An eye care programme was selected as a case study. The programme was implemented in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana and had been funded over a ten-year period by an international organisation. Sustainability in the study was defined as the level of continuation of activities after the end of international funding. Measuring the continuation of activities involved checking whether each eye care activity continued (i.e. out-patient consultation, cataract surgery, outreach, school health, and statistics) or was interrupted after the end of Swiss Red Cross funding the 11 district hospitals where the programme was implemented. The results showed a relationship between the level of sustainability and the attributes of every activity. The activities with the lowest score for the attributes were less sustained. School health screening was the least sustained activity after the end of international funding. This activity also held the smallest score in terms of attributes: they were the most incompatible and most complex activities, as well as the least triable and observable activities, amongst the four district activities. In contrast, compared to the three other district activities, facility-based consultations were more likely to be routinised because they were perceived by the hospital managers as very compatible, and not complex. Using diffusion of innovations theories can help predict the sustainability of specific activities within a health programme. The study also highlighted the need for disentangling the various components of a health programme in order to identify which activities are more likely to be continued within a health system. The same methodology could be used in a different setting and could help predict which innovations are more likely to be adopted and maintained over time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24552212/"}

Moreover, we analyzed the internet presence of the Eye Center Freiburg as well as its presentation of the training curriculum and the generally accessible annual reports. Furthermore, administrative personnel data were provided. Quantitative analyses were made with Microsoft Excel. A medical specialist's career is organized as follows: 1) Structured application procedure with evaluation through the Head of the Department, the section heads and the resident's representative. 2) Initial training through medical colleagues and a mentor. 3) Rotation through all sections and areas. 4a) Annual appraisal interviews. 4b) Definition of a career pathway after 3 years. 5) Regular participation in internal/external training sessions. 6) Research after 3 months. 7) Possibility of work shadowing in practices in the 5th year. For reconciling of work and family life, parental leave and part-time employment are possible. In the years between 2006 and 2017, the analyzed data show an increasing number of job interviews and employees.

There are high costs associated with managing dry eye and conducting research to identify effective and safe long-term treatments. To support evidence-based management of dry eye, our purpose was to identify and prioritize important clinical research questions for future clinical research. We translated recommendations from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's 2013 Preferred Practice Patterns for dry eye into answerable clinical research questions about treatment effectiveness. Clinicians around the world who manage patients with dry eye rated each question's importance from 0 (not important) to 10 (very important) using a 2-round online Delphi survey. We considered questions as \"important\" if ≥75% of respondents assigned a rating of 6 or more in round 2. We mapped the identified important clinical research questions to reliable systematic reviews published up to March 2016. Seventy-five clinicians from at least 21 countries completed both Delphi rounds. Among the 58 questions, 24 met our definition of \"important\": 9/24 and 7/24 addressed topical and systemic treatments, respectively. All 4 questions with the highest 25th percentiles addressed topical treatments. Although 6/24 \"important\" questions were associated with 4 existing reliable systematic reviews, none of these reviews came to a definitive conclusion about treatment effectiveness.

The National Blindness Prevention programmes have been forwarded through adoption of primary eye care approach integrating into the national health scheme of primary health care. Avoidable blindness once prevalent in 1980's, has been reduced from 1.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent in twenty years.

PMMA convex ellipsoidal buttons were calibrated using Form Talysurf analysis which allowed subsequent calculation of the vertex radius and p value of the surface. The EyeSys videokeratoscope was used to examine the same ellipsoids. The tabular data provided by the instrument software were used to plot a graph of r2 versus y2 where r is the measured radius at y, the distance from the corneal point being measured to the surface vertex. The intercept on the ordinate of this graph gives the vertex radius and the slope the p value. The results arising from the Talysurf and the EyeSys techniques were compared. The EyeSys videokeratoscope gave readings for both vertex radius and p value that were higher than those of the Talysurf analysis. The vertex radius was around 0.1 mm greater. The p value results were similar by the two methods for p values around unity but the EyeSys results were higher and the discrepancy increased as the p value approached that of a paraboloid. Although the videokeratoscope may be useful in comparative studies of the cornea, there must be some doubt about the absolute values displayed. The disagreement is sufficiently large to suggest that the instrument may not be accurate enough for contact lens fitting purposes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7488595/"}

With an ophthalmic surgeon:population ratio of 1:107,000 (similar to that in the UK), an increasing amount of blindness in India, the output by ophthalmic surgeons continues to be low. Whereas the shortage of surgeons has been recognised as a critical problem by the National Programme for Control of Blindness, recommendations made at various forums have been restricted only to increasing production of existing surgeons. The key issues relating to OSs in India are uneven distribution, under utilisation and increasing demands on the ophthalmologist's time, due to advancement in clinical ophthalmology in recent years. Serious intervention to streamline distribution and improve utilisation of OSs in government and private sectors is necessary to effectively counter the current menace of blindness. Another option-creating an exclusive cadre of cataract surgeons trained to perform intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) for a period of four months in the medical colleges--has been recommended.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8132406/"}

The four university eye clinics, which are the pillars of academic ophthalmology in Croatia, provide health care to most difficult cases, educate students, residents, and specialists, and do research. On the other hand, they lack equipment, room, and financial recognition. This ever growing imbalance between requirements imposed on academic ophthalmology today and its possibilities make it less and less attractive, especially in comparison with private practice.

The investigation focused on characterizing the goals and services offered, the didactics taught to residents, and the program director's understanding of systems-based practice gained in the host country. An online survey was sent to all U.S. ophthalmology residency program directors. The two outcome measures of the study were characterization of global health outreach and didactics completed by U.S. ophthalmology residency programs and review of program director understanding of host country systems of care. Twelve program directors of 117 (10.26%) answered the survey. 100% of programs from the Department of Defense responded. Countries served included Ecuador, Panama, Honduras, Dominican Republic, India, Tanzania, Nepal, Bhutan, Guatemala, Micronesia, Haiti, Mongolia, Bolivia. Sixty five percent worked at a free-standing public hospital. Many programs offered resident participation with only 41.87% giving residents ACGME credit. Most programs (91.67%) offered fewer than 5 hours of global health didactics. When program directors were asked about their knowledge of host country systems of care, most noted understanding of the hospital functions like the referral system, transitions of care, hospital funding, and medical supply chain, but not of the perception of patients with chronic or congenital ophthalmic diseases, host country general or ophthalmic medical education, patient research safeguards and host country malpractice system. From the small sample of program directors, Ophthalmology residency program global health outreach varies in faculty and resident participation, and in goals and services offered. In addition, there was a wide variation in ophthalmology program director understanding of host country systems of care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31038165/"}

Increasing requirements for medical documentation, exploding volumes of diagnostic data, overcrowded archives and unavailable files when needed, were the essential rationales for the implementation of an electronic patient archive (EPA). The EPA has been specifically adapted to the requirements of the Department of Ophthalmology in order to guarantee a standardized unobstructed documentation and patient care across all sections of the department. Seamless integration into the clinic information system (KIS) and network-compatible diagnostic software were essential as well as a timely digitization of existing paper charts. Decisive factors for using FIDUS (Arztservice Wente GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) as the EPA software were the visual layout of the EPA, user friendliness and reference installations of the software in other ophthalmology departments. After one and a half years of meticulous preparation with specific adaptations to the requirements of our department, the EPA was finally implemented in January 2016 and since then we have been working on improvements. The EPA software retrieves basic patient data from the KIS and diagnostic data from electronic devices via various interfaces. Expenses for printers could be reduced but computer workplaces had to be expanded or newly created. For previous patients paper files are digitized externally and stored in an electronic archive directly accessible from the EPA. Successful reorganization and implementation of electronic documentation during clinical routine is feasible with careful preparation and timely involvement of information technology experts, motivated physicians, nurses, research departments and the administration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29098374/"}

Assessment of temporary magnet systems in humans: 1) a magnet was affixed to the upper and lower eyelids, and 2) a magnet was affixed to the upper eyelid and another to eyeglasses. Parameters evaluated were eyelid positions and success of eyelid closure in healthy adult volunteers. Magnetic force required to create the average eyelid opening force was calculated from the eyelid model to be equivalent to 4 magnets. The magnet system affixed to upper and lower eyelids resulted in complete eyelid closure in 5 of 5 normal controls, while the magnet system affixed to the upper eyelid and to spectacles resulted in complete eyelid closure in 10 of 13 normal controls. Magnetic systems for eyelid closure were designed that used either magnets affixed to both upper and lower eyelids or an upper eyelid magnetic component combined with a magnetic element in the lower rim of spectacles. Both were effective in eyelid closure in a model eye and normal controls. These systems may ultimately provide a simplified, safer, and less invasive method to treat paralytic lagophthalmos.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24841731/"}

A training system that accurately represents the orbital anatomical features and provides qualitative feedback on the performed anesthetic technique, can be of immense help in reducing risks involved in regional block administration. In this paper, a training system that employs a special but simple capacitive sensing scheme has been developed. A rapid prototyped eye-model has been used to ensure anatomical accuracy. Capacitive transmitter electrodes placed on the orbital wall along the length of the extraocular muscles are excited with a special excitation sequence and the displacement current at the needle of the syringe is measured using simple electronic unit and a Data Acquisition System, enabling the developed Virtual Instrument to detect the depth of penetration and proximity of the syringe needle to the ocular muscles. Additionally, the system detects needle touch of the muscles accurately. The proposed electrode array system and excitation schemes have been validated on a prototype system thus demonstrating its usefulness for practical training purposes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24109832/"}

The use of resources is particularly high in the operating theater. Cataract surgery is one of the most frequent procedures in ophthalmology and even in medicine overall. Its CO<sub>2</sub> footprint is therefore quantitatively relevant. Approaches to conserve resources can be implemented at the levels of production and transport of materials and also in the form of reduction and management of waste. In this paper the sources of the waste load, the management of waste separation, the implementation of single-use instruments and the influence of innovative technologies during cataract surgery are presented based on the current literature. Particularly the use of plastic materials for packaging and single-use instruments, also for reasons of hygiene, lead to an increased waste production. The simple separation of compound materials is difficult and only meaningful if the materials used in eye operations can be recycled; however, international comparisons show that cataract surgery can be performed with the same quality of results while conserving resources. Measures in organization and infrastructure are presented. In the future, innovative strategies should be developed and the use of resources in Germany should also be critically questioned in order to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of cataract surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35467102/"}

Risk of complications in contact lens wear increases during overnight wear and may further increase when the treatment is used on children. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive guideline for practitioners to improve their orthokeratology practice and minimize unnecessary or preventable complications. The fundamental requirement for starting an orthokeratology practice is to have proper education in the area and to equip the practice appropriately. Overnight trial fitting is recommended to confirm the physiological response prior to commencement of the treatment. Practitioners should provide adequate information, both oral and written, to patients before and after the commencement of treatment to avoid any legal dilemmas and to improve patients' compliance. Costs for the treatment should be transparent and provision of an emergency contact number is a must. Patients should be regularly recalled for aftercare visits and all communication with patients should be properly documented. In this paper, patient selection and the clinical procedures were discussed and a standard of practice in orthokeratology proposed. We believe that the key to providing a safe orthokeratology practice is to continually update knowledge in the field, and to practice to the highest professional standards.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17714977/"}

{"id": "40601504", "title": "Eyeing Opportunity: A Review of Private Equity in Ophthalmology.", "text": "Private equity (PE) acquisition of ophthalmology practices has grown rapidly, reflecting broader trends in the consolidation of health care services. The driving force behind these acquisitions is the potential for high returns through operational efficiencies, increased bargaining power with insurers, and access to lucrative outpatient procedures. However, PE's impact on the quality and cost of ophthalmic care remains unclear. Studies show mixed results: some report increased use of expensive treatments and higher costs, while others suggest minimal changes in patient outcomes or spending. PE's appeal to ophthalmologists includes capital infusion for practice expansion and improved risk management, though concerns exist over profit-driven incentives possibly compromising patient care. The market for ophthalmology practices remains fragmented, with PE firms capitalizing on consolidation opportunities. Despite the growth, there are challenges to assessing the full impact of PE involvement, particularly due to limited research, nondisclosure agreements, and difficulty in selecting control practices for comparison. While PE acquisitions have been accelerating, recent reports indicate a slowdown in 2024, influenced by factors such as interest rates and federal investigations into the health care sector. The future of PE in ophthalmology will likely depend on market conditions, regulatory changes, and further research into its long-term effects on care quality and physician autonomy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40601504/"}

{"id": "17280851", "title": "How to measure slab-off and reverse slab prism in spectacle lenses.", "text": "It is well known that new spectacle lenses for the correction of anisometropia can induce diplopia with reading. The difference in the powers of the lenses induces a net prismatic effect that can cause double vision through off-center areas of the lenses. This is particularly bothersome when patients try to read, often noting vertical double vision in attempted downgaze, especially through multifocal add segments. This induced prismatic effect can be compensated at one level of downgaze by the use of slab-off or reverse slab prism. Typically the slab-off correction is ground into the stronger minus, or weaker plus lens. Reverse slab is ground into the weaker minus, or stronger plus, lens. Unfortunately, determining the amount of slab-off prism already incorporated into spectacle lenses is nonintuitive and inconvenient. This usually requires the use of a lens clock, which is not widely accessible to many ophthalmology practices. A simple technique, described in the past but poorly known, is illustrated here for quickly measuring slab-off and reverse slab prism prescription lenses in the clinic with a common manual lens meter.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17280851/"}

Given the high curricular burden placed on medical schools, the authors sought to better characterize existing ophthalmology curricula and to delineate which offerings are closely related to high numbers of students applying and matching into ophthalmology residencies. The authors reviewed the extent of ophthalmology curricula between 2007 and 2017 via a survey administered in 2018 to all U.S. Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-affiliated medical schools. They obtained residency application and match data with permission from the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology. The authors compared metrics of ophthalmology exposure with the number of students who applied and matched into ophthalmology during the corresponding year using mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis. This study includes 49 U.S. AAMC-affiliated medical schools. When adjusted for the number of applicants per year, the following were significantly (P < .05) associated with matching into an ophthalmology residency: the presence of an ophthalmology department, an ophthalmology residency program, an ophthalmology interest group, ophthalmologists on faculty, ophthalmology content in the preclinical curriculum, preclinical lectures taught by ophthalmologists, and the availability of an optional fourth-year ophthalmology elective. Multivariable analysis indicated both that the presence of an ophthalmology residency program was the only independent predictor of matching into an ophthalmology residency and that the presence of an ophthalmology residency program, ophthalmology content in the preclinical curriculum, and preclinical lectures taught by ophthalmologists are independent predictors for applying. A foundation in ophthalmology is crucial for all physicians, especially those who may encounter patients with eye problems in emergency or primary care settings. However, for those students considering a career in ophthalmology, choosing a medical school with an ophthalmology department and residency program is particularly important.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32324639/"}

A lack of the lens in the eye, i.e. aphakia, is considered to be a serious complication. The optic extraocular correction of aphakia is implemented mainly by the use of spectacles and contact lenses, which are not deprived of essential shortcomings. H. Ridley was the first to implant, in 1949, a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) intraocular lens (IOL). After that, anterior-chamber and iris-clips lenses as well as extrapupillary lenses with fixation to Sulcus cyliaris, which had by some complications, were offered. Only in 1973, we offered, for the first time in the world practice, an intracapsular implantation and intercapsular fixation of IOLs of various models. The designed intraocular correction of aphakia was checked by time and it is used now in cataract microsurgery, including small-incisions as well as ultrasound and laser phacoemulsification. The use of the lens bag as a natural bed for the fixation and isolation of IOL from intraocular structures is a priority direction in the Russian research ophthalmology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12698881/"}

Among the most relevant investigated structures are polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers and cyclodextrins. Besides the composition of the nanoparticle itself, its efficacy and stability can be optimized through coatings; however, long-term stability, standardization of production and toxicity remain the major challenges.

To diagnose these diseases earlier and to monitor their therapy more sensitively, an accurate measurement of the tissue thickness is needed. Since no clinical method is currently available, we developed and tested a new method capable of measuring noninvasively the retinal thickness. The separation between the images of the anterior and posterior intersections is quantitated by an optoelectronic system. The theoretical performance of the method has been calculated. Tests of the method in a model eye indicated that the measurements were basically diffraction limited, their reproductivity was +/- 9 microns, and their accuracy was 5.5 microns. Tests performed in vivo indicated that two intersections between the laser and the retina are present and correspond to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the retina. These intersections can be resolved and analyzed to yield quantitative data. These encouraging results indicate that this method is feasible and could yield sensitive measurements of the retinal thickness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2793353/"}

Applications of this technology include improving AI diagnostic models, inter-modality image transformation, more accurate treatment and disease prognostication, image denoising, and individualised education. Key barriers to its adoption include bias in generative models, risks to patient data security, computational and logistical barriers to development, challenges with model explainability, inconsistent use of validation metrics between studies and misuse of synthetic images. Looking forward, researchers are placing a further emphasis on clinically grounded metrics, the development of image generation foundation models and the implementation of methods to ensure data provenance. Compared to other medical applications of AI, image generation is still in its infancy. Yet, it holds the potential to revolutionise ophthalmology across research, education and clinical practice. This review aims to guide ophthalmic researchers wanting to leverage this technology, while also providing an insight for clinicians on how it may change ophthalmic practice in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40107410/"}

To evaluate the variations in pediatric eye care services and availability of optometrists and ophthalmologists for preschool-aged patients, referral patterns, and barriers to providing care as perceived by eye care specialists. A survey was mailed to 542 ophthalmologists and a random sample of 501 optometrists actively practicing in Michigan. The response rate was 65% (optometrists, 75%; ophthalmologists, 57%). More optometrists than ophthalmologists evaluated preschool-aged children (97% vs 79%; P < .001). Of these, most managed amblyopia (80% vs 77%; P = .372) and strabismus (89% vs 80%; P = .002) themselves. Fewer optometrists than ophthalmologists dilated eyes routinely during the first evaluation of a preschool-aged child (39% vs 93%; P < .001). The leading barrier to care for preschool-aged children reported by both optometrists and ophthalmologists was difficulty of the examination (25% vs 23%; P = .501). Optometrists reported that most of their patients were referred from community-based screening programs or by parent self-referral. Ophthalmologists reported that most of their preschool-aged patients were referred from primary care providers. There are different sources of referrals for optometrists and ophthalmologists. Although most eye care specialists treat amblyopia, the types of care offered by optometrists and ophthalmologists differ. Future studies should address the impact that these patterns have on outcomes and cost. The results of these studies should be shared with those responsible for screening.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14560835/"}

Two (of several) possible causes are the increasing number of new forms of organisation (large contract medical facilities in terms of number of patients, doctors and locations) and medical care centres (MVZ) in non-physician ownership. In a network of large ophthalmological care facilities, paediatric ophthalmological care activities per provider were surveyed for 2019 for all providers according to the proportion of the number of cases and structural characteristics (number of locations with orthoptists and sites with paediatric surgery), evaluated overall and in the subgroups according to ownership (non-physician or physician ownership) and compared with specialist group-related comparative data. With the one exception of a physician ownership provider, all providers (total n = 15, 12 of which were physician-owned) treated children < 6 years. In 2019, a total of 90,461 statutory health insurance (SHI) cases of children < 6 years were treated (9.3%of all SHI cases in children < 6 years in Germany). In the entire cohort, their share of all SHI cases was 3.7% (physician ownership: 4.8%, non-physician ownership: 3.2%). For the specialist group of all ophthalmologists in Germany, the average was 3.2% (difference not significant). Orthoptists worked at a total of 98 locations (58 physician ownership, 40 non-physician ownership, difference significant [p = 0.03]). Outpatient and inpatient paediatric surgery were offered by all non-physician owned providers and some physician owned providers. In this first large study on paediatric ophthalmic care in relation to the provider, the contribution of the newer types of organisation was evaluated. In comparison to traditional practices, there was no systematically different orientation - either for the whole study group or for any type of provider, as based on the relative proportion of children with SHI insurance or structural indicators (orthoptists or, outpatient or inpatient surgical care).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40398423/"}

A survey was conducted among multicenter studies in the US that included one or more randomized clinical trials and were sponsored by the NEI, National Institutes of Health. To be included in the survey, a study had to have VA reported in one or more publications or patient eligibility based on VA, a majority of study subjects 13 years of age or older, and a patient population primarily or exclusively from the US. A standard survey form was completed for each study based on information presented in the study manual of procedures and publications. Findings were summarized and displayed with frequency distributions. The survey included 24 studies, each with enrollment initiated in the period 1972 to 1999. VA was one of the study eligibility criteria for 19 (79%) studies, and VA or change in VA was the primary outcome in 12 (50%) studies. ETDRS charts have been employed in 16 of 19 studies initiated after the charts were published in 1982. All studies but one specified in the documents reviewed that VA testing was performed at multiple VA test distances. For studies that used ETDRS charts, methods of converting VA scores obtained at different test distances to a common scale fell into two categories: 11 studies used a method similar in nature to that first reported in the Macular Photocoagulation Study, and 7 studies used a method similar in nature to that first reported in the Krypton-Argon Regression of Neovascularization Study. conclusion The development of the ETDRS charts and a custom light box has led to more uniformity in VA test charts and chart illumination. However, details of VA measurement protocols vary widely from study to study. To assure comparable data across studies and ocular conditions, it would be useful to have a standard VA testing and scoring protocol with provisions for testing different levels of visual acuity that recommends a single method for converting scores from different test distances to a common scale and standard conversion of \"off the chart\" VA levels for calculation of means and changes in VA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12815490/"}

Qualitative, mixed method study participants include Aboriginal community members, and health and eye care providers in urban, rural and remote settings. Present evidence for health care providers to better understand and address some of the barriers that limit access to eye care in primary care settings. Patient perspectives on barriers to accessing eye care and reasons they choose to seek care or not are presented. Health system barriers identified by health and eye care providers are also presented. Additionally, key enablers for improving access to eye care through primary care services are identified. Primary health care services have an important role in Indigenous eye health. There is a critical role for primary care in the coordination of the patient journey and cooperating with other services to improve access to comprehensive eye care. Through improved provision of primary eye care, monitoring of Indigenous eye health indicators and supporting patients to access eye care, it is possible to close the gap for vision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23586574/"}

Systematic survey of German research centers in ophthalmology. The current research map records the data from 41 German research centers for the reporting period 2018-2020. Compared to previous editions of the research map, there has been a significant increase in scientific activity. The number of studies reported rose to 496. The number of government funded research projects (n = 121) and projects funded by foundations (n = 108) also increased. Furthermore, the number of scientific publications has almost doubled: while 1919 were published in the period from 2012 to 2014 and 2305 in the period from 2015 to 2017, there were 4215 in the current reporting period. The map also reports on a continuous increase in the number of young scientists in ophthalmology. The research map demonstrates the performance of German scientific ophthalmology. At the same time, the need for research in ophthalmology remains high because many diseases that affect the eyes are not yet or not yet completely curable.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35925367/"}

While this previous testing method proved useful, both in the diagnosis of lacrimal deficiencies, and in cases of slight to medium epiphora, it could not accurately measure the high volume of lacrimation produced in cases of strong epiphora because of the low absorption capacity of the thread. To overcome this shortcoming, I have developed a new system which utilizes a cotton thread enclosed in a soft, calibrated, silicone tubing. In subsequent testing of this new technique, eyes that exhibited a strong epiphora state gave a wetted length of 226.9 +/- 56.0 mm (mean +/- SD) in a 5- to 10-second test. This compares with 41.0 +/- 8.9 mm in tests using thread alone in a 5- to 10-second test (p less than 0.001).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3431816/"}

As a surgeon and as the editor of the \"Centralblatt für praktische Augenheilkunde\" (1877-1919) he enjoyed a world-wide reputation. He devised an electrical hand magnet for the extraction of intraocular foreign bodies (1879 - see Duke-Elder, System of ophthalmology, vol. 14/I, p.616) and investigated, among many other aspects of clinical ophthalmology, the ocular manifestations of general disease (e.g. diabetes). Hirschberg's greatest achievement is his History of ophthalmology, from the ancient Egyptians down to 1900 AD (\"Geschichte der Augenheikunde\" 1899-1919, 9 vols., 4700 p.). Because Hirschberg mastered not only several modern languages, but also Greek, Latin and Arabic, he was able to familiarize his readers with the original thoughts or even words of the earlier authors. Belonging himself to a positivistic and optimistic generation, he based his narratian on men, facts and tangible progress. Many problems which are discussed by modern historians of science have already been masterly treated by Hirschberg; reading his \"Geschichte\" is still worthwhile, even for English speaking scholars.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/789990/"}

We also describe the indications for its use and analyze its limitations. The utility of the SLS in effecting complete ptosis was examined in 33 patients. Outcome parameters examined were mean duration of (induced) ptosis, success (and failure) rate, and the incidence of side effects. The most common indications for using the SLS were lid closure abnormalities (n = 6) and epithelial defects after keratoplasty (n = 5). The induced ptosis lasted for a mean of 3.3 days (range, 1.5-6). The success rate of the SLS in achieving a total ptosis was 90.9%. Failure was attributed to the presence of atypical lid or orbital anatomy. No patient developed a complication specifically related to the SLS itself. The SLS is an inexpensive, quick, and technically straightforward means of treating a variety of ocular surface disorders in compliant patients with normal lid and orbital anatomy. The SLS is best suited to patients who require short-term therapy only.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11917173/"}

During his stay at the University of Prague, he was influenced by the famous people of his time, such as Einstein (physicist), Mach (physicist and psychophysicist), Lorenz (behavioral scientist), Popper (philosopher), Schlick (physicist and philosopher), Hering (physiologist), and others. Goldmann absorbed the essence of these disciplines to a very large extent. This, together with his remarkable intellect, enabled him to produce outstanding research work within a large spectrum of sciences more or less directly related to ophthalmology. Goldmann became known in particular for his exceptional and fundamental work on perimetry and glaucoma and he managed to cast his basic insight into practical, easy-to-operate, high-precision diagnostic instruments which, several decades after their invention, are still used by every ophthalmologist.

{"id": "24219362", "title": "Hospital process orientation from an operations management perspective: development of a measurement tool and practical testing in three ophthalmic practices.", "text": "Although research interest in hospital process orientation (HPO) is growing, the development of a measurement tool to assess process orientation (PO) has not been very successful yet. To view a hospital as a series of processes organized around patients with a similar demand seems to be an attractive proposition, but it is hard to operationalize this idea in a measurement tool that can actually measure the level of PO. This research contributes to HPO from an operations management (OM) perspective by addressing the alignment, integration and coordination of activities within patient care processes. The objective of this study was to develop and practically test a new measurement tool for assessing the degree of PO within hospitals using existing tools. Through a literature search we identified a number of constructs to measure PO in hospital settings. These constructs were further operationalized, using an OM perspective. Based on five dimensions of an existing questionnaire a new HPO-measurement tool was developed to measure the degree of PO within hospitals on the basis of respondents' perception. The HPO-measurement tool was pre-tested in a non-participating hospital and discussed with experts in a focus group. The multicentre exploratory case study was conducted in the ophthalmic practices of three different types of Dutch hospitals. In total 26 employees from three disciplines participated. After filling in the questionnaire an interview was held with each participant to check the validity and the reliability of the measurement tool. The application of the HPO-measurement tool, analysis of the scores and interviews with the participants resulted in the possibility to identify differences of PO performance and the areas of improvement--from a PO point of view--within each hospital. The result of refinement of the items of the measurement tool after practical testing is a set of 41 items to assess the degree of PO from an OM perspective within hospitals. The development and practically testing of a new HPO-measurement tool improves the understanding and application of PO in hospitals and the reliability of the measurement tool. The study shows that PO is a complex concept and appears still hard to objectify.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24219362/"}

In the early 1980 s, Fercher and colleagues pioneered the optical noncontact eye length measurement, leading to the first interferometric A-scan of the eye. This innovation, patented and later developed by Zeiss, culminated in the release of the IOLMaster in 1999, enabling more accurate and reproducible eye diagnostics. Over the years, optical biometry has evolved into advanced swept-source optical coherence tomography devices, accompanied by numerous formulas for calculating intraocular lens power. Today, this technology is crucial not only for cataract surgeries, especially in eyes previously treated with refractive surgery, but also in advancing our understanding of diseases across fields like cardiology and oncology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39353610/"}

Patient and neighborhood characteristics for SRFs were summarized. Differences in FQHCs providing and not providing vision care were compared via Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests for continuous measures and chi-square tests for categorical measures. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations between neighborhood measures and FQHCs providing vision care, adjusted for patient characteristics. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for neighborhood-level predictors of FQHCs providing vision care services. Overall, 28.5% of FQHCs (n = 375/1318) provided vision care in 2017 versus 32% (n = 435/1362) in 2021 with some increases and decreases in both the number of FQHCs and those with and without vision services. Only 2.6% of people who accessed FQHC services received eye care in 2021. Among the 435 FQHCs that provided vision care in 2021, 27.1% (n = 118) had added vision services between 2017 and 2021, 71.5% (n = 311) had been offering vision services since at least 2017, and 1.4% (n = 6) were newly established.

Forty-five subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 with no known dry eye conditions and with normal ocular health were assessed. Both methods were performed on one eye (both the eye and the first method of testing were randomly selected). On a direct comparison basis, we found that the keratometer method, as has been reported, yielded shorter (generalized sign rank test, n = 58 paired comparisons, p < 0.0001) non-invasive breakup times (NIBUTs) than the xeroscope (mean > or = 35.6 +/- 19.2 seconds and mean > or = 44.7 +/_ 16.3 seconds (mean +/- s.d.), respectively). The keratometer NIBUTs were longer than reported values. The different-day, same-subject repeatability of the NIBUTs as measured by both instruments was excellent.

After MBBS programme, most graduates tend to abandon studies, some migrate abroad, a few continue as general physicians and even fewer strive to get registered for postgraduate specialisation. This results in suboptimal supply of medical workforce. Inconsideration of the current ophthalmologist work ratio and growing demand for eye care services, an initiative is put forward to introduce Bachelors of Ophthalmic Surgery programme similar to Bachelor of Dental Surgery. Such initiative may facilitate effective learning, enable command in a particular area and encourage more individuals to pursue a career in ophthalmology.

The background of individual surgeons was determined by linking license numbers in the dataset to physician profiles publicly available from AHCA. From 2005 through 2012, women ophthalmologists in Florida performed roughly half the annual rate of cataract surgery as their male counterparts.

For this purpose, we developed a questionnaire and gaved it to recent graduates in ophthalmology residency in São Paulo, Brazil, from January to December 2010. The questions contained demographic information (age, sex and time of practice in ophthalmology), a Likert scale to evaluate the level of satisfaction with medical residency concerning clinical knowledge, surgical skills and doctor-patient relationship and questions about deficiency in clinical and surgical areas. The areas in which recent residency graduates were very or extremely satisfied were: acquisition of clinical knowledge (89.1%), acquisition of surgical skills (93.4%) and the development of doctor-patient relationship (74.9%). Specific areas of clinical knowledge in which they perceived more deficiency were orbit (48.3%) and ophthalmic pathology (47.9%), and in surgical skills were refractive surgery (65.9%) and orbit (59.2%) The assessment of the satisfaction with residency training in ophthalmology from the perspective of recent graduates showed high level of satisfaction and identified specific deficiencies in ophthalmic pathology, refractive surgery and orbit.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23706136/"}

The Actina was widely advertised as a cure for most of life's ills, particularly those of the eye and ear. Its manufacturers claimed that electrical properties were the mechanism of the Actina's alleged therapeutic effects. However, research has shown that the instrument had no electrical properties, its manufacturers had no medical training, and that the Actina was useless as a therapeutic agent. The firm that manufactured the Actina was located in Kansas City and was at the zenith of its success when the first meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology was held there in 1896. Its fraudulent activities sparked a continuing public outcry that contributed to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.

The analysis can be expanded to explain the reflex for an eye with aberrations. The succession of reflexes across the pupil for each position of the retinoscope is represented in a contour plot. The plots demonstrate that retinoscopy can be considered a measure of the transverse ray aberration of the eye. For an eye with simple defocus this causes the typical with and against motions observed with hyperopic and myopic refractive errors. For an eye with aberrations we predict more-complex retinoscopic reflexes. This theory is confirmed by actual measurements on a human eye with known aberrations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8544012/"}

A postal questionnaire was sent to 504 possible retinologists identified through the information supplied by the Spanish Ophthalmological Society and the Spanish Vitreous-Retina Society, with a minimum of 3 retinologists per Autonomous Region. 267 (52.9% of the sample population) responses were collected and processed. Most of the respondents had started their residency after 1980 (82.4%). Ninety-four percent had received specific training in retinal pathology, mostly during the residency period (82.1%) and from more experienced colleagues (62.9%). Official fellowships were held in a minority of cases (around 12%). Twelve percent of retinologists performed retinal surgery only, 14.6% performed anterior segment surgery, and 60.7% performed both types of surgery. Despite not having taken into consideration non-response bias, this study provides the first reported data on the professional profile of Spanish retinologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19253177/"}

{"id": "2668138", "title": "[Ophthalmology in the 18th century: the \"oculist seculum\" in Berlin].", "text": "At least 15 oculists were known in Berlin in the eighteenth century, beginning with Johann Andreas Eisenbarth, who visited the Prussian royal residence five times. From 1725 on, four oculists resided in Berlin for up to 33 years. Since 1740, lectures on ophthalmology had been given here as part of the surgery curriculum at Berlin Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum by Simon Pallas and, as of 1769, by Joachim Friedrich Henckel. Both of them taught the traditional method of couching the cataracts, which they also treated themselves. Christian Ludwig Mursinna first used the cataract-extraction method by Daviel at the Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum when he was appointed Professor of Surgery in 1787. The oculists who visited Berlin had demonstrated this new surgical method at least 15 years earlier. The very first cataract extraction in Berlin seems to have been done by the French military surgeon Taverne in 1755. There were two charlatans among the oculists: John Taylor, who was expelled from Berlin and Prussia in 1750, because Frederik II had found him to be an English spy. The same king appointed the other charlatan, Joseph Hillmer from Vienna, a Professor of Ophthalmiatrics at the Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum, in 1748. Hillmer's charlatanism was proven by the Medical Chancellery at Petersburg when he visited Russia in 1751. The Director of the Russian Medical Supervising Board, Herman Kaau Boerhaave, documented this affair in a book, which is the first printed source of Russian medical language. Hillmer was expelled from Russia. He had never given lectures in ophthalmiatrics in Berlin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2668138/"}

Hence, the aim of this study was to identify the quantitative and (through Journal Impact Factor) qualitative amount of ophthalmological articles coming from Switzerland. With a specifically developed software we searched 70 ophthalmological Journals indexed by Medline for articles from Switzerland. Not counting the publications related to the annual meeting of the Swiss Ophthalmological Society, the amount of Swiss papers in ophthalmological journals indexed by Medline, increased between 1988 and 1999 by a factor of four. In proportion to the global amount of ophthalmological publications we calculated an increase by a factor of 2.6. The amount of publications grew particularly during the analysed time period in journals with high impact factors. In 1999 a total of 1.8 % of the indexed ophthalmological articles originated from Swiss research institutes and hospitals. The average amount of authors of Swiss publications increased, thereby following an international trend. The increased amount of publications may rely on the growing role of Swiss research in ophthalmology as well as on a broadened and deepened international orientation of Swiss ophthalmology. The increased number of authors can be explained by the growing complexity and interdisciplinary nature of research projects. Both, the amount of publications and the number of authors, can be linked to the \"publish or perish\" paradigm.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12548471/"}

At the beginning of 2013 a new residency program was introduced at the department of ophthalmology of the Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf. This study evaluated the resident satisfaction with the new concept. The new residency program consists of three main changes: firstly a structured training with fixed rotation in the various subdisciplines of ophthalmology, secondly a list of practical skills examinations that has to be completed during the 5-year program and thirdly annual intermediate oral examinations. The satisfaction of the residents with the new program was anonymously evaluated with a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 15 items and additional free text comments. (1) The structured training was mostly rated positively and 9 out of 12 of residents favored a continuation of the training concept in this form. (2) Only 7 out of 11 residents (64 %) wanted to continue the practical skills examinations in this form and only approximately half of the residents saw a positive effect of these examinations. (3) Regarding the annual examinations 8 out of 11 residents (73 %) reported that the examinations helped them to assess their skills better, 91 % (10 out of 11) reported a learning motivation, 90 % (9 out of 10) an improvement in learning due to the examinations and 73 % (8 out of 11) were of the opinion that the examinations should take place regularly. The structured training and the annual examinations were positively evaluated. These changes could be effectively implemented even with a relatively small personnel structure. In comparison the practical skill examinations were rated relatively negatively, probably because of the further increase of daily work. The number of skills to be demonstrated is currently reduced and the integration of testing into the clinical routine of examiners and examinees is under revision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26065527/"}

The survey covered demographic data such as gender, age, workplace, and year of residency, as well as working conditions, current practical and diagnostic skills, interest in scientific work, and future plans. It consisted of 16 multiple choice questions (MCQ), 5 multiple select questions (MSQ), 8 free-text, 6 Net Promoter Score (NPS), and 4 Likert scale questions. All Young Swiss Ophthalmologists (YSO) members received an invitation to participate in the survey using an online form. All collected data were anonymized, and participants provided their consent for data collection, analysis, and publication. The survey assessed the perspectives of 63 Swiss ophthalmology residents on their training experiences. Respondents indicated the greatest interest in specializing in cataract and vitreoretinal surgery, followed by cornea, glaucoma, refractive surgery, and lid surgery. They also expressed a great need for improved supervision, structured curricula, and alignment of clinical and research duties. While pursuing additional surgical training and private practice autonomy, residents also expressed a preference for balanced workloads that emphasize patient care over full-time academic work. The survey indicates a need to standardize ophthalmology residency training in Switzerland to ensure comprehensive and uniform education. It also highlights specific areas for improvement, such as the absence of surgical training. Ongoing assessments are necessary to evaluate future developments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39642933/"}

The objective of this study was to undertake a situation analysis of the Zambian eye health system and assess VISION 2020 process indicators on human resources, equipment and infrastructure. All eye health care providers were surveyed to determine location, financing sources, human resources and equipment. Key informants were interviewed regarding levels of service provision, management and leadership in the sector. Policy papers were reviewed. A health system dynamics framework was used to analyse findings. During 2011, 74 facilities provided eye care in Zambia; 39% were public, 37% private for-profit and 24% owned by Non-Governmental Organizations. Private facilities were solely located in major cities. A total of 191 people worked in eye care; 18 of these were ophthalmologists and eight cataract surgeons, equivalent to 0.34 and 0.15 per 250,000 population, respectively. VISION 2020 targets for inpatient beds and surgical theatres were met in six out of nine provinces, but human resources and spectacles manufacturing workshops were below target in every province. Inequalities in service provision between urban and rural areas were substantial. Shortage and maldistribution of human resources, lack of routine monitoring and inadequate financing mechanisms are the root causes of underperformance in the Zambian eye health system, which hinder the ability to achieve the VISION 2020 goals. We recommend that all VISION 2020 process indicators are evaluated simultaneously as these are not individually useful for monitoring progress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24575919/"}

{"id": "11560347", "title": "Privately funded quality health care in India: a sustainable and equitable model.", "text": "As the cost and degree of training necessary to provide state of the art health care has increased throughout the world, the present challenge in health care is to establish institutions that are financially sound and responsive to the dynamic needs of the communities in which they exist. As public funds have diminished, the role of the private sector in estabhshing innovative health care institutions has increased. This paper reviews the case of the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), an ophthalmologic institute in Hyderabad, India, that is financially sound and medically vital. With an annual budget of US$3 million, 180 000 patients are seen and 23 000 surgeries are performed at the Institute and its satellites each year. The Institute provides patient care at a ratio of 1:1 non-paying to paying patients through fee cross-subsidization. The Institute uses a combination of financial modalities, including donations, grants and fees to administer its non-patient care programs. Non-clinical programs of the Institute include a paramedical training program and a fellowship in ophthalmology, an internationally accredited eye bank for the preservation of corneal tissues, a rural out-reach and education program, a basic science and epidemiology program that directs health policy activities of the Institute and a rehabilitation program for patients with incurable visual deficits. To evaluate its effectiveness, LVPEI uses quality improvement measures, including patient surveys, post-operative outcomes studies and service utlization reviews. This case report of a privately-funded medical institution describes a successful model through which high-quality, equitable health care can be provided in a developing country. The LVPEI's active program of quality management, its academic commitment and programmatic relevance to the needs of its community should be modularized and replicated to establish equitable, efficient and effective health care institutions in the developing world.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11560347/"}

In particular, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), due to their unique physicochemical properties such as high surface area, excellent thermal and electrical properties, high surface/volume aspect ratio, and high tensile strength, show great potential for application in biomedical and biotechnological fields. Ophthalmology, as a branch of medicine that requires great precision and innovation, is gradually becoming one of the hotspots for nanotechnology applications. Although the research and application of nanomaterials in ophthalmology have made some progress, the potential of SWCNTs in ophthalmology has not yet been explored. This paper is a comprehensive review of the applications of nanomaterials in ophthalmology, including their use in drug delivery, antimicrobials, imaging, tissue repair, and photodynamic therapy, and further explores the similar roles of SWCNTs in other medical fields, thus speculating on their potentially important value in ophthalmic research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126731/"}

{"id": "19293873", "title": "Dual-conjugate adaptive optics for wide-field high-resolution retinal imaging.", "text": "We present analysis and preliminary laboratory testing of a real-time dual-conjugate adaptive optics (DCAO) instrument for ophthalmology that will enable wide-field high resolution imaging of the retina in vivo. The setup comprises five retinal guide stars (GS) and two deformable mirrors (DM), one conjugate to the pupil and one conjugate to a plane close to the retina. The DCAO instrument has a closed-loop wavefront sensing wavelength of 834 nm and an imaging wavelength of 575 nm. It incorporates an array of collimator lenses to spatially filter the light from all guide stars using one adjustable iris, and images the Hartmann patterns of multiple reference sources on a single detector. Zemax simulations were performed at 834 nm and 575 nm with the Navarro 99 and the Liou- Brennan eye models. Two correction alternatives were evaluated; conventional single conjugate AO (SCAO, using one GS and a pupil DM) and DCAO (using multiple GS and two DM). Zemax simulations at 575 nm based on the Navarro 99 eye model show that the diameter of the corrected field of view for diffraction-limited imaging (Strehl >or= 0.8) increases from 1.5 deg with SCAO to 6.5 deg using DCAO. The increase for the less stringent condition of a wavefront error of 1 rad or less (Strehl >or= 0.37) is from 3 deg with SCAO to approximately 7.4 deg using DCAO. Corresponding results for the Liou-Brennan eye model are 3.1 deg (SCAO) and 8.2 deg (DCAO) for Strehl >or= 0.8, and 4.8 deg (SCAO) and 9.6 deg (DCAO) for Strehl >or= 0.37. Potential gain in corrected field of view with DCAO is confirmed both by laboratory experiments on a model eye and by preliminary in vivo imaging of a human eye.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19293873/"}

However, the lack of a precise and standard guide for the tortuosity evaluation hinders its use for diagnostic and treatment purposes. This work aims to advance in the standardization of the retinal vascular tortuosity as a clinical biomarker with diagnostic potential, allowing, thereby, the validation of objective computational measurements on the basis of the entire spectrum of the expert knowledge. This paper describes a multi-expert validation process of the computational vascular tortuosity measurements of reference. A group of five experts, covering the different clinical profiles of an ophthalmological service, and a four-grade scale from non-tortuous to severe tortuosity as well as non-tortuous / tortuous and asymptomatic / symptomatic binary classifications are considered for the analysis of the the multi-expert validation procedure. The specialists rating process comprises two rounds involving all the experts and a joint round to establish consensual rates. The expert agreement is analyzed throughout the rating procedure and, then, the consensual rates are set as the reference to validate the prognostic performance of four computational tortuosity metrics of reference. The Kappa indexes for the intra-rater agreement analysis were obtained between 0.35 and 0.83 whereas for the inter-rater agreement in the asymptomatic / symptomatic classification were between 0.22 and 0.76. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each expert against the consensual rates were placed between 0.61 and 0.83 whereas the prognostic performance of the best objective tortuosity metric was 0.80. There is a high inter and intra-rater variability, especially for the case of the four grade scale. The prognostic performance of the tortuosity measurements is close to the experts' performance, especially for Grisan measurement. However, there is a gap between the automatic effectiveness and the expert perception given the lack of clinical criteria in the computational measurements.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458717/"}

This scoping review describes the evidence and potential role for VS in ophthalmic practice and education. A literature search strategy was developed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We included full-text articles published in an English-language peer-reviewed journal that involved physician-physician or physician-trainee VS in ophthalmology. We excluded studies with direct (in-person) supervision. Two investigators independently extracted from each article the year of publication and study location, design, participant characteristics, sample size, and outcomes. We appraised the methodological quality of the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Seven articles were included in our qualitative synthesis. Supervisees ranged from physicians such as an ophthalmic surgeon and a general practitioner to medical trainees such as ophthalmology residents, vitreoretinal fellows, and emergency medicine residents. Study settings included emergency departments, operating rooms, eye clinics, and a rural hospital. All studies reported successful transmission of real-time images or videos of clinical examinations and surgical or in-office procedures. Various methods were used to ensure high image and video quality during VS, although some technical challenges remained. MMAT ratings revealed limitations in outcome measurement, statistical analysis, sampling strategy, and inclusion of confounding factors. Virtual supervision in ophthalmology is technologically feasible and permits synchronous communication and transmission of clinical data, which can be used to formulate diagnostic and management plans and learn new surgical skills. Future studies with larger sample sizes and robust study designs should investigate factors that make VS effective in ophthalmic practice and education.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37017740/"}

During his stay at the University of Prague, he was influenced by the famous people of his time, such as Einstein (physicist), Mach (physicist and psychophysicist), Lorenz (behavioral scientist), Popper (philosopher), Schlick (physicist and philosopher), Hering (physiologist), and others. Goldmann absorbed the essence of these disciplines to a very large extent. This, together with his remarkable intellect, enabled him to produce outstanding research work within a large spectrum of sciences more or less directly related to ophthalmology. Goldmann became known in particular for his exceptional and fundamental work on perimetry and glaucoma and he managed to cast his basic insight into practical, easy-to-operate, high-precision diagnostic instruments which, several decades after their invention, are still used by every ophthalmologist.

The context-sensitive configuration and orchestration of interoperable, networked medical devices is a prerequisite for an effective reduction in the surgeons' workload, by providing the right service and right information at the right time. The information about the surgical situation must be described as surgical process models and distributed to the medical devices and IT systems in the OR. Available modeling languages are not capable of describing surgical processes for this application. In this work, the BPMN<sup>SIX</sup> modeling language for intraoperative processes is technically enhanced and implemented for workflow build-time and run-time. Therefore, particular attention is given to the integration of the recently published IEEE 11073 SDC standard family for a service-oriented architecture of networked medical devices. In addition, interaction patterns for context-aware configuration and device orchestration were presented. The identified interaction patterns were implemented in BPMN<sup>SIX</sup> for an ophthalmologic use case. Therefore, the examples of the process-driven incorporation and control of device services could be demonstrated. The modeling of surgical procedures with BPMN<sup>SIX</sup> allows the implementation of context-sensitive surgical assistance functionalities and enables flexibility in terms of the orchestration of dynamically changing device ensembles and integration of unknown devices in the surgical workflow management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055764/"}
