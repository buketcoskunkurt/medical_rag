This review highlights sleep's instrumental biological functions, various sleep problems, and sleep hygiene and lifestyle interventions that can help improve sleep quality. Quality sleep allows for improved cardiovascular health, mental health, cognition, memory consolidation, immunity, reproductive health, and hormone regulation. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders, or disrupted sleep from lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, or other medical issues can lead to significant morbidity and can contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The best treatment for long-term sleep improvement is proper sleep hygiene through behavior and sleep habit modification. Recommendations to improve sleep include achieving 7 to 9 h of sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep/wake schedule, a regular bedtime routine, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting a contemplative practice. In addition, avoiding many substances late in the day can help improve sleep. Caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and light exposure later in the day are associated with fragmented poor-quality sleep. These sleep hygiene practices can promote better quality and duration of sleep, with corresponding health benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36841492/"}
{"id": "35506356", "title": "Sleep, insomnia and mental health.", "text": "While sleep serves important regulatory functions for mental health, sleep disturbances, in particular insomnia, may favour a state of allostatic overload impairing brain neuroplasticity and stress immune pathways, hence contributing to mental disorders. In this framework, the aim of this work was to link current understanding about insomnia mechanisms with current knowledge about mental health dysregulatory mechanisms. The focus of the present work was on mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, which represent important challenges in clinical practice. Literature searches were conducted on clinical, neurobiological, and therapeutic implications for insomnia comorbid with these mental disorders. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. Insomnia may play an important role as a risk factor, a comorbid condition and transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders including mood/anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Insomnia may also play a role as a marker of disrupted neuroplasticity contributing to dysregulation of different neurobiological mechanisms involved in these different mental conditions. In this framework, insomnia treatment may not only foster normal sleep processes but also the stress system, neuroinflammation and brain plasticity. Insomnia treatment may play an important preventive and neuroprotective role with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia being the treatment with important new evidence of efficacy for insomnia, psychopathology, and indices of disrupted neuroplasticity. On the other hand, pharmacological pathways for insomnia treatment in these mental conditions are still not well defined. Therapeutic options acting on melatonergic systems and new therapeutic options acting on orexinergic systems may represents interesting pathways of interventions that may open new windows on insomnia treatment in mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35506356/"}

The introduction of polysomnography into psychiatric research confirmed a disturbance of sleep continuity in patients with depression, revealing not only a decrease in Slow Wave Sleep, but also a disinhibition of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, demonstrated as a shortening of REM latency, an increase of REM density, as well as total REM sleep time. Initial hopes that these abnormalities of REM sleep may serve as differential-diagnostic markers for subtypes of depression were not fulfilled. Almost all antidepressant agents suppress REM sleep and a time-and-dose-response relationship between total REM sleep suppression and therapeutic response to treatment seemed apparent. The so-called Cholinergic REM Induction Test revealed that REM sleep abnormalities can be mimicked by administration of cholinomimetic agents. Another important research avenue is the study of chrono-medical timing of sleep deprivation and light exposure for their positive effects on mood in depression. Present day research takes the view on insomnia, i.e., prolonged sleep latency, problems to maintain sleep, and early morning awakening, as a transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders, being most closely related to depression. Studying insomnia from different angles as a transdiagnostic phenotype has opened many new perspectives for research into mechanisms but also for clinical practice. Thus, the question is: can the early and adequate treatment of insomnia prevent depression? This article will link current understanding about sleep regulatory mechanisms with knowledge about changes in physiology due to depression. The review aims to draw the attention to current and future strategies in research and clinical practice to the benefits of sleep and depression therapeutics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31071719/"}

Treating insomnia has been shown to improve outcomes, including reduced risk of developing cardiovascular and mental health disorders. Insomnia is influenced by the brain's regulation of sleep and wake, which are mutually exclusive events. Insomnia should be treated as a distinct condition, even when occurring with a comorbid diagnosis such as depression or anxiety. Clinicians should implement a multimodal approach to insomnia management, including nonpharmacologic interventions and pharmacologic therapy (when indicated). Pharmacologic agents that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon), low-dose doxepin (tricyclic antidepressant), ramelteon (melatonin receptor agonist), and dual orexin receptor agonists (DORAs, daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant). Unlike other pharmacologic agents, DORAs inhibit wakefulness rather than induce sedation. Additionally, these medications have no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal, and little to no abuse potential. Daridorexant is the newest DORA, has an ideal half-life of 8 hours, and has demonstrated continued efficacy over a 12-month period. Selection of pharmacologic agent should be based on the patient's comorbid conditions, treatment goals and preferences, and other clinical characteristics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37549414/"}

Recent studies support the notion that metabolic processes correlate with sleep. The study of metabolite biomarkers (metabolomics) in a large-scale manner offers unique opportunities to provide insights into the pathology of diseases by revealing alterations in metabolic pathways. This review aims to summarize the status of metabolomic analyses-based knowledge on sleep disorders and to present knowledge in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. Overall, findings suggest that sleep-wake disorders lead to pronounced alterations in specific metabolic pathways, which might contribute to the association of sleep disorders with other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. These alterations are mainly related to changes in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. In insomnia, alterations in branched-chain amino acid and glucose metabolism were shown among studies. In obstructive sleep apnea, biomarkers related to lipid metabolism seem to be of special importance. Future studies are needed to examine severity, subtypes and treatment of sleep-wake disorders in the context of metabolite levels.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33008070/"}

However, some recommendations claim that only hypnotics have been proven effective in the treatment of sleep initiation and maintenance disorders. The aim of this article is to compare the effect of hypnotics and trazodone on sleep, and to analyse the evidence for the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. Three studies investigated the effects of trazodone on sleep in primary insomnia, 5 studies on insomnia in the course of affective disorders and 6 studies on insomnia in other indications (PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol and opiate dependence, somatoform disorder, and insomnia during pregnancy). In the treatment of insomnia, trazodone is less effective than hypnotics in the treatment of sleep onset insomnia (i.e., disorders of falling asleep). For this indication it needs to be administered earlier than hypnotics, at least 1 hour before bedtime. It is, however, very effective in the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, especially in patients with comorbid mental disorders or patients treated with activating antidepressants. Hypnotics and trazodone have the opposite effect on deep sleep. Trazodone increases the duration of deep sleep, which is associated with better sleep quality as assessed by patients. In contrast, hypnotics decrease slow-wave activityin sleep EEG, which is the biomarker of deep sleep. The main mechanism through which trazodone promotes sleep is its antagonistic effect on 5-HT2 serotonin receptors, while hypnotics are agonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAA receptors, and other sedative antidepressants block H1 histamine receptors. This is associated with a low risk of weight gain, which is rare with trazodone treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994734/"}
{"id": "32790576", "title": "Brain mechanisms of insomnia: new perspectives on causes and consequences.", "text": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32790576/"}

Insomnia disorder is associated with depression and other psychiatric disorders, and is an independent risk factor for suicidality and substance use in adolescents, raising the possibility that treating insomnia symptoms in early adolescence may reduce risk for these adverse outcomes.

This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of Ashwagandha root extract on sleep in healthy subjects and also in the subjects having insomnia. We performed a randomized, parallel-group, stratified design, placebo-controlled study. A total of 80 eligible participants, 40 in Arm-A (healthy) and 40 in Arm-B (insomnia) were assigned to two groups, either Ashwagandha or placebo and studied for 8-weeks. The assessment was done based on the sleep parameters (Sleep Onset Latency, Total Sleep Time, Wake After Sleep Onset, Total time in bed, and Sleep Efficiency), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Hamilton Anxiety scale-A questionnaire, mental alertness on rising assessment, and sleep quality questionnaire. Safety and adverse events along with the concomitant medication were also assessed. In both healthy and insomnia subjects, there was a significant improvement in the sleep parameters in the Ashwagandha root extract supplemented group. The improvement was found more significant in insomnia subjects than healthy subjects. Repeat measure Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed the significant improvement in SOL (p 0.013), HAM-A outcomes (p < 0.05), mental alertness (p 0.01), and sleep quality (p < 0.05) of the insomnia patients. A two-way ANOVA was used to confirm the outcomes that denoted sleep onset latency (p < 0.0001) and sleep efficiency (p < 0.0001) as the most improved parameters, followed by TST (p < 0.002) and WASO(p < 0.040). All these parameters (SOL, TST, WASO, TIB, SE, PSQI, HAM-A, Mental Alertness, and Sleep quality) were also statistically assessed for the significant improvement within the group both for the treatment, and the placebo groups in the healthy and the insomnia datasets.

Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined. Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMD = - 0.327, 95% CI = - 0.506 to - 0.148, P < 0.001).

Participants were 959 individuals selected from the community for an epidemiological study of insomnia (Community sample) and 183 individuals evaluated for insomnia treatment and 62 controls without insomnia (Clinical sample). They completed the ISI and several measures of sleep quality, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and quality of life; those in the Clinical sample also completed sleep diaries, polysomnography, and interviews to validate their insomnia/good sleep status and assess treatment response. In addition to standard psychometric indices of reliability and validity, item response theory analyses were computed to examine ISI item response patterns. Receiver operating curves were used to derive optimal cutoff scores for case identification and to quantify the minimally important changes in relation to global improvement ratings obtained by an independent assessor. ISI internal consistency was excellent for both samples (Cronbach α of 0.90 and 0.91). Item response analyses revealed adequate discriminatory capacity for 5 of the 7 items. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between total ISI score and measures of fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. A cutoff score of 10 was optimal (86.1% sensitivity and 87.7% specificity) for detecting insomnia cases in the community sample. In the clinical sample, a change score of -8.4 points (95% CI: -7.1, -9.4) was associated with moderate improvement as rated by an independent assessor after treatment.

Outcomes were assessed at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size estimates. During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. 42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures.

Randomization was to one of three groups: antidepressant (AD; escitalopram) + CBT-I (4 sessions), CBT-I + placebo pill, or AD + 4-session sleep hygiene control (SH). Subjective sleep was assessed via 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries (use of medication was covaried in all analyses); although there were no statistically significant group differences detected, all groups improved from baseline to posttreatment on subjective sleep efficiency (SE) and total wake time (TWT) and the effect sizes were large. Objective sleep was assessed via overnight polysomnographic monitoring at baseline and posttreatment; analyses revealed both CBT groups improved on TWT (p = .03), but the AD + SH group worsened. There was no statistically significant effect for PSG SE (p = .07). There was a between groups medium effect observed for the AD + SH and CBT + placebo group differences on diary TWT and both PSG variables. All groups improved significantly from baseline to posttreatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17); the groups did not differ. Although all groups self-reported sleeping better after treatment, only the CBT-I groups improved on objective sleep, and AD + SH's sleep worsened.

This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported.

Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290199/"}

Perception of wakefulness following serial awakenings from NREM sleep was frequent in both patients and controls, with no significant group difference. High frequency spectral power, as an index of cortical arousal prior to awakening, but not standard measures of sleep, predicted the perception of wakefulness across groups, possibly related to physiological wake-like activity during sleep.

While the cognitive and behavioural consequences of poor sleep and insomnia have been studied in depth in recent decades, emotional experience empirical findings in this area still need to be replicated and confirmed. Review article included studies published from January 1990 to March 2020 accessed via PubMed database. The keywords \"Insomnia, Emotional regulation, Nightmares, Mental disorders, Sleep quality, Nightmares treatment\" were used in various combinations. The total of 145 articles was found, and after their complete review, 42 papers were selected. Secondary texts from reference lists of primarily selected articles were examined and added to the primary document list. Finally, a total of 159 articles were included in the review. Sleep is involved in emotion regulation both in the general population and individuals with various mental disorders. Several studies found that pre-sleep emotional activation of negative and positive emotions disturbs sleep by enhancing emotional excitement. On the other hand, many studies showed that poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation adversely affects the emotional functioning in adults. The results of the studies summarized in this review show that emotional regulation can mediate the effect of insomnia on various psychiatric disorders. Insomnia can be a significant risk factor that should be targeted in various psychiatric disorders. Targeted prevention of affective disorders in patients who have insomnia, as well as identification of transformation mechanisms, could be an advantageous approach to alleviating their burden. Complex treatment, including cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, added to the primary treatment of these disorders, is recommended.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33315339/"}

The literature underlines the close association between impaired sleep quality and difficulties in regulating emotions. Impaired sleep quality is also associated with reduced positive affect and increased negative affect, but little evidence supports a bi-directional association between affective states and sleep. Affect variability in relation to sleep has been less investigated. Initial evidence suggests that high variability in positive affect has a negative impact on sleep. Neurobiological and behavioural evidence indicates that insomnia disorder is associated with emotion dysregulation, negative affect, and a distinct daily profile of affective states.

The low-frequency, high-amplitude slow waves that dominate the electroencephalogram (EEG) during SWS can be quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA). SWS and SWA are regulated very accurately in response to variations in the duration and intensity of wakefulness and sleep. SWA declines more or less independently of circadian phase during the course of a sleep episode, indicating that it is primarily under homeostatic rather than circadian control. An age-related decline in SWS and SWA is well established. In some studies, apprehension, depression and insomnia have been associated with reductions in SWS and SWA. Experimental reductions of SWS through SWS deprivation (without altering total sleep time or REM duration) have been reported to lead to an increase in daytime sleep propensity and reductions in performance. SWS and SWA are therefore thought to contribute to the recovery processes that occur during sleep. Most currently prescribed hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, suppress SWA. Some compounds have been shown to enhance SWS and SWA in healthy volunteers through GAT-1 inhibition, GABA-A modulation, GABA-B modulation, and 5HT2(A) antagonism.

Although sleep macrostructures facilitate classification of sleep disorders, sleep arousals being directly associated with changes in sleep microstructure, cause sleep instability, particularly in insomnia, and thereby prove to be useful for classifying insomnia.

Nonpharmacologic management strategies (e.g., stimulus control, relaxation therapy, sleep hygiene) are therapeutic options that, compared with medication use, provide more sustained effects. The benzodiazepines and zolpidem are the most commonly prescribed hypnotic agents, but their use is associated with tolerance and central nervous system adverse effects. A new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, zaleplon, was very recently approved in the United States. Because of its short half-life, zaleplon will be useful in patients experiencing difficulty in falling asleep and in those who wake up at night and have trouble falling back to sleep. Antidepressants, antihistamines, and alternative medications are other treatment options. To avoid complications of therapy, hypnotic agents should be used at their lowest possible doses and for limited treatment durations.

We recorded electrocardiography, posture, and actigraphy in 33 people without sleep complaints and 158 patients with mild to severe insomnia over 4 d in their home environment. At the microscale, we investigated whether HR changed with proximity to gross (body) and small (wrist) movements at nighttime.

At the microscale, an increase in HR was often detectable already 60 s prior to as well as following a nocturnal chest, but not wrist, movement. This increase was slightly steeper in insomnia and was associated with insomnia severity, but future EEG recordings are necessary to elucidate whether these changes occur prior to or simultaneously with PSG-indicators of wakefulness.

Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing.

Therefore, for the first time, a systematic review on the effects of ACT on sleep quality has been conducted. This systematic review was performed to determine the effect of ACT on insomnia and sleep quality. To collect articles, the PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Cochrane library, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, ProQuest, Mag Iran, Irandoc, and Google Scholar databases were searched, without a lower time-limit, and until April 2020. Related articles were derived from 9 research repositories, with no lower time-limit and until April 2020. After assessing 1409 collected studies, 278 repetitive studies were excluded. Moreover, following the primary and secondary evaluations of the remaining articles, 1112 other studies were removed, and finally a total of 19 intervention studies were included in the systematic review process. Within the remaining articles, a sample of 1577 people had been assessed for insomnia and sleep quality. The results of this study indicate that ACT has a significant effect on primary and comorbid insomnia and sleep quality, and therefore, it can be used as an appropriate treatment method to control and improve insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791960/"}

This study aimed to determine which modifiable factors, beyond stress, were associated with acute insomnia during a major crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. A global online survey assessed sleep/circadian, stress, mental health, and lifestyle factors between April-May 2020. Logistic regression models analyzed data from 1319 participants (578 acute insomnia, 731 good sleepers), adjusted for demographic differences. Perceived stress was a significant predictor of acute insomnia during the pandemic (OR 1.23, 95% CI1.19-1.27). After adjusting for stress, individuals who altered their sleep-wake patterns (OR 3.36, CI 2.00-5.67) or increased technology use before bed (OR 3.13, CI 1.13-8.65) were at increased risk of acute insomnia. Other sleep factors associated with acute insomnia included changes in dreams/nightmares (OR 2.08, CI 1.32-3.27), increased sleep effort (OR 1.99, CI1.71-2.31) and cognitive pre-sleep arousal (OR 1.18, CI 1.11-1.24). For pandemic factors, worry about contracting COVID-19 (OR 3.08, CI 1.18-8.07) and stringent government COVID-19 restrictions (OR 1.12, CI =1.07-1.18) were associated with acute insomnia. Anxiety (OR 1.02, CI 1.01-1.05) and depressive (OR 1.29, CI 1.22-1.37) symptoms were also risk factors. A final hierarchical regression model revealed that after accounting for stress, altered sleep-wake patterns were a key behavioral predictor of acute insomnia (OR 2.60, CI 1.68-5.81). Beyond stress, altered sleep-wake patterns are a key risk factor for acute insomnia.

This study used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal relationship between self-reported short sleep duration, insomnia and long sleep duration and cognitive function. A total of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with short sleep duration, 240 associated with insomnia, and 7 associated with long sleep duration were extracted from a genome-wide association study primarily based on European ancestry, to be used as instrumental variables. Summary-level statistics were obtained from the Dementia genome-wide association studies database. MR estimation was performed using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary method, supplemented by MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimator methods. Finally, multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to obtain robust and valid estimates. Based on IVW methods, short sleep duration showed a harmful impact on cognitive performance score (beta = -0.15, 95% CI: -0.27 to -0.02, P = 0.02, IVW), fluid intelligence score (beta = -0.38; 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.11; P = 0.006, IVW), memory performance (beta = -0.10, 95% CI: -0.20 to -0.0005; P = 0.04, IVW) and Trail Making (TM) test (TM: interval in trail 2 path, beta = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.21; P = 0.03, IVW; TM: duration to complete trail 2 path, beta = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.002 to 0.22; P = 0.04, IVW). In addition, insomnia was causally associated with Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.24, p = 0.02, IVW). However, due to the limited number of SNPs (n = 7) available as instruments for long sleep duration, there was no strong evidence to support a causal effect of long sleep duration on cognitive outcomes. This study suggests self-reported short sleep duration was causally associated with cognitive decline and self-reported insomnia was causally associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in individuals of European ancestry. The evidence of causality between long sleep duration and cognitive function requires further investigation.

Although multiple mechanisms have been hypothesized to be involved in their pathogenesis, just a few integrative theoretical frameworks have been proposed and have yet to integrate comprehensively all available findings. As such, a comprehensive framework would be quite useful from a clinical and therapeutic point of view in order to identify elements to evaluate and target in the clinical practice. Because conditions of sleep loss, which include reduced sleep duration and insomnia, are constant alterations in mood disorders, the aim of this paper was to review the literature on their potential role in the pathogenesis of mood disorders and to propose a novel theoretical model. According to this hypothesis, sleep should be considered the main regulator of several systems and processes whose dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. The model may help explain why sleep disturbances are so strikingly linked to mood disorders, and underscores the need to evaluate, assess and target sleep disturbances in clinical practice, as a priority, in order to prevent and treat mood disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968511/"}

Only about half of all patients who complained of difficulties in initiating sleep at T1 still exclusively reported sleep-onset insomnia 4 months later, whereas the remaining patients were distributed to different subtypes. The stability of sleep-maintaining insomnia and insomnia with early morning awakening was even lower.

Self-reported sleep measurements included bedtime, rise time, time in bed, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, rate and frequency and duration of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and rate and frequency of tiredness and sleepiness. The adolescents reported short sleep duration on weekdays (mean 6:25 hours), resulting in a sleep deficiency of about 2 h. A majority of the adolescents (65%) reported sleep onset latency exceeding 30 min. Girls reported longer sleep onset latency and a higher rate of insomnia than boys, while boys reported later bedtimes and a larger weekday-weekend discrepancy on several sleep parameters. Insomnia prevalence rates ranged from a total prevalence of 23.8 (DSM-IV criteria), 18.5 (DSM-V criteria) and 13.6% (quantitative criteria for insomnia).

We studied 41 patients with chronic insomnia who had received 5-week CBT-I. Self-reported and objective sleep were assessed with sleep diary and actigraphy, respectively. Sleep perception was calculated as self-reported total sleep time/objective total sleep time. The underestimation of sleep duration group was defined based on sleep perception less than the median of the overall sample (85%). Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess the severity of insomnia. The total scores of Insomnia Severity Index decreased significantly after CBT-I in both groups with and without underestimation of sleep duration. Compared to pretreatment, self-reported sleep efficiency increased and total wake time decreased after CBT-I, while the magnitude of changes in sleep efficiency (<i>d</i> = 1.40 vs <i>d</i>=0.81, interaction <i>P</i> = .016) and total wake time (<i>d</i> = -1.82 vs <i>d</i> = -0.85, interaction <i>P</i> < .001) were larger in the underestimation of sleep duration group . Furthermore, self-reported sleep onset latency (interaction <i>P</i> = .520) and wake after sleep onset (interaction <i>P</i> = .052) decreased in the underestimation of sleep duration group (all <i>P</i> < .05), but not in patients without underestimation of sleep duration. Linear regressions showed that lower sleep perception at baseline predicted greater increase in self-reported sleep efficiency (β = -0.99, <i>P</i> < .001) and total sleep time (β = -0.51, <i>P</i> = .006) and greater decrease in self-reported total wake time (β=1.22, <i>P</i> = .023) after CBT-I after adjusting for confounders.

In order to understand and diagnose insomnia in childhood it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the genesis of sleeping and waking. We must also take the possible existence of other types of disorders into consideration. Insomnia appears as an imbalance between the systems that maintain the waking state and those that are in charge of activating sleep generating systems. In children, this imbalance depends on the state of functional immaturity peculiar to each age. Rather than a shortage of sleep, childhood insomnia takes the form of a lack of matching between the child s own rhythm or need to sleep and his or her family or social environment. Insomnia is most frequently caused by environmental, behavioural and psychological factors. A correct diagnosis of childhood insomnia has to be based on determining a procedure to differentiate it from parasomnias or motor disorders affecting waking and sleep.

Globally, large surveys and tightly controlled sleep deprivation or manipulation experiments provide good evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between sleep and subclinical psychotic experiences. The evidence for cause-and-effect using a interventionist-causal model is more ambiguous; it would appear treating insomnia improves psychotic experiences in an insomnia cohort but not in a cohort with schizophrenia.

We demonstrate the socio-ecologial impact of sleep health with findings on gender and couples' relationships as exemplars. Robust gender differences in sleep duration and insomnia are due to biological and socio-ecological factors. Gender differences in insufficient sleep vary by country of origin and age whereas gender differences in insomnia reflect minoritized identities (e.g., sexual, gender). Co-sleeping with a partner is associated with longer sleep and more awakenings. Gender differences and couples' sleep were affected by intersecting social and societal influences, which supports a socio-ecological approach to sleep. Recent and seminal contributions to sleep health highlight the importance of observing individual sleep outcomes in a socio-ecological context. Novel methodology, such as global measures of sleep health, can inform efforts to improve sleep and, ultimately, public health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36401678/"}

The present review considers the influence of sleep disturbance on the neurovascular unit; the role of sleep disturbance in neurodegenerative diseases; and relevant strategies of neuro-immuno-endocrine interactions that likely contribute to the restorative power of sleep. Given the latest discoveries about the brain's waste clearance system and its relationship to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, this review gives a brief overview on the molecular mechanisms behind sleep loss-related impairments. Recent evidence indicates that sleep plays a vital role in neuro-immuno-endocrine homeostasis. Sleep loss has been linked to elevated risks for cognitive and mood disorders, underscored by impaired synaptic transmission. The glymphatic system has been shown to be modulated by sleep and implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Interactions between sleep quality, the immune system, and neurodegenerative disease are complex and a challenge to distil. These interactions are frequently bidirectional, because of sleep's characterization as an early symptom and as a potential factor contributing to the development and progression of mood and cognitive disorders.

For this reason, research is needed to identify modifiable individual difference variables that may contribute to better sleep in this population. Temperament and sleep hygiene may be two such factors. As part of a larger study, 167 university students (61.7% female) completed online questionnaires that inquired about temperament (the Adult Temperament Questionnaire; ATQ), sleep hygiene behavior (the Sleep Hygiene Index; SHI), global sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI), and insomnia severity (the Insomnia Severity Index; ISI). Correlations amongst the included measures were in the predicted direction: effortful control was negatively associated with the SHI composite, PSQI global scores, and ISI scores; extraversion was negatively related to PSQI global scores; and negative affect was positively associated with the SHI composite and ISI scores. In addition, the SHI composite mediated the association between effortful control and the PSQI global scores as well as the association between negative affect and PSQI global scores; similar patterns of mediation were found when considering ISI scores, although the direct effects differed. That is, negative affect was directly associated with ISI scores but not PSQI global scores. These findings suggest that interventions designed enhance effortful control, reduce negative affect, and improve sleep hygiene may contribute to better global sleep quality and decrease insomnia in university students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34264959/"}

However, most individuals with transient insomnia do not develop chronic insomnia. The current study investigated the differential contributing factors for these two conditions to further the understanding of this phenomenon. Chronic insomnia patients and normal sleepers with high and low vulnerability to transient insomnia completed measures of pre-sleep arousal, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, and sleep-related safety behaviors. Both cognitive and somatic pre-sleep arousals were identified as significant predictors for transient insomnia. Dysfunctional beliefs regarding worry about insomnia and cognitive arousal were predictors for chronic insomnia. Sleep-related safety behavior, although correlated with insomnia severity, was not a significant predictor for both conditions. Dysfunctional beliefs associated with worry and losing control over sleep are the most critical factors in differentiating chronic insomnia from transient insomnia. These factors should be addressed to help prevent individuals with high sleep vulnerability from developing chronic sleep disturbance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23797824/"}

As a consequence, almost 40% of hypnotic medications are prescribed to people over age 60. Yet, hypnotics are often of little benefit in this population. As such, an effective non-drug alternative could prove important in the management of age-related sleep maintenance insomnia. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of bright light exposure in the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Following baseline sleep and circadian rhythms assessment, subjects with sleep-maintenance insomnia were treated with timed exposure to either bright white light or dim red light for 12 consecutive days. Sleep and circadian rhythms recordings were subsequently obtained and measures of sleep quality were compared to assess efficacy of the treatments. Baseline and post-treatment sleep and circadian rhythms assessments took place in the Laboratory of Human Chronobiology, Department of Psychiatry, Cornell University Medical College. The treatment phase of the study was conducted in participants' homes. Sixteen men and women between the ages of 62 and 81 years were studied. All subjects were free of hypnotic medication, and all had experienced sleep disturbance for at least 1 year prior to entering the study. Exposure to bright light resulted in substantial changes in sleep quality. Waking time within sleep was reduced by an hour, and sleep efficiency improved from 77.5% to 90%, without altering time spent in bed. Increased sleep time was in the form of Stage 2 sleep, REM sleep, and slow wave sleep. The effects were remarkably consistent across subjects. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of timed exposure to bright light in the treatment of age-related sleep maintenance insomnia. With further refinement of treatment regimens, this non-drug intervention may prove useful in a large proportion of sleep disturbed elderly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8340561/"}

Various diagnostic systems emphasize the chronic nature of insomnia and its impact on daily functioning, relying heavily on patient self-reporting due to limitations in objective measures such as polysomnography (PSG). Discrepancies between subjective experiences and objective PSG results highlight the need for more nuanced approaches, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis, which reveals distinct patterns of high-frequency activity in individuals with insomnia. This study explores EEG markers of insomnia by integrating subjective reports with objective physiological markers, specifically ORP (Odds-Ratio-Product) and spectral features, to address inconsistencies found in previous research and clinical settings. Qualitative and quantitative definitions of insomnia are contrasted to highlight differences in sleep architecture and EEG characteristics. The research aims to determine whether groups defined by weekly frequency and daily duration of symptoms have different distribution patterns and which physiological characteristics best distinguish insomnia patients from controls. Our findings suggest that ORP, as a dependent variable, captures the most significant differences in the independent variables across the model. Elevated beta power in insomnia patients indicates increased cortical arousal, supporting the perspective of insomnia as a hyperarousal disorder.

Research has identified hyperarousal as a key factor, with both trait and state components. It has been shown that emotion dysregulation also plays a role in insomnia. Hence, the aim was to investigate how insomnia rumination is associated with both trait- and state-dependent arousal and emotion dysregulation in insomnia. Sixty-eight subjects with insomnia disorder (DSM-5) and 36 good sleepers were evaluated using: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Daytime Insomnia Symptom Response Scale (DISRS), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses and mediation analyses were performed. Subjects with insomnia (F 41, mean age 50.2 ± 10) presented higher scores than good sleepers (F 22, mean age 49.7 ± 14) in all the scales (ISI, DISRS, APS, PSAS, DERS; p < 0.0001). Insomnia rumination was directly correlated with trait (APS, B = 0.22, p < 0.0001) pre-sleep state arousal (PSAS cognitive B = 0.22, p < 0.0001, PSAS somatic B = 0.24, p < 0.0001) and emotion dysregulation (B = 0.5, p = 0.03). It mediated the association between trait and pre-sleep state hyperarousal (Z = 3.3, p = 0.0008), the bidirectional association between cognitive and somatic arousal (p = 0.02), and the association between trait hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation (Z = 2.3, p = 0.04). In insomnia, specific rumination is related to both trait predisposition to arousal and to state-dependent arousal. It is also related to emotion dyregulation. Insomnia-specific ruminative response style may modulate the complex association between trait- and state-dependent arousal factors and arousal and emotion regulation in insomnia.

The aim of this study was to estimate meaningful within-patient change for sTST using clinical trial data. Data were from an open-label trial of zolpidem and pooled data from a phase III placebo-controlled trial of daridorexant. In both trials, adults with moderate to severe insomnia completed the SDQ daily. Meaningful change in sTST was estimated in an anchor-based analysis using outcome measures that were correlated with change in weekly average sTST (Spearman correlation coefficient ≥ 0.30): the Insomnia Severity Index, patient global assessments and impressions of severity and change in daytime and night-time symptoms (PGA-S, PGI-S, PGI-C), and clinician global impressions of severity and change in patients' daytime symptoms (CGI-S, CGI-C). Meaningful within-patient change estimates were 'triangulated' to identify a value where they converged. In the open-label trial (N = 114), subjects with a 1-point or 1-step improvement on the anchors had mean increases in sTST of 60.1-83.2 min at day 8 and 55.5-68.2 min at day 15. For subjects with a 2-point or 2-step improvement on the anchors, mean increases in sTST were 79.6-81.4 min at day 8 and 80.1-93.5 min at day 15. In the phase III trial (N = 930), weekly average increases in sTST for subjects with a 1-point or 1-step improvement on the anchors were 39.3-46.7 min at month 1 and 47.3-58.3 min at month 3. For subjects with a 2-point or 2-step improvement on the anchors, mean increases in sTST were 60.7-76.2 min at month 1 and 70.1-87.7 min at month 3. Triangulation of these values supported a meaningful within-patient change threshold starting at 55 min. Increasing sTST is an important treatment outcome for people with insomnia.

Specifically, this research examined differences in sleep interruption factors, use of sleep promotion aids, sleep characteristics and insomnia management between men and women who are first generation Korean-American older adult immigrants. Older adults feel that their sleep is shallow, interrupted frequently and is insufficient. If sleep changes are severe, it is difficult for older adults to maintain an awakened state during the day. This was a descriptive survey study. The survey included a set of four questionnaires. All measures were self-administered. In the data analysis, descriptive statistics was used to analyse demographic characteristics. The chi-squared test and t-test were used to examine the differences between men and women. Most subjects experienced sleep interruption (n = 43, 82.6%) and were not satisfied with their sleep (n = 42, 80.8%). A quarter of the subjects had experience with complementary/alternative therapies to manage insomnia, although 40 subjects (76.9%) wanted to use complementary/alternative therapies to manage their insomnia. The study shows that first generation Korean-American older adult immigrant men and women report sleep interruptions and dissatisfaction with the quality of their sleep. Women were more likely in want of using complementary/alternative therapies for insomnia management than men. Women may have longed more for their traditional healthcare practices.

Despite being recognized for a long time by the international community, it is still unclear whether this entity really exists, which are its features and boundaries. Much of the debate is fuelled by the lack of a consensus on its precise definition. To help filling some of the existing gaps, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, through which 19 different quantitative definitions were obtained. These definitions were then applied to two distinct datasets. The first consisted of 200 chronic primary insomnia patients, diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The second consisted of 200 age- and sex-matched healthy persons without insomnia. For each dataset, available data from the objective sleep parameters and their subjective estimation were imported and analysed in MATLAB. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of paradoxical insomnia ranged from 8 to 66%, while agreement between different definitions ranged from -0.19 to 0.9 (using Cohen's kappa coefficient). Based on the results garnered, necessary features for a quantitative definition of paradoxical insomnia were identified. Several open questions remain, such as whether there is a minimum number of hours a patient should sleep to fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia, and whether sleep latency can be used in the definition along with total sleep time. We conclude by advocating continued study of paradoxical insomnia and sleep state misperception and by providing specific directions for future research. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The current understanding of paradoxical insomnia and, more broadly, of sleep state misperception, is greatly hampered by the lack of agreement on a quantitative and evidence-base measure of the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep evaluation. The current study provides a critical analysis about the strength and the limitations of the available definitions, using both a data-driven and a theory-driven approach. The overarching goal is to motivate a rigorous discussion involving the main experts of the field, to build a consensus, and develop an evidence-based measure of sleep state misperception and/or of paradoxical insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30731262/"}

Pharmacological approaches and brain stimulation techniques have recently offered solutions for increasing slow-wave activity during sleep. We used slow (0.75 Hz) oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation during stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement sleeping insomnia patients for resonating their brain waves to the frequency of sleep slow-wave. Six patients diagnosed with either sleep maintenance or non-restorative sleep insomnia entered the study. After 1 night of adaptation and 1 night of baseline polysomnography, patients randomly received sham or real stimulation on the third and fourth night of the experiment. Our preliminary results show that after termination of stimulations (sham or real), slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation increased the duration of stage 3 of non-rapid eye movement sleep by 33 ± 26 min (P = 0.026), and decreased stage 1 of non-rapid eye movement sleep duration by 22 ± 17.7 min (P = 0.028), compared with sham. Slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation decreased stage 1 of non-rapid eye movement sleep and wake time after sleep-onset durations, together, by 55.4 ± 51 min (P = 0.045). Slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation also increased sleep efficiency by 9 ± 7% (P = 0.026), and probability of transition from stage 2 to stage 3 of non-rapid eye movement sleep by 20 ± 17.8% (P = 0.04).

The quality of the evidence and the risk of bias were moderate. The results suggest that interventions on insomnia in the workplace are effective for improving workers' health, and that improvements in the quality of sleep and a decrease in the symptoms of insomnia are produced, thanks to an increase in weekly sleeping hours and a reduction in latency at sleep onset.

Available models exist primarily in the psychological domain and derive from the demonstrated efficacy of behavioral treatment approaches to insomnia management. However, these models offer little specific prediction about the anatomic or physiological foundation of chronic primary insomnia. On the other hand, a growing body of data on the physiology of sleep supports a reasonably circumscribed overview of possible pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as the development of physiological models of insomnia to guide future research. As a pragmatic step, these models focus on primary insomnia, as opposed to comorbid insomnias, because the latter is by its nature a much more heterogeneous presentation, reflecting the effects of the distinct comorbid condition. Current understanding of the regulation of sleep and wakefulness in mammalian brain supports four broad candidate areas: 1) disruption of the sleep homeostat; 2) disruption of the circadian clock; 3) disruption of intrinsic systems responsible for the expression of sleep states; or 4) disruption (hyperactivity) of extrinsic systems capable of over-riding normal sleep-wake regulation. This review examines each of the four candidate pathophysiological mechanisms and the available data in support of each. While studies that directly test the viability of each model are not yet available, descriptive data on primary insomnia favor the involvement of dysfunctional extrinsic stress-response systems in the pathology of primary chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18346677/"}

The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is commonly used for evaluating sleep disturbance; however, this questionnaire is time-consuming owing to the large number of questions. As the usefulness of the Athens insomnia scale (AIS) in patients with CLD is not sufficiently known, the present study aimed to determine whether the AIS and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) could be used as simple alternative questionnaires for evaluating sleep disturbances in patients with CLD. Materials and Methods: A total of 117 patients with CLD were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy were excluded. All patients were examined using the AIS, PSQI, and ESS, and their responses to these questionnaires were statistically analyzed. Results: The number of patients diagnosed with sleep disturbance using the AIS, PSQI, and ESS were 39 (33.3%), 37 (31.6%), and 9 (7.7%), respectively. There was no correlation between PSQI and ESS scores (r = 0.011, p = 0.910); in contrast, the AIS scores showed a significant correlation with the PSQI scores (r = 0.689, p < 0.001).

In particular, all interventions that require regularity have been removed, and instead, interventions that address factors that proved to be relevant to sleep in our preliminary study have been integrated. We now want to test this manual for its effectiveness.

We investigated the macro- and micro-structure of sleep with and without leg movements in 10 PLMS patients complaining of insomnia to clarify whether periodic leg movements are responsible for sleep disruption. The total sleep time without periodic leg movements was significantly longer than sleep time with leg movements. Sleep time without leg movements was longer than sleep time with leg movements in stage 2, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Short lasting awakenings were significantly more frequent during periodic leg movements associated sleep whilst long lasting awakenings were equally frequent during sleep with and without periodic leg movements. The percentage of the four electroencephalogram (EEG) activities (delta, theta, alpha and spindles) did not show any significant difference between periodic leg movements associated and not associated with sleep stages and total sleep time. The lack of significant differences in both the macro- and micro-structure of sleep and EEG activity content regarding the association with movements confirm the hypothesis that periodic leg movements did not primarily cause sleep disturbance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10886318/"}

The sleeping brain does fail and this failure is manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms; all sleep complaints should be taken seriously and investigated. Transient insomnia is uniformly associated with objective sleep disturbances which have been documented following phase shifts of the major sleep period such as that caused by transmeridian travel. However, the degree to which the individual responds to these factors is variable. There is a consensus that sleep medications are indicated for transient and short-term insomnia.

Insomnia per se is a very frequent complaint and can be caused by environmental, medical, mental or psychosocial factors or the intake of drugs. Primary insomnia is an insomnia subtype characterized by the absence of a causative medical or psychiatric factor. From a pathophysiological point of view, persistent hyperarousal on autonomous, emotional, cognitive or neurobiological levels is thought to be the decisive factor for the development and persistence of chronic primary insomnia. This view is supported by studies confirming that patients with primary insomnia display heightened levels of fast frequencies of the sleep EEG, show increased production of cortisol and interleukin-6, and demonstrate increased metabolism in several brain areas during sleep (as measured by positron emission tomography). Furthermore, primary insomnia is coupled with cognitive deficits during waking and with impairments of nocturnal memory consolidation. Just recently, reductions in hippocampal volume size have been reported in patients suffering from primary insomnia. In the light of neurobiological theories of sleep-wake regulation, primary insomnia may be conceptualised as the final common pathway of the interaction of a genetic vulnerability to an imbalance between arousing and sleep-inducing brain centres (which is triggered by psychosocial and/or medical stressors) with perpetuating mechanisms such as maladaptive behaviours, learned sleep-preventing associations and cognitive factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473230/"}

Sleep issues are prevalent in Veterans and may interfere with PE by disrupting the learning and consolidation of fear extinction memories during PE exposures. Here, we examined whether changes in fear extinction across imaginal exposures and PTSD symptoms during PE were predicted by diary-assessed levels of nightly sleep efficiency (SE; i.e., percent of time in bed spent sleeping), which may indirectly index sleep fragmentation and sleep-facilitated memory processes. Participants were Veterans with PTSD and comorbid insomnia (N = 40) participating in a clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia plus PE. SE was measured via nightly sleep diaries, fear extinction was operationalized as a reduction in peak distress between weekly imaginal exposures, and PTSD symptoms were assessed bi-weekly. Cross-lagged panel models revealed that higher sleep efficiency during the week predicted lower peak distress at the subsequent imaginal exposure and lower PTSD symptoms at the subsequent assessment, whereas PTSD symptoms and peak distress did not predict subsequent sleep efficiency. Efficient sleep may facilitate fear extinction and PTSD reduction during PE. Targeting sleep efficiency could improve PE effectiveness for Veterans with comorbid insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37099850/"}

A total of 177 subjects (121 in the IN group and 56 in the NC group) were evaluated on the basis of EEG sleep, subjective sleep, sleepiness, performance, mood, personality, and metabolic parameters during a 36-hour laboratory stay. Equal percentages of subjects in each group had 0, 1, or 2 nights of poor EEG sleep, indicating that the IN group was not more likely to have impaired sleep in the laboratory. Results of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory showed that subjects in the IN group had more pathological personality profiles, and results of laboratory studies showed that these subjects had worse mood ratings, less subjective sleepiness, poorer memory performance, and longer midafternoon sleep latencies. Subjects in the IN group also rated their laboratory sleep as poorer in quality with more time awake after sleep onset and longer sleep latencies, but no differences in EEG sleep were observed. Poor nights of EEG sleep were associated with being male, increasing age, and a history of more time awake after sleep onset; among the laboratory tests, poor EEG sleep was associated with worse mood ratings, poorer memory performance, longer sleep latencies (as indicated by higher scores on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), higher sleep/wake ratios for metabolic parameters, lower ratings of sleep quality, and longer perceived sleep latencies. A history of chronic insomnia does not predict poor EEG sleep.

{"id": "26229000", "title": "Sleep at high altitude: guesses and facts.", "text": "Lowlanders commonly report a poor sleep quality during the first few nights after arriving at high altitude. Polysomnographic studies reveal that reductions in slow wave sleep are the most consistent altitude-induced changes in sleep structure identified by visual scoring. Quantitative spectral analyses of the sleep electroencephalogram have confirmed an altitude-related reduction in the low-frequency power (0.8-4.6 Hz). Although some studies suggest an increase in arousals from sleep at high altitude, this is not a consistent finding. Whether sleep instability at high altitude is triggered by periodic breathing or vice versa is still uncertain. Overnight changes in slow wave-derived encephalographic measures of neuronal synchronization in healthy subjects were less pronounced at moderately high (2,590 m) compared with low altitude (490 m), and this was associated with a decline in sleep-related memory consolidation. Correspondingly, exacerbation of breathing and sleep disturbances experienced by lowlanders with obstructive sleep apnea during a stay at 2,590 m was associated with poor performance in driving simulator tests. These findings suggest that altitude-related alterations in sleep may adversely affect daytime performance. Despite recent advances in our understanding of sleep at altitude, further research is required to better establish the role of gender and age in alterations of sleep at different altitudes, to determine the influence of acclimatization and of altitude-related illness, and to uncover the characteristics of sleep in highlanders that may serve as a study paradigm of sleep in patients exposed to chronic hypoxia due to cardiorespiratory disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26229000/"}

Limited information is available on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in treating patients who experience significant sleep-wake state discrepancy in \"real-world\" samples. In the present study, all patients with insomnia received cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia through an outpatient insomnia program (N = 386; mean age = 51.96 years, SD = 15.62; 65.97% [N = 254] female). Prior to treatment, participants completed a polysomnography sleep study and sleep diary, which was used to calculate sleep-wake state discrepancy. At pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index and other questionnaires, and 1 week of sleep diaries from which sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset and other sleep variables were calculated. There were no differences in self-reported sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset or Insomnia Severity Index scores at post-treatment or 3-month follow-up between quintiles of sleep-wake state discrepancy. These results indicate that sleep-wake state discrepancy at pre-treatment does not predict treatment response to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia.

Baseline inquiry data concerning psychosocial circumstances and self-reported sleep habits were compared with official register-based DP rates. Five hundred and nine persons were granted a DP. Insomnia symptoms, affirmed by 33 % of the men and 41 % of the women, were associated with receiving a DP; the hazard ratios in the fully adjusted model were 1.4 for both men [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 1.9] and women (95 % CI 1.1, 1.7). The fully adjusted hazard ratio for women sleeping ≥9 h was 7.8 (95 % CI 3.7, 16.6) for DP due to a mental disorder. In the age-adjusted analyses, the sub-domain \"difficulties falling asleep\" was related to DP due to mental disorders in men and DP due to cardiovascular diseases in women. The findings suggest that preventing and treating insomnia symptoms could reduce DP and that disease mechanisms linking sleep disturbances to DP may differ by gender.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23595781/"}

Insomnia is considered one of the climacteric symptoms of menopause, which can be controlled with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This study examined the relationship between menopause and sleep in women with insomnia and compared the sleep quality of menopausal women with and without HRT. A total of 74 women (age range=40-59 years old) with insomnia who were either pre or peri/post menopause were evaluated at Laval University's Sleep Disorders Center as part of ongoing clinical trials of insomnia therapies. All participants completed daily sleep diaries for a 2-week period and a series of psychological and insomnia questionnaires, followed by three consecutive nights of polysomnographic evaluation (PSG). A detailed medical history interview was taken by the study physician. PSG measures showed that menopausal women had significantly longer total wake time (TWT, 84.2 vs. 63.2 min, Cohen's d=0.504) and lower sleep efficiency (SE, 81.8% vs. 86.0%, d=0.487) than the non-menopausal women. Women using HRT did not show significantly better sleep compared to those who did not use HRT. No significant difference was observed between menopausal groups on subjectively assessed sleep parameters. Menopause may contribute to specific aspects of sleep disturbances in midlife women with insomnia. Use of HRT for menopausal symptoms does not seem to attenuate such disturbances, although further investigation using hormonal level dosing and a larger sample size is warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21147026/"}

After a screening nocturnal polysomnograms (NPSG) and MSLT the following day, participants with primary insomnia were randomized to take zolpidem 10 mg (n = 50) or placebo (n = 45) nightly for 12 months. During months 1 and 8, while taking their prescribed treatments, NPSGs and MSLTs the following day were conducted. A population-based sample served as controls and received a single NPSG followed by MSLT. Mean daily sleep latency on the screening MSLT of insomniacs was normally distributed across the full range of MSLT scores and significantly higher than those of a population-based representative control sample (P < 0.006). The insomniacs with the highest screening MSLTs had the shortest screening total sleep times (P < 0.05). The MSLTs of insomniacs during treatment in study month 1 were correlated (r = 0.44, P < 0.001) with their month 8 MSLT. The mean MSLT score of the zolpidem group did not differ from that of the placebo group, and the stability within treatment groups also did not differ.

The statistical properties of this index were analysed in detail in both groups. In controls, the Bland-Altman test demonstrated the reliability of this index for values of oTST >120 min. Healthy subjects estimated their sleep time correctly, while insomniacs largely underestimated their sleep time. Statistical analysis of the distribution of MI in insomnia patients disclosed the presence of two subgroups, one with moderate sleep misperception (132 patients) and the other with high sleep misperception (27 patients). The latter presented MI values >or=0.9, exhibiting statistical properties different from those with MI <0.9 and from normal subjects.

The review begins by examining how the existing diagnostic systems conceptualise acute insomnia. Theoretical models that explain, or inferentially explain, the transition between normal sleep and acute insomnia are then explored and evaluated. The review then examines the current evidence base in terms of the pathogenesis of acute insomnia from naturalistic and experimental studies. Overall, the findings from the review confirm the paucity of evidence available but perhaps more importantly highlight the need for a structured diagnosis of acute insomnia as the first step in a research and treatment strategy.

The objective of the present study was to further circumscribe arousal in Psy-I and Para-I using N1, P2 and the waking processing negativity (wPN). N1 and P2 were recorded in the evening, at sleep-onset and in early stage 2 sleep in 26 good sleepers, 26 Psy-I and 26 Para-I. An oddball paradigm was used and participants received the instruction to ignore all stimuli at all times. Three difference waves (wPNs) were computed to evaluate the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset, from sleep onset to sleep and from wakefulness to sleep. Results revealed that N1 was smaller during wakefulness and sleep onset for Psy-I, while it was larger for Para-I during these same times. P2 was smaller at sleep onset for Psy-I than for Para-I and GS, while P2 during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep was larger for Para-I than GS. WPNs revealed that Psy-I showed fewer changes in information processing, while Para-I showed larger changes between recording times.

Insomnia was defined according to the diagnostic classification system requiring both daytime and nighttime symptoms, and further categorized into subtypes based on nighttime symptoms (ie, sleep onset latency [SOL-insomnia], wake after sleep onset [WASO-insomnia], early morning awakening [EMA-insomnia], or combinations of these). Subthreshold insomnia comprised those with only daytime impairment or one or more nighttime symptoms. Chronic spinal pain was defined as pain in either 'neck', 'low back', or 'upper back', or a combination of these.

Outcomes included sleep continuity, architecture, and REM-related parameters across nights one through four. Intraclass correlation coefficients with mixed-effect variances and repeated-measure analysis of covariance were used, respectively, to determine short-term stability as well as between-participants and time-by-group interaction effects. Wake after sleep onset and stage 1 showed \"poor stability\" in the comorbid insomnia/nightmare group compared to \"moderate stability\" in the good sleeping controls and chronic insomnia alone group. Significant between-group effects (all ps < .05) showed that the comorbid insomnia/nightmare group took longer to fall asleep and had a greater first-night-effect in stage 1 compared to good sleeping controls and chronic insomnia alone group; in addition, the comorbid insomnia/nightmare and insomnia alone groups slept shorter, with fewer awakenings and REM periods, compared to the good sleeping controls. Nightmares are associated with abnormal sleep above and beyond REM disruption, as sleep continuity was the primary aspect in which poor stability and group differences emerged. The greater inability to fall asleep and instability of sleep fragmentation in those with comorbid insomnia/nightmares compared to chronic insomnia alone may be attributed to the impact of presleep anticipatory anxiety and nightmare-related distress itself.

Treatment options for insomnia include behavior modification and pharmacotherapy. The choice of hypnotics is based on matching the nature of the insomnia to the hypnotic agent. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are common hypnotics prescribed for insomnia in the elderly. The ideal agent has rapid onset, duration of action that lasts through the night but no residual daytime effects, and no adverse effects.

Despite the availability of evidence-based treatments, the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning this disorder remain poorly understood. Recently, the investigation of the less than 1 Hz oscillations (commonly termed slow oscillations), a hallmark of slow wave sleep, has gained increased interest in research on insomnia. In this context, an intriguing perspective arises from the association between slow oscillations and metabolic waste clearance, an impaired process in individuals suffering from insomnia disorder. Indeed, the exploration of the relationships between cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and glymphatic system functions, which relate to brain metabolic clearance, and sleep slow oscillations may represent a promising avenue for future research in this field. This narrative review examines current knowledge about the intricate interplay among these mechanisms and their implications for insomnia disorder. Particular attention is given to the role of sleep slow oscillations in the clearance of metabolic waste during sleep, their coupling with cerebrospinal fluid oscillations, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying glymphatic function. The review emphasises the relevance of investigating sleep slow oscillations-related mechanisms in insomnia, intending to provide novel insights into the neurophysiological underpinnings of the disorder and contribute to more accurate diagnostic approaches.

The odds ratios (ORs) of being excessively sleepy versus nonsleepy were not different than 1.0 for both SRT (OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [0.13-6.96]) and CBT-I (OR = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [0.09-4.46]), indicating that the odds of becoming excessively sleepy following treatment was not different from the odds of being nonsleepy. This suggests that excessive sleepiness is not of unique concern following SRT relative to CBT-I or sleep education. SRT appears to have a comparable risk profile for excessive sleepiness as CBT-I, and thus may be considered a safe alternative to CBT-I. Future research should characterize objective measures of excessive sleepiness immediately following sleep restriction.

This review examines the empirical evidence behind the practices and recommendations captured by the ABCs of SLEEPING mnemonic for children aged 1 to 12. A search was conducted of key electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, & EMBASE) to identify English articles that included the concepts of sleep, insomnia, and/or bedtime. 77 articles were eligible for inclusion and were coded to extract key details and findings regarding the relations between sleep practices identified in the ABCs of SLEEPING mnemonic and sleep outcomes. Findings provided preliminary support for many of the recommendations that are commonly made to families regarding healthy sleep practices.

A sample of 128 students underwent randomization to receive either a single session of online Cognitive Bias Modification-Interpretation (CBM-I) or a sham training. Participants then tracked their pre-sleep worry and sleep parameters for seven consecutive days. Interpretation bias was assessed using an encoding-recognition task specifically designed for insomnia-related interpretation bias. The CBM-I manipulation utilized ambiguous scenarios to redirect participants away from making insomnia-related interpretations. Results revealed that CBM-I effectively decreased insomnia-consistent interpretation bias compared to the sham treatment, with interpretation bias being absent post-training in the CBM-I group. This reduction did not lead to improvements in pre-sleep worry or any sleep parameters. This study has been the first to investigate the causal role of interpretation bias on symptoms of insomnia. Although results indicated this bias to be modifiable, its causality within the cognitive model proves to be more complicated. Future research focusing on optimization of cognitive bias modifications could shed more light on the effects of biased cognitions on insomnia symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39116605/"}

There was no significant difference in the general demographic information between the two groups (P > 0.05). The total MoCA score and MoCA memory score of patients with insomnia accompanied by anxiety were significantly lower than those with insomnia alone, while their PSQI scores were significantly higher. The wake time after sleep (WASO) monitored by polysomnography was significantly longer than that in patients with simple insomnia disorder, and the duration of N3 and N3% were significantly shorter than that in patients with simple sleep disorder, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Executive function was positively correlated with N3 duration and N3%, naming function was negatively correlated with N1 duration and N1%, and memory was negatively correlated with wake time after sleep (WASO) in insomnia patients with anxiety, (P < 0.05).

Yet, in many cases, physicians treat the symptom of insomnia rather than evaluating and treating the underlying causes of insomnia. Because the subjective complaint of insomnia does not always correlate with evidence of objective sleep disruption, a careful history and evaluation are required. Assessment of the duration of insomnia and quantification of the impact of nocturnal sleep disruption on daytime functioning provide the most reliable indices of severity. Primary insomnia may be due to a number of different causes, such as poor sleep hygiene or circadian rhythm disruption. Insomnia may also be the presenting symptom of other primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea syndrome or nocturnal myoclonus, or of a variety of medical or psychiatric illnesses. The treatment of the patient with insomnia should address the underlying cause, when identifiable. When the cause cannot be identified, treatment should be conservative; nonpharmacologic therapies should be used whenever possible. When pharmacologic approaches are indicated, short-acting benzodiazepines should be administered in concordance with strict prescribing guidelines.

State-spaced TVARMA processes with recursive particle filtering provided resilience to nonlinear, nonstationary, and non-Gaussian conditions of biosignals. FIS managed automated sleep scoring robust to intersubjects' and interraters' variability. The similarity distances quantified in a scalar measure the transitions amongst sleep onset stages, computed from expert and automated hypnograms. A statistical set of unpaired two-tailed t -tests suggested that distances d1 , d2, and d3 had larger statistical significance ( ) to characterize sleeping patterns. The logistic regression model classified control and subjects with insomnia with sensitivity 87 % , specificity 75 %, and accuracy 81 %.

Patients were treated with single-component SRT over a 4-w protocol, sleeping in the laboratory for 2 nights prior to treatment initiation and for 3 nights (SRT night 1, 8, 22) during the acute interventional phase. The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was completed at seven defined time points [day 0 (baseline), day 1,7,8,21,22 (acute treatment) and day 84 (3 mo)]. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was completed at baseline, w 1-4, and 3 mo. Subjective sleep outcomes and global insomnia severity significantly improved before and after SRT.

{"id": "15892588", "title": "Antidepressants and sleep: a qualitative review of the literature.", "text": "Most antidepressants change sleep; in particular, they alter the physiological patterns of sleep stages recorded overnight with EEG and other physiological measures. These effects are greatest and most consistent on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and tend to be in the opposite direction to the sleep abnormalities found in major depression, but are usually of greater degree. Reductions in the amount of REM sleep and increases in REM sleep onset latency are seen after taking antidepressants, both in healthy volunteers and in depressed patients. Antidepressants that increase serotonin function by blocking reuptake or by inhibiting metabolism have the greatest effect on REM sleep. The decrease in amount of REM sleep appears to be greatest early in treatment, and gradually diminishes during long-term treatment, except after monoamine oxidase inhibitors when REM sleep is often absent for many months. Sleep initiation and maintenance are also affected by antidepressants, but the effects are much less consistent between drugs. Some antidepressants such as clomipramine and the selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), particularly fluoxetine, are sleep-disturbing early in treatment and some others such as amitriptyline and the newer serotonin 5-HT2-receptor antagonists are sleep promoting. However, these effects are fairly short-lived and there are very few significant differences between drugs after a few weeks of treatment. In general, the objectively measured sleep of depressed patients improves during 3-4 weeks of effective antidepressant treatment with most agents, as does their subjective impression of their sleep. Sleep improvement earlier in treatment may be an important clinical goal in some patients, perhaps when insomnia is particularly distressing, or to ensure compliance. In these patients, the choice of a safely used and effective antidepressant which improves sleep in short term is indicated. Patients with other sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome and REM sleep behaviour disorder should be identified before choosing a treatment, as some antidepressants worsen these conditions. Conversely, there is evidence that some antidepressants may be useful in the treatment of sleep disorders such as night terrors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15892588/"}

Subjects were 16 community-dwelling older women (mean age 69.4 ± 8.1) with insomnia who underwent 8 nights of concurrent actigraphy and PSG. Sleep efficiency reflected much greater sleep disturbance on PSG (66.9%) than actigraphy (84.4%).

Epoch-by-epoch analysis showed high sensitivity (96.1%), low specificity (36.4%), and modest values on agreement (75.4%) and predictive values of sleep (74.7%) and wake (80.2%). Generalized linear models showed that overall accuracy of actigraphy declined as sleep efficiency declined (unstandardized Beta = 0.741, p < 0.001). Based on this model, sleep efficiency of 73% was the point at which accuracy declined below an acceptable accuracy value of 80%.

Thirty patients with average sleep latencies of 81.48 minutes, who reported chronic insomnia for an average of 2.6 years, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: behavioral stimulus control/relaxation training and triazolam. Both treatments decreased sleep latency but differentially. Triazolam was effective immediately but maintained only some gains at follow-up. Behavioral treatment decreased sleep latency beginning the second week, when subjects expected no improvement, with gains maintained at follow-up. Comparisons showed that triazolam group latencies returned toward baseline, while behavioral group gains were maintained at follow-up. Triazolam treatment showed superior immediate treatment effects, while behavioral treatment showed superior treatment effects at follow-up, effects that accrued during the training period and differentially persisted at follow-up. One treatment strategy implied by these results would be to combine these two interventions concurrently. This would seem to use the immediate effects produced by the medication until the behavioral skills were learned, at which point medication would be terminated.

This is because experimental or clinical sleep disturbance is usually followed by annoying symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness the following day. Can these daytime changes be documented objectively? In the past several years, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) has been developed and validated as an objective quantitative measure of sleepiness. Multiple assessments of sleep latency yield a profile of sleepiness across the day. This profile changes in the predicted direction with acute total and partial sleep deprivation, chronic sleep deprivation, sleep satiation, and in comparisons between hypersomnia patients and controls. Sleep and wakefulness are complementary phases in the daily cycle of human existence. Adequacy of sleep and energetic wakefulness next day are interacting phases in this cycle. Insomnia can be seen as a perception of disturbed sleep with daytime consequences, but is essentially also a symptom. This paper reviews a number of issues in the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia. The dimensions, daytime consequences and longitudinal aspects of insomnia are considered. Most investigations to date have been geared towards the problem of chronic insomnia and yet we are all likely to suffer from transient insomnia at some point. Psychiatric and psychophysiological disorders have been shown to be the most frequent causes of disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Moreover, there is an apparent disparity between subjective and objective sleep parameters with, for example, objectively disturbed sleep in noncomplaining subjects. The criteria of hypnotic efficacy and the effects of triazolam and flurazepam on sleep and daytime alertness have been investigated in normals, chronic insomniacs and the elderly. In general, chronic insomniacs showed all degrees of daytime alertness regardless of nocturnal sleep parameters. About one-third could be classified as fully alert all day long in spite of their complaints. The effect of flurazepam and triazolam on sleep (improvement) was essentially the same. Daytime effects were most closely related to half-life. The long-acting benzodiazepine, flurazepam, impaired daytime alertness although nocturnal sleep was improved.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between chronotype and insomnia and whether sleep hygiene mediates this relationship in older adults with depression (OAD). We assessed subjective insomnia severity, sleep hygiene, chronotype, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms of 82 OAD and 70 healthy controls using the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The mediation effect of SHI and ISI scores were evaluated in the relationship between MEQ and BDI total scores in OAD. The results showed that MEQ performed its effect on BDI through ISI with full mediation (effect = -0.16, SE: 0.07, 95% CI: -0.3230 to -0.0336). The mediation effect of SHI and BDI scores were evaluated in the relationship between MEQ and ISI total scores in OAD. In this model, it was found that MEQ significantly performed its effect on ISI through SHI and BDI. BDI and SHI predicted the ISI variable as partial mediators (respectively, effect = -0.05, SE: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.1073 to -0.0100; effect = -0.06, SE: 0.02, 95% CI: -0.1051 to -0.0129). Sleep hygiene practices could be essential for the natural functioning of the biological clock and the interrelation of depression and insomnia. Longitudinal follow-up studies of structured sleep hygiene approaches are needed in terms of cost-effectiveness, in OAD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32954590/"}

{"id": "15982376", "title": "Diagnosis and management of insomnia in older people.", "text": "Insomnia is a common but underrecognized problem in elderly patients. Five basic steps can help clinicians identify and treat insomnia. The first step is to ask a single question about sleep at every new patient visit, which goes a long way toward detection of patients with insomnia. The second step is to perform an initial evaluation of the problem, including symptoms, contributing factors, and effects on daytime function. Step three is to determine whether the patient is in crisis. True sleep emergencies are rare, and in most cases, treatment can be delayed until another appointment can be made for a full evaluation of the problem. A sleep evaluation constitutes the fourth step and focuses mainly on a thorough sleep history; blood tests and polysomnography rarely have a role. The final step is intervention. Nonpharmacological strategies are a mainstay of treatment for chronic insomnia, but hypnotics have a role in treating transient insomnia and chronic insomnia that does not improve with nonpharmacological treatment or treatment of associated primary conditions. Pharmacological therapy usually consists of benzodiazepines with short half-lives or nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zaleplon, although lack of demonstrated efficacy against sleep maintenance difficulties, one of the primary symptoms of insomnia among older people, limits use of these agents. Emerging nonbenzodiazepine agents such as indiplon and eszopiclone may specifically address sleep maintenance problems in elderly patients and are pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. (Editor's note: Since preparation of this manuscript, the FDA has approved eszopiclone for treatment of insomnia.).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15982376/"}

The study randomized 110 participants (107 women; mean age: 35.5 years) to CBT-I or to an attention-control group. Participants were assessed at 3 time periods: baseline, post-CBT-I (or attention control), and at time 3 (T3) post-cognitive processing therapy received by all participants. NM reports were extracted from the Fear of Sleep Inventory. Participants with weekly NMs were compared with those with fewer than weekly NMs on outcomes including attrition, insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression. Change in NM frequency was examined. Participants with weekly NMs (55%) were significantly more likely to be lost to follow-up post-CBT-I (37%) compared with participants with infrequent NMs (15.6%) and were less likely to complete T3 (43%) than patients with less frequent NMs (62.5%). NMs were unrelated to differential treatment response in insomnia, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder. Treatment with CBT-I was not associated with reduced NM frequency; however, change in sleep-onset latency from post-CBT-I to T3 predicted fewer NMs at T3. Weekly NMs were associated with attrition but not a reduced change in insomnia symptoms following CBT-I. NM symptoms did not change as a function of CBT-I, but change in sleep-onset latency predicted lower NM frequency. CBT-I trials should screen for NMs and consider augmenting CBT-I to specifically address NMs. Hamilton NA, Russell JA, Youngren WA, et al.

College students' developmental stage and lifestyle are significantly different than the general adult population, yet there have been no studies of CBT-I in this age group. Thirty-four college students (ages 18-27; M=19.71, SD=2.10) were randomly assigned to and completed either six sessions of CBT-I or a 6-week wait list control (WLC). All participants completed 1-week sleep diaries and actigraphy, as well as sleep and daytime functioning questionnaires at baseline and posttreatment. The treatment group repeated all measures at 3-month follow-up. Students who received CBT-I showed greater baseline to posttreatment improvements in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, time awake after sleep onset, sleep quality, insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, general fatigue, and global sleep quality than the WLC group. These improvements were durable at 3-month follow-up. Ninety-four percent of participants in the CBT-I condition completed at least 4 sessions of treatment. Significantly more participants in the CBT-I group than the WLC group responded (68.8% vs 7.7%, respectively) and remitted (68.8% vs 15.4%, respectively). CBT-I is an effective treatment for insomnia in college students. This study found that treatment responses were similar to results from studies in the general population.

Quality sleep can be affected by such things as stress, age, pregnancy, physical health problems, and shift work. Behaviors related to sleep problems can be one of three types: predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating. Additionally, cognitive processes related to sleep quality tend to be predominated by sleep thinking or insomnia thinking. Multiple medical organizations promote Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia as a best practice for clinical management of sleep problems and disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia consists of five components aimed at addressing both the behavioral and cognitive impediments to high quality sleep.

This study aimed to explore factors associated with insomnia in older adult outpatient clinics, and to further analyze the influence of gender on factors associated with insomnia. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital in Southern Taiwan from July to September 2018. A total of 400 consecutive subjects aged 60 years or older were recruited. Insomnia was defined as a score of ≥6 points on the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Socio-demographics, health behaviors and clinical data were collected by face-to-face interview. Multivariable logistic regression was adopted for statistical analysis of the entire sample and stratified by gender. Participants' mean age was 74.74 ± 8.54 years, and the majority (93%) had more than one chronic disease. The prevalence of insomnia accounted for 30% (120/400) of all subjects, with males 22.9% (46/201) and females 37.2% (74/199). Gender, appetite, exercise, depressive symptoms, and sleep-related conditions such as short sleep duration, sleeping pills usage, medium-high risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless leg syndrome (RLS) were factors associated with insomnia in older adults. Exercise, sleeping pills usage, and RLS were independently associated with insomnia only in men, while appetite and medium-high risk of OSA were associated with insomnia in women only. In addition, after further adjusting for covariates, prevalence of the insomnia-related symptoms such as sleep induction, total sleep duration, sleep quality and sleepiness during the day was significantly higher in females than in males. Insomnia symptoms are highly prevalent among older adults, predominantly females. Significant differences are found between genders in factors associated with insomnia and insomnia-related symptoms.

The present study investigated whether brief training in identifying and elaborating an interesting and engaging imagery task for use during the pre-sleep period can reduce unwanted pre-sleep cognitive activity and sleep onset latency. Forty one people with insomnia were given one of three instructional sets to follow on the experimental night; instructions to distract using imagery, general instructions to distract, or no instructions. Based on previous findings reported by Salkovskis & Campbell (1994) 'Behaviour Research and Therapy 32 (1994) 1' and ironic control theory (Wegner, 1994) 'Psychological Review 101 (1994) 34', it was predicted that (1) \"imagery distraction\" would be associated with shorter sleep onset latency and less frequent and distressing pre-sleep cognitive activity compared to the \"no instruction\" group and that (2) \"general distraction\" would be associated with longer sleep onset latency and more frequent and distressing pre-sleep cognitive activity compared to the \"no instruction\" group. Support was found for the first but not the second prediction. The success of the \"imagery distraction\" task is attributed to it occupying sufficient \"cognitive space\" to keep the individual from re-engaging with thoughts, worries, and concerns during the pre-sleep period. In addition, \"imagery distraction\" involved a very specific alternative cognitive task hence the operating process was given a feature positive search, conditions where mental control is likely to be achieved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11863237/"}

Consequently, the Psychobiological Inhibition Model can embrace numerous, potentially interacting, pathways to the persistence of this ubiquitous disorder, providing an overarching conceptual framework for why and how insomnia develops. The clinical guideline treatment for chronic insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy. Although typically delivered as \"talking therapy\", cognitive behavioural therapy is not some form of \"psychobabble\". Rather, the Psychobiological Inhibition Model framework for insomnia articulates how specific techniques can correct the various ways in which the expression of normal sleep and circadian brain-behaviour relationships have become disrupted. Indeed, cognitive behavioural therapy is best conceived of as an approach to treatment rather than being one specific agent.

This study addresses this gap by exploring smoker's and ex-smoker's experiences of the link between smoking and sleep and how this may change as a function of smoking/smoking abstinence. It also explores views of traditional CBT-I components (i.e., perceived feasibility, effectiveness, barriers of use). We conducted semi-structured interviews with current and recently quit smokers (n = 17) between January and September 2022. The framework method was used for analysis. Four themes addressing research questions were described. These included: 1) A viscous cycle; poor sleep quality and negative psychological state during cessation; 2) Perceived engagement and effectiveness; the importance of feasibility, experience, value, identity and psychological state in assessing CBT-I as a cessation tool; 3) Striking a balance; tailoring CBT-I to reduce psychological overload in a time of lifestyle transition; and 4) Personalisation and digital delivery helping overcome psychological barriers during cessation. The analysis suggested during quit attempts smokers experienced a range of sleep problems that could increase risk of relapse due to a negative impact on psychological state. It also revealed participants thought that CBT-I is something they would use during a quit attempt but suggested changes and additions that would improve engagement and be better tailored to quitting smokers.

As such, the current investigation examined the utility of premorbid sleep reactivity in identifying a specific and manageable population at elevated risk for future insomnia. A community-based sample of adults (n = 2,892; 59.3% female; 47.9 ± 13.3 y old) with no lifetime history of insomnia or depression completed web-based surveys across three annual assessments. Participants reported parental history of insomnia, demographic characteristics, sleep reactivity on the Ford Insomnia in Response to Stress Test (FIRST), and insomnia symptoms. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were used to determine insomnia classification. Baseline FIRST scores were used to predict incident insomnia at 1-y follow-up. Two clinically meaningful FIRST cutoff values were identified: FIRST ≥ 16 (sensitivity 77%; specificity 50%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.88, P < 0.001); and FIRST ≥ 18 (sensitivity 62%; specificity 67%; OR = 3.32, P < 0.001). Notably, both FIRST cut-points outperformed known maternal (OR = 1.49-1.59, P < 0.01) and paternal history (P = NS) in predicting insomnia onset, even after controlling for stress exposure and demographic characteristics. Of the incident cases, insomniacs with highly reactive sleep systems reported longer sleep onset latencies (FIRST ≥ 16: 65 min; FIRST ≥ 18: 68 min) than participants with nonreactive insomnia (FIRST < 16: 37 min; FIRST < 18: 44 min); these groups did not differ on any other sleep parameters. The current study established a cost- and time-effective strategy for identifying individuals at elevated risk for insomnia based on trait sleep reactivity. The FIRST accurately identifies a focused target population in which the psychobiological processes complicit in insomnia onset and progression can be better investigated, thus improving future preventive efforts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26446111/"}

Effect sizes were computed for each end-point variable based on subjective (patient-reported) and polysomnographic measures. Thirty-four studies (n = 1392 subjects) met inclusion criteria; twenty-three used a pharmacological placebo (n = 1163), four used a psychological placebo (n = 81), and seven used a waitlist condition (n = 148). Between-group comparisons were performed using a random effects model analysis. Significant pre-post changes were observed in the pharmacological placebo condition on several sleep parameters, both on objectively and subjectively measured outcomes [objective and subjective sleep onset latency (SOL) and total sleep time (TST) and subjective wake after sleep onset]. Although a tendency was observed for objective SOL, only the changes on subjective SOL and TST in the pharmacological placebo condition were significantly different from the corresponding changes in the untreated group. No differences were significant for the psychological placebo groups. Although the present findings suggest that sleep may significantly change in response to a pharmacological placebo, conclusions remain tentative because of possible confounds that may arise when comparing groups issued from different trials.

The objective of our study was to evaluate sleep perception in insomniacs, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) patients, and healthy volunteers. Our hypothesis was that insomniacs have less sleep perception than healthy individuals and patients with sleep respiratory disorders. We studied 199 individuals who were divided into the following four groups: (1) insomnia group; (2) patients with sleep-disordered breathing; (3) patients with insomnia complaints and an associated sleep respiratory disorder; and (4) healthy individuals with no sleep complaints. All patients were subjected to polysomnography (PSG) followed by a questionnaire addressing their perception about the previous night's sleep. In addition to analysis of all sleep parameters, we determined sleep perception as the percentage of the ratio between total sleep time perceived by the patient and the total sleep time obtained by PSG. Sleep perception was significantly lower in insomnia patients than in sleep-disordered breathing patients or the normal group. In addition, no significant differences across the four groups were observed in sleep efficiency and total sleep time. The results showed that the reported sleep perception of insomniacs is lower than that of sleep-disordered breathing patients or normal individuals.

Since he could not sleep at night and felt the necessity to compose his literary works in an absolutely quiet environment, Kafka deliberately changed his sleep-wake schedule so he could write at night and nap in the afternoon. These maladaptive sleep habits perpetuated his insomnia and led to chronic sleep deprivation resulting in fatigue, lack of concentration and sleep-related auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations. Kafka sought help in alternative medicine however this was ineffective in improving his insomnia.

The idea that temperature and sleep are interrelated is based on evolutionary history. Mammalian sleep developed in association with endothermy, and all species, independent of temporal niche, usually sleep during the circadian trough of their core body temperature (CBT) rhythm. The circadian pattern of CBT results from the balance between heat production and heat loss, the latter being relevant for sleep induction. Sleep under entrained conditions is typically initiated on the declining portion of the CBT curve when its rate of change and body heat loss is maximal. Body heat loss before lights off, via selective vasodilatation of distal skin regions, promotes sleepiness and the rapid onset of sleep. This thermophysiological effect represents the cement between the circadian clock and the sleep-wake cycle, and in turn determines phase of entrainment (Psi) and sleep onset latency (SOL). These interrelationships have been recently studied in a particular subset of the general population, mainly women, who suffer from cold hands and feet (the so-called vasospastic syndrome, VS). Women with VS exhibit not only a lower capacity to lose heat during the daytime but also a prolonged SOL, a disturbed Psi of the circadian clock with respect to the sleep-wake cycle and psychologically, a disposition to turn experienced anger inwards. This naturalistic model leads us to a more general conclusion that regulation of distal skin blood flow may have clinical relevance for insomnia, in particular sleep onset insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17764994/"}

Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is unknown, recent research has demonstrated that normal sleep and wakefulness are controlled by reciprocal inhibition by different brain regions. This sleep-wake control system offers multiple therapeutic targets for the treatment of insomnia; currently, most research and available hypnotic agents target gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the sleep side of the switch. Historically, drugs have evolved from benzodiazepine receptor agonists to nonbenzodiazepines to, most recently, selective extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor agonists. However, these drugs have a differential impact on characteristics of sleep. Among the compounds that modulate the benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors, benzodiazepines suppress stage 3-4 sleep, whereas nonbenzodiazepines have no substantial effect on these stages of sleep. Recently, work on GABA agonists indicates that they increase stage 3-4 sleep. This has been demonstrated via sleep-stage scoring as well as with spectral analysis. Further, this increase in stage 3-4 sleep is associated with a decrease in stage 1 sleep and arousals from sleep. Thus, the GABA agonists may not simply promote sleep, but consolidate it as well. The clinical utility of the increase in slow-wave sleep and the sleep consolidation it produces warrants further investigation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17539704/"}

Nine patients with psychophysiological insomnia completed the Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale (DISS) at rise-time, 12:00 hours, 18:00 hours and bedtime for 1 week before and 3 weeks during SRT. Four validated factors from the DISS were analyzed (alert cognition, positive mood, negative mood and sleepiness/fatigue) across 28 days yielding 17 170 data points. Factors evaluated week (baseline versus weeks 1 and 3) and time of day symptomatology. Insomnia Severity Index scores decreased significantly pre-to-post treatment (mean 18 versus 7). Reflecting acute effects of SRT, significant differences were found for all factors, except negative mood, between baseline and week 1 of SRT, suggesting adverse effects. By week 3, sleepiness/fatigue and negative mood decreased significantly compared to baseline, and positive mood showed a trend towards improvement (P = 0.06). Sleepiness/fatigue displayed a significant week × time of day interaction, explained by a reduction in sleepiness/fatigue at every daytime assessment point (except bedtime, which remained high). A significant interaction for alert cognition was associated with reduction in alertness at bedtime by week 3 and an increase in alertness at rise-time, suggesting that SRT not only improves sleep, but moderates alertness and sleepiness in therapeutic ways.

CBT-I should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.

From the findings, we found that the SLP-supplemented animals improved their sleeping behaviour and that the major neurotransmitters, hormones, and receptors were maintained at an equilibrium level. Furthermore, the neurotrophin level was increased and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced. The evaluation of oxidative stress markers shows that the antioxidants were significantly boosted, and as a result, lipid peroxidation was prevented.

Safety behaviors have been identified as contributing to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. They include overt or covert strategies designed to prevent a feared outcome. However, they contribute to the maintenance of the disorder because they prevent unambiguous disconfirmation of unrealistic beliefs and they increase the likelihood that the fear would actually occur. A questionnaire based on the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale was developed to elicit safety behaviors and was administered to 33 people meeting criteria for primary insomnia and 33 nonpatient controls. The data indicated that people with insomnia use a wide range of safety behaviors to prevent feared outcomes. Blind raters determined that the safety behaviors reported included those that: interfere with the regularity of the sleep cycle, interfere with sleep directly, cause paradoxical fuelling of presleep cognitive activity, exacerbate day-time sleepiness, contribute to the day being unpleasant or boring, and those that increase preoccupation with sleep. The clinical implications of these findings and areas for further research are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11838025/"}

IC is critical for sleep-wake regulation. This study evaluates whether computerized IC training can improve sleep in ISSD and explores related neural mechanisms using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Twenty ISSD patients participated in a three-week computerized IC training program (15 sessions), alongside a control group of 17 participants. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), complemented by objective measures from overnight EEG recordings. Neuroimaging analyses focused on changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and functional connectivity (FC) in brain regions associated with IC. Computerized IC training led to significant improvements in both subjective and objective sleep quality, demonstrated by reductions in PSQI and ISI scores, as well as decreased wake time during sleep. Neuroimaging revealed increased ReHo in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC), elevated fALFF in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and enhanced FC between the MOFC and the right rectus gyrus (RG), which correlated with improvements in sleep measures. Computerized IC training appears to be an effective intervention for improving sleep in ISSD, likely by inducing functional changes in prefrontal cortex regions. These findings underscore the potential of IC-targeted treatments for ISSD and highlight the need for future research to evaluate the long-term effects of such interventions.

Participants were 100 adults (mean age = 49.9 years; 66% women) randomly selected from a larger population-based sample enrolled in a longitudinal study of the natural history of insomnia. They completed 12 monthly telephone interviews assessing insomnia, use of sleep aids, stressful life events, and physical and mental health problems in the previous month. A total of 1,125 interviews of a potential 1,200 were completed. Based on data collected at each assessment, participants were classified into one of three subgroups: good sleepers, insomnia symptoms, and insomnia syndrome. At baseline, 42 participants were classified as good sleepers, 34 met criteria for insomnia symptoms, and 24 for an insomnia syndrome. There were significant fluctuations of insomnia over time, with 66% of the participants changing sleep status at least once over the 12 monthly assessments (51.5% for good sleepers, 59.5% for insomnia syndrome, and 93.4% for insomnia symptoms). Changes of status were more frequent among individuals with insomnia symptoms at baseline (mean = 3.46, SD = 2.36) than among those initially classified as good sleepers (mean = 2.12, SD = 2.70). Among the subgroup with insomnia symptoms at baseline, 88.3% reported improved sleep (i.e., became good sleepers) at least once over the 12 monthly assessments compared to 27.7% whose sleep worsened (i.e., met criteria for an insomnia syndrome) during the same period. Among individuals classified as good sleepers at baseline, risks of developing insomnia symptoms and syndrome over the subsequent months were, respectively, 48.6% and 14.5%. Monthly assessment over an interval of 6 months was found most reliable to estimate incidence rates, while an interval of 3 months proved the most reliable for defining chronic insomnia. Monthly assessment of insomnia and sleep patterns revealed significant variability over the course of a 12-month period.

The potential for manic or hypomanic symptoms to emerge after sleep deprivation in bipolar disorder raises questions about the appropriateness of these methods for treating insomnia. In a series of patients with bipolar disorder who underwent behavioral treatment for insomnia, the authors found that regularizing bedtimes and rise times was often sufficient to bring about improvements in sleep. Two patients in a total group of 15 patients reported mild increases in hypomanic symptoms the week following instruction on stimulus control. Total sleep time did not change for these individuals. Two of five patients who underwent sleep restriction reported mild hypomania that was unrelated to weekly sleep duration. Sleep restriction and stimulus control appear to be safe and efficacious procedures for treating insomnia in patients with bipolar disorder.

Such observations imply that individuals with PI may not experience the full deactivation of sensory and cognitive processing, resulting in reduced filtering of external sensory information during sleep. To test this hypothesis, gating of sensory information during sleep was tested in participants with primary insomnia (n = 18) and good sleepers (n = 20). Sensory gating was operationally defined as (i) the difference in magnitude of evoked response potentials elicited by pairs of clicks presented during Wake and Stage II sleep, and (ii) the number of K complexes evoked by the same auditory stimulus. During wake the groups did not differ in magnitude of sensory gating. During sleep, sensory gating of the N350 component was attenuated and completely diminished in participants with insomnia. P450, which occurred only during sleep, was strongly gated in good sleepers, and less so in participants with insomnia. Additionally, participants with insomnia showed no stimulus-related increase in K complexes. Thus, PI is potentially associated with impaired capacity to filter out external sensory information, especially during sleep. The potential of using stimulus-evoked K complexes as a biomarker for primary insomnia is discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20529120/"}

Sleep modifications as a function of aging chiefly involve stage 4, which is reduced by about one half between the ages of 19 and 30. Analyzing a large group of normal and insomniac subjects, it is possible to show a statistical association between very low values of slow wave sleep and short and fragile total sleep. This association cannot be explained simply by an increase in waking pressure. Comparison of a group of 16 insomniacs with 16 age and sex matched normal subjects shows in the insominacs a deficiency of production of slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), most probably linked to a disturbed waking/sleep balance, whereas the other parameters of sleep, especially paradoxical stage, remain unmodified. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a physiopathological role of slow wave sleep deficiency in chronic primary insomnia; on the other hand, slow wave sleep may possibly be responsible for sleep induction and maintenance, playing the role of a physiological hypnogenic mechanism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/432607/"}

While traditionally assessed through subjective measures such as the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the advent of wearable technology has enabled continuous, objective sleep monitoring in natural environments. However, the relationship between subjective insomnia severity and objective sleep parameters remains unclear. This study aims to (1) explore the relationship between subjective insomnia severity, as measured by ISI scores, and activity-based objective sleep parameters obtained through wearable devices; (2) determine whether subjective perceptions of insomnia align with objective measures of sleep; and (3) identify key psychological and physiological factors contributing to the severity of subjective insomnia complaints. A total of 250 participants, including both individuals with and without insomnia aged 19-70 years, were recruited from March 2023 to November 2023. Participants were grouped based on ISI scores: no insomnia, mild, moderate, and severe insomnia. Data collection involved subjective assessments through self-reported questionnaires and objective measurements using wearable devices (Fitbit Inspire 3) that monitored sleep parameters, physical activity, and heart rate. The participants also used a smartphone app for ecological momentary assessment, recording daily alcohol consumption, caffeine intake, exercise, and stress. Statistical analyses were used to compare groups on subjective and objective measures. Results indicated no significant differences in general sleep structure (eg, total sleep time, rapid eye movement sleep time, and light sleep time) among the insomnia groups (mild, moderate, and severe) as classified by ISI scores (all P>.05). Interestingly, the no insomnia group had longer total awake times and lower sleep quality compared with the insomnia groups. Among the insomnia groups, no significant differences were observed regarding sleep structure (all P>.05), suggesting similar sleep patterns regardless of subjective insomnia severity. There were significant differences among the insomnia groups in stress levels, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome (all P≤.001), with higher severity associated with higher scores in these factors. Contrary to expectations, no significant differences were observed in caffeine intake (P=.42) and alcohol consumption (P=.07) between the groups. The findings demonstrate a discrepancy between subjective perceptions of insomnia severity and activity-based objective sleep parameters, suggesting that factors beyond sleep duration and quality may contribute to subjective sleep complaints.

Consideration of sleeping pills involves the evaluation of hypnotic efficacy as a property of the medication on the one hand and the practical clinical application on the other. Properties of different hypnotics are reviewed, including factors that affect the use of hypnotics in clinical practice. It is concluded that the rational use of sleeping pills demands a systematic approach to the evaluation of the individual patient and a specific attempt to formulate individual treatment goals together with a knowledgeable consideration of the specific chemotherapeutic agent to be utilized.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6366825/"}

Total sleep time was approximately 10.5 h, with no difference between the sexes. Of 887 children who reported that they were awoken at night, parents considered that 75% were superficial sleepers and 25% were deep sleepers. The prevalence of frequent insomnia, sleepwalking and daytime sleepiness was 13, 7 and 4%, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that onset insomnia was associated with fear of sleeping alone, bone pains, hypnagogic myoclonias, rhythmic movement disorder, enuresis, nocturia, confusion when awoken at night, nightmares, bodily movements during sleep, interrupted sleep, daytime sleepiness and daytime headache or stomach ache. Somnambulism was associated with rhythmic movement disorder, somniloquy, spontaneous confused arousals, nocturia and confusion when awoken at night. Increased risk of daytime sleepiness was found among children with fear of sleeping alone, onset insomnia, rhythmic movement disorder, spontaneous confused arousals, snoring, confusion when awoken, nightmares, bodily movements during sleep and headache or stomach ache. The results support the notion that onset insomnia is a problem with a predominantly psychological and behavioural background, while sleepwalking is a disorder of arousal without major psychological implications. The mechanisms behind daytime sleepiness seem to be multifactorial.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11853345/"}

This study compared nighttime sleep data from polysomnography (PSG) and Fitbit Sense in individuals with knee OA and insomnia.

Agreement with PSG was higher on nights with longer total sleep time, higher sleep efficiency, shorter sleep onset, and fewer awakenings, suggesting better performance when sleep is less fragmented. The device showed limited precision in classifying sleep stages, often misclassifying deep and REM sleep as light sleep.

Of the 168 older adults who received the intervention, the data from 162 participants with complete AIS scores were analyzed. From this group, 57 individuals who displayed improvements in their AIS severity classification over a 3-month period were selected for qualitative analysis. The guidance sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using an inductive content analysis approach. The analysis revealed seven major categories comprising 18 sub-categories. The categories were: (1) Praise for improvements in sleep quality and behavioural change efforts; (2) evaluation and continuous support for behaviour change; (3) establishing appropriate napping habits; (4) developing a healthy daily routine and rhythm; (5) establishing appropriate sleep habits; (6) addressing factors affecting sleep quality; and (7) appropriate medical advice and recommendations to consult physicians. This exploratory study described the themes observed in the personalized health guidance provided to older adults who showed improvements in AIS scores.

In order to prevent the unneccessary administration of hypnotics, clinicians should evaluate both the sleep quality and daytime activities of patients. A sleep diary may help this process. Clinicians should prescribe hypnotics only when a patient's sleep disturbance is neither a part of the symptoms of major psychiatric disorders nor sleep-wake schedule disorders, and is not a consequence of inadequate lifestyle behavior.

Here we tested the effects of insomnia diagnosis and insomnia treatment on nonrapid eye movement electroencephalography in older adults, distinguishing slow-oscillation and delta power. In 93 older adults with insomnia and 71 good sleeper control participants (mean ages 68 years), effects of insomnia and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (insomnia group only) on electroencephalographic spectral power were analyzed. Main effects and interactions with nonrapid eye movement period were assessed for the following frequency bands: slow-oscillation (0.5-1 Hz), delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), sigma (12-16 Hz), and beta (16-32 Hz). Slow-oscillation absolute and relative power were lower in the insomnia group compared with controls. There were no group differences in delta power.

Total per patient treatment costs were 5.5 times greater for PCBT-I ($1298.90) than VCBT-I ($234.36; P < .0001). Both at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up, the ISI reduction was greater in PCBT-I than VCBT-I, but these differences were not significant (P = .09 and P = .24, respectively). In contrast, the cost-effectiveness ratio was significantly more advantageous for VCBT-I than PCBT-I.

The investigated factors include modes of living, sleep wishes and personality aspects. During the period 1988-1997 18 published reports were found. Based on the findings it is difficult to claim that elderly persons with insomnia are characterized by inappropriate modes of living. There were, however, some (inconsistent) indications that tea consumption, smoking and lack of exercise predicted insomnia. There were also scarce indications for less realistic sleep expectations in bad than in good sleepers. More bad sleepers perceived their sleep as uncontrollable and unpredictable than than good sleepers. Bad sleepers had significantly higher scores for anxiety, neuroticism and depression than good sleepers. Anxiety as well as depression correlated positively with insomnia and negatively with sleep duration. Depression, anxiety or neuroticism often were better predictors of insomnia than health indicators such as perceived health and number of prescribed drugs. The findings suggest that insomnia in relatively healthy elderly is more tightly associated with psychological factors than with modes of living or health indicators. This has some consequences for therapy. In addition to advice concerning modes of living and sleep hygiene, one has to be alert for the possible presence of depression or anxiety. In that case depression or anxiety has to be treated, pharmacologically or nonpharmacologically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10093888/"}

Discrepancies, however, were not random: In patients with psychophysiologic insomnia and in insomnia associated with psychiatric disease, the actigram typically overestimated sleep when compared with the PSG. In patients with sleep-state misperception, the actigram was either quite accurate or it underestimated sleep when compared with the PSG.

Consecutive patients (n = 140) with chronic insomnia were enrolled in this study (68 men and 72 women; mean age, 53.8 ± 10.8 years). All patients filled out a self-assessment questionnaire asking clinical descriptive variables at the baseline of the treatment period; patients received the usual dose of a single type of BZD or BzRA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were self-assessed at the baseline, and the former was re-evaluated at the time of cessation of medication or at the end of the 6-month treatment period. The PSQI included the following sub-items: evaluating sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), frequency of sleep disturbance (C5), use of sleeping medication (C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). Among the patients, 54.6% needed to continue hypnotics for a 6-month treatment period. Logistic regression analysis revealed that, among descriptive variables, only the PSQI score appeared as a significant factor associated with long-term use {odds ratio (OR) = 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.0-4.0}. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis identified that the cut-off PSQI total score at the baseline for predicting long-term use was estimated at 13.5 points (area under the curve = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.8-0.92). Among the sub-items of PSQI, the increases in C1: (OR = 8.4, 95% CI = 2.4-30.0), C3: (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.1-11.5), C4: (OR = 11.1, 95% CI = 3.6-33.9), and C6: (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.9-6.2) scores were associated with long-term use.

The present study aimed to evaluate potential cardiovascular benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The present study included 65 patients treated for chronic insomnia (M = 51.8 years, SD = 10.0; 66.2% female) at a university hospital. Patients received CBT-I over a 6-week period, and change scores from pre- to posttreatment derived from the Insomnia Severity Index, sleep diary, and polysomnography (PSG) were used as indices of sleep improvement. HRV variables (i.e., low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], and the ratio of low to high frequency [LF:HF ratio]) were derived for Stage 2 (S2) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep at pre- and posttreatment. High HF (i.e., parasympathetic activity) and/or low LF:HF ratio (i.e., sympathovagal balance) were used as indices of HRV improvement. Following therapy, sleep improvements, particularly for sleep onset latency, were related with reduced HF in S2 (r = .30, p < .05) and in REM (r = .36, p < .01). A trend was also observed between reduced insomnia symptoms and increased HF in REM (r = -.21, p < .10). Findings suggest that contrary to expectations, sleep improvements following CBT-I were associated with reduced parasympathetic activation and increased sympathovagal balance. Although preliminary, these results raise the question as to whether insomnia treatment might play a role in physiological changes associated with cardiovascular anomalies. Future research is needed to examine the long-term impact of treatment as a preventative tool against insomnia-related morbidity.

Secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of brief behavioral treatment of insomnia (BBTI) vs. an information-only control (IC) in 79 community-dwelling older adults with chronic insomnia. For the current analysis, participants were stratified into 2 groups: those with self-reported nocturia at baseline i.e., ≥ 1 void/night (N = 30; 16 IC, 14 BBTI) and those without nocturia (N = 49; 24 IC, 25 BBTI). We then determined the impact of BBTI on sleep, sleep quality, and nocturia as assessed by self-report, actigraphy, and polysomnography. Individuals without baseline nocturia responded well to BBTI with significant decrease in sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time assessed by sleep diary and actigraphy; these changes were significantly greater than those in the IC group. In comparison, changes in the same sleep parameters among participants with nocturia were not significantly different from the IC control. Although BBTI showed significant improvement in sleep quality in groups with and without nocturia (as assessed by PSQI and sleep diary), the effect size of these improvements was larger in those without nocturia than in those with nocturia (PSQI d = 0.82 vs. 0.53, diary sleep quality d = 0.83 vs. 0.51).

Diagnostic interviews were held at the laboratory of the Research Institute of Child Development and Education at the University of Amsterdam. Treatment for GT occurred at the mental health care center UvAMinds in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One hundred sixteen adolescents (mean age = 15.6 y, SD = 1.6 y, 25% males) meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia, were randomized to IT, GT, or WL. CBTI of 6 weekly sessions, consisted of psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, restriction of time in bed, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. GT was conducted in groups of 6 to 8 adolescents, guided by 2 trained sleep therapists. IT was applied through an online guided self-help website with programmed instructions and written feedback from a trained sleep therapist. Sleep was measured with actigraphy and sleep logs for 7 consecutive days. Symptoms of insomnia and chronic sleep reduction were measured with questionnaires. Results showed that adolescents in both IT and GT, compared to WL, improved significantly on sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time at post-test, and improvements were maintained at follow-up. Most of these improvements were found in both objective and subjective measures. Furthermore, insomnia complaints and symptoms of chronic sleep reduction also decreased significantly in both treatment conditions compared to WL.

The rates of persistent, remitted, and poor sleepers who developed chronic insomnia were 39%, 44%, and 17%, respectively. Risk factors for persistent poor sleep were physical health conditions combined with psychologic distress. Shorter objective sleep duration and a family history of sleep problems were risk factors for poor sleep evolving into chronic insomnia. Poor sleep appears to be primarily a symptom of physical and mental health conditions, whereas the persistence of poor sleep is associated with psychologic distress.

We exposed rats to a psychological stressor (cage exchange) that initially causes an acute stress response, but several hours later generates a pattern of sleep disturbances similar to that observed in stress-induced insomnia in humans: increased sleep latency, decreased non-REM (nREM) and REM sleep, increased fragmentation, and high-frequency EEG activity during nREM sleep. We examined the pattern of Fos expression to identify the brain circuitry activated, and found increased Fos in the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and parts of the arousal and autonomic systems. Surprisingly, there was simultaneous activation of the sleep-promoting areas, most likely driven by ongoing circadian and homeostatic pressure. The activity in the cerebral cortex and arousal system while sleeping generates a novel intermediate state characterized by EEG high-frequency activity, distinctive of waking, during nREM sleep. Inactivation of discrete limbic and arousal regions allowed the recovery of specific sleep components and altered the Fos pattern, suggesting a hierarchical organization of limbic areas that in turn activate the arousal system and subsequently the cerebral cortex, generating the high-frequency activity. This high-frequency activity during nREM was eliminated in the stressed rats after inactivating parts of the arousal system. These results suggest that shutting down the residual activity of the limbic-arousal system might be a better approach to treat stress-induced insomnia, rather than potentiation of the sleep system, which remains fully active.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18829974/"}

We employed at-home ambulatory polysomnography and compared this attenuated insomnia group to a good sleeping group. The poor sleepers had significantly higher wake after sleep onset, arousal count, mean HR in all sleep stages (with the exception of Stage 1) and lower sleep efficiency.

When restricting our analyses to insomnia with objectively determined short sleep duration, we found significantly lower standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN; a measure of HRV) compared to good sleepers.

Fourteen adolescents with insomnia (age range = 14-19, mean = 17, SD ± 1.7; 71% female) and depression completed a 90-min focus group. Information was elicited about sleep disruptions, insomnia's impact on mood, and preferences for insomnia treatments. Themes included poor daytime functioning affecting sleep, lack of benefit from sleep medication, and bedtime rumination. Most identified sleep diaries as a barrier to treatment regardless of mode of delivery. Participants also preferred an in-person therapy.

{"id": "9646380", "title": "The consequences of a week of insomnia. II: Patients with insomnia.", "text": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9646380/"}

All patients underwent 24 h ambulatory polysomnography (A-PSG). Prevalence of napping behavior in Insomnia Patients (I-group) was compared with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients (OSAS-group) and epilepsy patients (Ep-group). Patients were evaluated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Berlin Questionnaire. Psychometric evaluation included Self-Administered Anxiety Scale (SAS #54), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Maudsley's Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), and Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26).<b>Results:</b> No significant differences resulted in prevalence and duration of naps in the three groups. In the comparison between nappers (N+, subject with at least one nap in A-PSG) and non-nappers (N-, subject with no naps in A-PSG) we observed significant differences in PSQI scores (N+ = 14.1 ± 2.7; N- =11.9 ± 3.3; Whitney U-test = 341.0; <i>p</i> = 0.004) and in EAT score (N+ = 9.8 ± 9.7; N- = 4.4 ± 5.6; Whitney U-test = 313.5, <i>p</i> = 0.0.14); no significant differences were measured in other psychometric parameters and in sleep macrostructural indexes.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our data are in accordance with previous findings outlining that N + insomniacs have higher PSQI scores than N-. Our results do not confirm the suggested association between napping and depressive or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Conversely, we found a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.0014) in EAT scores in N + and N-.

Insomnia is common in patients with COVID-19 admitted to mobile cabin hospitals. Insomnia may lead to immune dysfunction, a condition not conducive to recovery from COVID-19. The use of sedative-hypnotic drugs is limited by their inhibitory effect on the respiratory system. A paucity of research is available regarding psychotherapy interventions to improve insomnia symptoms among  patients with COVID-19. In the general population, sleep problems are more common in women than in men; insomnia in women patients requires special attention. The aim of this study was to develop simplified-cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (S-CBTI) for patients with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms and to verify its effectiveness through a self-control trial. A second aim was to compare the effectiveness of S-CBTI between acute and chronic insomnia among women with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms in Wuhan Jianghan Cabin Hospital. S-CBTI consisted of education on COVID-19 and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and self-suggestion relaxation training over a period of two consecutive weeks. Of 67 women, 66 completed psychological intervention and baseline and post-intervention assessments. There were 31 women with acute insomnia and 35 with chronic insomnia. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and self-compiled sleep data were assessed at baseline and post-intervention, and subjective sleep evaluations were assessed at days 4, 7, 12, and 14. The ISI score, sleep latency, night sleep time, and sleep efficiency were statistically significantlly improved from baseline to post-intervention by paired T-test. After the intervention, the mean ISI score of the acute insomnia group was lower than that of the chronic insomnia group. The reduction of the ISI score and the improvement of sleep time from baseline to post-intervention in the acute insomnia group were greater than those in the chronic insomnia group. Utilization of sedative-hypnotic drugs in the acute insomnia group was less than that in the chronic insomnia group, and the difference was statistically significant.

However, there is no evidence suggesting associations between sleep traits and age at natural menopause (ANM). The objective of this study was to investigate the causal relationship between sleep traits (insomnia, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness) and ANM from the perspective of genetic variation. We selected the single-nucleotide polymorphisms from large-scale genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables and conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on these single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode. The Steiger test was employed to verify the correct causal directionality. The robustness of the MR analysis was examined through Cochran's Q test, horizontal pleiotropy test, and leave-one-out analysis. The results indicated that insomnia was causally associated with ANM (inverse variance weighting: β = -0.982; 95% CI: -1.852 to -0.111, P = .027), with other analyses confirming the robustness of this finding. Steiger test and reverse MR Analysis validated the absence of a reverse causal association between the two. However, sleep duration and daytime sleepiness did not exhibit a causal effect on ANM. In summary, this study provides initial evidence that insomnia can contribute to an earlier onset of ANM.

In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided. Melatonin may be helpful when insomnia is related to shift work and jet lag; however, its use remains controversial.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10524487/"}

Goodness-of-fit ratings of 10 DSM-IV-TR and 37 ICSD-2 insomnia diagnoses for each patient. Ratings were provided by 3 clinician pairs who used distinctive assessment methods to derive diagnostic impressions. Correlations computed within and across clinician pairs were used to test reliability and validity of diagnoses. Findings suggested that the best-supported DSM-IV-TR insomnia categories were insomnia related to another mental disorder, insomnia due to a general medical condition, breathing-related sleep disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. The category of primary insomnia appeared to have marginal reliability and validity. The best-supported ICSD-2 categories were the insomnias due to a mental disorder and due to a medical condition, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic insomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder-delayed sleep phase type. Psychophysiological insomnia and inadequate sleep hygiene received much more variable support across sites, whereas the diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia was poorly supported. Both the DSM-IV-TR and ICSD-2 provide viable insomnia diagnoses, but findings support selected subtypes from each of the 2 nosologies. Nonetheless, findings regarding the frequently used DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of primary insomnia and its related ICSD-2 subtypes suggest that their poor reliability and validity are perhaps due to significant overlap with comorbid insomnia subtypes.

Insomnia is defined and described with special attention to differentiating the subjective complaint and the laboratory assessment of objective sleep parameters. Specific disorders causing or associated with sleep disturbance and the complaint of insomnia are described, and some data bearing on relative prevalence of specific disorders are presented.

Most nocturnal sleeping problems varied little in prevalence over time, whereas problems related to turning in bed and vivid dreaming or nightmares increased. Insomnia was present in 54-60% of the patients at each of the three study visits and varied considerably in individual patients over time. The presence of insomnia was closely related to disease duration, higher Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores and female sex. Insomnia is a highly frequent complaint in patients with PD.

The potential side effects of hypnotic medications hinder their clinical application. Thus, traditional Chinese medicine is considered as an alternative option for treating insomnia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of suanzaoren decoction (SZRD), a classic Chinese herbal prescription, for adult chronic insomnia disorder. This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 150 patients with chronic insomnia disorder are randomised, allocated in a ratio of 1:1:1 to three groups: intervention group, control group and placebo group. The intervention group receives SZRD granule plus zolpidem tartrate (ZT) placebo; the control group receives ZT tablet plus SZRD granule placebo; and the placebo group receives ZT placebo and SZRD granule placebo. The patients receive medicine or placebo for 5 weeks and are followed up at 20 weeks. The primary outcome measures are polysomnography and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Secondary outcome measures are the Insomnia Severity Index, sleep diary and safety assessment. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and after treatment.

Although crucial in ensuring meaningful interactions and interventions for patients, research on patients' experiences of depression-related insomnia and its treatment is limited. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate how adult patients with depression-related insomnia experience sleeping with a weighted Protac Ball Blanket®, focusing on how the blanket feels and works and contributes to their subjective sleep quality experience. An inductive content analysis approach was adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 patients. Four categories were identified: 1) Deep and dynamic touch pressure from the plastic balls induced calmness; 2) Changing sensory impressions from the rolling balls distracted attention from distressing thoughts and emotions; 3) The ball blanket improved the quality and quantity of sleep, which increased daily well-being; 4) Sleeping with the ball blanket was associated with positive as well as negative experiences depending on personal preferences for sensory stimulation. This study explains how the Protac Ball Blanket® as a potential non-pharmacological sleep-intervention improved the sleep of adult patients with depression-related insomnia.

Sleep characteristics, and the health and sociodemographic status of the participants were assessed. The Insomnia in the Elderly Scale is divided into two subscales for the evaluation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fouth Edition criteria A and B for insomnia. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for subscale A was 0.868. The cut-off point to detect the presence of diagnostic criterion A for insomnia was a score of ≥ 3 (sensitivity: 86.4%; specificity: 69.5%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for subscale B was 0.832. The cut-off point to detect the presence of diagnostic criterion B was a score of ≥ 2 (sensitivity: 86.3%; specificity: 66.4%). The Insomnia in the Elderly Scale has appropriate psychometric properties. This scale compensates for the lack of validated instruments for use in the population aged 65 years or older. The fact that it is divided into two subscales to separately evaluate the insomnia criteria enables us to detect the presence of each of them.

Results demonstrated that sleep quality and sleep duration were the most sensitive primary measures, or best predicted perceived improvement, whereas sleep efficiency was the most specific primary measure, or best predicted perceived lack of improvement (defined as only mild improvement). Of the secondary measures, results showed that daytime impairment was the most sensitive predictor of perceived improvement and that mood was the most specific predictor of perceived lack of improvement.

First night effects were assessed using the following four variables: sleep efficiency, sleep latency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and REM latency. The 20 subjects who showed the strongest normal FNE were compared with the 20 showing the strongest reverse FNE. The two groups were similar in age, sex, and most aspects of reported home sleep. They differed in their sleep on night 1, but on nights 2 and 3 their sleep was quite similar. Both groups overestimated their sleep latencies on night 1 (by subjective reports) but unlike the normal FNE group, the reverse FNE patients very accurately assessed their sleep latency on nights 2 and 3. Reverse FNE patients had significantly higher scores than normal FNE patients on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) K (defensiveness, guardedness) and Pa (paranoia) scales, and they were less depressed, marginally less anxious, and somewhat more sensation-seeking and more susceptible to boredom. This study concluded that evaluations using only 1 night in the laboratory may be missing the larger picture of a patient's insomnia.

Furthermore, while the majority of studies have addressed explicit memory, few have investigated the implicit domain, and very little is known concerning other types of implicit memory besides procedural memory, such as priming. Thus, the purpose of the study was to investigate priming effect for visual stimuli in insomniacs and good sleepers. Twenty-three insomniacs and 20 good sleepers performed a visual priming task in which they were asked to name new and old pictures presented at nine ascending levels of spatial filtering. Both neutral and sleep-related stimuli were used, as previous research evidenced an attentional bias for sleep-related stimuli. Visual priming effect was observed in both groups, suggesting that poor sleep quality does not affect this type of implicit memory. However, the identification process in insomniacs is influenced by the nature of the stimulus to identify: insomniacs recognized both new and old sleep-related stimuli at lower spatial frequencies compared with good sleepers. The tendency to selectively attend to sleep-related stimuli may influence top-down processes occurring during identification of filtering stimuli, by determining a pre-allocation of attentional resources and facilitating identification processes even when sensorial information is scant. Differences in the identification processes of sleep-related stimuli compared with neutral ones should be carefully taken into account as possible pre-clinical markers of insomnia in poor sleepers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251718/"}

This study examined the within-person effect of sleep on next day physical activity in patients with chronic pain and insomnia. 119 chronic pain patients monitored their sleep and physical activity for a week in their usual sleeping and living environment. Physical activity was measured using actigraphy to provide a mean activity score each hour. Sleep was estimated with actigraphy and an electronic diary, providing an objective and subjective index of sleep efficiency (A-SE, SE) and a sleep quality rating (SQ). The individual and relative roles of these sleep parameters, as well as morning ratings of pain and mood, in predicting subsequent physical activity were examined in multilevel models that took into account variations in relationships at the 'Day' and 'Participant' levels. Of the 5 plausible predictors SQ was the only significant within-person predictor of subsequent physical activity, such that nights of higher sleep quality were followed by days of more physical activity, from noon to 11 pm. The temporal association was not explained by potential confounders such as morning pain, mood or effects of the circadian rhythm.

To elucidate how musical constituents influence sleep onset, we used both subjective and objective measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale as the former and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis as the latter. The EEG data showed that melody and harmony significantly enhance sleep quality, particularly impacting the theta band and the dispersion entropy in the temporal lobes. Conversely, the effect of rhythm in sleep induction appeared less significant, with minimal activity observed in the frontal and parietal lobes. We believe the data provide a foundation for innovative approaches to music composition that emphasize melody and harmony to enhance the therapeutic potential of music in sleep management, while de-emphasizing the role of rhythm.

Analysis of variance was performed, with contributing factors as the dependent variable and diagnostic group and clinic location as independent variables. Sleep specialists rated a psychiatric disorder as a stronger factor for insomnia related to mental disorders and rated negative conditioning and sleep hygiene as stronger factors for primary insomnia. However, a psychiatric disorder was rated as a contributing factor for 77% of patients who received a first diagnosis of primary insomnia. While neither sleep hygiene nor negative conditioning is a diagnostic criterion in DSM-IV, these results support the face validity of these clinical factors distinguishing between primary insomnia and insomnia related to mental disorders. The use of a psychiatric disorder as an inclusion criterion for insomnia related to mental disorders and an exclusion criterion for primary insomnia reinforces a categorical distinction between the two diagnoses, but the contribution of psychiatric symptoms in primary insomnia appears to be a clinically relevant one.

Insomnia's high prevalence and disease burden render it an important target for treatment. Further, and importantly, there exist established bidirectional links between insomnia and a range of health conditions, with insomnia both contributing to risk, maintenance and relapse of comorbid conditions. Recent clinical research demonstrates that treating insomnia in its own right is important for resolution of insomnia and for optimising treatment outcomes for comorbid presenting problems. Due to its effectiveness and favourable side-effect profile, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy-Insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment even when comorbid conditions are present. CBT-I is a brief treatment often delivered in four to eight consultations. Individual, group and online CBT-I have each demonstrated effectiveness. Outcomes for online CBT-I are often stronger when individualised clinician support is provided. Specifically assessing for and treating insomnia in clinical practice may provide an opportunity to optimise treatment outcome in many patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34796636/"}

Lack of light exposure is associated with sleep disorders, especially insomnia. For that purpose, our team developed a sleep diary with information about light exposure. Our objectives were to compare the proportion of informative usual sleep diaries (USD) and light/sleep diaries (LSD) and to evaluate factors influencing the quality of filling them. A monocentric, prospective, controlled interventional study was conducted. Patients included were randomized into two parallel groups: distribution of an USD (used in common practice), versus distribution of a LSD (similar to the USD but with light exposure data). The main outcome was the proportion of diaries returned and correctly filled out. A multivariate logistic regression model was then used to identify factors associated with the correct filling. A total of 325 USD and 324 LSD were distributed. 295 (45.5%) diaries were returned by patients: 158 (48.6%) USD, 137 (42.3%) LSD. The proportion of correctly completed diaries was 25.2% for USD versus 20.4% for LSD, which corresponds to a difference in the proportion of -4.86% [-10.25%; +∞[. The hypothesis of non-inferiority of LSD compared to USD cannot therefore be retained for a non-inferiority threshold of -10%. Multivariate analysis identified the level of difficulty experienced by the patient as an important factor influencing the quality of completion (OR =  0.99 [0.979-0.998]). The proportion of returned sleep diaries was greater in the USD and LSD insomniac subgroup (p < 0.0001). The non-inferiority of this new diary was not reached but this study highlighted the importance of clear explanations, patient motivation and restricted amount of collected data.

Our objective, therefore, was to explore how patients with depression experience treatment components and how their experiences influence adherence to CBT-I as a full-package treatment. Twelve patients with depression and comorbid insomnia were interviewed after six sessions of CBT-I, and a conventional qualitative content analysis was conducted. Two themes were found. The theme \"I picked what I needed\" showed that participants chose among CBT-I methods. Behavioral methods were considered hard but so effective that they reduced the need to learn other methods. Participants had difficulty learning cognitive methods, such as the restructuring of negative thoughts, owing to lack of energy and cognitive problems aggravated by sleep loss. Sleep hygiene education was regarded as common knowledge. The theme \"Staying on track\" highlighted factors promoting adherence, such as a preference for non-pharmacological treatment, rapid improvement, and support from relatives and therapists. Factors impeding adherence were: a perceived lack of support from the ongoing group setting, side effects of medication, changes in daily routine, and daytime fatigue influencing cognitive and emotional functioning. The study suggests: focusing on adherence throughout treatment; actively using support from relatives and therapists; preferring individual treatment; and prioritizing behavioral treatment components, with cognitive components introduced later in the treatment course when the negative effects on cognitive functioning due to sleep restriction have diminished.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32627595/"}

Participants included 29 Veterans with insomnia who had been prescribed sleeping medication in the last year and had not previously engaged with CBT-I. Semi-structured 90-min focus groups were used to 1) explore messages and appropriate channels for a CBT-I social marketing campaign, 2) determine patient preferences for self-management CBT-I tools, and 3) determine patient opinions on alternative provider-delivered forms of CBT-I. Thematic analysis was used to identify conceptual themes. Three main themes were identified. First, patient education is necessary but not sufficient. Patients recommended multiple outreach attempts through multiple channels to motivate tired and overwhelmed insomnia patients to engage with CBT-I. Second, patients gravitated toward a stepped-care approach. Most would start with self-management CBT-I tools, moving on to provider-delivered CBT-I if needed. Finally, patients appreciated being able to choose from a menu of CBT-I delivery options and would use multiple options simultaneously.

One hundred seventy-five users (mean age 46 y (18-79 y)) started a 6 week online intervention for insomnia. The drop-out rate was 29%, leaving a final sample of 125 users. The intervention is based on well-established face-to-face CBT-I. Sleep diaries were used to determine changes in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset. Treatment effects were assesed after 6 weeks of treatment and at the 6 week follow-up. Significant improvement was found in all main sleep variables except for 5% decrease in total sleep time (TST). Effects were sustained at 6 week follow-up and TST increased. The use of hypnotics decreased significantly. This form of treatment seems to suit its users very well and over 94% would recommend the treatment. Internet interventions for insomnia seem to have good potential. CBT-I will hopefully be offered as the first line treatment for chronic insomnia in Iceland instead of hypnotics as the availability of the CBT-I is growing.

The sample was composed of 67 participants (38 women, 29 men; mean age, 39.6 years), 40 individuals with insomnia and 27 good sleepers. Subjects completed prospective, daily measures of stressful events, presleep arousal, and sleep for 21 consecutive days. In addition, they completed several retrospective and global measures of depression, anxiety, stressful life events, and coping skills. The results showed that poor and good sleepers reported equivalent numbers of minor stressful life events. However, insomniacs rated both the impact of daily minor stressors and the intensity of major negative life events higher than did good sleepers. In addition, insomniacs perceived their lives as more stressful, relied more on emotion-oriented coping strategies, and reported greater presleep arousal than good sleepers. Prospective daily data showed significant relationships between daytime stress and nighttime sleep, but presleep arousal and coping skills played an important mediating role. The findings suggest that the appraisal of stressors and the perceived lack of control over stressful events, rather than the number of stressful events per se, enhance the vulnerability to insomnia. Arousal and coping skills play an important mediating role between stress and sleep. The main implication of these results is that insomnia treatments should incorporate clinical methods designed to teach effective stress appraisal and coping skills.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12651993/"}

Patients demonstrated decreased sleep efficiency and sleep stage S2 as well as increased sleep latency to S1, S2 and S3, wakefulness within the total sleep period, number of awakenings, S1 and REM sleep. There was no intergroup difference in REM latency. Subjective sleep quality and the total score of the Self-Assessment Scale for Sleep and Awakening Quality (SSA) were deteriorated as were evening and morning well-being, mood, affectivity and drowsiness. Noopsychic measures showed deteriorated numerical memory, fine motor activity and reaction time variability. In a placebo-controlled crossover design study, the acute effects of 100 mg trazodone, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a sedative action due to 5HT(2) and alpha(1) receptor blockade, were investigated in the patients. As compared with placebo, trazodone induced an increase in slow-wave sleep (S3 + 4), a lengthening of REM latency, a decrease in REM sleep and a normalization of the periodic leg movement (PLM) index. In the morning, there was a minimal increase in somatic complaints and a decrease in critical flicker frequency and systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that dysthymia induced significant changes in objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality, which were counteracted by 100 mg trazodone, thus suggesting a key-lock principle in the treatment of nonorganic insomnia related to dysthymia with this drug.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11586054/"}

The IC consisted of 6 Internet-based sessions that aimed to promote healthy restorative behavior. Self-report data were assessed at baseline and again after 8 weeks. Additionally, a sleep diary was used starting 1 week before baseline and ending 1 week after postassessment. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included perseverative cognitions (i.e., work-related rumination and worrying), a range of recovery measures and depression. An extended 6-month follow-up was assessed in the IC only. A serial multiple mediator analysis was carried out to investigate mechanisms of change. IC participants displayed a significantly greater reduction in insomnia severity (d = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.77) than did participants of the CC. The IC was also superior with regard to changes in all investigated secondary outcomes. Effects were maintained until a naturalistic 6-month follow-up. Effects on insomnia severity were mediated by both a reduction in perseverative cognitions and sleep effort. Additionally, a greater increase in number of recovery activities per week was found to be associated with lower perseverative cognitions that in turn led to a greater reduction in insomnia severity.

Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation.

The patients involved in the study lived a normal life and belonged to both sexes. In the introduction the author summarizes the different forms of pathological sleep and discusses the pharmacology of some hypnotics on the basis of which a detailed, multifactorial, up-to-date clinical examination of a hypnotic should be planned. He uses up-to-date methods and means for the examination of the drug which meet the requirements of an adequate clinical testing of a hypnotic. The sleep disturbances of the patients have been classified and characterized by the author from the somnological aspects and with somnological methods. Patients with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning, as well as mixed insomnias were differentiated. The effectivity of the drug was evaluated on the basis of data of sleep questionnaires referring to the target symptoms and the results of 24-hour polygraphic monitorings performed in 18 patients. In addition, the eventual hangover effect of the drug was assessed in these patients on the basis of the changes in reaction time, pulse rate, and skin resistance measured by polygraphy, besides placebo control on the day following the intake of the drug. The neurological and other organic side-effects were also examined and registered by means of the self-evaluating questionnaires, target specific interviewing of the patients, as well as by laboratory examinations. The drug proved to be most valuable as a hypnotic in patients with sleep onset and mixed insomnias. The hypnotic action was not so definite in sleep maintenance insomnias, the poorest responses were obtained in early morning insomnia cases. According to the results of polygraphic sleep examinations the two first sleep cycles become normal following the intake of the hypnotic. Parameters characteristic of REM sleep do not show changes. In the examined patients the number of side- and hangover effects attributable to the drug was very low. The author calls the attention to the importance of the observance of the dosage and administration of the drug which may prevent the development of a great number of side-effects. By giving a detailed description of a case history of an insomniac patient the author illustrates how the application field of midazolam may be further extended--within the frames of a sleep therapeutic process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8202870/"}

It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, ±0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, <2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, >97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32409833/"}

Usually, the obvious choice will be the use of pharmaceuticals however, these often have various side effects, and the lasting use of these medications could become a concern. Therefore, new non-drug alternatives are sought after. Audio brain entrainment is a procedure that modules neural activities by synchronizing brainwave frequency with pulse tones. By producing frequency tones for the deep sleep stage, it promotes a good night's sleep. In this paper, we developed a pillow integrated with the audio speakers that produce alpha and theta beats that should help improve sleep. Sleep polysomnography was performed on 10 people to compare the effects of the audio stimulus. Initial results showed a positive effect on sleep onset latency, indicating that sleep induction happened.

There has been marked scientific interest in sleep for a century, with the discoveries of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG), sleep-wake system, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and circadian rhythm system. Additionally, the advent of video-polysomnography in clinical research has revealed some of the consequences of disrupted sleep and sleep deprivation in psychiatric disorders. Decades of clinical research have demonstrated that sleep disorders are intimately tied to not only physical disease (e. g., lifestyle-related disease) but psychiatric illness. According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2005), sleep disorders are classified into 8 major categories: 1) insomnia, 2) sleep-related breathing disorders, 3) hypersomnias of central origin, 4) circadian rhythm sleep disorders, 5) parasomnias, 6) sleep-related movement disorders, 7) isolated symptoms, and 8) other sleep disorders. Several sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder, and narcolepsy, may be comorbid or possibly mimic numerous psychiatric disorders, and can even occur due to psychiatric pharmacotherapy. Moreover, sleep disorders may exacerbate underlying psychiatric disorders when left untreated. Therefore, psychiatrists should pay attention to the intimate relationship between sleep disorders and psychiatric symptoms.

However, PIDs are genetically determined and may occur at any age from early childhood to elderly age. Due to chronic patterns, the risk of malignancy and organ damage in patients with PIDs may affect any aspect of life, including sleep patterns. To our knowledge, the prevalence of insomnia and subjective sleep quality have not been investigated in patients with PIDs. Therefore, this pilot study was conducted to investigate sleep quality, the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and fatigue in adult patients with PIDs in Poland. All participants were surveyed using the Athens Insomnia Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, and a questionnaire concerning general health and demographic data. We included 92 participants: 48 women (52.2%) and 44 men (47.8%). Participants' mean age was 41.9 ± 13.9 years. The mean sleep duration was 7.0 ± 1.5 hours, and the mean sleep latency was 41.2 ± 53.1 minutes. Additionally, 44.6% of patients (n=41) had symptoms of insomnia and 44.6% (n=42) had poor sleep quality. Less than one-fourth (n=22; 23.9%) of the patients reported the use of sleeping pills; moreover, clinically significant fatigue was reported in 52.2% (n=48). Our investigation provides insight into the problem of sleep disturbances in patients with PIDs. Data have demonstrated that sleeping disorders with concomitant fatigue are common in patients with PID. Further studies are needed to determine the determinants of poor sleep quality in this specific group of patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36713442/"}

The two groups differed in 10 out of 13 questions about habitual sleep and daytime feelings. In contrast, polygraphic measures of baseline sleep indicated only that insomniacs tended to have slightly less total sleep and had a small but significant increase in early morning awakening time. Unlike the descriptions of habitual sleep, the subjects' retrospective reports of the previous night's sleep differed significantly only for the variable of total sleep time, and there were virtually no differences in the description of their status at a given moment. Auditory arousal thresholds were similar in the two groups, and both went back to sleep and stayed asleep with equal facility. These findings suggest that subjectively poor sleep is not necessarily \"light\" sleep. For both groups, arousal thresholds differed across the sleep stages, and thresholds to hearing the subject's name were lower than those in response to electronic tones. Although insomniacs had as much polygraphically defined sleep as controls between the forced awakenings of the arousal threshold studies, they perceived their sleep to be only approximately half as long. Insomniacs described themselves as having been awake more frequently than controls in 8 out of 10 forced awakening situations. In one case, insomniacs also overestimated the time between awakenings. In both groups, there was little relationship between reported habitual aspects of sleep and baseline polygraphically defined sleep variables. On questionnaires the following mornings, however, in both groups there was a positive correlation of subjective quality of sleep on the baseline nights with percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, and a negative correlation to various aspects of slow-wave sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3809325/"}

Participants (<i>N</i> = 303) received four sessions of CBT-I and completed measures of subjective insomnia severity, fatigue, sleep-related beliefs, treatment expectations, and sleep diaries. Subjective insomnia severity and sleep diaries were completed between each treatment session. Early response was defined as a 50% reduction in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores and early remission was defined by < 10 on the ISI after the first session. A single-session of CBT-I significantly reduced subjective insomnia severity scores and diary total wake time.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Yoga for improvement of subjective and objective sleep quality as well as measures of anxiety, depression, sleepiness, and fatigue in patients with CI. Adults with CI were prospectively included in this single group pre-post study. Baseline assessments included home polysomnography (PSG), 7-day actigraphy, and questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pichot fatigue scale (PS)). Patients practiced Viniyoga, an individualised Yoga practice with daily self-administered exercises, for 14 weeks. Assessments were repeated at the end of Yoga practice. Twenty-one patients completed the study. Objective sleep measurements revealed no change in PSG parameters after Yoga practice, but a decrease in arousals on actigraphy (p < 0.001). Subjective symptoms improved for all questionnaires (PSQI, p < 0.001; HAD-A, p = 0.020, HAD-D, p = 0.001, ESS, p = 0.041, PS, p = 0.010). In univariate correlations, decrease in PSQI was associated with increase in sleep stage N3 (p < 0.001) on PSG. We have demonstrated a positive impact of individualized Yoga practice on subjective parameters related to sleep and daytime symptoms in CI, resulting in fewer arousals on actigraphy. Yoga could be proposed as a potentially useful alternative to CBT-I in CI, as it is easy to practice autonomously over the long-term.

Thus far, objective studies report that migraine per se is a not associated with sleep apnea. At the present time, there is minimal evidence that migraine is under circadian influence. The current body of evidence suggests that the insomnia symptoms and poor sleep quality commonly reported by patients with migraine are not attack-related but occur interictally and are a marker of worsening disease. The development of clinical guidelines to approach sleep symptoms and expansion of CBT-I trials in those with episodic migraine would be clinically valuable.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38864968/"}

Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) is a self-report questionnaire to evaluate subjective pre-sleep arousal of insomnia. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the PSAS among patients with acute insomnia disorder (AID) using Rasch analysis. Totally 170 patients with AID from 31 public hospitals in China were recruited and completed the test. The psychometric properties of the PSAS were tested using Rasch analysis by Winsteps v5.4.1.0, including unidimensionality, local item independence, item fit, category diagnostics, reliability, item-person maps and differential item functioning (DIF) by age and gender. According to Rasch analysis, somatic and cognitive subscales were unidimensional and basically demonstrated good item-fit statistics. 4-point Likert scale may be more appropriate for PSAS. All items have a good reliability and separation. No gender and age bias were detected for the scale. However, the person arousal level is not well matched to item difficulty. The present study further reveals appropriate psychometric properties of the PSAS in patients with AID and provides suggestions for refinements and supplements to the PSAS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38749257/"}

Despite the high prevalence of the disorder and the need for therapeutic interventions, the accessibility and effectiveness of conventional insomnia treatments remain limited. The electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback control method is based on objective brain activity data to teach the patient self-regulation. This study performed a systematic analysis of current data on the use of neurofeedback technology for the treatment of sleep disorders, assessing the method's effectiveness and limitations. The search and review of publications from international databases over the past 10 years was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and the methods described in the RELISH Consortium. The results show that neurofeedback control, in particular, based on individual peak alpha frequency, is a viable and promising therapy. The technology significantly improves subjective and objective sleep parameters, such as reducing sleep latency, increasing total sleep time, and improving sleep quality. With its high efficacy and safety, neurofeedback control can become one of the key components of personalized medicine for the long-term treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40371858/"}

However, the relationship between these two phenomena over the course of a day remains largely unstudied. It is possible that (a) worry predicts sleep disturbance that night, (b) sleep disturbance predicts worry the following day, or (c) there is a bidirectional relationship between worry and sleep disturbance. The present study examined the daily relationship between worry (both during the day and immediately prior to sleep onset) and sleep in 50 high trait worriers who were randomly assigned to one of two interventions aimed at reducing worry as part of a larger study. A daily process approach was utilized wherein participants completed daily reports of sleep and worry during a 7-day baseline period followed by a 14-day intervention period. Results of repeated measures multilevel modeling analyses indicated that worry experienced on a particular day predicted increased sleep disturbance that night during both the baseline and intervention weeks. However, there was no evidence of a bidirectional relationship as sleep characteristics did not predict worry the following day. Additionally, the type of intervention that participants engaged in did not affect the daily relationship between worry and sleep. Results of the present study are consistent with the cognitive model of insomnia (Harvey, 2002) and highlight the importance of addressing and treating worry among individuals with high trait worry and sleep disturbance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27423163/"}

With PSG, 10 out of 14 participants with TBI could be defined as having objective insomnia. Nonetheless, when groups were compared, no significant differences were found on sleep continuity variables, although large effect sizes were seen for several measures suggesting sleep fragmentation. In terms of sleep architecture, no significant differences were found in the percentage of stage 2, slow-wave (stages 3 and 4), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but a higher proportion of stage 1 sleep was found in the TBI participants.

In 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that sleep disorders should be dealt with as a public health epidemic. However, it is hard to provide adequate treatment for each insomnia sufferer, since various behavioral characteristics influence symptoms of insomnia collectively. We aim to develop a neural-net based unsupervised user clustering method towards insomnia sufferers in order to clarify the unique traits for each derived groups. Unlike the current diagnosis of insomnia that requires qualitative analysis from interview results, the classification of individuals with insomnia by using various information modalities from smart bands and neural-nets can provide better insight into insomnia treatments. This study, as part of the precision psychiatry initiative, is based on a smart band experiment conducted over 6 weeks on individuals with insomnia. During the experiment period, a total of 42 participants (19 male; average age 22.00 [SD 2.79]) from a large university wore smart bands 24/7, and 3 modalities were collected and examined: sleep patterns, daily activities, and personal demographics. We considered the consecutive daily information as a form of images, learned the latent variables of the images via a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and clustered and labeled the input images based on the derived features. We then converted consecutive daily information into a sequence of the labels for each subject and finally clustered the people with insomnia based on their predominant labels. Our method identified 5 new insomnia-activity clusters of participants that conventional methods have not recognized, and significant differences in sleep and behavioral characteristics were shown among groups (analysis of variance on rank: F<sub>4,37</sub>=2.36, P=.07 for the sleep_min feature; F<sub>4,37</sub>=9.05, P<.001 for sleep_efficiency; F<sub>4,37</sub>=8.16, P<.001 for active_calorie; F<sub>4,37</sub>=6.53, P<.001 for walks; and F<sub>4,37</sub>=3.51, P=.02 for stairs). Analyzing the consecutive data through a CAE and clustering could reveal intricate connections between insomnia and various everyday activity markers.

A representative sample of 584 adults (18-96 years old) participated in an online survey. Respondents reported their SEL on weekday nights (Sunday to Thursday) and weekend nights (Friday and Saturday), and activities during SEL. One in five adults tried to sleep immediately at bedtime. Around 16% of respondents were awake >30 min on both weekday and weekend nights. Younger people and those with an eveningness preference reported longer SEL. Longer SEL corresponded with a progressive decline in sleep quality, increased SOL and more fatigue.

{"id": "26004526", "title": "Some implications of melatonin use in chronopharmacology of insomnia.", "text": "The last decade has witnessed the emergence of new chronopharmacological perspectives. In the case of sleep disorders, the accumulating evidence suggests that even a minor dysfunction in the biological clock can impact broadly upon body physiology causing increases in sleep onset latency, phase delays or advances in sleep initiation, frequent nocturnal awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, delayed and shortened rapid eye movement sleep and increased periodic leg movements, among others. Thus, restoration of the adequate circadian pattern of proper sleep hygiene, targeted exposure to light and the use of chronobiotic drugs, such as melatonin, which affect the output phase of clock-controlled circadian rhythms, can help to recover the sleep-wake cycle. The optimization of drug effects and/or minimization of toxicity by timing medications with regard to biological rhythms is known as chronotherapeutics. While chronotherapeutical approaches have been particularly successful in the treatment of hypertension, allergies and some forms of cancer, a time-dependent pharmacological approach can be also effective when dealing with sleep disruptions like insomnia. A large proportion of patients under benzodiazepine (BZD)/Z drug treatment fail to achieve a complete and sustained recovery and are left with residual symptoms, like tolerance or dependency, that make relapse or recurrence more likely, and poorer quality of life a reality. Thus the chronic and extensive use of BZD/Z drugs has become a public health issue and has led to multiple campaigns to reduce both prescription and consumption of BZD/Z-drugs. This short review discusses available data on the efficacy of melatonin to reduce chronic BZD use in insomnia patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26004526/"}

{"id": "33314496", "title": "The acute effects of sleep restriction therapy for insomnia on circadian timing and vigilance.", "text": "Sleep-restriction therapy (SRT) has been shown to improve insomnia symptoms by restricting sleep opportunity. Curtailment of time in bed affects the duration and consolidation of sleep, but also its timing. While recent work suggests that people with insomnia are characterised by misalignment between circadian and behavioural timing of sleep, no study has investigated if SRT modifies this relationship. The primary aim of the present study was to examine change in phase angle after 2 weeks of SRT. As a secondary aim, we also sought to assess the effect of SRT on psychomotor vigilance. Following a 1-week baseline phase, participants implemented SRT for 2 consecutive weeks. Phase angle was derived from the difference between the decimal clock time of dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and attempted sleep time. Secondary outcomes included vigilance (assessed via hourly measurement during the DLMO laboratory protocol), sleep continuity (assessed via sleep diary and actigraphy), and insomnia severity. Eighteen participants meeting insomnia criteria (mean [SD] age 37.06 [8.99] years) took part in the study. Consistent with previous research, participants showed robust improvements in subjective and objective sleep continuity, as well as reductions in insomnia severity. The primary outcome (phase angle) was measurable in 15 participants and revealed an increase of 34.8 min (~0.58 hr; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-1.15) from baseline to post-treatment (mean [SD] 2.27 [0.94] versus 2.85 [1.25] hr). DLMO remained relatively stable (20:49 versus 21:01 hours), while attempted sleep was 46.8 min later (~0.78 hr; 95%CI 0.41-1.15; 23:05 versus 23:52 hours). For psychomotor vigilance, reaction time was delayed (by 52.71 ms, 95% CI 34.44-70.97) and number of lapses increased (by 5.84, 95% CI 3.93-7.75) after SRT. We show that SRT increases phase angle during treatment, principally by delaying the timing of sleep attempt. Future studies are needed to test if an increase in phase angle is linked to clinical improvement. Finally, reduction in vigilance after SRT appears to be of similar magnitude to normal sleepers undergoing experimental sleep restriction, reinforcing the importance of appropriate safety advice during implementation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314496/"}

In addition, we proposed a network approach to the insomnia and hypersomnolence symptoms. A total of 433 university students underwent a clinical interview for sleep and socio-demographics and completed the SCI and the IHSS. Confirmatory factorial and network analyses were conducted. The SCI demonstrated a two-factor structure, while the IHSS exhibited a three-factor structure. Over 70% of students scored above the IHSS clinical threshold, while 36.5% were diagnosed with insomnia. For the SCI, a threshold of ≤ 13 demonstrated the highest predictive value for diagnosing insomnia. Network analyses highlighted the central role of cognitive consequences of insomnia and hypersomnolence. Cognitive and emotional consequences of insomnia and hypersomnolence were moderately interconnected. Higher cognitive complaints related to insomnia were associated with increased feelings of insufficient sleep and more pronounced sleep inertia. Additionally, greater wakefulness after sleep onset was linked to both a shorter ideal night-time sleep duration and increased difficulty staying awake during low-stimulation activities throughout the day. The SCI and IHSS showed structural invariance in university students when compared to the general population. Insomnia and hypersomnolence represent critical clinical issues among French students.

Stress exposure was a significant predictor of insomnia onset, such that the odds of developing insomnia increased by 19% for every additional stressor. Chronicity significantly moderated this relationship, such that the likelihood of developing insomnia as a result of stress exposure increased as a function of chronicity. Cognitive intrusion significantly mediated the association between stress exposure and insomnia.

We also found that nightmare occurrences did not predict increased sleep disturbance on the same night or the following 2 nights, rather nightmares predicted increased sleep disturbance at the between-subjects level only.

More access to technology has provided opportunities to use virtual teaching methods to educate and support cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of supportive educational intervention (SEI) through virtual social networks (VSNs) on the sleep quality and the severity of insomnia of cancer patients. The study was conducted on 66 patients with cancer: intervention (n = 33) and control (n = 33) groups (CONSORT). Intervention group received supportive educational intervention on sleep for 2 months through virtual social networks (VSNs). All participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and insomnia severity index (ISI) before and after the intervention. The mean scores of sleep quality (p = .001) and insomnia severity (p = .001) in the intervention group had a statistically significant decrease. Moreover, quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances of sleep, and daytime dysfunction showed significant improvement in the intervention group, every two times after the intervention (p < .05). However, the participants' sleep quality deteriorated progressively in the control group (p = .001).

Research over the past 4 years has utilized cross-sectional, longitudinal, cohort, and intervention designs to examine these associations. Short (< 7 h) and long (> 8-9 h) sleep durations and insomnia symptoms are risk factors for depression in older adults. Similarly, short sleep, long sleep, insomnia symptoms, and depression are all risk factors for poorer health in late life, including increased risk of cognitive decline, falls, and poorer quality-of-life. Intervention studies have produced mixed findings, with some studies suggesting that sleep interventions may be potentially effective in improving both insomnia and mood symptoms.

The pilot study used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design where each participant received both treatment and placebo for 2 weeks with an intervening 2-week washout period. Sleep continuity (sleep onset, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency) was assessed by 2-week mean values from daily sleep diaries and disease severity by the Insomnia Severity Index in a cohort of 15 older adults with chronic insomnia who were otherwise healthy. The tart cherry juice beverage was associated with statistically significant pre- to post-treatment improvements on all sleep variables. When compared to placebo, the study beverage produced significant reductions in insomnia severity (minutes awake after sleep onset); no such improvements were observed for sleep latency, total sleep time, or sleep efficiency compared to placebo. Effect sizes were moderate and in some cases negligible. The results of this pilot study suggest that CherryPharm, a tart cherry juice blend, has modest beneficial effects on sleep in older adults with insomnia with effect sizes equal to or exceeding those observed in studies of valerian and in some, but not all, studies of melatonin, the two most studied natural products for insomnia.

{"id": "21476952", "title": "Pharmacological advances in the treatment of insomnia.", "text": "Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition, and due to ongoing demand from patients suffering with this condition, new pharmacological treatments are actively being sought. As our neurophysiological understanding of insomnia grows, so too do the available treatment options. A significant advance in the treatment of insomnia came with the development of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications, zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. These medications have shorter durations of action than many traditional benzodiazepines and may be associated with less risk of tolerance and abuse. They have also been demonstrated to be helpful in cases in which insomnia is comorbid with depression or anxiety, leading to beneficial effects not only with sleep but also with mood and anxiety symptoms. Melatonin, a naturally-occurring substance intimately involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm, has also been explored as a hypnotic. Little data to date support its use; however, there is evidence that ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, may be helpful for sleep initiation difficulties. Tri-cyclic antidepressants have long been used for insomnia, but use has been limited by unwanted anticholinergic side effects. Low-dose doxepin, at doses of 3 and 6mg, has been demonstrated to have the unique property among its class of being free of anticholinergic effects at those doses. In addition, it seems to have particular efficacy for sleep maintenance insomnia, exhibiting the most robust effects in the latter third of the night. The hypocretin/orexin system has been identified as a possible target. Almorexant, a hypocretin/orexin antagonist displayed evidence of efficacy during Phase III clinical trials but these trials were recently discontinued due to its side effect profile. Another hypocretin/orexin antagonist with a different mechanism of action, MK-4035, is presently in clinical trials. Serotonin antagonists and inverse agonists have been investigated; however, a recent trial with APD125 was discontinued due to lack of efficacy. Sodium oxybate has been used off-label for insomnia by some providers, although data supporting its use are limited. While the sleep-promoting effects of GABA(A) (nonbenzodiazepines and benzodiazepines) enhancement is well-established, newer research examining other mechanisms of action suggest that agents which modulate the histaminergic, serotonergic, melontonergic, and hypocretin/orexin and perhaps GABA-B systems show promise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476952/"}

We reviewed the existing literature on dual orexin receptor antagonists in PubMed databases using the search terms \"orexin receptor antagonist,\" \"almorexant\" \"filorexant,\" \"lembroexant\" and \"suvorexant\"; searches were limited to English language primary research articles, clinical trials, and reviews. Targeting the orexin receptor system for treatment of insomnia offers an additional and alternative pharmacological approach to more common gamma aminobutyric acid agonist sedative hypnotic treatment. Effectiveness is not well established in the current literature; however, the literature does suggest efficacy. Preclinical reports also suggest the potential for treatment in individuals with comorbid Alzheimer disease and insomnia. DORAs offer an additional treatment option for insomnia.

The subjects were evaluated with an assessment battery, which included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Aggression Questionnaire, during a semi-structured interview. The main finding was that more of the APD patients suffered from disturbed sleep quality than did the controls. Compared to the matched controls the APD patients had lower subjective sleep quality, longer sleep latency, shorter duration of sleep, less habitual sleep efficiency, more sleep disturbances, more use of sleeping medication, and a higher level of daytime dysfunction. In the APD group, elevated levels of aggression were also significantly correlated with impaired sleep quality.

We computed subjective-objective mismatch by the formula (subjective - objective value)/objective value ×100; negative and positive values indicated under- and overestimation, respectively. In the entire sample, the magnitude of under- and overestimation of total sleep time was similar, but varied significantly between diagnostic groups, with insomnia and insufficient sleep syndrome showing the most pronounced underestimation and REM parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders showing the most pronounced overestimation of total sleep time. In all diagnostic categories, a majority tended to overestimate their sleep onset latency and to underestimate the amount of WASO. Younger age was independently correlated with underestimation of total sleep time and WASO, and with overestimation of sleep onset latency. Overestimation of sleep onset latency independently correlated to an increased latency to N3 sleep stage on polysomnography.

Data from 1,332 daytime workers aged less than 60 years who had no depressive symptoms at baseline were analyzed. The risk of developing depression in the future was associated with insomnia at baseline, after adjusting for age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64). Even after adjusting for the covariances of job type, living with family, sleeping time, and undergoing treatment or taking medication, insomnia was associated with the onset of future depression (HR 1.58).

The number and duration of waking periods in the night were regularly underestimated, and no correlation could be found between the estimated number of waking periods and those actually recorded on the EEG. The composition of sleep on falling asleep and on waking, when these are overestimated, showed an appreciable period of waking sleep at these times (21% and 41% respectively). The authors suggest that their results indicate that study of the transitional periods of sleep and waking may provide a better understanding of insomnia and lead to alternative therapeutic approaches.

In addition to completing a range of standardized measures related to sleep quality and quality of life, participants also monitored their sleep with a self-completed sleep diary over a two-week period, on two separate occasions. Following CBT-I treatment, no between-group difference was found on any sleep or quality of life measure.

We speculated that insomnia subtyping with additional power spectral analysis and measurement of response to acute sleep restriction may be informative in overall assessment of ID. To explore alternative classifications of ID subtypes, insomnia patients (n = 99) underwent two consecutive overnight sleep studies: (i) habitual sleep opportunity (polysomnography, PSG) and, (ii) two hours less sleep opportunity (electroencephalography, EEG), with the first night compared to healthy controls (n = 25). ID subtypes were derived from data-driven classification of PSG, EEG spectral power and interhemispheric EEG asymmetry index. Three insomnia subtypes with different sleep duration and NREM spectral power were identified. One subtype (n = 26) had shorter sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (short-sleep delta-deficient; SSDD), the second subtype (n = 51) had normal sleep duration but lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (normal-sleep delta-deficient; NSDD) and a third subtype showed (n = 22) no difference in sleep duration or delta power from healthy controls (normal neurophysiological sleep; NNS). Acute sleep restriction improved multiple objective sleep measures across all insomnia subtypes including increased delta power in SSDD and NSDD, and improvements in subjective sleep quality for SSDD (p = 0.03), with a trend observed for NSDD (p = 0.057).

A systematic review of mechanistic evidence and the introduction of the Triple-R model.", "text": "For over 30 y sleep restriction therapy (SRT) has been used to treat insomnia but we know very little about how this therapy exerts its effects. When SRT was first described, it was hypothesised to treat insomnia by addressing four key factors: strengthening homeostatic sleep pressure, inhibiting perpetuating practices (excessive time in bed), attenuating hyperarousal and tightening regulatory control of sleep by the endogenous circadian pacemaker. We conducted a systematic literature review in search of evidence for these putative mechanisms-of-action. A total of 15 randomised and non-randomised studies investigating SRT met inclusion criteria. For each study, we extracted all variables associated with the proposed mechanisms and assessed study quality using a structured appraisal tool. The extracted variables were: time in bed (TIB), napping, variability in sleep, markers of circadian rhythmicity, measurements of sleep pressure/sleepiness, and assessments of arousal. Overall study quality was poor as indicated by a mean quality score of 17 (out of a possible range of 0-31). No study indicated, or indeed was designed to test, whether changes in the proposed mechanisms act as mediators of treatment outcomes. Of all reviewed studies, most reported a reduction in TIB (10/10) and/or revealed a decrease in sleep onset latency (10/14), indexing increased sleep pressure. However, such changes were most often reported at the end of treatment, reflecting an outcome and not a mechanism of SRT per se. Evidence for reduction in arousal (4/4) and night-to-night sleep variability (2/2) was found in only a small number of uncontrolled studies while there was no evidence for change in circadian phase or periodicity (0/1). Our review suggests that SRT targets some of the hypothesised processes but specifically-designed mechanistic evaluations are needed. We introduce a new testable model of SRT mechanism-of-action (Triple-R) and set out a research agenda aimed at stimulating prospective investigations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30177248/"}

To determine the accuracy of sleep duration perception, we investigated 44 healthy subjects participating in multi-day inpatient sleep protocols during which they had extended nighttime and short daytime sleep opportunities but no time cues or knowledge of time of day. The first sleep opportunity was at habitual sleep time and duration. The subsequent 3, 4, or 11 days had 12-h nighttime sleep opportunities and 4-h daytime nap opportunities, potentially creating an experimentally induced \"insomnia\" with substantial time awake during scheduled sleep. Subjective sleep duration estimates were accurate for the first (habitual) sleep opportunity. The subjective reports following nighttime 12-h sleep opportunities significantly underestimated objective sleep duration, while those following daytime 4-h sleep opportunities significantly overestimated objective sleep duration. Misperception errors were not explained by poor sleep efficiency, which was lower during 4-h (~39%) than 12-h opportunities (~71%). Subjective sleep estimates after 4-h opportunities correlated with the percentage of REM and N3 sleep. Subjective sleep estimates following 12-h opportunities were, unexpectedly, negatively correlated with NREM stage 2 sleep. The estimation of sleep duration in the absence of time cues may depend on length of sleep opportunity and/or time of day.

This study aimed to systematically revise the literature relating to adherence to the Mediterranean diet and sleep features in observational studies. The systematic review comprised 23 reports describing the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and different sleep features, including sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia symptoms. The majority of the included studies were conducted in the Mediterranean basin and reported a significant association between a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a lower likelihood of having poor sleep quality, inadequate sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness or symptoms of insomnia. Interestingly, additional studies conducted outside the Mediterranean basin showed a relationship between the adoption of a Mediterranean-type diet and sleep quality, suggesting that biological mechanisms sustaining such an association may exist. In conclusion, current evidence suggests a relationship between adhering to the Mediterranean diet and overall sleep quality and different sleep parameters.

Individuals with insomnia disorder (n = 18) and good sleeper controls (GSC; n = 15) completed the AX-continuous performance task, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. This task required participants to maintain specific cue-information active to prepare an adequate response to a subsequent probe, which allowed us to measure participants' reliance on both proactive and reactive control. The results indicate that, although ID show a comparable level of performance as GSC, they show a reduced proactive engagement of cue-induced maintenance and response preparation processes (as reflected by the P3b and the contingent negative variation components). Moreover, in contrast to GSC, ID fail to engage reactive control (as indexed by the P3a component) to overcome invalid response tendencies.

This comorbidity is associated with health problems like depression and a self-perpetuating vicious circle in which pain and insomnia symptoms mutually reinforce each other. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) has demonstrated efficacy in facilitating the behavioural and psychological changes necessary to improve sleep. However, its applicability to patients with the insomnia-pain comorbidity condition is underexplored. We will expand the knowledge base of CBT-i to this patient group by examining the effects on core insomnia symptoms, including sleep onset, the frequency and duration of nightly and early morning awakenings, sleep efficiency and daytime impairments at post-test and follow-up. Secondary outcomes include reductions in pain intensity and interference, depression and fatigue; improved pain acceptance and quality of life; and more adaptive sleep-related beliefs. This study also explores mediators of the expected effects, patient experiences of the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and how these experiences relate to individual differences in treatment benefits. The study includes hospital patients with a chronic pain condition according to the criteria from the International Association for the Study of Pain and a DSM-5 diagnosis of insomnia. The study will recruit 106 patients based on a power analysis that accounts for 20% dropout, and block-randomise them to a group-based CBT-i intervention or treatment as usual (TAU).

Patients' experiences of feasibility and acceptability will be analysed using a reflexive thematic approach.

Several databases were queried for technology-mediated insomnia treatments. After inclusion and exclusion steps, data from 18 studies were retrieved and aggregated to find an average adherence rate. Next, 15 semistructured interviews about sleep-support technologies were conducted to investigate perceived adherence. Lastly, several scenarios were written about the usage of a virtual sleep coach that could support adherence rates. The scenarios were discussed in six different focus groups consisting of potential users (n=15), sleep experts (n=7), and coaches (n=9). From the meta-analysis, average treatment adherence appeared to be approximately 52% (95% CI 43%-61%) for technology-mediated insomnia treatments. This means that, on average, half of the treatment exercises were not executed, suggesting there is a substantial need for adherence and room for improvement in this area. However, the users in the interviews believed they adhered quite well to their sleep products. Users mentioned relying on personal commitment (ie, willpower) for therapy adherence. Participants of the focus groups reconfirmed their belief in the effectiveness of personal commitment, which they regarded as more effective than adherence-enhancing strategies. Although adherence rates for insomnia interventions indicate extensive room for improvement, users might not consider adherence to be a problem; they believe willpower to be an effective adherence strategy.

Poor sleep was a persistently troubling complaint for participants, long after the completion of active cancer treatment. The impact of insomnia was significant for all participants, with six key domains emerging as those most affected: temperament, sociability, physical well-being, cognitive functioning, relationships, and psychological well-being. In terms of insomnia management, participants frequently resorted to unfruitful self-management strategies, due to the lack of professional insomnia expertise within cancer care settings. Three main themes emerged in relation to insomnia management: self-management, seeking professional intervention, and a lack of focus on sleep. A lack of clinician understanding of the importance of sleep health and the poor availability of evidence-based insomnia interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), were highlighted as important gaps in cancer care. Insomnia was found to have a detrimental and pervasive impact on cancer survivors' quality of life, which persisted long into survivorship.

With respect to the latter, subjects in the modafinil plus CBT group more reliably adhered to the prescribed phase delay in bedtime than did the placebo plus CBT group. These data suggest that modafinil may be used to diminish the negative side effects of CBT (increased daytime sleepiness) and may increase subject compliance with therapy. Whether enhanced daytime function mediates the change in adherence and whether reduced sleepiness and enhanced compliance translate to less patient attrition in the clinical setting remain to be evaluated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15283007/"}

Low energy emission therapy (LEET) has been developed as a potential alternative therapy for this disorder. LEET consists of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields delivered intrabuccally by means of an electrically conducting mouthpiece in direct contact with the oral mucosa. The effect of LEET on chronic psychophysiological insomnia was assessed with polysomnography (PSG) and sleep rating forms on a total of 106 patients at two different centers. Active or inactive LEET was administered for 20 minutes in late afternoon three times a week for a total of 12 treatments. Primary efficacy endpoints evaluating the results were changes from baseline in PSG-assessed total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency (SL). Secondary endpoints were changes in sleep efficiency (SE), sleep stages, and reports by the subjects of SL and TST. There was a significant increase in TST as assessed by PSG between baseline and post-treatment values for the active treatment group (76.0 +/- 11.1 minutes, p = 0.0001). The increase for the inactive treatment group was not statistically significant. The TST improvement was significantly greater for the active group when compared to the inactive group (adjusted for baseline TST; p = 0.020. R1 = 0.20). There was a significant decrease in SL as assessed by PSG between baseline and post-treatment values for the active treatment group (-21.6 +/- 5.9 minutes, p = 0.0006), whereas the decrease noted for the inactive treatment group was not statistically significant. The difference in SL decrease between the two treatment groups was marginally significant (adjusted for baseline SL and center, p = 0.068, R2 = 0.60). The number of sleep cycles per night increased by 30% after active treatment (p = 0.0001) but was unchanged following inactive treatment. Subjects did not experience rebound insomnia, and there were no significant side effects. The data presented in this report indicate that LEET administered for 20 minutes three times a week increased TST and reduced SL in chronic psychophysiological insomnia. LEET is safe and well tolerated and it effectively improved the sleep of chronic insomniacs given 12 treatments over a 4-week period by increasing the number of sleep cycles without altering the percentage of the various sleep stages during the night. The therapeutic action of LEET differs from that of currently available drug therapies in that the sleep pattern noted in insomniacs following LEET treatment more closely resembles nocturnal physiological sleep. This novel treatment may offer an attractive alternative therapy for chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8776791/"}

The authors tested the hypothesis that patients with primary insomnia (PI) would show deficits in sleep-related memory consolidation compared to good sleeper controls (GSC). The study used a four-group parallel design (n=86) to investigate the effects of 12 h of night-time, including polysomnographically monitored sleep ('sleep condition' in PI and GSC), versus 12 h of daytime wakefulness ('wake condition' in PI and GSC) on procedural (mirror tracing task) and declarative memory consolidation (visual and verbal learning task). Demographic characteristics and memory encoding did not differ between the groups at baseline. Polysomnography revealed a significantly disturbed sleep profile in PI compared to GSC in the sleep condition. Night-time periods including sleep in GSC were associated with (i) a significantly enhanced procedural and declarative verbal memory consolidation compared to equal periods of daytime wakefulness in GSC and (ii) a significantly enhanced procedural memory consolidation compared to equal periods of daytime wakefulness and night-time sleep in PI. Across retention intervals of daytime wakefulness, no differences between the experimental groups were observed. This pattern of results suggests that healthy sleep fosters the consolidation of new memories, and that this process is impaired for procedural memories in patients with PI.

Specific behavioural factors relevant to an individual patient's insomnia must be identified. The factors are: (i) the patient's expectations of the experience of going to sleep and his/her belief that he can or cannot control the onset of sleep, (ii) the patients' personal theory of the cause of the problem, (iii) what the patient says to himself privately about the problem, (iv) the presence of stimuli in the sleep setting which arouse the patients including objects, persons and behavioural rituals.

We explored whether insomnia with physiological hyperarousal measured by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is associated with body-weight differences. A total of 185 normal sleepers and 440 insomniacs were included in this study. Insomnia was defined by standard diagnostic criteria with symptoms lasting ≥6 months. All subjects underwent one night of laboratory polysomnography followed by a standard MSLT. We used the median MSLT value (i.e., ≥14 min) to define physiological hyperarousal. BMI was based on measured height (cm) and weight (kg) during the subjects' sleep laboratory visit. BMI > 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was defined as overweight, while BMI < 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was defined as underweight. After controlling for confounders, the odds of lower weight rather than overweight were significantly increased among insomnia patients with increased MSLT: insomnia with MSLT 14-17 min and MSLT > 17 min increased the odds of lower weight by approximately 89% (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.00-4.85) and 273% (OR = 3.73, 95% CI 1.51-9.22) compared with normal sleepers, respectively. In contrast, insomnia in patients with MSLT 11-14 min and 8-11 min was not different from normal sleepers in terms of body weight. Insomnia associated with physiological hyperarousal, the most severe phenotype of chronic insomnia, is associated with higher odds of lower weight and underweight compared with normal sleepers.

This cross-sectional, population-based study involved 477,529 participants, comprising 133,314 patients with frequent insomnia symptoms (age: 57.4 ± 7.7 years; 62.1% female) and 344,215 controls without insomnia symptoms (age: 56.1 ± 8.2 years; 52.0% female). Cognitive performance was assessed by a touchscreen test battery probing reasoning, basic reaction time, numeric memory, visual memory, and prospective memory. Adjusted models included relevant demographic, clinical, and sleep variables. Frequent insomnia symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment in unadjusted models; however, these effects were reversed after full adjustment, leaving those with frequent insomnia symptoms showing statistically better cognitive performance over those without. Relative to intermediate chronotype, evening chronotype was associated with superior task performance, while morning chronotype was associated with the poorest performance. Sleep medication use and both long (>9 h) and short (<7 h) sleep durations were associated with impaired performance. Our results suggest that after adjustment for potential confounding variables, frequent insomnia symptoms may be associated with a small statistical advantage, which is unlikely to be clinically meaningful, on simple neurocognitive tasks.

The effect of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway on BSXMD treatment of insomnia was investigated by using p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) induced insomnia male rat model. The results of open field test, Morris water maze and hypnosis experiments implied that circadian dysrhythmia, increased open-field activity, decreased sleep quality and learning and memory impairments were observed in insomnia male rat. Besides, the levels of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway, 5-HT, MT, MT1 and MT2 were reduced, accompanied with neural tissue damage in insomnia male rats by ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, immunohistochemistry and HE staining. BXSMD alleviated neural tissue damage and improved sleep quality along with cognitive functions (learning and memory) in insomnia male rats. Moreover, BXSMD caused activation of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway and upregulation of 5-HT, MT, MT1 and MT2 levels in insomnia male rats. BDNF overexpression-mediated activation of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway enhanced the pharmacological effects of BXSMD described above.

Sleep normalized in the second trimester, but the third trimester was characterized by increased Insomnia and decreased Daytime Alertness. The most frequent reasons cited by women for sleep alterations were urinary frequency, backache or ache in the hips and fetal movement. Contingency X2 analyses were used to investigate a relationship between the frequency of reporting the reasons and the trimester of pregnancy. Significant increases were found in reporting as the reasons for sleep difficulties, fetal movement in the third trimester, and heartburn, nausea and vomiting in the first trimester. The description of sleep patterns during pregnancy has clinical relevance as sleep alterations in pregnancy are common.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8038885/"}

The sleep diary variable corresponding to the same one night of PSG was used to calculate the sleep discrepancy (diary minus PSG parameter) variables for total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. Regression analyses determined independent and interactive (with insomnia status) associations between cognition and sleep discrepancy, controlling for age, sex, apnea-hypopnea index, and sleep medication usage. Working memory interacted with insomnia status in associations with sleep discrepancy related to TST and sleep efficiency. In those with insomnia, worse working memory was associated with shorter self-reported TST (p = .008) and lower sleep efficiency (p = .04) than PSG measured. In older adults with insomnia, worse working memory may be a contributing factor to sleep discrepancy. Future investigations of underlying neurophysiological factors and consideration of other objective sleep measures (actigraphy) are warranted. Prospective findings may help determine whether sleep discrepancy is a potential marker of future cognitive decline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38679960/"}

The interviews were conducted using the Sleep-Eval knowledge-based system, a nonmonotonic, level 2 expert system with a causal reasoning mode. Questions investigated nightmares, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), definition, psychopathological traits, and included 12 other groups of information, including sociodemographics, sleep-wake schedule, daytime functioning, psychiatric and medical history, and drug intake. The data from 1,049 subjects suffering from insomnia were considered for this analysis. Bivariate analyses, logistic regression analysis using the method of indicator contrasts for the investigation of independent variables, and calculation of significant odds ratios were performed. Nightmares were reported in 18.3% of the surveyed insomniac population and were two times higher in women than in men. The following factors were found to be significantly associated with nightmares 1) sleep with many awakenings, 2) abnormally long sleep onset, 3) daytime memory impairment following poor nocturnal sleep, 4) daytime anxiety following poor nocturnal sleep, and 5) being a woman. There was a strong association between the report of nightmares in women and the presence of either a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or both disorders together. When the effects of major psychiatric disorders were controlled for, nightmares were significantly associated with being a woman, feeling depressed after a poor night's sleep, and complaining of a long sleep latency. Nightmares can lead to a negative conditioning toward sleep and to chronic sleep complaints. Considering the frequency of nightmares in an adult insomniac population and the significant relationship between nightmares and certain subgroups, nightmares should receive more attention in patients, especially women complaining of disrupted sleep, as high rates of psychiatric disorders were found in this specific group.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9381055/"}

Mixed model ANOVAs were performed with absolute and relative PSA data to assess differences between groups and nights. Over the course of the two nights, more absolute delta activity at F3, C3, and P3 was observed in ParI compared with PsyI suggesting deactivation of the left hemisphere in ParI and/or hyperactivation in PsyI. Further analysis on absolute PSA data revealed that differences between groups relate mostly to NREM. In REM, lower relative activity in slower frequency bands was found in ParI in comparison with GS and less relative theta activity was found in PsyI compared with GS implying higher activation in insomnia. In addition, between nights variability has been found in absolute powers of faster frequency bands (beta to omega).

Given that insufficient sleep and insomnia can be addressed via behavioral interventions, it is critical to understand the prevalence and correlates of these disorders among AI/AN individuals in order to elucidate the mechanisms associated with health disparities and provide guidance for subsequent treatment research and practice. We reviewed the available literature on insufficient sleep and insomnia in the AI/AN population. PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and ProQuest were searched between June 12<sup>th</sup> and October 28<sup>th</sup> of 2018. Prevalence of insufficient sleep ranged from 15% to 40%; insomnia prevalence ranged from 25% to 33%. Insufficient sleep was associated with unhealthy diet, low physical activity levels, higher BMI, worse self-reported health, increased risk for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, frequent mental distress, smoking, binge drinking, depression, and chronic pain. Insomnia was associated with depression, childhood abuse, PTSD, anxiety, alcohol use, low social support, and low trait-resilience levels. Research on evidence-based treatment and implementation practices targeting insufficient sleep and insomnia was lacking, and only one study described the development/validation of a measure of insufficient sleep among AI/AN people. There is a need for rigorous sleep research including testing and implementation of evidence-based treatment for insufficient sleep and insomnia in this population in an effort to help eliminate health disparities. We present recommendations for research and clinical practice based on the current review.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31360174/"}

Data were collected in 2013 and 2014. Four questions were asked on habitual time for sleeping and waking on weekdays and weekends, with 24 possible answers, one for each hour of the day. Analysis of inconsistencies considered the distribution of frequencies of answers as to sleeping and waking times, in addition to compatibility with the school shift. Sleep duration during the week and on weekends was obtained by the difference between sleeping and waking times, and differences of ≤ 4 or ≥ 14 hours were excluded. Mean total sleep duration in seven days was calculated by the formula (weekday sleep duration x 5 + weekend sleep duration x 2)/7. The following groups were created: original data (answers that did not require correction), corrected data (inconsistent, but amenable to correction), and excluded data (inconsistent, and for which there was no criterion for correction). Correction recovered inconsistent information for 5,988 adolescents, 8% of the 74,589 participants. A total of 7,937 (10.6%) answers were excluded. Adolescents whose information was corrected or excluded were younger, predominantly males, from public schools, and from the North of Brazil.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the acceptability and efficacy of this brief one-session intervention. Young adult undergraduates (N = 61) with elevated subclinical anxiety and insomnia were randomized to receive the anxiety-insomnia intervention or a physical health control condition. Participants were followed for 1 month and completed self-report measures. Analyses indicated that participants found the intervention acceptable, credible, and engaging.

Moreover, habituation of amygdale responses was observed only in HGS, but not in patients with ID who showed a mixed pattern of amygdala responses to the second presentation of the stimuli.

We included those aged 45-85 years, living in 1 of 10 Canadian provinces between 2012 and 2015 (at the baseline), recruited via 3 population-based sampling methods. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using questions adapted/modified from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. A panel of potential prodromal neurodegenerative markers including self-reported symptoms and objective gait motor, cognitive, and autonomic variables were assessed cross sectionally. We compared those who endorsed insomnia symptoms ≥ 3 times per week to controls, adjusting for age, sex, and education via logistic regression. Overall, 2,051/30,097 people screened positive for sleep-onset insomnia alone and 4,333 for sleep-maintenance insomnia alone, while 2,371 endorsed both subtypes. On objective gait tests, participants with sleep-onset insomnia, but not sleep-maintenance insomnia, had worse balance (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = [1.16, 1.52]) and slower gait speed (OR = 1.52 [1.34, 1.73]). Although participants with any insomnia subtype endorsed more motor symptoms, these were more severe in those with sleep-onset insomnia (OR onset vs maintenance = 1.13 [1.07, 1.18]). On objective cognitive tests, those with sleep-maintenance insomnia scored normally. However, participants with sleep-onset insomnia performed worse on tests of verbal fluency (OR = 1.24 [1.06, 1.43]), immediate memory (OR = 1.23 [1.08, 1.41]), and prospective memory task (OR = 1.29 [1.11, 1.50]).

Sixty-two elderly participants were randomly assigned to either BBT-I or self-monitoring and attention control (SMAC). Sleep was assessed by sleep diaries and actigraphy from baseline to posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up. Mixed models were used to examine changes in sleep variability (within-person standard deviations of weekly sleep parameters) and the hypothesized mediation and moderation effects.

The objective of this literature review was to identify PROs used in insomnia populations that purport to measure NRS, and to evaluate their psychometric characteristics. A comprehensive review of PRO instruments used in insomnia was conducted; instruments were reviewed for NRS content by two independent reviewers; a total of 26 instruments identified to contain NRS content were retained for further review. Of the 26 instruments reviewed, 23 contained at least one item evaluating subjective nighttime aspects of NRS; 17 contained at least one item evaluating daytime aspects of NRS. Only the Sleep Assessment Questionnaire contained a specific NRS domain score. However, little published evidence was available regarding measurement properties of the NRS domain in insomnia populations.

It is conceivable that sleep fragmentation by arousals, a key characteristic of insomnia disorder, could hamper the downregulation of distress. In this study, we sought further support for the idea that insomnia disorder may involve a lasting deficiency to downregulate emotional distress. We used functional MRI in insomnia disorder (n = 27) and normal sleepers (n = 30) to identify how brain activation differs between novel and relived self-conscious emotions. We evaluated whether brain activity elicited by reliving emotional memories from the distant past resembles the activity elicited by novel emotional experiences more in insomnia disorder than in normal sleepers. Limbic areas were activated during novel shameful experiences as compared to neutral experiences in both normal sleepers and insomnia disorder. In normal sleepers, reliving of shameful experiences from the past did not elicit a limbic response. In contrast, participants with insomnia disorder recruited overlapping parts of the limbic circuit, in particular the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, during both new and relived shameful experiences. The differential activity patterns with new and old emotions in normal sleepers suggest that reactivation of the long-term memory trace does not recruit the limbic circuit. The overlap of activations in insomnia disorder is in line with the hypothesis that the disorder involves a deficiency to dissociate the limbic circuit from the emotional memory trace. Moreover, the findings provide further support for a role of the anterior cingulate cortex in insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31135050/"}

Likewise, a wider standard deviation and lower mean of subjective total sleep time (sTST) during the lead-in period were independent predictors of greater improvement in mean sTST in the subsequent weeks, but predictability of change in sTST with these parameters appears lower than those for sSL (R(2)=0.13 and 0.44, respectively, in Week 2).

The EEG can be studied without any intervention (thus using the raw data) via either PSG or fine quantitative EEG analyses (power spectral analysis [PSA]), identifying EEG patterns as in the case of cyclic alternating patterns (CAPs) or by decorticating the EEG while scoring the different transient or phasic events (K-Complexes or sleep spindles). One can also act on the on-going EEG by delivering stimuli so to study their impact on cortical measures as in the case of event-related potential studies (ERPs).

Given that little is known about the impact of light pollution on sleep in wild animals, we tested how experimentally elevated light levels affected sleep behaviour of female songbirds rearing 10 day old chicks. Using a within-subject design, individual sleep behaviour was observed over three consecutive nights in great tits (Parus major), with females sleeping in a natural dark situation on the first and third night, whereas on the second night they were exposed to a light-emitting diode (1.6 lux). Artificial light in the nest box dramatically and significantly affected sleep behaviour, causing females to fall asleep later (95 min; while entry time was unaffected), wake up earlier (74 min) and sleep less (56%). Females spent a greater proportion of the night awake and the frequency of their sleep bouts decreased, while the length of their sleep bouts remained equal. Artificial light also increased begging of chicks at night, which may have contributed to the sleep disruption in females or vice versa. The night following the light treatment, females slept 25% more compared to the first night, which was mainly achieved by increasing the frequency of sleep bouts. Although there was a consistent pattern in how artificial light affected sleep, there was also large among-individual variation in how strongly females were affected. When comparing current results with a similar experiment during winter, our results highlight differences in effects between seasons and underscore the importance of studying light pollution during different seasons.

We describe a proposal for a multicenter, patient-assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. A total of 400 chronic insomnia patients will be allocated 1:1 to the intervention group (treatment with oral NMN 320 mg/day) or control group (treatment with oral placebo). All subjects are clinical chronic insomnia patients who meet all inclusion criteria. All subjects are treated by taking NMN or placebo. The primary outcome is the score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes are the score on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleeping Scale (ESS), the total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency, and REM sleep latency to assess sleep quality changes. Subjects are assessed at two time points: baseline and follow-up. The duration of the clinical trial is 60 days.

Insomnia in neurological disorders stems from a variety of factors, encompassing physical and neuropsychiatric factors, behavioral patterns, and disruptions in the biological clock and circadian rhythm. There are bidirectional connections between neurological disorders and insomnia. Insomnia in neurological disorders worsens symptoms, resulting in heightened depressive symptoms, elevated mortality rates, reduced quality of life, and intensified acute symptoms. Managing comorbid sleep disorders, especially in the presence of psychiatric comorbidities, is crucial. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line recommendation for insomnia management in neurological disorders. Other treatments are second-line strategies. Melatonin may demonstrate effectiveness in addressing insomnia, with soporific and chronobiotic effects. Furthermore, it has the potential to alleviate \"sundowning\" and behavioral disturbances, while generally being well-tolerated. Other treatment options that may be of interest include morning bright light therapy, sedative antidepressants, new orexin dual antagonists and levodopa specifically indicated for Parkinson's disease. Benzodiazepines and z-drugs can be used primarily during acute phases to prevent pharmacotolerance and minimize side effects. However, they should be avoided in patients with neurological disorders and not used in patients over 75 years old due to the risk of falls and confusion. In neurological disorders, insomnia has a profound impact on daytime functioning, making its management crucial. Effective treatment can result in improved outcomes, and additional research is necessary to investigate alternative therapeutic options and enhance patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37620177/"}
{"id": "25025617", "title": "Association between light exposure at night and insomnia in the general elderly population: the HEIJO-KYO cohort.", "text": "Chronic circadian misalignment between the internal and environmental rhythms, which is typically related to night-shift work and clock-gene variants, is associated with disruption of suprachiasmatic nucleus function and increased risk of insomnia. Under controlled laboratory conditions, light at night (LAN) suppresses melatonin secretion, delays the internal biological rhythm, and reduces sleepiness. Therefore, LAN exposure may cause circadian misalignment and insomnia, though it remains unclear in real-life situations whether LAN exposure is associated with insomnia. To evaluate an association between LAN exposure and sleep quality in home settings, we conducted a cross-sectional community-based study in 857 elderly individuals (mean age, 72.2 years). We evaluated bedroom light intensity using a light meter and subjectively and objectively measured sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and an actigraph, respectively, along with urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion. Compared with the lowest quartile group of LAN intensity, the highest quartile group revealed a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) for subjective insomnia in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, daytime physical activity, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, bedtime, rising time, and day length (adjusted OR, 1.61, 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.45, p=0.029). In addition, higher OR for subjective insomnia was significantly associated with the increase in quartiles of LAN intensity (ptrend=0.043). Consistently, we observed significant association trends between the increase in quartiles of LAN intensity and poorer actigraphic sleep quality, including decreased sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep-onset latency, increased wake-after-sleep onset, shortened total sleep time, and delayed sleep-mid time in multivariate models adjusted for the covariates mentioned above (all ptrend<0.001). In conclusion, we demonstrated that LAN exposure in home settings is significantly associated with both subjectively and objectively measured sleep quality in a community-based elderly population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25025617/"}

Six months post-CBT-I treatment, individuals with insomnia and normal sleep duration ≥6 h fared significantly better on clinical improvement milestones than did those with insomnia and short sleep duration <6 h. Specifically, individuals with insomnia and normal sleep duration had significantly higher insomnia remission (ISQ < 36.5; χ2[1, N = 60] = 44.72, p < .0001), more normative sleep efficiency (SE) on actigraphy (SE > 80%; χ2[1, N = 60] = 21, p < .0001), normal levels of middle of the night wake after sleep onset (MWASO) <31 minutes (χ2[1, N = 60] = 37.85, p < .0001), and a >50% decline in MWASO (χ2[1, N = 60] = 60, p < .0001) compared to individuals with insomnia and short sleep duration.

Functional connectivity was analyzed using coherence (COH) across multiple frequency bands. The relationships between COH metrics and self-reported emotional measures and the potential mediation effects were investigated. The ID group revealed sleep stage-specific alterations in brain network functional connectivity, with enhanced alpha connectivity being observed in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increased delta connectivity in both phasic and tonic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. Increased alpha band connectivity in anterior-posterior networks during wakefulness was associated with emotional regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses showed that alpha and delta band connectivity between frontal-occipital regions mediated the relationship between insomnia and emotional dysregulation. These findings reveal the pattern of functional connectivity is differently changed in insomnia disorder across wakefulness and sleep states, and such connectivities play a mediation rolein relationship between chronic sleep disruption and emotional regulation in insomnia disorder.

These inconsistencies may be due to methodological issues related to the affective valence of the sleep-related stimuli. Thus, individuals may attend differentially to sleep-related stimuli not because of their 'sleep' properties, but their negativity. The current study addresses this by controlling the affective valence of sleep-related words. A total of 107 participants [mean age = 33.22 years, standard deviation (SD) = 12.31 years; 61.7% female] were recruited during an evening event at the Newcastle Science Festival. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a computerized EST containing 20 non-affective sleep-related, 20 neutral and 20 negatively valenced threat words. Good and poor sleepers were categorized using the PSQI. There were no significant differences between groups on response latency to sleep-related words (t(105) = -0.30, P = 0.76). However, the interaction between good versus poor sleepers and word-type on response latency was significant (F(2,210) = 3.06, P < 0.05). Poor sleepers took longer to respond to sleep-related words (mean = 723.35, SD = 172.55) compared to threat words (mean = 694.63, SD = 162.17) than good sleepers (mean = 713.20, SD = 166.32; and mean = 716.65, SD = 181.14). The results demonstrate the presence of an attention bias towards sleep-related stimuli compared to threat stimuli in poor sleepers. Accordingly, poor sleepers may be consumed by stimuli relevant to their specific difficulties, as well as being more highly attuned to negative cues that signal anxious states. Thus, the present research suggests that there are two opposing forces at play: one which facilitates performance (non-specific threats) and one which hinders performance (personally relevant threats).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23398166/"}

This study examined the efficacy of a single session of CBT-I, with an accompanying self-help pamphlet, for individuals with acute insomnia. A pragmatic parallel group randomized controlled trial. Community. Forty adults (mean age 32.9 ± 13.72 y) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defined insomnia disorder, except a self-reported duration of less than 3 mo (i.e., acute insomnia), who reported no previous exposure to CBT-I and were not currently taking medication for sleep. A single 60- to 70-min session of CBT-I (n = 20), with an accompanying self-help pamphlet, or wait list control group (n = 20). All subjects were offered a full individual course of CBT-I on completion of the study, regardless of group allocation. Subjects completed sleep diaries and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) pretreatment and 1 mo following treatment. There were no between-group differences on baseline ISI scores or subjective sleep continuity. The intervention group reported significantly lower ISI scores than controls (t(38) 2.24, P < 0.05) at follow-up. Further, using proposed ISI scores for identifying insomnia caseness (i.e., ≥ 10), 60% of those in the CBT-I group had remitted by 1 mo compared to 15% of those in the control group. This single session of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is sufficiently efficacious for a significant proportion of those with acute insomnia. The results are discussed in terms of integrating this brief form of CBT-I into the \"stepped care\" model of insomnia.

The study sample consisted of 2,391 young adults aged 20-39 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008. HRQOL was assessed using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's HRQOL-4 scale. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the sleep-HRQOL associations. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine whether the associations varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Approximately 35.6 % of young adults slept <7 h, 41.9 % had insomnia, 4.4 % had sleep disorder, and 8.5 % had sleep apnea. More females had insomnia than males (48.6 vs. 35.9 %, P < 0.001). US-born young adults had more sleep disturbances than their foreign-born counterparts. Compared with those sleeping 7-8 h, the adjusted odds ratio of poor general health was 1.60 (95 % confidence interval, 1.08-2.35) for individuals sleeping 6-7 h and 1.88 (1.23-2.86) for those sleeping <6 h. Similar results were found for low mental HRQOL and overall HRQOL. Insomnia, long sleep latency, troubling falling asleep, daytime sleepiness, and frequent sleeping pill use were significantly associated with low mental HRQOL and overall HRQOL. The associations between sleep disturbances and low HRQOL varied little by sex, race/ethnicity, and country of birth. Sleep disturbances are common among US young adults and are significantly associated with low HRQOL. Objective measures of sleep are warranted to confirm our findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23860850/"}

In this study, the authors report the positive preliminary results of insomnia treatment using pillows with embedded magnets, magnetic insoles and TriPhase bracelets. The analysis is based on objective actigraphic and polysomnographic data. A theory of accelerated transition from wakefulness to sleep is proposed to explain the process of insomnia relief through low-strength static magnetic fields.

We must better understand how insomnia develops in cancer patients and explore the main contributors to its chronicity so that insomnia management protocols can be integrated more effectively within cancer care. This study monitors the etiology of insomnia in breast cancer patients and identifies risk factors for its persistence. One hundred seventy-three females with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer were tracked from diagnosis for 12 months. Participants completed monthly sleep assessments using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and 3 monthly health-related quality-of-life assessments using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Breast (EORTC QLQ-C30-BR23) scale. Clinical data on disease status and treatment regimens were also assessed. Prior to diagnosis, 25% of participants reported sleep disturbance, including 8% with insomnia syndrome (IS). Prevalence increased at cancer diagnosis to 46% (18% IS) and remained stable thereafter at around 50% (21% IS). We also explored sleep status transitions. The most common pattern was to remain a good sleeper (34%-49%) or to persist with insomnia (23%-46%). Seventy-seven percent of good sleepers developed insomnia during the 12-month period and 54% went into insomnia remission. Chemotherapy (odds ratio = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.29, p < .001) and pre-diagnosis ISI scores (odds ratio = 1.13/unit increase in pre-diagnosis sleep score, 95% CI 1.05-1.21, p = .001) were identified as the main risk factors for persistent insomnia. These data advance our understanding of insomnia etiology in cancer patients and help identify those who should be prioritized for insomnia management protocols.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30521041/"}

Investigating mechanisms underlying this predilection for pharmacotherapy may uncover strategies to decrease reliance on sleep aids. The objective of this study was to determine how time monitoring behavior (TMB; clock-watching) and associated frustration may interact with insomnia symptoms to drive the use of sleep aids. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Patients (N = 4,886) presenting for care at a community-based, private sleep medical center between May 2003 and October 2013 completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Time Monitoring Behavior-10 (TMB-10) and reported their frequency of sleep medication use (OTC and prescription, separately). Mediation analyses examined how clock-watching and related frustration could be associated with insomnia symptoms and medication use. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The relationship between TMB and sleep medication use was significantly explained by ISI (<i>P</i> < .05), in that TMB (especially related frustration) appears to aggravate insomnia, which in turn leads to sleep aid use. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, the relationship between ISI and sleep medication use was explained by TMB, in that ISI may lead to increased TMB, which may in turn lead to sleep aid use. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> TMB and the associated frustration it engenders may perpetuate a negative cycle of insomnia and sleep aid use. Future longitudinal and interventional research is necessary to examine the developmental course of these clinical symptoms and behaviors and to test whether decreasing frustration by limiting TMB reduces the proclivity for pharmacotherapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37227396/"}

To date, little is known about insomnia patients' treatment experiences or how they access and engage with the available health care resources. This study sought to capture the help-seeking experiences and behavioral patterns of patients with insomnia who are seeking or receiving specialist care. A purposive sample of 26 insomnia patients from specialist sleep and mental health clinics located in metropolitan New South Wales, Australia was recruited. Participants completed a brief questionnaire, followed by an in-depth, semi-structured interview. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using framework analysis. Three key themes emerged from the data: patients' sleep beliefs, treatment beliefs, and accessing specialized care. The findings show that daytime symptoms arising from insomnia serve as important illness cues for patients to seek medical help. In addition, participants' treatment pathways highlight factors that prevent the widespread use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), including limited awareness about CBT-I, tentative referral mechanisms, limited service providers, and the high cost of CBT-I.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23514322/"}
{"id": "16840413", "title": "Recent developments in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia.", "text": "Sleep/wake complaints, and specifically insomnia, are some of the more common problems encountered in the outpatient setting. Despite its prevalence, few clinicians are experts at diagnosing and treating this entity. Additionally, diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is a time-intensive process (often the initial interview takes at least 1 h, depending on the complexity of the insomnia). With a conservative estimate of the annual cost of insomnia between dollar 92.5 and dollar 107.5 billion dollars, it is becoming clear that insomnia has significant medical and public health implications. A problem that has hampered insomnia research is the lack of a standard definition of insomnia for use in research, as well as guidelines for assessment. In recent years, there have been important advances in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia with efforts to establish greater consensus in how to define and measure insomnia. Cognitive behavioral and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective treatment approaches. Insomnia is a complex entity, often multifactorial in its etiology; and as research and clinical guidelines are established and validated (leading to better data interpretation), continued enhancement of our understanding of this disorder is expected.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16840413/"}

However, the biological mechanisms underpinning these associations remain largely unclear. We assessed the possible involvement of the circulating immune system by determining the associations between sleep traits and white blood cell counts using multivariable-adjusted linear regression and Mendelian randomization. Cross-sectional multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses were done using participants within the normal range of total white blood cell counts (>4.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> and <11.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/μL) from UK Biobank. For the sleep traits, we examined (short and long) sleep duration, chronotype, insomnia symptoms and daytime dozing. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were done using instruments for sleep traits derived from European-ancestry participants from UK Biobank (over 410,000 participants) and using SNP-outcome data derived from European-ancestry participants from the Blood Cell Consortium (N = 563,946) to which no data from UK Biobank contributed. Using data from 357,656 participants (mean [standard deviation] age: 56.5 [8.1] years, and 44.4% men), we did not find evidence that disturbances in any of the studied sleep traits were associated with differences in blood cell counts (total, lymphocytes, neutrophiles, eosinophiles and basophiles). Also, we did not find associations between disturbances in any of the studied sleep traits and white blood cell counts using Mendelian Randomization. Based on the results from two different methodologies, disturbances in habitual sleep are unlikely to cause changes in blood cell counts and thereby differences in blood cell counts are unlikely to be underlying the observed sleep-disease associations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38429948/"}

Although meta-analyses have examined primary insomnia, less is known about the comparative efficacy of CBT-I on comorbid insomnia. To examine the efficacy of CBT-I for insomnia comorbid with psychiatric and/or medical conditions for (1) remission from insomnia; (2) self-reported sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, and subjective sleep quality; and (3) comorbid symptoms. A systematic search was conducted on June 2, 2014, through PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and manual searches. Search terms included (1) CBT-I or CBT or cognitive behavioral [and its variations] or behavioral therapy [and its variations] or behavioral sleep medicine or stimulus control or sleep restriction or relaxation therapy or relaxation training or progressive muscle relaxation or paradoxical intention; and (2) insomnia or sleep disturbance. Studies were included if they were randomized clinical trials with at least one CBT-I arm and had an adult population meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia as well as a concomitant condition. Inclusion in final analyses (37 studies) was based on consensus between 3 authors' independent screenings. Data were independently extracted by 2 authors and pooled using a random-effects model. Study quality was independently evaluated by 2 authors using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. A priori main outcomes (ie, clinical sleep and comorbid outcomes) were derived from sleep diary and other self-report measures. At posttreatment evaluation, 36.0% of patients who received CBT-I were in remission from insomnia compared with 16.9% of those in control or comparison conditions (pooled odds ratio, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.30-4.68; P < .001). Pretreatment and posttreatment controlled effect sizes were medium to large for most sleep parameters (sleep efficiency: Hedges g = 0.91 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.08]; sleep onset latency: Hedges g = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00]; wake after sleep onset: Hedges g = 0.68; sleep quality: Hedges g = 0.84; all P < .001), except total sleep time. Comorbid outcomes yielded a small effect size (Hedges g = 0.39 [95% CI, 0.60-0.98]; P < .001); improvements were greater in psychiatric than in medical populations (Hedges g = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.09-0.30]; χ2 test for interaction = 12.30; P < .001). Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is efficacious for improving insomnia symptoms and sleep parameters for patients with comorbid insomnia. A small to medium positive effect was found across comorbid outcomes, with larger effects on psychiatric conditions compared with medical conditions. Large-scale studies with more rigorous designs to reduce detection and performance bias are needed to improve the quality of the evidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26147487/"}

However, research rarely extends beyond the postpartum period. This study investigated the multifaceted relationship between child sleep and maternal depression in early motherhood. A confidential survey assessed child sleep problems, maternal sleep duration, parental self-efficacy and depressive symptoms in 477 Australian mothers of children aged 3 months to 5 years. We found no relationship between child age and maternal depression, supporting our decision to look beyond postpartum depression. Robust bootstrapped mediation modelling tested the hypothesis that both maternal sleep duration and parental self-efficacy would mediate child sleep problems as predictors of maternal depression. After controlling for child age, results showed a significant parallel mediation effect, demonstrating that maternal sleep duration and parental self-efficacy both mediate the relationship between child sleep problems on maternal depression. While the total effect of child sleep problems on maternal depression was statistically significant, after partialling out the effects of other variables, child sleep problems no longer predicted maternal depression. Akaike information criterion analyses supported the full model, with both mediators explaining meaningful variance in maternal depression. This study expands our knowledge beyond the postpartum period, and divulges the disparate effects of sleep deprivation and parental self-efficacy on the relationship between child sleep and depression in early motherhood. Maternal sleep duration and self-efficacy are modifiable risk factors of maternal depression, indicating possible efficacious treatments. Parental self-efficacy stands out as a direction for clinical practice and further psychobiological study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483064/"}

We systematically searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO for relevant studies. Search period was set to inception of these databases to March 2014. Studies were included if they were: original randomized controlled trials (RCTs); testing a nonpharmacological intervention; that targets sleep; in adults; with painful health conditions; that has a control group; includes a measure of sleep quality; and at least one other health and well-being outcome. Means and standard deviations of sleep quality, pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, physical and psychological functioning were extracted for the sleep treatment and control groups at baseline, posttreatment and final follow-up. Methodological details concerning the treatment, participants, and study design were abstracted to guide heterogeneity and subgroup analyses. Eleven RCTs involving 1,066 participants (mean age 45-61 years) met the criteria for the meta-analysis. There was no systematic evidence of publication bias. Nonpharmacological sleep treatments in chronic pain patients were associated with a large improvement in sleep quality (standardized mean difference = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval [0.42, 1.13]; P < 0.001), small reduction in pain (0.18 [0, 0.36] P < 0.05), and moderate improvement in fatigue (0.38 [0.08, 0.69]; P < 0.01) at posttreatment.

Sleep initiation is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and endogenous melatonin, both of which are influenced by environmental light. Exposure to evening light is hypothesized to cause circadian phase delay and melatonin suppression before bedtime, resulting in circadian misalignment and sleep-onset insomnia; however, whether exposure to evening light disturbs sleep initiation in home settings remains unclear. In this longitudinal analysis of 192 elderly individuals (mean age: 69.9 years), we measured evening light exposure and sleep-onset latency for 4 days using a wrist actigraph incorporating a light meter and an accelerometer. Mixed-effect linear regression analysis for repeated measurements was used to evaluate the effect of evening light exposure on subsequent sleep-onset latency. The median intensity of evening light exposure and the median sleep-onset latency were 27.3 lux (interquartile range, 17.9-43.4) and 17 min (interquartile range, 7-33), respectively. Univariate models showed significant associations between sleep-onset latency and age, gender, daytime physical activity, in-bed time, day length and average intensity of evening and nighttime light exposures. In a multivariate model, log-transformed average intensity of evening light exposure was significantly associated with log-transformed sleep-onset latency independent of the former potential confounding factors (regression coefficient, 0.133; 95% CI, 0.020-0.247; p = 0.021). Day length and nighttime light exposure were also significantly associated with log-transformed sleep-onset latency (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Pre-treatment and post-treatment self-report measures of sleep were compared with those obtained from home-based polysomnography (PSG) in 60 adults (mean age = 69.17; 42 women) with comorbid insomnia. The self-report data were published previously in a randomized controlled trial demonstrating the efficacy of CBT-I compared with a placebo treatment. Self-report measures significantly underestimated sleep at pre-treatment and CBT-I led to a correction in this discrepancy. There were no significant changes in PSG after CBT-I. Path analysis showed that an increase in an objective proxy measure of sleep quality (i.e., decreased stage N1 sleep) after CBT-I was significantly related to improvements in self-report of sleep, with full mediation by reductions in discrepancy. This is the first CBT-I outcome study to analyze discrepancy changes and demonstrate that these changes account for a significant portion of self-report outcome. In addition, improved sleep quality as measured by a decrease in percentage of stage N1 sleep following treatment may be one mechanism that explains why sleep estimation is more accurate following CBT-I.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23280680/"}
{"id": "36949314", "title": "Sleep Immune Cross Talk and Insomnia.", "text": "Sleep and immunity have bidirectional relationships. In this chapter, we review the links between sleep and immunity, focusing on immune changes occurring in the insomnia disorder. During physiological sleep, there is a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α) and a decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). Examinations of ratios of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines allow to identify rather a pro-inflammatory activity at the beginning of the night and confirm then anti-inflammatory during the second part of the night. Immune cells, as NK-cells, decrease in the blood, due to their migration to secondary lymphoid organs, but their activity increases. Inversely, a short sleep duration appears associated with increased inflammatory processes and increased risk of infection.Only few studies have investigated changes in immunity in patients with insomnia disorder. These studies suggest that insomnia disorder is related to deregulation of the immune system, with an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and change in rate of secretion and a decrease in the level of lymphocyte. Insomnia treatments, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I), seems to have a restorative effect not only on sleep, but also on the associated inflammation. Melatonin also seems to reduce inflammation in patients suffering from insomnia disorder.More studies are necessary to better understand the pathophysiology of changes in immune system in patients suffering from insomnia disorders and their clinical implications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36949314/"}

The interest in complementary and alternative medicines for treating or preventing insomnia has increased recently. Centuries-old herbal treatments, popular for their safety and effectiveness, include valerian, passionflower, lemon balm, lavender, and Californian poppy. These herbal medicines have been shown to reduce sleep latency and increase subjective and objective measures of sleep quality. Research into their molecular components revealed that their sedative and sleep-promoting properties rely on interactions with various neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a major role in controlling different vigilance states. GABA receptors are the targets of many pharmacological treatments for insomnia, such as benzodiazepines. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of studies assessing the mechanisms of action of various herbal medicines on different subtypes of GABA receptors in the context of sleep control. Currently available evidence suggests that herbal extracts may exert some of their hypnotic and anxiolytic activity through interacting with GABA receptors and modulating GABAergic signaling in the brain, but their mechanism of action in the treatment of insomnia is not completely understood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561990/"}

OX2R is particularly important for promoting arousal and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and has been linked to sleep disorders such as insomnia and narcolepsy. Although OX2R antagonists like suvorexant have shown therapeutic promise, they are often associated with side effects including cognitive impairment and dependence, highlighting the need for safer alternatives. This study employed an <i>in-silico</i> approach to identify natural OX2R antagonists from Valeriana species. Phytochemicals were screened based on molecular docking and favourable ADME/T profiles. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and post-MD analysis confirmed stable binding of hesperidine and valerosidate to OX2R. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed minimal conformational variability while gibbs free energy landscape (FEL) analysis and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations further supported the strong binding of hesperidine and valerosidate to OX2R, comparable to suvorexant.

The polysomnography data of thirty-one patients (61% female, between 20 and 79 years of age) who were referred for clinical sleep assessment was collated with subjective measures of symptoms linked to vestibular problems (rated on the Situational Characteristics Questionnaire), as well as fatigue, anxiety and depression symptoms.

Feature values were segregated according to clinical status of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, insomnia plus OSA, no clinical sleep disorder, and demographics (age, gender, and race). Results from SHHS visit2 were compared with SHHS1 results. All features varied widely among clinical groups and demographics. Relative to participants with no sleep disorder, wake ORP was higher in participants reporting insomnia symptoms and lower in those with OSA (p < 0.0001 for both), reflecting opposite changes in sleep pressure, while NREM ORP was higher in both insomnia and OSA (p<0.0001), reflecting lighter sleep in both groups. There were significant associations with age, gender, and race. EEG Power, and REM ORP were highly reproducible across the two studies (ICC > 0.75). The reported results serve as bases for interpreting studies that utilize novel sleep EEG biomarkers and identify characteristic EEG changes that vary with age, gender and may help distinguish insomnia from OSA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34156473/"}

From a randomly selected sample from the general population (n=3600), 1936 participants filled out a baseline and 1-year follow-up survey. Logistic regressions were used to investigate whether arousal, distress, and beliefs were related to sleep status (insomnia: n=116; poor sleep: n=222; normal sleep: n=529; good sleep: n=234) over 1 year. Cluster analysis was employed to assess whether it was possible to classify the participants based on their profiles of psychological functioning. The results showed that beliefs in the long-term negative consequences of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and arousal were significantly related to the maintenance of insomnia (18-72% of the variance). Of the individuals with persistent insomnia, 91% belonged to a cluster characterized by high scores on sleep-related beliefs, anxiety, depression, and arousal, and 9% to a cluster defined by low scores on the mechanisms. This study shows that sleep-related beliefs, anxiety, depression, and arousal are related to the maintenance of persistent insomnia, but also that these mechanisms often co-occur in individuals with insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16759637/"}

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effectively reduces concurrent symptoms of insomnia and depression and can be delivered digitally (dCBT-I); however, it remains unclear whether treating insomnia leads to sustained reduction and prevention of depression. This randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of dCBT-I in reducing and preventing depression over a 1-year follow-up period. Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to receive dCBT-I or an attentional control. The follow-up sample included 358 patients in the dCBT-I condition and 300 patients in the online sleep education condition. The primary outcome measure was relative rate ratios for depression at 1-year follow-up. Insomnia responses to treatment were also tested as predictors of incident depression at the 1-year follow-up. At 1-year follow-up, depression severity continued to be significantly lower in the dCBT-I condition relative to control. In addition, the number of individuals who reported no depression at 1-year follow-up was 51% higher in the dCBT-I condition relative to control. In those with minimal to no depression at baseline, the incident rate of moderate-to-severe depression at 1-year follow-up was reduced by half in the dCBT-I condition relative to the control condition. dCBT-I showed robust effects as an intervention that prevents depression. Future research should examine dose-response requirements and further characterize mechanisms of action of dCBT-I for depression prevention.

To compare the Emotional Freedom Techniques-Insomnia (EFT-I) and Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE) group therapy as two treatments for insomnia in a geriatric population when delivered, and their effects on sleep quality, depression, and life satisfaction. This open-label randomized controlled trial study was conducted at El-Abbasia Mental Hospital and Osana family wellness elderly nursing home at Maadi, Cairo. It included 60 elderly patients suffering insomnia sleep problems randomized into two equal groups: one group received a Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE) intervention, the other had a form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) adapted for use with insomnia (EFT-I). A self-administered questionnaire with tools for sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), depression, and life satisfaction was used to collect data. The fieldwork was from January to March 2021. The two groups had equal median age (70 years), and almost similar gender and place of residence distribution. After the intervention, 73.3% of the EFT group had good sleep quality, compared to 100.0% in the SHE group (P = 0.005); the median score of depression (3.00) was higher in the EFT group compared with 0.00 in the SHE group (P < 0.001); as for life satisfaction, the difference was not statistically significant. The multivariate analyses identified the study intervention as the main statistically significant negative predictor of PSQI and depression scores, and a positive predictor of life satisfaction. Being in the SHE group was a negative predictor of PSQI and depression scores. Both SHE and EFT approaches are beneficial for elderly patients' sleep quality, with SHE being more effective in ameliorating sleep.

Participants were followed for a median of 11.4 years (Q1-Q3, 8.8-12.4 years) until death or last contact. The primary exposure was insomnia or poor sleep with short sleep defined as follows: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty returning to sleep, early morning awakenings, or sleeping pill use, 16-30 nights per month; and total sleep of <6 hr on PSG. We used proportional hazard models to estimate the association between insomnia or poor sleep with short sleep and CVD, as well as all-cause mortality. Among 4994 participants (mean age: 64.0 ± 11.1 years), 14.1 per cent reported insomnia or poor sleep, of which 50.3 per cent slept <6 hr.

Large treatment effects were also found for the sleep diary estimates (except for total sleep time), and anxiety and depression measures (for depression only in the face-to-face condition). Face-to-face treatment yielded a statistically larger treatment effect (Cohen d = 0.9) on insomnia severity than the online condition at all time points. In addition, a moderate differential effect size favoring face-to-face treatment emerged at the 3- and 6-mo follow-up on all sleep diary estimates.

It is defined as a persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or a report of nonrestorative sleep, accompanied by related daytime impairment. Insomnia is a significant public health problem because of its high prevalence and management challenges. There is increasing evidence of a strong association between insomnia and various medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Diagnosis of insomnia and treatment planning rely on a thorough sleep history to address contributing and precipitating factors as well as maladaptive behaviors resulting in poor sleep. Using a sleep diary or sleep log is more accurate than patient recall to determine sleep patterns. A sleep study is not routinely indicated for evaluation of insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the mainstay of treatment and is a safe and effective approach. The key challenge of CBT-I is the lack of clinicians to implement it. The newer generation nonbenzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon) are used as first-line pharmacotherapy for chronic insomnia. Newer drugs active on targets other than the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor are now available, but clear treatment guidelines are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28845958/"}

Individuals with insomnia may present symptoms of hyperarousal. Cancer survivors with insomnia and trait hyperarousal may require different clinical treatments than patients with insomnia without trait hyperarousal.

The sample included 160 individuals with previous cancer diagnoses who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder. Measures were collected with cross-sectional batteries of questionnaires, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Hyperarousal Scale (HAS). This study is based on baseline data collected in a randomized clinical trial comparing CBT-I to acupuncture for cancer survivors with insomnia (Garland, Gehrman, Barg, Xie, & Mao, 2016). Hyperarousal was positively associated with insomnia (ISI total score) in bivariate correlations (r = .350, p < .01) and linear regressions (F = 22.06, p < .001). In bivariate correlations, hyperarousal was related to perceptions about the consequences of disturbed sleep rather than reported sleep patterns. For example, hyperarousal was positively related to reported satisfaction (r = .159, p < .05) and worry about sleep (r = .415, p < .01), but not to falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early. In regressions, younger age, insomnia duration, and worry about sleep were uniquely associated with hyperarousal when adjusting for insomnia (B = 0.200, B = 0.177, B = -0.182, p < .05). Hyperarousal is associated with psychological appraisal of insomnia rather than reported sleep pattern. Younger age and longer duration of insomnia are associated with trait hyperarousal.

The sample consisted of 19 patients (mean age 43.3+/-10.6 years) with primary insomnia (DSM-IV), who had taken BZDs nightly, for 7.1+/-5.4 years. The control group was composed of 18 healthy individuals (mean age 37+/-8 years). Sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of the patients was analyzed with period amplitude analysis (PAA) and associated algorithms, during chronic BZD use (Night 1), and after 15 days of a valerian placebo trial (initiated after washout of BZD, Night 2). Sleep of control subjects was monitored in parallel. Valerian subjects reported significantly better subjective sleep quality than placebo ones, after BZD withdrawal, despite the presence of a few side effects. However, some of the differences found in sleep structure between Night 1 and Night 2 in both the valerian and placebo groups may be due to the sleep recovery process after BZD washout. Example of this are: the decrease in Sleep Stage 2 and in sigma count; the increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and delta count, which were found to be altered by BZD ingestion. There was a significant decrease in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) in valerian subjects when compared to placebo subjects; results were similar to normal controls. Nonetheless, valerian-treated patients also presented longer sleep latency and increased alpha count in SWS than control subjects. The decrease in WASO associated with the mild anxiolytic effect of valerian appeared to be the major contributor to subjective sleep quality improvement found after 2-week of treatment in insomniacs who had withdrawn from BDZs. Despite subjective improvement, sleep data showed that valerian did not produce faster sleep onset; the increase in alpha count compared with normal controls may point to residual hyperarousabilty, which is known to play a role in insomnia. Nonetheless, we lack data on the extent to which a sedative drug can improve alpha sleep EEG.

The results show that with low and medium sleep reactivity to stress, the more night shifts a person works per month, the more severe insomnia symptoms they will report. With high sleep reactivity to stress even a low number of night shifts per month will lead to a deterioration of sleep.

To address this issue, the pre-post effects of placebos on objective and subjective measures (i.e., polysomnography [PSG] and sleep diaries) were evaluated meta-analytically.

PubMed searches, 1967-2016, yielded 329 possible articles, 17 of which met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present analysis (including 879 subjects with PSG data, 1,209 subjects with diary data, and six studies with both PSG and sleep diary data). Average change and weighted effect sizes (ESs) were computed via modeling for sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Pre-to-post change on PSG measures were: SL -13.7 min., ES = -0.37; WASO -14.3 min., ES = -0.36; and TST 29.8 min., ES = 0.50.

The modeled average objective subjective difference per sleep continuity measure was less than 5 minutes. The modeled average objective subjective difference per sleep continuity measure (in effect sizes) was less than 0.17. The observed outcomes of this analysis suggest that placebos produce comparable effects on objective and subjective measures of sleep continuity. Thus, objective measures do not appear to protect against placebo responses. This being the case and given the importance of the subjective experience of illness severity and recovery, such data suggests that prospectively sampled sleep continuity data (sleep diaries) may be the optimal data for clinical trials, particularly when only one measure is possible.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36094215/"}

A prerequisite for understanding the neurocognitive consequences of primary insomnia is to establish task paradigms that robustly differentiate insomniacs from well-sleeping subjects. We hypothesized that the decline in performance that typically occurs with an increasing cognitive demand would provide a more sensitive measure than performance on a single task version. The hypothesis was tested, first, by assessing the performance on two vigilance tasks with different cognitive demands in 25 elderly patients with primary insomnia and 13 healthy well-sleeping age-matched subjects. Secondly, we investigated the performance response to sleep therapy using a waiting-list controlled design. Sleep therapy consisted of a multi-component intervention including sleep restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, bright-light therapy, structured physical activity and body temperature manipulations. The results show that insomniacs differed markedly from controls in their reaction times across tasks with different cognitive demands: patients responded faster on the 'simple' vigilance task, yet slower on the 'complex' vigilance task. Sleep therapy effectively restored normal performance: patients became significantly slower on the 'simple' task and faster on the 'complex' task, returning to the performance levels of control subjects. These findings indicate that the performance decline associated with increasing cognitive demands is possibly the first sensitive and robust measure of the neurocognitive sequelae of insomnia.

Sleep disorder diagnosis heavily depends on accurately classifying sleep stages. Traditionally, this classification has been performed manually by trained sleep technologists that visually inspect polysomnography records. However, in order to mitigate the labor-intensive nature of this process, automated approaches have been developed. These automated methods aim to streamline and facilitate sleep stage classification. This study aims to classify sleep stages in a dataset comprising subjects with insomnia, PLM, and sleep apnea. The dataset consists of PSG recordings from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of the national sleep research resource (NSRR), including 2056 subjects. Among these subjects, 130 have insomnia, 39 suffer from PLM, 156 have sleep apnea, and the remaining 1731 are classified as good sleepers. This study proposes an automated computerized technique to classify sleep stages, developing a machine-learning model with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) capabilities using wavelet-based Hjorth parameters. An optimal biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (BOWFB) has been employed to extract subbands (SBs) from 30 seconds of electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs. Three EEG channels, namely: Fz_Cz, Cz_Oz, and C4_M1, are employed to yield an optimum outcome. The Hjorth parameters extracted from SBs were then fed to different machine learning algorithms. To gain an understanding of the model, in this study, we used SHAP (Shapley Additive explanations) method. For subjects suffering from the aforementioned diseases, the model utilized features derived from all channels and employed an ensembled bagged trees (EnBT) classifier. The highest accuracy of 86.8%, 87.3%, 85.0%, 84.5%, and 83.8% is obtained for the insomniac, PLM, apniac, good sleepers and complete datasets, respectively. Using these techniques and datasets, the study aims to enhance sleep stage classification accuracy and improve understanding of sleep disorders such as insomnia, PLM, and sleep apnea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39160031/"}

Switching attention and working memory were significantly worse in insomnia patients than controls, while no differences were found for simple or complex sustained attention tasks. Poorer sustained attention in the control, but not the insomnia group, was significantly associated with increased subjective sleepiness. In insomnia patients, poorer sustained attention performance was associated with reduced health-related quality of life and increased insomnia severity. We found that insomnia patients exhibit deficits in higher level neurobehavioral functioning, but not in basic attention.

Resulting from a complex interplay of genetic, biological, social, and environmental factors, it affects disturbances in everyday functioning in many aspects of life. The aim of the study was to analyze the factors related to the occurrence of insomnia among high school students. The study was conducted among 2364 high school students aged between 14 and 19 years old (the average age 17.92 ± 1.10), of which there were 2068 girls and 295 boys. Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and authorial demographic data questionnaire involved questions about physical activity during the day, smoking, frequency of upper respiratory tract infections, problems with concentration and memory, school achievements, and the use of mobile devices at bedtime were used to assess examined parameters. The scale and questionnaires were shared on-line via social media. Analyzing the results obtained in the study group, the average score of 8.42 ± 4.16 was obtained in the AIS, which allows the assessment of sleep disorders bordering on normal. After division into groups of girls and boys, 8.38 ± 4.56 points were obtained, respectively for girls and 8.43 ± 4.27pts. for boys - the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, statistically significant differences were not found when dividing the groups into the one in which adolescents used the phone just before bedtime and the one that did not use it. The act of sleeping alone or with another person in the room also did not differentiate the groups statistically, as well as the place of residence. Statistically significant worse results in the AIS scale were obtained by people who declared worse physical activity during the day and smoking cigarettes, as well as those who reported more frequent problems with concentration and memory, had worse school performance and suffered from upper respiratory infections more often. 1). Sleep disorders may be related to factors such as smoking cigarettes or lack of physical activity, as well as difficulties in concentrating attention, memory disorders or worse academic performance and a tendency to contract upper respiratory tract infections. 2). Elimination of factors that may adversely affect the quality of sleep is particularly important in the group of adolescents, in whom the developing structures of the central nervous system may be particularly sensitive to deficiencies in this area. 3).

We determined the developmental trajectories of insomnia symptoms, their evolution into adult insomnia, and the role of objective sleep duration in the transition to adulthood. A total of 502 children (median 9 years old, 71.7% response rate) were studied 7.4 years later as adolescents (median 16 years old) and 15 years later as adults (median 24 years old). Insomnia symptoms were ascertained as moderate-to-severe difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep via parent- or self reports at all 3 time points, adult insomnia via self-report in young adulthood, and objective short-sleep duration via polysomnography in childhood and adolescence. Among children with insomnia symptoms, the most frequent trajectory was persistence (43.3%), followed by remission (26.9% since childhood, 11.2% since adolescence) and a waxing-and-waning pattern (18.6%). Among children with normal sleep, the most frequent trajectory was persistence (48.1%), followed by developing insomnia symptoms (15.2% since adolescence, 20.7% in adulthood) and a waxing-and-waning pattern (16.0%). The odds of insomnia symptoms worsening into adult insomnia (22.0% of children, 20.8% of adolescents) were 2.6-fold and 5.5-fold among short-sleeping children and adolescents, respectively.

Better characterizing this \"sleep\" domain may allow to both better treat acute episodes with existing chronotherapeutics, but also to prevent the manifestation or recurrences of mood disorders. This work aims to i) review theoretical and fundamental data of chronotherapeutics, and ii) provide practical recommendations. Light therapy (LT) can be used as a first-line monotherapy of moderate to severe depression of all subtypes. LT can be also used as a combination with antidepressant to maximize patients' response rates, which has a clear superiority to antidepressant alone. Sleep deprivation (SD) is a rapid and powerful chronotherapeutic with antidepressant responses within hours in 45-60% of patients with unipolar or bipolar depression. Different strategies should be combined to stabilize the SD antidepressant effect, including concomitant medications, repeated SD, combination with sleep phase advance and/or LT (triple chronotherapy). Melatonin treatment is of interest in remitted patients with mood disorder to prevent relapses or recurrences, if a complaint of insomnia, poor sleep quality or phase delay syndrome is associated. During the acute phase, melatonin could be used as an adjuvant treatment for symptoms of insomnia associated with depression. The cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can be recommend to treat insomnia during euthymic phases. The Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) is indicated for the acute treatment of bipolar depression and for the prevention of mood episodes.

Outcome measures included changes in sleep (self-reported latency, efficiency, duration, quality), functional outcomes (daytime dysfunction, negative mood, need for sleep medication) and treatment goal, collected in 50 individuals with a psychotic disorder and insomnia who underwent CBT-I treatment. Three distinct profiles were identified: (1) Strong responders, who met their treatment goals and showed broad improvements in both sleep and functional domains; (2) Partial responders, who showed sleep improvements (particularly in total sleep time), without noticeable gains in function, and who were predominantly female; and (3) Non-responders who showed little treatment response and failed to meet their treatment goals. This group was also more likely to have greater psychopathology (high levels of negative mood and psychotic symptoms, and antipsychotic medication dosage).

Through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), sleep and mental conditions were assessed in the ID and HC groups. The dietary intake structure of both groups was observed using the food frequency table. Meanwhile, the relationship between dietary intake and sleep quality was analyzed based on the logistics regression. Individuals in the ID group had significantly higher age, weight, and body mass index compared to the HC group (p<0.01). Individuals within the ID category demonstrated a heightened daily consumption of carbohydrates, grains, tubers, and legumes relative to the healthy control group.

Additionally, correlations between the change in sleep discrepancies and the change in subjective sleep quality and trait mindfulness were measured within each group. Sleep onset latency discrepancy measured by polysomnography and actigraphy decreased significantly after the MBTI and SHEEP interventions. In contrast, there was no significant change in wake after sleep onset discrepancy in either group. The change in sleep onset latency discrepancy was correlated with the change in insomnia symptoms and objectively measured trait mindfulness. Mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia was effective in reducing sleep onset latency discrepancies and improving sleep perception in older adults with sleep disturbances, which in turn drove an improvement in sleep quality and insomnia symptoms.

Non-REM sleep and REM sleep are different states of being, sustained by activity in brainstem nuclei, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and thalamus. Such complex phenomenology is subject to many alterations grouped in the new International Classification of Sleep Disorders. The insomnias are the result of interacting psychosocial, psychophysiologic, neurodevelopmental, and medical factors. Proper perspective of each factor provides the clinical strategies to approach medically the symptom-complex of insomnia. The most common cause of daytime hypersomnia is chronic sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea responds to nasal CPAP, but the failure rate approaches 30%. In intolerant patients BiPAP and surgical remedies should be considered. Motor and behavioral abnormalities of sleep may be linked to REM sleep as in the REM sleep behavior disorder. Paroxysmal nocturnal dystonia and nocturnal wanderings may be associated with epilepsy. Intrusions of one state of being (wakefulness, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep) into another result in mixed, poorly defined, or only partially developed states. Dissociation of states may be responsible for confusional arousals, hallucinations, and cateplexy. Senile degeneration of the suprachiasmatic nuclei may underlie the circadian rhythm changes in old age and the \"sundown\" syndrome in demented patients. Misalignment of the hypothalamic pacemaker causes dysregulation of sleep-related physiologic and behavioral variables. Exposure to bright light retrains the pacemaker in night-shift workers, transmeridian travelers, and in patients with seasonal affective syndrome. Benzodiazepine compounds are very effective hypnotics, but should be used sparingly in the elderly to avoid falls, memory lapses, and aggravation of a preexisting sleep apnea syndrome.

The endogeneity of wages is taken into account with an instrumental variables approach; we find that the wage rate affects sleeping time in general, corroborating Biddle and Hamermesh's (1990) main conclusion. A ten percent increase in the wage rate leads to an 11-12min decrease in sleep per week. But this number masks several effects. The responsiveness of sleep time to wage rate changes depends upon the sex of the individual, whether or not sleep problems are present and general economic conditions. By far the largest adjustment is found for insomniacs in 2010, a year of general economic downturn in Canada. We also investigate the non-randomness of insomnia in the population by using a Heckman procedure, and find that the sleep time of female non-insomniacs is even more responsive to wage rate changes once account is taken of this selection bias, but otherwise selection was not a problem in our samples.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27987490/"}

Among those with baseline SI, CBTI patients reported lower SI rates at posttreatment (30.0% vs 54.5%, p = .005) and 1-year follow-up (29.6% vs 46.8%, p = .042) relative to control. PRODCLIN analysis estimated that half of suicidolytic effects of CBTI were mediated through insomnia remission. Among those without baseline SI, CBTI did not directly prevent new onset SI. However, insomnia remitters reported lower rates of new-onset SI at posttreatment relative to non-remitters (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = .009). Mediation analysis supported a significant indirect effect wherein CBTI increased the likelihood of insomnia remission, which was associated with SI prevention (αβ = -3.20, 95% CI = -5.74 to -0.87). Digital CBTI reduces insomnia symptoms, which promotes SI alleviation and prevention. For nonsuicidal patients, digital CBTI may serve as a highly accessible monotherapy for improving sleep, thereby reducing the risk for SI. For suicidal patients, digital CBTI may be appropriately administered as an adjunct treatment to support mainline intervention more directly targeting suicidogenic thoughts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36242607/"}

A total of 173 women with breast cancer participated and were followed up over a period of 9 months. At baseline, participants were assigned to a high (n = 114) or low (n = 59) sleep reactivity group, based on their responses to the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST). We assessed whether these FIRST groupings (high/low sleep reactivity) predicted changes in insomnia over time using the Insomnia Severity Index. We also tested if these FIRST groupings predicted insomnia disorder (using Insomnia Severity Index cutoffs) at 3 different time points (T3, T6, and T9). Individuals with high sleep reactivity were more likely to experience a worsening of insomnia. Using logistic regression, we also found that FIRST grouping predicted insomnia disorder. Results remained significant after controlling for estimated premorbid sleep, age, and whether someone had chemotherapy. Our study shows that sleep reactivity may be a robust predictor of insomnia within breast cancer populations. Sleep reactivity should be considered in routine clinical assessments as a reliable way to identify patients at risk of developing insomnia. This would facilitate early sleep intervention for those patients who are considered high risk. Rehman A, Drake CL, Shiramizu V, Fleming L.

Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279980/"}

In the spring of 2019, 1st year high-school students in Western Norway were invited to a survey assessing habitual sleep duration, insomnia, depression and anxiety. Sleep patterns, depression and anxiety were assessed using the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Students consenting to data linkage with the county school authorities were re-invited 2 years later. Registry-based grade point averages for each of the included school years were accessed through the school authorities. The final longitudinal sample included 1092 students (65.1% girls; initial mean age 16.4 years). Data were analysed using linear mixed models. Longer school night sleep duration and less severe symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety were all associated with higher grade point averages at baseline in crude analyses. Shorter school night sleep duration, as well as more severe symptoms of insomnia and depression at baseline, all predicted worse grade point averages at 2-year follow-up when controlled for baseline grade point averages. [Correction added on 30 December 2024, after first online publication: In the preceding sentence, the word \"better\" has been corrected to \"worse\".] By contrast, anxiety symptomatology at baseline was unrelated to changes in grade point averages over time.

Those reporting elevated ISI scores 1 month later were offered STEP-2: a 3-session, group cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia that has been demonstrated to be efficacious. Participants were considered treatment responders if their ISI score improved by ≥6 points and were considered as having remitted if their posttreatment ISI score was <12.

After behavioral modifications fail to show adequate response, pharmacologic options are used. The pharmacokinetics of agents used to treat insomnia may be altered. This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of medications used to treat insomnia. A literature search of Medline, PubMed, and Embase was conducted (January 1966-June 2016). It included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series that had an emphasis on insomnia in an older population. Search terms included medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia: benzodiazepines (triazolam, estazolam, temazepam, flurazepam, and quazepam), nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists (non-BzRAs; zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), suvorexant, ramelteon, doxepin and trazodone. Off-label drugs such as other antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, gabapentin, pramipexole, tiagabine, valerian, and melatonin were also included. Cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep hygiene are considered initial therapy for insomnia. Benzodiazepines are discouraged in the geriatric population, especially for long-term use. Although non-BzRAs have improved safety profiles compared with benzodiazepines, their side effects include dementia, serious injury, and fractures, which should limit their use. Ramelteon has a minimal adverse effect profile and is effective for sleep-onset latency and increased total sleep time, making it a valuable first-line option. Although the data on suvorexant are limited, this drug improves sleep maintenance and has mild adverse effects, including somnolence; residual daytime sedation has been reported, however. Sedating low-dose antidepressants should only be used for insomnia when the patient has comorbid depression. Antipsychotic agents, pramipexole, and tiagabine have all been used for insomnia, but none has been extensively studied in an older population, and all have considerable adverse effects. Gabapentin may be useful in patients with restless leg syndrome or chronic neuropathic pain and insomnia. Diphenhydramine should be avoided in the elderly. Valerian and melatonin are unregulated products that have a small impact on sleep latency and can produce residual sedation. An ideal treatment for insomnia should help to improve sleep latency and sleep duration with limited awakenings and be without significant adverse effects such as daytime somnolence or decreased alertness. Cognitive behavioral therapy should always be first line treatment. Clinical inertia regarding previous prominent use of benzodiazepines and non-BzRAs will be a significant challenge for patients accustomed to their issuance. The future direction of insomnia treatment should have an emphasis on nonpharmacologic interventions, treating comorbid conditions, and focusing therapy on using benzodiazepines and non-BzRAs as last resorts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27751669/"}

Fifty inpatients were randomized to either CircadianCare (<i>n</i> = 25; 18 males, 62.4 ± 1.9 years) or standard of care (<i>n</i> = 25; 14 males, 64.5 ± 2.3 years). On admission, all underwent a full sleep-wake evaluation; they then completed daily sleep diaries and wore an actigraph for the whole length of hospitalization. On days 1 (T0), 7 (T1), and 14 (T2, if still hospitalized), salivary melatonin for dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and 24-h skin temperature were recorded. In addition, environmental noise, temperature, and illuminance were monitored. Patients in the CircadianCare arm followed 1 of 3 schedules for light/dark, meal, and physical activity timings, based on their diurnal preference/habits. They wore short-wavelength-enriched light-emitting glasses for 45 min after awakening and short-wavelength light filter shades from 18:00 h until sleep onset. While the first, primary registered outcome (reduced sleep-onset latency on actigraphy or diary) was not met, based on sleep diaries, there was a trend (0.05 < <i>p</i> < 0.1) toward an advance in bedtime for CircadianCare compared to standard of care patients between T0 and T1. Similarly, DLMO time significantly advanced in the small group of patients for whom it could be computed on both occasions, with untreated ones starting from earlier baseline values. Patients sleeping near the window had significantly higher sleep efficiency, regardless of treatment arm. As noise fluctuation increased, so did the number of night awakenings, regardless of treatment arm. In conclusion, the CircadianCare management system showed positive results in terms of advancing sleep timing and the circadian rhythm of melatonin. Furthermore, our study identified a combination of environmental noise and lighting indices, which could be easily modulated to prevent hospitalization-related insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38153134/"}

They completed daily diaries assessing insomnia symptoms and alcohol use for 14 days. Multilevel modelling was used to evaluate the bidirectional associations between alcohol use and insomnia symptoms at the daily level.

Specifically, for every alcoholic drink consumed, time to sleep onset decreased by 5.0 min in the same night but increased by 4.3 min 2 nights later. Alcohol use was not significantly associated with subsequent wake after sleep onset or total sleep time, and insomnia symptoms were not significantly associated with subsequent alcohol use.

However, the impact of acute and chronic sleep deficiency on physiologic stressor responses is poorly understood. In a controlled laboratory study with normal sleepers and individuals with chronic sleep-onset insomnia, we measured responses to an acute stressor administered in a sleep deprivation condition or a control condition. Twenty-two adults (aged 22-40 years; 16 females)-11 healthy normal sleepers and 11 individuals with sleep-onset insomnia-completed a 5-day (4-night) in-laboratory study.

At 8:00 PM after 36 hours awake in the sleep deprivation condition or 12 hours awake in the control condition, subjects underwent a Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST). Salivary cortisol was measured immediately before the MAST at 8:00 PM, every 15 minutes after the MAST from 8:15 PM until 9:15 PM, and 30 minutes later at 9:45 PM. Baseline salivary cortisol was collected in the evening of the baseline day. Additionally, before and immediately upon completion of the MAST, self-report ratings of affect and pain were collected. The MAST elicited a stressor response in both normal sleepers and individuals with sleep-onset insomnia, regardless of the condition, as evidenced by increases in negative affect and pain ratings. Relative to baseline, cortisol levels increased immediately following the MAST, peaked 30 minutes later, and then gradually returned to pre-MAST levels. At the cortisol peak, there was a significant difference across groups and conditions, reflecting a pronounced blunting of the cortisol response in the normal sleepers in the TSD condition and the sleep-onset insomnia group in both the TSD and control conditions. Blunted stressor reactivity as a result of sleep deficiency, whether acute or chronic, may reflect reduced resiliency attributable to allostatic load and may put warfighters at increased risk in high-stakes, rapid response scenarios.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33499519/"}

{"id": "1297583", "title": "[Sleep disorders in psychiatric diseases. Epidemiological aspects].", "text": "Very few epidemiological surveys have specifically studied relationships between sleep disturbances and psychiatric diseases. In this review, we preferred to use the classification proposed in 1979 by the Association of Sleep Disorders Centers. It includes four main categories: insomnias, excessive sleepiness, troubles of the wake/sleep schedule and parasomnias. Evaluating psychiatric disorders among general populations is easier owing to DSM III and DSM III-R criteria, but there are not equivalent criteria in evaluating sleep disorders. It is almost impossible to realize polysomnographic recordings in large samples, therefore sleep disorders are to be detected by questionnaires. It has been shown that there is a good correlation between self-reports and polysomnographic recordings among clinical and general samples. The prevalence of insomnia, defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, is estimated between 9 and 31%. It is higher among women, elderly people, separated and divorced subjects, and low educational levels' groups. It has to be noticed that polysomnographic records of some subjective insomniacs are not different from those of good sleepers, sleep latency excepted. These subjective (and not objective) insomniacs have high scores in anxiety scale, depression scale, or psychologic distress. Insomnia is more frequently noted amongst subjects with psychiatric diagnoses, especially major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. Depressive disorders are present in 21-40% of insomniacs versus 0-1% of non-insomniacs, and anxiety disorders in 13-24% of insomniacs versus 3-10% of non-insomniacs. In depressive disorders, sleep alterations are frequently noted: they are difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, decreasing proportion of slow-wave sleep, decreasing time of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and REM sleep latency, and increasing density of REM sleep. Of these modifications, the last two ones seem to be specific for depression. The relationships between sleep, aging and depression are more complex than previously noted. For example, differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects depend on the age of the population. The prevalence of hypersomnia is lower than the insomnia's. It varies between 2 and 4%.

Probable upcoming stress levels were estimated through weekly web questionnaire ratings. Based on the modified FIRST-scale (Ford insomnia response to stress) participants were grouped into high (n = 9) or low (n = 19) sensitivity to stress related sleep disturbances (Drake et al., 2004). Sleep was recorded in 28 teachers with polysomnography, sleep diaries and actigraphs during one high stress and one low stress condition in the participants home. EEG showed a decrease in sleep efficiency during the high stress condition. Significant interactions between group and condition were seen for REM sleep, arousals and stage transitions. The sensitive group had an increase in arousals and stage transitions during the high stress condition and a decrease in REM, whereas the opposite was seen in the resilient group. Diary ratings during the high stress condition showed higher bedtime stress and lower ratings on the awakening index (insufficient sleep and difficulties awakening). Ratings also showed lower cognitive function and preoccupation with work thoughts in the evening. KSS ratings of sleepiness increased during stress for the sensitive group. Saliva samples of cortisol showed no effect of stress. It was concluded that moderate daily stress is associated with a moderate negative effect on sleep sleep efficiency and fragmentation. A slightly stronger effect was seen in the sensitive group.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22835074/"}
{"id": "16876255", "title": "Treating insomnia: Current and investigational pharmacological approaches.", "text": "Chronic insomnia affects a significant proportion of young adult and elderly populations. Treatment strategies should alleviate nighttime symptoms, the feeling of nonrestorative sleep, and impaired daytime function. Current pharmacological approaches focus primarily on GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRA) have been a mainstay of pharmacotherapy; the classical benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines share a similar mode of action and allosterically enhance inhibitory chloride currents through the GABA(A) receptor, a ligand-gated protein comprising 5 subunits pseudosymmetrically arranged around a core anion channel. Variations in GABA(A) receptor subunit composition confer unique pharmacological, biophysical, and electrophysiological properties on each receptor subtype. Classical benzodiazepines bind non-selectively to GABA(A) receptors containing a gamma2 subunit, whereas non-benzodiazepine hypnotics bind with higher relative affinity to alpha1-containing receptors. The non-benzodiazepine compounds generally represent an improvement over benzodiazepines as a result of improved binding selectivity and pharmacokinetic profiles. However, the enduring potential for amnestic effects, next day residual sedation, and abuse and physical dependence, particularly at higher doses, underscores the need for new treatment strategies. Novel pharmacotherapies in development act on systems believed to be specifically involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. The recently approved melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon, targets circadian mechanisms. Gaboxadol, an investigational treatment and a selective extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor agonist (SEGA), targets GABA(A) receptors containing a delta subunit, which are located outside the synaptic junctions of thalamic and cortical neurons thought to play an important regulatory role in the onset, maintenance, and depth of the sleep process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16876255/"}

The intervention is based on cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia with specific emphasis on the biological clock ('i-Sleep & BioClock'). We assessed feasibility and acceptability. Pre- to post-intervention (7-week) changes in insomnia, depression, anxiety, chronotype, and quality of life were evaluated. Of 101 included students, 81 accessed the platform, 41 initiated the intervention, and 13 completed the intervention. Post-test response was 39%. Students rated the intervention with good acceptability and the platform with excellent usability.

Moreover, the intersection between OUD recovery and sleep represents an area well-suited for the development of novel, personalized treatment strategies. This study assessed the prevalence of clinically significant insomnia symptoms and characterized its neurofunctional correlates among a clinical sample of adults with OUD receiving buprenorphine. Adults (N = 129) receiving buprenorphine for OUD from an outpatient clinic participated in a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed an abbreviated version of NIDA's Phenotyping Assessment Battery, which assessed 6 neurofunctional domains: sleep, negative emotionality, metacognition, interoception, cognition, and reward. Bivariate descriptive statistics compared those with evidence of clinically significant insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] score of ≥11) to those with minimal evidence of clinically significant insomnia symptoms (ISI score of ≤10) across each of the neurofunctional domains. Roughly 60% of participants reported clinically significant insomnia symptoms (ISI score of ≥11). Experiencing clinically significant insomnia symptoms was associated with reporting greater levels of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, stress intolerance, unhelpful metacognition, and interoceptive awareness (ps<0.05). Participants with evidence of clinically significant insomnia were more likely to report that poor sleep was interfering with their OUD treatment and that improved sleep would assist with their treatment (ps<0.05). Insomnia was prevalent among adults receiving buprenorphine for OUD. Insomnia was associated with neurofunctional performance, which may impact OUD treatment trajectories. Our findings indicate potential targets in the development of personalized treatment plans for patients with co-morbid insomnia and OUD. To inform the development of novel treatment strategies, more research is needed to understand the potential mechanistic links between sleep disturbances and substance use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38870144/"}

Fourteen insomniacs and 14 age- and sex-matched controls kept a sleep log for 1 week and slept once in the laboratory (standard polygraphy). In addition, actual perception of awakening was measured by a behavioral device. Results suggest that physiological arousal is necessary, but not sufficient, for perception of awakening. Many arousals that are not perceived occur during the first REM-NREM cycle. Insomniacs nearly exclusively perceive those arousals occurring after consolidated sleep (at least 15 min) and at the beginning of interrupted sleep intervals. It is suggested that insomniacs perceive these intervals as continuous wakefulness and have difficulty in perceiving short-lasting sleep, whereas controls often do not perceive wakefulness at all. The latter may be a sleep-protecting mechanism. Number and correlation suggest that recalled awakenings are exactly those perceived.

Forty-seven individuals with insomnia disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (48.66±15.62 years; 31 women) and 29 healthy controls (50.66±15.14 years; 17 women) participated in the experiments and completed the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ) immediately after the resting session.

Statistical analyses included multiple regression to elucidate the independent determinants of ARSQ phenotypes. Participants with insomnia presented higher ISI, PSQI, and DBAS scores than did healthy controls. Insomniacs had strikingly different scores on most dimensions of the ARSQ, in particular Discontinuity of Mind, Self, Sleepiness, and Health Concern, that correlated positively with ISI and DBAS. Multiple regressions highlighted that for insomniacs, ISI was the best predictor of both Discontinuity of Mind and Health Concern.

We retrospectively examined whether lemborexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, is effective in improving sleep disturbances and reducing pain in patients with chronic pain. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital. The subjects were 26 patients with chronic pain undergoing treatment at our pain clinic between July 2021 and March 2022, who had been diagnosed with insomnia, with an Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) score of ≥6 and had been started on lemborexant. The AIS score and pain score (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) before and after 2 and 4 weeks of starting lemborexant were investigated. Patients who were already taking other sleep medications, such as benzodiazepines were switched to 5 mg of lemborexant after all the other sleep medications were discontinued. Those who had not yet used sleeping pills were started on 5 mg of lemborexant. During the study course, the dose of lemborexant was adjusted at the discretion of the attending physician, based on improvement of insomnia symptoms and secondary symptoms, such as daytime sleepiness and lightheadedness. The study finally included 21 patients, excluding 5 who could not continue taking lemborexant due to side effects, such as lightheadedness.

It has been most extensively studied in childhood while there is scarcity of reports concerning adulthood of AS subjects despite the lifelong nature of this syndrome. In children with Asperger syndrome the initiation and continuity of sleep is disturbed because of the neuropsychiatric deficits inherent of AS. It is probable that sleep difficulties are present in adulthood as well. Our hypothesis was that adults with AS suffer from difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep and nonrestorative sleep (insomnia). 20 AS without medication were compared with 10 healthy controls devoid of neuropsychiatric anamnesis. Clinical examination, blood test battery and head MRI excluded confounding somatic illnesses. Structured psychiatric interview for axis-I and axis-II disorders were given to both groups as well as Beck Depression Inventory and Wechsler adult intelligence scale, revised version.Sleep quality was assessed with sleep questionnaire, sleep diary during 6 consecutive days and description of possible sleep problems by the participants own words was requested. compared with controls and with normative values of good sleep, AS adults had frequent insomnia. In sleep questionnaire 90% (18/20), in sleep diary 75% (15/20) and in free description 85% (17/20) displayed insomnia. There was a substantial psychiatric comorbidity with only 4 AS subject devoid of other axis-I or axis-II disorders besides AS. Also these persons displayed insomnia. It can be noted that the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses in AS subjects was virtually similar to that found among patient with chronic insomnia. the neuropsychiatric deficits inherent of AS predispose both to insomnia and to anxiety and mood disorders.

{"id": "12506261", "title": "[Etiology of adult insomnia].", "text": "In the article, the author develops an analysis of external and intrapsychic factors related to adults' insomnia. First she undertakes a literature review to describe semiological, evolutive and etiological levels of insomnia. From a semiological point of view, it is usual to differenciate initial insomnia (associated to the first phase of sleeping), intermittent insomnia (related to frequent awakenings) and final insomnia (related to early morning awakenings). From an evolutive point of view, we can identify transitory insomnia (characterized by frequent awakenings) and chronic insomnia. On the other hand, we are allowed to distinguish organic insomnia (disorder where an organic cerebral injury is demonstrated or suspected) from insomnias related to psychiatric or somatic disease or idiopathic one. Then, the author makes a literary review to identify various insomnia causes and points out. Social factors: insomnia rates are higher by divorced, separated or widowed people. Percentages are higher when scholastic level is weak, domestic income is less then 915 O a month, or by unemployed people. Besides, sleep quality is deteriorated by ageing. Sleeping and waking rhythm is able to loose its synchronization. Complaints about insomnia occur far frequently from women than men. Environmental factors: working constraints increase sleep disorders. It is possible to make the same conclusion when we have to face overcharge of external events, deep intrapsychic conflicts (related to grief, unemployment, damage or hospitalization) or interpersonal conflicts' situations where we are confronted to stress related to socio-affective environment, lack of social support or conjugal difficulties. Medical and physiologic causes: legs impatience syndrome, recurrent limbs shakings syndrome, breathe stop during sleep, narcolepsy, excessive medicine or hypnotic drugs use, some central nervous system injuries, every nocturnal awakening (related to aches.), surgical operation. Chronobiological factors: night working or day-night shift produce insomnia by desynchronization. It is the same for time lag related to jet-lag flights. Significant gaps between the internal biological clock and environmental synchronizators, such as phase delay sleep, phase advance sleep, sleep-waking cycle longer than 24 (25) hours, or variations in sleep-awakening cycle, are of less importance. Toxic factors are numerous: amphetamines, antidepressors, medication against anorexia and tubercular disease, caffeine and alcohol excessive use, chronic alcoholism. Behavioral factors: enduring insomnias are related to poor nightroutines (to go to sleep too early, to read or to look at T.V. when going to bed). The same effect is produced by regular intellectual activities close to bedtime or by a late meal in the evening, by an noisy or unhealthy environment, by physical hyperactivity or sleeping after each lunch. Psychiatric factors: insomnia often appears with psychiatric disorders such as a major depressive episode, an anxiety disorder or schizophrenia. Insomnia also is able to open a delirious disorganization or a manic access. Psychological factors: overstimulation of waking system (related to stress overdose or intellectual hyperactivity), conditioning phenomena, fear of not falling asleep, intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts. Third, the author put hypothesis about psychodynamic etiology of chronic insomnia. Following a first assumption, insomnia should be a result of anguish excess related to intrapsychic (and not interpersonal) conflicts which can't lead to a mental elaboration. These conflicts run over dream protective function, generating a breakdown of dream symbolization function. At a clinical level, we are in some cases in front of people enduring sleeping insomnia but more often, we are confronted with an intermittent or early waking insomnia sometimes associated with nightmares. Following a second assumption, insomnia should be a result of psychic functioning invalidation. Here, failure of dream protective and symbolization function is related to anguish excess associated with an amount of external conflicts. Overwhelmed by concretude, insomniac patients present an alexythimic intrapsychic functioning forbiding dream realization. These persons have no possibility to elaborate conflicts especially external overcharge, using dreams or imagination to escape from an intrusive reality and regress to sleeping. Here we are in front of initial sleep insomnia. Following a third hypothesis, some insomnias are related to wakings associated with repetitive nightmares. This type of insomnia should be related to a past traumatic event or activated by actual existential context and produces a too important anguish charge to follow a mental elaboration process and lead to mental symbolic representation. Following a fourth hypothesis, some insomnias are in relation with an impossibility to accept passive position. The last one will expose to a danger consisting either of castration or loneliness and death. To conclude, the author suggests some preventive perspective to face insomnia. Especially, she points out limits of pharmalogical treatments. She underlines the necessity to promote no medical methods to facilitate sleep induction and maintenance, including sleep hygiene measures, relaxation, psychotherapic approach and behavioral methods. She emphasizes the danger of a reductive approach of insomnia which would be focused on a single medical, psychological or environmental dimension.

Digital cognitive therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) has been validated as effective in alleviating this cognitive dysfunction. However, the effect of dCBT-I on attentional bias among Chinese individuals with insomnia remains undiscussed. This research sought to investigate this effect via a pictorial dot-probe task. In Study 1, the pattern of attentional bias among poor sleepers (N = 52) and normal sleepers (N = 56) was assessed by the dot-probe task. In study 2, dCBT-I and conventional education were received by the experimental group (N = 42) and control group (N = 25), respectively. The dot-probe tasks and sleep quality assessments were completed at baseline and post-test. The results of Study 1 indicated that poor sleepers exhibited significant attentional bias, characterized by increased attentional vigilance. Compared to normal sleepers, they showed heightened attentional vigilance toward sleep-related cues. The results of Study 2 showed that both dCBT-I and conventional education led to improvements in PSQI scores. However, only dCBT-I training alleviated attentional vigilance toward sleep-related cues. Additionally, dCBT-I was uniquely effective in reducing feelings of fatigue. Poor sleepers had a significant attentional bias, marked by heightened vigilance toward sleep-related cues. Digital CBT-I effectively reduced attentional vigilance and fatigue, suggesting that dCBT-I targets the cognitive distortions associated with insomnia.

However, its length can be cumbersome in clinical practice. This study aims to develop a data-driven shortened version of the DBAS-16 that efficiently predicts the DBAS-16 total score among the general population. We collected 1000 responses to the DBAS-16 from the general population through three separate surveys, each focusing on different aspects of insomnia severity and related factors. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on the survey responses, we grouped DBAS-16 items based on response pattern similarities. The most representative item from each group, showing the highest regression performance with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) in predicting the DBAS-16 total score, was selected to create a shortened version of the DBAS-16. Through EFA and XGBoost, we categorized the DBAS-16 items into six distinct groups. Selecting one item from each group, based on the highest coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> values in predicting the DBAS-16 total score. After measuring the R<sup>2</sup> values for all possible combinations of six items, items 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 15 were chosen, exhibiting the highest R<sup>2</sup> value. Based on these six items, we developed the DBAS-6, a data-driven shortened version of the DBAS-16. The DBAS-6 exhibited outstanding predictive ability, achieving the highest R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.90 for predicting the DBAS-16 total score, surpassing that of a previously developed shortened version. Notably, the DBAS-6 efficiently encapsulates the core aspects of the DBAS-16 and demonstrates robust predictive power over heterogeneous test data samples with distinct statistical characteristics from the training data.

Hence, in older patients, the drug should be safe and hypnotically active in doses equal to or less than the doses recommended for young adults. The present study tested this hypothesis. We studied ten healthy subjects, aged 55 and older, with both subjective and objective insomnia. Subjective insomnia was the complaint of requiring at least 45 min to fall asleep and sleeping less than six and a half hours per night. Each complaint was present on at least 50% of the nights for at least three months. Objective insomnia was measured polysomnographically and was present on at least two of the last three nights of four consecutive nights of placebo baseline. The study involved a design in which treatment was administered in a double-blind fashion. Each subject was studied for 14 consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. The drug was administered for seven consecutive nights which were preceded by a placebo baseline and followed by a placebo period of drug withdrawal. On each laboratory night subjects were monitored by continuous, all-night conventional EEG/EOG/EMG recordings. Each laboratory morning subjects completed a questionnaire on which they rated six characteristics of their sleep on the previous night. At study entry and again at study end, each subject had a physical examination by a Board internist and clinical laboratory tests.

The investigation was performed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Sixteen patients (4 male, 12 female) with previously established psychophysiological insomnia (ICSD-code 1.A.1.), and with a median age of 49 (range: 22 to 55), were included in the study. The main inclusion criteria were reported primary insomnia according to ICSD criteria, which was confirmed by polysomnographic recording, and the absence of acute diseases. During the study, the patients underwent 8 polysomnographic recordings: i.e., 2 recordings (baseline and study night) at each time point at which the short and long-term effects of placebo and valerian were tested. The target variable of the study was sleep efficiency. Other parameters describing objective sleep structure were the usual features of sleep-stage analysis, based on the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968), and the arousal index (scored according to ASDA criteria, 1992) as a sleep microstructure parameter. Subjective parameters such as sleep quality, morning feeling, daytime performance, subjectively perceived duration of sleep latency, and sleep period time were assessed by means of questionnaires. After a single dose of valerian, no effects on sleep structure and subjective sleep assessment were observed. After multiple-dose treatment, sleep efficiency showed a significant increase for both the placebo and the valerian condition in comparison with baseline polysomnography. We confirmed significant differences between valerian and placebo for parameters describing slow-wave sleep. In comparison with the placebo, slow-wave sleep latency was reduced after administration of valerian (21.3 vs. 13.5 min respectively, p<0.05). The SWS percentage of time in bed (TIB) was increased after long-term valerian treatment, in comparison to baseline (9.8 vs. 8.1% respectively, p<0.05). At the same time point, a tendency for shorter subjective sleep latency, as well as a higher correlation coefficient between subjective and objective sleep latencies, were observed under valerian treatment. Other improvements in sleep structure - such as an increase in REM percentage and a decrease in NREM1 percentage - took place simultaneously under placebo and valerian treatment. A remarkable finding of the study was the extremely low number of adverse events during the valerian treatment periods (3 vs. 18 in the placebo period).

This secondary analysis compares participants (N = 303) randomized to an Internet-based CBT-I program (SHUTi-Sleep Healthy Using the Internet) or Internet-based patient education (PE). Participants reported daily bedtimes and rising times on 10 online sleep diaries collected over 2 weeks at baseline and 9-week post-intervention assessment. Participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at post-assessment and 6-month follow-up; symptom remission was defined by ISI < 8. Mixed effects location scale modeling was used to examine the effect of SHUTi on bedtime and rising time IIV; a novel two-staged analysis examined the effect of bedtime and rising time IIV on insomnia symptom remission. At post-assessment, SHUTi participants reported about 30% less bedtime and 32% less rising time variability compared to PE (ps < 0.03). Bedtime and rising time IIV was not independently associated with likelihood of insomnia symptom remission at the subsequent time point (ps > 0.18), nor did sleep schedule IIV moderate treatment response (ps > 0.12). Findings demonstrate that an Internet-delivered CBT-I program can effectively increase users' sleep schedule consistency relative to an educational control. This consistency, however, was not related to treatment outcome when defined by insomnia symptom remission, suggesting that enforcing rigid sleep schedules for patients may not be necessary for treatment success.

Unstable sleep, which can be detected in all stages, is expressed by the recurrence of arousal complexes (sequences of K-complexes, delta bursts, K-alpha, conventional arousals), which translate a brief (10-15 s) activation of the sleeping brain. These repetitive arousal complexes compose the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). During stable NREM sleep, arousal complexes are rare or absent and the EEG lacks any cyclic pattern (non-CAP). CAP is a spontaneous feature of normal sleep as it is typically involved in stage changes and nocturnal motor activity. The physiological amount of CAP rate (ratio of CAP time to NREM sleep time) varies with age according to a U-shape curve. Within these ranges, sleep is perceived as continuous and restorative. Conversely, an excess of CAP rate fragments sleep and impairs its quality. Polysomnographic investigation reveals that untreated insomniac patients exhibit significantly higher values of CAP rate compared to healthy sleepers. Effective hypnotic treatment restores physiological amounts of CAP rate, with specific differences between the administered drugs. The sensitivity of CAP parameters to drug manipulation can provide circumscribed information on the hypnotic properties of active compounds.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11924041/"}

The prevalence of insomnia is disproportionately higher in people with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment. In fact, recent meta-analytic evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that insomnia, especially when accompanied by objective short sleep duration, is a risk factor for incident hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, stroke, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and all-cause mortality. Insomnia should, thus, be part of the prevention and management of these adverse health outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated whether treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, the first-line guideline-recommended treatment, or hypnotics/sedatives improves heart- or brain-related outcomes. Studies have also failed to consider insomnia a heterogeneous disorder consisting of distinct phenotypes that result from the relative contribution of biological versus cognitive-behavioral perpetuating factors. Objective short sleep duration has emerged as a marker of physiological hyperarousal in insomnia (ie, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, increased sympathetic nervous system activation, and increased inflammation), as a predictor of insomnia-related adverse heart and brain health outcomes and, potentially, poor response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. This review summarizes the meta-analytic evidence on the association of insomnia with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including current knowledge on the heterogeneity of the disorder. This review also summarizes the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to heart and brain morbidity, which vary across insomnia phenotypes based on objective sleep duration.

The baseline and follow-up measurements were completed by 62 older adults (55 female, 89%). This was a two-condition within-participant design. Mediation analysis using a parallel mediation model was conducted using the MEMORE macro for repeated measure designs. Out of all the included mediator variables, only a reduction in sleep effort scores (0.88; SE 0.51; 95% CI 0.001-2.00) significantly mediated changes in insomnia severity scores following the intervention. Insomnia severity scores significantly reduced following the intervention (M<sub>pre</sub>  = 9.84, SD = 5.89, M<sub>post</sub>  = 6.87, SD = 4.90); t(61) = 5.19, P = <0.001; d = 0.55 95% CI 0.38-0.93. Sleep in older adults improved following digitally delivered CBT-I, and these changes were influenced by a reduction in sleep control efforts exerted by participants. These findings highlight possible treatment pathways of CBT-I. Further investigation of CBT-I as a strategy to prevent sleep problems is warranted.

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder that can be managed with cognitive behavioural therapy, however, access to skilled therapists is an issue. Telemedicine improves access to care and thus, it may facilitate management of insomnia. The aim of this study was to assess whether telemedicine can be as effective as traditional in person sleep medicine service for the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of insomnia. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, studies related to telemedicine and insomnia were identified and selected, using the keywords of telemedicine, insomnia, sleep disorder, treatment, non-pharmacological treatment. The international databases of Embase, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar were searched without a lower time limit, and until July 12, 2021. Data were analysed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 2) software, and the significance level of the test was considered P ˂ 0.05. A systematic review of 16 selected studies showed that telemedicine interventions have a positive effect on improving insomnia in different groups. The meta-analysis was performed on 2 studies. Based on the results, CBTI interventions based on telemedicine have a greater effect on improving chronic insomnia than face to face CBTI with an average difference of 2.05 ± 0.66 based on the random effects model. Moreover, the difference between the mean in the telemedicine intervention group and the non-intervention group was 0.65 ± 0.19, which shows the positive effect of the telemedicine intervention. The use of telemedicine in treatment of insomnia not only accelerates access to sleep services, but can also improve the efficiency of health services in terms of time and cost, as well as therapeutic effects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35151065/"}

Regular exercise has small beneficial effects on total sleep time and sleep efficiency, small-to-medium beneficial effects on sleep onset latency, and moderate beneficial effects on sleep quality. Effects were moderated by sex, age, baseline physical activity level of participants, as well as exercise type, time of day, duration, and adherence.

Participants in this cross-sectional observational study included men and women with insomnia (n = 28) and good sleeper controls (n = 38). Interpersonal distress was measured with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems. Sleep parameters included insomnia severity, self-reported presleep arousal, and sleep quality; and polysomnographically-assessed sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), percent delta (stage 3 + 4 NREM), percent REM, and EEG beta power. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the relationship between distress from interpersonal problems and sleep and the extent to which relationships differed among insomnia patients and controls. More interpersonal distress was associated with more self-reported arousal and higher percentage of REM. More interpersonal distress was associated with greater insomnia severity and more cognitive presleep arousal for individuals with insomnia, but not for controls. Contrary to expectations, interpersonal distress was associated with shorter sleep latency in the insomnia group. Results were attenuated, but still significant, after adjusting for depression symptoms. Distress from interpersonal problems is associated with greater self-reported arousal and higher percent REM. Individuals with insomnia who report more distress from interpersonal problems have greater insomnia severity and cognitive presleep arousal, perhaps due to rumination.

The levels of key neurotransmitters, cytokines and receptor protein associated with insomnia were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Additionally, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing was performed to assess the impact of YA on gut microbiota, focusing on species abundance and diversity. YA significantly shortened sleep latency (P < 0.01) and prolonged sleep duration (P < 0.01) in sleep-deprived mice, effectively improving circadian rhythm disturbances compared to the model group (MOD). Biochemical analysis revealed that YA restored abnormal neurotransmitter levels in brain tissue, increasing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor α-1 subunit (GABAARα1) expression (P < 0.01) and reducing the glutamate (Glu)/GABA ratio (P < 0.01). Additionally, the levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression were significantly decreased (P < 0.05, 0.01), while interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) expression increased (P < 0.01). YA treatment also significantly increased gut microbiota abundance and diversity, with microbiome profiles in the YA group being closer than those of diazepam group (DZP) to the control group (CON). Notably, YA reversed the dysbiosis of high-abundance gut microbiota species associated with insomnia at both the family and genus levels (P < 0.05, 0.01).

The age-standardized prevalence of trouble sleeping and using MCUFI was higher in women than men, but men tended to sleep less (sleep duration <7 hours) and were more likely to have sleep disorders. The temporal trends in sleep disorders and MCUFI were similar in men and women, except that trouble sleeping increased more in men (P = 0.024). The prevalence of insufficient sleep decreased from 33.6% in women and 38.1% in men in 2005-2006 to 20.5% in women and 28.6% in men in 2017-2018. The prevalence of MCUFI use was 13.3% in women and 8.9% in men in 2005-2006, peaked at 15.2% for men and 17.0% for women in 2013-2014, and decreased slightly in 2015-2018. The prevalence of trouble sleeping and MCUFI use was higher in women, while the prevalence of short sleep duration and sleep disorders was higher in men. Sleep disorders, abnormal sleep duration, and MCUFI use increased at a broadly similar pace in men and women, except that trouble sleeping increased more in men.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36117095/"}

This evolution provides an increasing capacity to improve the effectiveness of insomnia pharmacotherapy by allowing the selection of medications that specifically target the particular type of sleep difficulty present in each patient. As a result, they can achieve a therapeutic effect with fewer effects on aspects of brain function other than those needed to achieve benefit, thereby minimising adverse effects. The accumulated evidence-base is such that it can serve as the basis for a personalised insomnia pharmacotherapy paradigm. Here we outline a set of best-practice recommendations for how to carry out optimised personalised insomnia pharmacotherapy based on that evidence base in the hope that it will improve the treatment delivered to the many individuals suffering from insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37940337/"}

Although behavioural interventions are safe and effective, controversy has arisen because of the impression that they are incompatible with sensitive parenting (i.e. cued care). The practice of extinction, however, does not preclude a sensitive parenting style. It stimulates autonomy and self-regulation in the child. Instead of counterposing behavioural interventions and cued care, we suggest it is more productive to start from their similarities, such as optimizing sleep hygiene and developing a fixed sleep-wake rhythm. Such measures could be the first steps in a stepped-care model that may be supplemented with additional treatment aimed at the underlying causes of insomnia. For this comprehensive approach it is necessary to have a diverse array of evidence-based treatment options that suits the needs of both children and parents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32391994/"}

In this study, we used a combination of daily sleep diaries and ambulatory activity monitoring (actigraphy) to: (i) examine the nature and severity of the sleep disturbance in this patient group; (ii) determine the concordance between sleep diary and actigraph measures of different sleep parameters; (iii) assess the reliability of sleep parameters across nights; and (iv) identify the clinical correlates of insomnia severity. Forty subjects with insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed questionnaires addressing clinical issues of pain severity, medication use, sleep quality, and affective distress. For 2 consecutive nights, each subject then completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph unit on the non-dominant wrist. The results showed that the sleep diaries and the actigraphs provided similar estimates of total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, but differed in the measurement of sleep onset latency and nocturnal awakenings. Both methods of assessment exhibited low to moderate reliability across nights. Measures of the same sleep parameters across the two methods of assessment showed low concordance. Of the clinical variables, pain severity had the strongest association with disturbed sleep, but only using the diary method of assessment. Subjects who reported high pain severity also reported greater sleep impairment than subjects with low pain severity, but this was not confirmed by actigraphy. In general, both methods of assessment point to the significance of insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain as a distinct clinical problem, but the activity monitoring and self-report procedures provide different information. These findings suggest that multi-method assessment is an important consideration for studies of insomnia in patients with chronic pain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9539676/"}

On this basis, a proper evaluation of polysomnographic data collected in clinical trials conducted to explore clinical efficacy of novel hypnotic compounds should include the assessment of sleep architecture and its drug-induced changes. This work presents a non-linear mixed-effect Markov-chain model based on multinomial logistic functions which characterize the time course of transition probabilities between sleep stages in insomniac patients treated with placebo. Polysomnography measurements were obtained from patients during one night treatment. A population approach was used to describe the time course of sleep stages (awake stage, stage 1, stage 2, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep) using a Markov-chain model. The relationship between time and individual transition probabilities between sleep stages was modelled through piecewise linear multinomial logistic functions. The identification of the model produced a good adherence of mean post-hoc estimates to the observed transition frequencies. Parameters were generally well estimated in terms of CV, shrinkage and distribution of empirical Bayes estimates around the typical values. The posterior predictive check analysis showed good consistency between model-predicted and observed sleep parameters. In conclusion, the Markov-chain model based on multinomial logistic functions provided an accurate description of the time course of sleep stages together with an assessment of the probabilities of transition between different stages.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20052524/"}

A comparison of attention bias in people with psychophysiological insomnia, delayed sleep phase syndrome and good sleepers using the induced change blindness paradigm.", "text": "Cognitive models of insomnia suggest that selective attention may be involved in maintaining the disorder. However, direct assessment of selective attention is limited. Using the inducing change blindness (ICB) paradigm we aimed to determine whether there is attentional preference for sleep-related stimuli in psychophysiological insomnia (PI) relative to delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and good sleepers (GS). In the ICB task, a visual scene, comprising both sleep-related and neutral stimuli, 'flickers' back and forth with one element (sleep or neutral) of the scene changing between presentations. Therefore, a 2 x 3 totally between-participants design was employed. The dependent variable was the number of flickers it took for the participant to identify the change. Ninety individuals (30 per group) were classified using ICSD-R criteria, self-report diaries and wrist actigraphy. As predicted, PI detected a sleep-related change significantly quicker than DSPS and GS, and significantly quicker than a sleep-neutral change. Unexpectedly, DSPS detected a sleep-related change significantly quicker than GS. No other differences were observed between the two controls. These results support the notion that there is an attention bias to sleep stimuli in PI, suggesting that selective attention tasks such as the ICB may be a useful objective index of cognitive arousal in insomnia. The results also suggest that there may be an element of sleep preoccupation associated with DSPS.

As per the third International Classification of Sleep disorders (ICSD-3) insomnia can be defined as a state with repeated difficulty in sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. The conventional treatments approved for management of insomnia were benzodiazepines (BZDs) (estazolam, quazepam, triazolam, flurazepam and temazepam) and non-BZDs, also known as z-drugs (zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) doxepin as well as melatonin agonists, e.g. ramelteon. But the potential of these agents to address sleep problems has been limited due to substantial side effects associated with them like hangover, dependence and tolerance, rebound insomnia, muscular atonia, inhibition of respiratory system, cognitive dysfunctions, and increased anxiety. Recently, orexin neuropeptides have been identified as regulators of transition between wakefulness and sleep and documented to aid an initial transitory effect towards wakefulness by activating cholinergic/monoaminergic neural pathways of the ascending arousal system. This has led to the development of orexin peptides and receptors, as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sleep disorders with the advantage of having lesser side effects as compared to conventional treatments. The present review focuses on the orexin peptides and receptors signifying their physiological profile as well as the development of orexin receptor antagonists as novel strategies in sleep medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26922522/"}

This article discusses the function of napping and the impact of napping on sleep. The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep.

This study sought to assess whether perinatal sleep disturbances predicted depression and anxiety symptoms across each month of the first 6 months postpartum in women with a history of depression. Pregnant women without active depression at enrollment ( N = 159), 18 to 45 years of age, were recruited. In late pregnancy and for up to 6 months postpartum, women completed monthly online questionnaires including the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Repeated-measures multilevel models were used to predict depression and anxiety across the postpartum. The prevalence of insomnia was 20.4%, and the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 67.8% across the first 6 months postpartum. Postpartum insomnia and poor sleep quality at the between-subject and within-subject levels tended to uniquely predict greater depressive and anxiety symptoms, even after controlling for demographic characteristics, prenatal insomnia, and prenatal poor sleep quality. Most of the women in our sample had sleep disturbances across the perinatal period. Consistent with the extant literature, postpartum insomnia and poor sleep quality, but not prenatal measures of sleep, longitudinally predicted greater postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms. The chronic sleep deprivation of insomnia and the subjective experience of poor sleep quality are uniquely relevant risks of postpartum mood disorders.

Without conscious effort, most animals engage in a series of sleep-preparatory behaviors, such as nesting. These are stereotypical actions performed in a temporally structured pre-sleep phase. Researchers have examined these behaviors from an evolutionary perspective, as they must provide some advantage. One hypothesis is that they have an indirect fitness benefit by facilitating de-arousal, making it easier to transition from wakefulness to sleep. In humans, regular positive bedtime routines are considered a main pediatric dimension of sleep health. In adults, difficulty in de-arousal at bedtime is a major issue for people with insomnia. Cognitive models of insomnia stress the strict association between arousal and cognitive-emotional factors driving behaviors. However, there is a lack of a unified framework to address the interplay between pre-sleep behaviors, psychological processes, and arousal levels in promoting or inhibiting evening winding down and wake-to-sleep transition. This narrative review aims to explore the role of behavioral components of sleep regulation, by focusing on the dynamical association between pre-sleep behaviors, cognitions, motivations, emotions, and arousal in relation to sleep health.

The recommendations were prepared as a position of an expert panel, which included people from a number of clinical disciplines: family medicine, cardiology, psychiatry, sleep medicine and clinical psychopharmacology. The first step in treating sleep disorders is to establish proper diagnosis and, if possible, to initiate causal treatment. Moreover, cognitive and behavioural therapy for insomnia should also be used as the primary form of treatment, which can be supplemented, if not sufficiently effective, with pharmacological treatment. The main group of drugs used for treating insomnia are nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone, zaleplon). However, these drugs do not fully meet the needs of people over 65 years of age, primarily with regard to treatment safety. Therefore other classes of medicines, which are used for treatment of mental disorders, are prescribed off-label in this group of patients. Melatonin in a prolonged-release form is also indicated for this age group due to the high safety of the therapy. The management of insomnia in people over 65 years of age is a challenging task, given the need to seek compromise between treatment efficacy and safety.

Reduced sleep affects social and working functioning, productivity, and patient's quality of life, leading to a total of $100 billion per year in direct and indirect healthcare costs. Primary insomnia is unrelated to any other mental or medical illness; secondary insomnia co-occurs with other underlying medical, iatrogenic, or mental conditions. Epidemiological studies found a 40-50% comorbidity prevalence between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, suggesting a high relevance of mental health in insomniacs. Sleep disturbances also worsen the outcomes of several psychiatric disorders, leading to more severe psychopathology and incomplete remission, plausibly contributing to treatment-resistant conditions. Insomnia and psychiatric disorder coexistence can lead to polypharmacy, namely, the concurrent use of two or more medications in the same patient, regardless of their purpose or rationale. Polypharmacy increases the risk of using unnecessary drugs, the likelihood of drug interactions and adverse events, and reduces the patient's compliance due to regimen complexity. The workup of insomnia must consider the patient's sleep habits and inquire about any medical and mental concurrent conditions that must be handled to allow insomnia to be remitted adequately. Monotherapy or limited polypharmacy should be preferred, especially in case of multiple comorbidities, promoting multipurpose molecules with sedative properties and with bedtime administration. Also, non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia, such as sleep hygiene, relaxation training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be useful in secondary insomnia to confront behaviors and thoughts contributing to insomnia and help optimizing the pharmacotherapy. However, insomnia therapy should always be patient-tailored, considering drug indications, contraindications, and pharmacokinetics, besides insomnia phenotype, clinical picture, patient preferences, and side effect profile.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043331/"}

To shed light on this discrepancy, subjective estimates of sleep and PSG variables were compared in patients with PI and good sleeper controls (GSC). 100 patients with PI (age: 42.57 +/- 12.50 years, medication free for at least 14 days) and 100 GSC (41.12 +/- 13.99 years) with a sex distribution of 46 men and 54 women in each group were included. Both PSG and questionnaire variables showed clear impairments of sleep quality in PI compared with GSC. The arousal index within total sleep time was increased, which was mainly because of a strong increase within rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Subjectively, more PI than GSC subjects estimated wake times longer than obtained from PSG. Linear modeling analysis of subjective wake time in terms of PSG parameters revealed that in addition to PSG defined wake time, REM sleep time contributed significantly to subjective wake time. This REM sleep contribution was larger for PI than for GSC subjects. The findings suggest that REM sleep-related processes might contribute to subjectively disturbed sleep and the perception of waking time in patients with PI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18482106/"}

Two-thirds of patients reported significant insomnia symptoms at baseline. Baseline severity of sleep disruption and BDD symptoms were not related (r = 0.02). Pre-treatment sleep disruption did not predict BDD symptom reduction across treatment, nor did early sleep improvements predict greater BDD symptom improvement. Early BDD symptom improvement also did not predict later improvements in sleep. Limitations include the small sample, restricted ranges of BDD symptom severity and treatment response, and few metrics of sleep disruption. Although insomnia was disproportionately high in this sample and both BDD symptoms and sleep improved in treatment, results suggest sleep and BDD symptoms may function largely independent of one another.

The 5 sleep-related traits (chronotype, short sleep duration, long sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia) were associated with distinct genetic variants chosen as instrumental factors. Employing MR Egger's analysis of Mendelian randomization (MR), weighted median, weighted mode, and inverse variance weighted (IVW) methods to assess the 5 sleep traits in relation to hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, we subsequently conducted inverse MR analysis to examine the causal relationship between thyroid function and the 5 sleep characteristics. The IVW technique did not reveal a causal association between chronotype, short sleep duration, long sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, or insomnia and the risk of abnormal thyroid function in the study investigating the influence of sleep characteristics on this risk. The outcomes of the IVW approach were consistent with the remaining 3 methods. The IVW, weighted median, MR Egger, and weighted mode methods in the reverse magnetic resonance imaging investigation did not yield evidence of a causative association between the risk of time type, long sleep duration, and insomnia and abnormal thyroid function. In contrast, the weighted median and weighted mode methods showed a possible causal relationship between hypothyroidism and short sleep duration and daytime sleepiness. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust and no pleiotropy or heterogeneity was detected.

Outcome measures were Insomnia Severity Index and insomnia remission (Insomnia Severity Index <8). Therapist ratings of patient agreement as well as homework completion were significantly associated with sleep diary-derived global ABS. Therapist-rated patient agreement and homework completion as well as global ABS predicted greater insomnia symptoms reduction from pretreatment to posttreatment. Patient agreement also predicted insomnia symptoms reduction from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up. Patient agreement, adherence, and ABS measures during treatment significantly predicted insomnia remission at posttreatment, and all but therapist rating of homework completion predicted remission at 6-month follow-up. Greater patient agreement and adherence (therapist ratings and ABS) during treatment predicted better treatment outcome.

Actigraphy has been validated in people with sleep disturbances; however, the validity of scoring settings in people with chronic medical illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains unclear. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to compare actigraphy-customized scoring settings with polysomnography (PSG) for the measurement of sleep outcomes in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have insomnia. Participants underwent overnight sleep assessment simultaneously by PSG and actigraphy at the University of Illinois of Chicago Sleep Science Center. Fifty participants (35 men and 15 women) with mild-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-existing insomnia were included in the analysis. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were calculated independently from data derived from PSG and actigraphy. Actigraphy sleep outcome scores obtained at the default setting and several customized actigraphy settings were compared to the scored PSG results. Although no single setting was optimal for all sleep outcomes, the combination of 10 consecutive immobile minutes for sleep onset or end and an activity threshold of 10 worked well. Actigraphy overestimated TST and SE and underestimated WASO, but there was no difference in variance between PSG and actigraphy in TST and SE when the 10 × 10 combination was used. As the average TST and SE increased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase, and as the average WASO decreased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase. Results support the conclusion that the default actigraphy settings may not be optimal for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-existing insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899522/"}

The goal of this study was to determine whether paroxetine, a nonsedating antidepressant, would be effective in the treatment of patients with primary insomnia. Fifteen patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for primary insomnia received paroxetine at bedtime for 6 weeks in an open, flexible-dose trial (median dose = 20 mg). Patients were assessed with daily sleep diaries, baseline and treatment polysomnography, and weekly standardized clinical evaluations. Of the 14 patients who completed the study (1 dropped out owing to side effects), 11 improved with treatment, and 7 of these 11 no longer met diagnostic criteria for insomnia. Although self-reported sleep quality (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and daytime well-being (measured by the Profile of Mood States) improved with treatment, the quantity of sleep, measured by diary and by polysomnography, did not change consistently with these improvements. Power spectral analysis suggested that paroxetine treatment may be associated with decreases in power in frequencies within the delta and alpha frequency ranges. These results support the effectiveness of paroxetine in the acute treatment of primary insomnia.

Insomniacs' sleep showed a sleep-waking imbalance and a marked deficiency in stages 3 and 4. This deficiency seems to be similar to the age effect in normals, but more accentuated; it cannot be attributed merely to increased pressure of wakefulness.

Furthermore, nighttime sleep experience, measured by either PSG or self-report, was not a strong predictor of these daytime indices among either insomniacs or noninsomniacs. The results of this study support the conclusions that insomniacs do not exhibit heightened levels of daytime sleepiness and that routine fluctuations in sleep exert minimal influence on daytime sleepiness among insomniacs and noninsomniacs.

Effects of an antidepressant drug on sleep are important for its clinical profile. Rapid improvement of sleep quality is particularly indicated in depressed patients with insomnia, anxiety, agitation and suicidal thoughts. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of trazodone on sleep in depressed patients in comparison to other sleep promoting antidepressants: agomelatine, amitriptyline, doxepin, mianserine and mirtazapine according to analysis of scientific publications. Sedative antidepressants including trazodone are regarded as treatment of choice in depression with agitation, anxiety or insomnia. They are also frequently used in low dose to promote sleep, as an alternative to hypnotics. Such approach to treatment of insomnia in depressed patients protects them against dependence on hypnotic drugs. Additionally, the antagonistic action of antidepressants on serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors improves not only the sleep continuity, but promotes also slow wave sleep. Trazodone and mirtazapine in comparison to many other antidepressants do not suppress REM sleep. Antidepressants have different effects on sleep. In treatment of depression sedative antidepressants should be administered in the full, recommended dose. However, if they are administered as concomitant treatment only to promote sleep, low doses are indicated. Too late administration time and too high dose are the most common factors related to failure of insomnia treatment with these drugs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21870714/"}

The present study extended findings of remedy-related sleep stage alterations in human subjects by testing the feasibility of using two different NDS analytic approaches to assess remedy effects on human slow wave sleep EEG. Subjects (N=54) were young adult male and female college students with a history of coffee-related insomnia who participated in a larger 4-week study of the polysomnographic effects of homeopathic medicines on home-based all-night sleep recordings. Subjects took one bedtime dose of a homeopathic remedy (Coffea cruda or Nux vomica 30c). We computed multiscale entropy (MSE) and the correlation dimension (Mekler-D2) for stages 3 and 4 slow wave sleep EEG sampled in artifact-free 2-min segments during the first two rapid-eye-movement (REM) cycles for remedy and post-remedy nights, controlling for placebo and post-placebo night effects. MSE results indicate significant, remedy-specific directional effects, especially later in the night (REM cycle 2) (CC: remedy night increases and post-remedy night decreases in MSE at multiple sites for both stages 3 and 4 in both REM cycles; NV: remedy night decreases and post-remedy night increases, mainly in stage 3 REM cycle 2 MSE).

Today, music therapy, one of nonpharmacological treatment approaches, can be used for enhancing the sleep quality of individuals. The increase of individuals' sleep quality by using music therapy will enable nurses to intervene in problems associated with sleep disorders and prevent insomnia and other relevant problems. This study was conducted to determine the effect of music therapy on sleep quality of the students. The research was an experimental pretest-posttest control group design. The research was conducted among the students studying in the nursing department at a university in the east of Turkey in the spring term of the academic year of 2015-2016. Students who (1) got a total score of 5 and higher according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), (2) had no neurological/psychiatric disorder, (3) had no hearing problem, (4) received no medical treatment regarding sleep, and (5) volunteered to participate in the study were included in the study. The students who were included in the study were divided into experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group were instructed to keep the volume of the personal MP3 player to be used for listening to the music therapy below 70% and to use it for 1 h/d at most. No intervention was applied to students in the control group. They were asked to sustain their normal sleeping habits. To collect the data, a questionnaire prepared by the researchers for determining sociodemographic characteristics of the students and PSQI were used. As a result of the study, it was found that the posttest PSQI mean scores of students in the experimental group, listening to music therapy, were lower than the mean scores of the students in the control group, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant. As a result of this study, it was determined that music therapy increased the sleep quality of students.

The current study examined associations between sleep intraindividual variability and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia across different facets of sleep intraindividual variability (sleep duration, efficiency, and timing) and sleep measurement types (sleep diary and actigraphy). We pooled eight datasets (N = 3053 participants) that assessed repeated measures of sleep diary- and/or actigraphy-determined sleep across multiple days, as well as one-time measures of mental health or sleep disorder symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and insomnia). Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between sleep intraindividual variability and mental health or sleep disorder symptoms. Greater diary- and actigraphy-determined sleep duration intraindividual variability was associated with more depression symptoms (diary: b=0.02, p < .001; actigraphy: b=0.03, p = .006) and more insomnia symptoms (diary: b=0.02, p < .001; actigraphy: b=0.02, p < .001).

A total of 142 insomniacs and 724 controls selected from a general random sample of 1,741 individuals (aged ≥20 years) underwent a polysomnographic evaluation, completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, and were split into two groups based on their objective sleep duration: \"normal sleep duration\" (≥6 hours) and \"short sleep duration\" (<6 hours). The discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration was determined by two independent factors. Short sleepers reported more sleep than they objectively had, and insomniacs reported less sleep than controls with similar objective sleep duration. The additive effect of these two factors resulted in underestimation only in insomniacs with normal sleep duration. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 profile of high depression and anxiety and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder. Underestimation of sleep duration is prevalent among insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Anxious-ruminative traits and poor resources for coping with stress seem to mediate the underestimation of sleep duration. These data further support the validity and clinical utility of objective sleep measures in phenotyping insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20978224/"}

The purpose of our present study was to explore the relationship between genetically predicted sleep traits and poststroke functional outcomes with Mendelian randomization (MR) method. Instrumental variables for insomnia and sleep duration were adopted from genome-wide association studies data of European ancestry individuals. Summary data for functional outcome after ischemic stroke were retrieved from the Genetics of Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcome network. Inverse-variance weighted approach was adopted as the main analyses. Alternative MR approaches were used in sensitivity analyses. I<sup>2</sup> and Q value statistics were used to appraise the heterogeneity among genetic variants. In univariable analysis, genetic liability to insomnia was significantly associated with worse functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≥3) after ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10-1.54, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Genetic liability to short sleep, long sleep, and continuous sleep duration were not associated with poststroke functional outcome (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). Sensitivity analyses without adjustment for stroke severity also supported that insomnia was causally associated with poor functional outcome (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08-1.44, <i>p</i> = 0.003). In the multivariable MR analysis adjusting for potentially confounding traits including body mass index, depression, type 2 diabetes, smoking, and alcohol consumption, the overall patterns between genetic liability to insomnia and poststroke outcome remained (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). This MR study supports potential adverse effects of liability to insomnia on functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Interventions that address insomnia may offer a therapeutic target to improve recovery after ischemic stroke and warrant exploration in a clinical context.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36539296/"}

Habitual sleep duration or symptoms of insomnia were assessed as baseline exposure, and the outcome was incidence of hypertension. Subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess heterogeneity, and Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. Eleven studies (17 cohorts) were included. Short sleep duration, sleep continuity disturbance (SCD), early-morning awakening (EMA) and combined symptoms of insomnia increased the risk of hypertension incidence (the relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.21 (1.05-1.40) for short sleep duration, 1.20 (1.06-1.36) for SCD, 1.14 (1.07-1.20) for EMA and 1.05 (1.01-1.08) for combined insomnia symptoms). Less evidence exists to support conclusions about the association between long sleep duration or difficulty falling asleep (DFA) and hypertension incidence. No obvious heterogeneity or publication biases were found. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that short sleep duration and single/combined symptoms of insomnia (except DFA) are associated with an increased risk of hypertension incidence.

Automatic analysis of the polygraphic sleep recordings was carried out employing real-time signal processing (based on linear prediction), and an off-line sequential fuzzy clustering. Total sleep length did not vary significantly during medication, whereas other efficacy parameters such as sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset and number of nightly awakenings decreased significantly throughout the period of active medication. In one patient, midazolam was still effective after 151 days of administration. The ultrashort action (probably 3-4 h) of midazolam could be demonstrated by the distribution of the efficacy parameters, dividing the night into 2-h periods, by the unchanged total sleep length during medication compared with baseline and by the lack of any subjective clinical symptoms of hangover. The quantitative analysis of the signals showed that, although a decrease in the total amount of slow-wave sleep during long-term medication and withdrawal was detected, the total relative power in the delta band increased during drug administration. This was interpreted as redistribution of the delta activity during active medication. A lengthening of REM sleep was found during active medication probably attributable to intranight rebound. This was not followed by any clinical symptom of clinical REM rebound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6138088/"}

Each morning over a two week period, 77 licensed MC patients suffering from PTSD reported on the timing of previous night MC use and sleep disturbances. Within-person analyses found that shorter time gaps between previous night MC use and sleep start time was associated with lower likelihood of experiencing nightmares throughout the night, but it was not associated with nightly awakenings or waking up too early. Between-person analyses showed that individuals who used MC products with higher CBD concentrations reported fewer early awakenings.

Theories of insomnia have proposed that perceived sleeplessness triggers excessive intention and effort to sleep, ironically disturbing the normal initiation of sleep. The current study tested this specific association between (mis)perception of sleep and intrinsic motivation to think about sleep. The sample (n = 74) covered students and community living in Munich and surrounds with ages between 18 and 30 years. We assessed the subjective and objective sleep of participants using a sleep diary and actigraphy. Participants also completed a decision-making task (the pay-per-view task), where they had to decide between thinking about sleep vs. eating. As these options were associated with a variable monetary reward, participants typically experienced a conflict between their preferred topic and the reward for their choice. Multilevel logistic regression analyses showed that participants with greater SOL misperception (i.e., longer subjective relative to objective SOL) forgo a greater reward for the opportunity to think about sleep. The non-clinical nature of our sample may limit the implication of the findings for clinical levels of insomnia. Results support the cognitive model of insomnia, suggesting that perception of sleeplessness is associated with higher intrinsic motivation to engage in sleep-related thinking.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32553998/"}

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of bright light therapy for mild-to-moderate stroke patients with insomnia. This study was randomized, double blind, and placebo controlled. A 2-week trial was conducted on patients with mild-to-moderate stroke who had poststroke insomnia. Only patients who had experienced a first episode of stroke were enrolled in this study. Sleep parameters were measured using the Actiwatch Spectrum Pro for 7 days before and after light therapy. The instrument specifically collected data concerning sleep, mood state, fatigue, and subjective quality of life. Participants with poststroke insomnia received bright light therapy (10,000 lux) or placebo therapy for 30 minutes in the early morning. A total of 112 eligible participants entered the study, but only 56 patients were randomized to treatment (27 to bright light therapy and 29 to placebo therapy). Results from analysis of variance showed that the mean change of sleep latency (F(1,55) =4.793, p = .033) and sleep efficiency (F(1,55) = 5.625, p = .022) were significantly superior in bright light therapy over placebo. Bright light therapy resulted in significant improvements in daytime sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and quality of life in study participants (p < .05). Bright light therapy is a nonpharmacological treatment of early, poststroke insomnia in patients who had a mild to moderate stroke. In addition, bright light therapy is effective for the treatment of daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and depression and for improving quality of life in patients with poststroke insomnia.

Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data from 37 patients with ID and 30 well-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recorded during wakefulness and different sleep stages and subsequently analyzed. A Markov chain model was used to estimate the transition probability between each stage. The FC between the ACC (set as the seed) and voxels across the whole brain was calculated. A linear mixed effect model was used to determine the group-by-stage interaction of the seed-based connectivity. The correlation between the sleep-stage transition probability and the ACC-based connectivity was explored. Patients with ID exhibited a higher likelihood of transitioning from N2 to wakefulness than HCs. A significant group-by-stage interaction of connectivity with the bilateral ACC was observed in the cerebellar, subcortical, and cortical regions. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found in patients with ID between the transition probability from N2 to wakefulness and the FC of the ACC with the anterior cerebellum in N2 (r = 0.48). This exploratory analysis indicates that enhanced FC between the ACC and cerebellum represents a potential neural pathway underlying the greater likelihood of patients with ID waking during N2 sleep. These findings contribute to an emerging framework that reveals the link between sleep maintenance difficulty and ACC function, further highlighting the possibility that N2 sleep is a therapeutic target for meaningfully reducing sleep disruption.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36462192/"}

Sleep latencies of insomniacs (52.0 min) and normals (12.6 min) differed (P less than 0.001). There were no other sleep stage differences. Non-parametric statistics showed that, during wakefulness, insomniacs had significantly more beta activity and less alpha activity than normals. During stage 1, insomniacs had significantly more beta activity than normals. There were no differences during stages 2, 3, or 4. During REM sleep the insomniacs again had significantly more beta activity than the normals. Data from both EEG leads were generally consistent. Thus, insomniacs have increased beta and decreased alpha activity relative to normals prior to the onset of stage 2 sleep. This agrees with our previous finding of increased presleep physiological activity in insomniacs. However, the present data also suggest that a CNS component of this activity, reflected by increased beta EEG, is reactivated during REM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2420556/"}

In this report, long-term effects are compared. Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group.

The cognitive domains were episodic memory, verbal fluency, perceptual speed, executive functioning, and global cognition (aggregated measure). A series of mixed linear models were run separately in each study and then compared to assess the level and rate of change in cognitive functioning across each sleep disturbance parameter. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, hypnotic usage, depressive symptoms, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular, and metabolic conditions. By using a coordinated analytic approach, comparable construct-level measurements were generated, and results from identical statistical models were qualitatively compared across studies. While the pattern of statistically significant results varied across studies, subjective sleep disturbances were consistently associated with worse cognition and steeper cognitive decline. Insomnia symptoms were associated with poorer episodic memory and participants sleeping less or more than 7-8 hours had a steeper decline in perceptual speed. In addition, daytime napping (>2 hours) was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with all examined cognitive domains. Most observed associations were study-specific (except for daytime napping), and a majority of association estimates remained significant after adjusting for covariates. This rigorous multicenter investigation further supports the importance of sleep disturbance, including insomnia, long and short sleep duration, and daytime napping on baseline cognitive functioning and rate of change among older adults.

In the current study, we examined plasma orexin-A levels in patients with insomnia disorder and in normal sleepers. We also studied the possible mechanisms underlying changes in orexin-A levels between the study groups; this included investigations of prepro-orexin and orexin receptor gene polymorphisms as well as exploration of other variables. We measured plasma orexin-A levels in 228 patients with insomnia disorder and 282 normal sleepers. The results indicated that the patients with insomnia disorder had significantly higher orexin-A levels than normal sleepers (63.42±37.56 vs. 54.84±23.95pg/ml). A positive relationship was detected between orexin-A level and age in patients with insomnia disorder. Orexin-A levels were elevated in relation to course of insomnia, as well as in relation to increased Insomnia Severity Index score. None of the evaluated prepro-orexin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms were informative between the two study populations. After sequencing all orexin receptor exons, one variation (rs2271933) in the OX1R gene and one variation (rs2653349) in the OX2R gene were found. However, no significant differences were found in either genotypic or allelic frequency distributions between the two study groups. It is suggested that the increased plasma orexin-A levels in patients with insomnia disorder are associated with the course and severity of insomnia, but not with prepro-orexin and orexin receptor gene polymorphisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27988352/"}

Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34 ± 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects. CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI. NAME: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes. URL: clinicaltrials.gov.

This study compared sleep IIV across four subgroups: noncomplaining good sleepers (NG), complaining poor sleepers (CP), complaining good sleepers (CG), and noncomplaining poor sleepers (NP). This study analyzed 14 days of sleep diary data from 723 adults. Participants were classified according to presence/absence of a sleep complaint and presence/absence of poor sleep. A 2 × 2 multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed to explore differences on five measures of sleep IIV: intraindividual standard deviation in total sleep time (iSD TST), sleep onset latency (iSD SOL), wake after sleep onset (iSD WASO), number of nightly awakenings (iSD NWAK), and sleep efficiency (iSD SE). MANCOVA revealed significant main effects of poor sleep, sleep complaint, and their interaction on sleep IIV. Poor sleepers exhibited greater IIV across all sleep parameters compared to good sleepers. Similarly, individuals with a sleep complaint exhibited greater IIV compared to individuals with no complaint. The interaction revealed that iSD SOL was significantly greater among CP than NP, and iSD NWAK was significantly greater among CG than NG. Greater night-to-night variability in specific sleep parameters was present among complaining versus noncomplaining sleepers in good and poor sleep subgroups.

{"id": "26866361", "title": "The bidirectional relation between emotional reactivity and sleep: From disruption to recovery.", "text": "Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and greatly affect consecutive emotional reactivity, while sleep quality itself can be strongly affected by reactions to previous emotional events. In this review, we shed light on this bidirectional relation through examples of pathology: insomnia and bipolar disorder. We show that both experimental sleep deprivation and insomnia are related to increased emotional reactivity and increased amygdala activation upon emotional stimuli presentation, and that particularly Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is important for emotional processing and reorganization of emotion-specific brain activity. Increased emotional reactivity affects REM sleep quality and sleep spindles, while REM sleep is particularly affected in insomnia, possibly related to condition-specific hyperarousal levels. Normal sleep onset deactivation of brain regions important for emotional processing (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) is further affected in insomnia. In bipolar disorder, sleep disturbances are common in both symptomatic and nonsymptomatic phases. Both amygdala and ACC volume and function are affected in bipolar disorder, with the ACC showing phase-dependent resting state activity differences. Deficient Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABA-ergic activity of this region might play a role in sleep disturbances and their influence on emotional reactivity, given the inhibitory role of GABA on brain activity during sleep and its deficiency in both bipolar disorder and insomnia. Promising findings of normalizing brain activity in both insomnia and bipolar disorder upon treatment may inspire a focus on treatment studies investigating the normalization of sleep, emotional reactivity, and their corresponding brain activity patterns.

Psychotropic drugs are well known to have an effect on the sleep/wake cycle, but there is only limited information about the sleep effects of nonpsychotropic medications. Cardiovascular drugs, especially beta-blockers, which are widely used drugs, often change the sleep architecture and cause nightmares and insomnia.

Sleep measures included self-reported adherence to NSF guidelines on sleep duration (sleeping between 7 and 9 hours per night), and self-reported difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia). Brain structural measures included global and regional cortical or subcortical morphometry (thickness, surface area, volume), global and tract-related white matter microstructure, brain age gap (difference between chronological age and age estimated from brain scan), and total volume of white matter lesions. Longer-than-recommended sleep duration was associated with lower overall grey and white matter volumes, lower global and regional cortical thickness and volume measures, higher brain age gap, higher volume of white matter lesions, higher mean diffusivity globally and in thalamic and association fibers, and lower volume of the hippocampus. Shorter-than-recommended sleep duration was related to higher global and cerebellar white matter volumes, lower global and regional cortical surface areas, and lower fractional anisotropy in projection fibers. Self-reported insomnia was associated with higher global gray and white matter volumes, and with higher volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen. Sleeping longer than recommended by the NSF is associated with a wide range of differences in brain structure, potentially indicative of poorer brain health. Sleeping less than recommended is distinctly associated with lower cortical surface areas.

In this randomized crossover controlled trial, we compared the effects of a peaceful Buddhist MV intervention to a usual-care control condition before bedtime on subjective and objective sleep quality in middle-aged and older adults with chronic insomnia. The study was conducted in a hospital's sleep laboratory. We randomly assigned 38 subjects, aged 50-75 years, to an MV/usual-care sequence or a usual-care/MV sequence. After pretest data collection, testing was held on two consecutive nights, with subjects participating in one condition each night according to their assigned sequence. Each intervention lasted 30 min. Sleep was assessed using PSG and self-report questionnaires. After controlling for baseline data, sleep-onset latency was significantly shorter by approximately 2 min in the MV condition than in the usual-care condition (p = .002). The MV intervention had no significant effects relative to the usual care on any other sleep parameters assessed by PSG or self-reported sleep quality. These results suggest that an MV intervention may be effective in promoting sleep.

Intention-to-treat multiple regression with multiple imputations showed that after controlling for baseline values, compared to the Control group (n = 51), the Intervention group (n = 52) had lower ISI (p = .011, d = 0.51) and SDis (p = .036, d = 0.42) post-intervention, but differences in SRI, depression, anxiety, and sleep-wake state discrepancy parameters (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset) were not meaningful (P-values >.40). Providing feedback and guidance about sensor-based sleep parameters reduced insomnia severity and sleep disturbance but did not alter sleep-wake state discrepancy in individuals with insomnia more than sleep hygiene and education.

In the current study, we examined EEG spectral power values for standard frequency bands as indices of cortical arousal and sleep protecting mechanisms during sleep in 25 patients with primary insomnia and 29 good sleeper controls. Patients with primary insomnia demonstrated significantly elevated spectral power values in the EEG beta and sigma frequency band during NREM stage 2 sleep. No differences were observed in other frequency bands or during REM sleep. Based on prior studies suggesting that EEG beta activity represents a marker of cortical arousal and EEG sleep spindle (sigma) activity is an index of sleep protective mechanisms, our findings may provide further evidence for the concept that a simultaneous activation of wake-promoting and sleep-protecting neural activity patterns contributes to the experience of non-restorative sleep in primary insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960269/"}
{"id": "37020247", "title": "The sleep response to stress: how sleep reactivity can help us prevent insomnia and promote resilience to trauma.", "text": "Sleep reactivity is a predisposition to sleep disturbance during environmental perturbations, pharmacological challenges, or stressful life events. Consequently, individuals with highly reactive sleep systems are prone to insomnia disorder after a stressor, engendering risk of psychopathology and potentially impeding recovery from traumatic stress. Thus, there is tremendous value in ameliorating sleep reactivity to foster a sleep system that is robust to stress exposure, ultimately preventing insomnia and its downstream consequences. We reviewed prospective evidence for sleep reactivity as a predisposition to insomnia since our last review on the topic in 2017. We also reviewed studies investigating pre-trauma sleep reactivity as a predictor of adverse post-traumatic sequelae, and clinical trials that reported the effect of behavioural treatments for insomnia on mitigating sleep reactivity. Most studies measured sleep reactivity via self-report using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), demonstrating high scores on this scale reliably indicate a sleep system with a lower capacity to tolerate stress. Nascent evidence suggests elevated sleep reactivity prior to trauma increases the risk of negative posttraumatic outcomes, namely acute stress disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Lastly, sleep reactivity appears most responsive to behavioural insomnia interventions when delivered early during the acute phase of insomnia. Overall, the literature strongly supports sleep reactivity as a premorbid vulnerability to incident acute insomnia disorder when faced with an array of biopsychosocial stressors. The FIRST identifies individuals at risk of insomnia a priori, thereby guiding early interventions toward this vulnerable population to prevent insomnia and promote resilience to adversity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020247/"}

The psychometric properties were assessed using the item response theory approach. Reliability analyses were assessed. Convergent validity of the GSES with the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale-16 (DBAS-16), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were explored. For the predictive validity, we used an independent-samples t-test for comparing the total score of the GSES between poor sleepers and good sleepers following the PSQI, and between clinical insomnia and non-clinical insomnia groups according to the ISI. The cut-off score of the GSES was examined. A single factor structure explaining 49.2% of the total variance was detected using the EFA. The CFA also found single-factor good fit indices. Cronbach's alpha and omega values were 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. There were statistically significant correlations between the GSES and DBAS-16, ISI, PSQI, and DASS-21 in convergent validity. In the Graded Response Model, the GSES was more efficient and provided reasonable information at the -0.75 to 2.25 theta level.

We recruited 259 adolescents (69 with current insomnia) and their parents (256 middle-aged adults, 78 with current insomnia). Insomnia severity and sleep quality were measured by the Insomnia Severity Inventory (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Pain and somatic symptoms were measured by the Somatic Symptom Inventory and Visual Analogue Scale for overall pain. Subjects with insomnia scored higher on all measures of pain and somatic symptoms than non-insomnia patients, in both adolescents and adults (P<.001). Both pain and somatic measures were associated with ISI and PSQI scores after controlling for age, sex, depressive and anxiety symptoms. There was an interaction effect between insomnia and female sex on pain and somatic symptoms (P<.05), especially in adults. Pain and somatic symptoms ran in family with moderate heritability (range h(2)=0.15-0.42). The phenotypic associations of ISI and PSQI with pain and somatic measures were both contributed by genetic (range p(G)=0.41-0.96) and environmental (range p(E)=0.27-0.40) factors with a major genetic contribution. In summary, insomnia and poor sleep quality are closely associated with pain and somatic symptoms. Insomnia seems to modulate the sex differences in pain and somatic symptoms, especially in the adult population. A shared genetic predisposition might underlie the associations of insomnia and sleep quality with pain and somatic symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22277557/"}

The main goal was to determine the differences in sensitivity to caffeine between the groups. We investigated the effects on daytime sleep of placebo or caffeine after a night of total sleep deprivation (SD). We hypothesized that insomniacs would be more affected by caffeine, which would suggest a change in adenosine receptor (number or sensitivity) in primary insomniacs. Six primary insomnia patients (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)) and six normal volunteers with no sleep complaints participated in a double-blind study with caffeine or placebo administered under a cross-over design with each subject serving as his or her own control. The participants did not have a history of drinking coffee or caffeinated beverages. Data from all-night polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were collected in the sleep research laboratory of National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubirán. During the baseline night, patients with insomnia had significantly less delta sleep and less total sleep time than the normal volunteers. Mean sleep latency under basal MSLT did not differ between the groups. However, insomnia patients had significantly less total sleep during each nap compared to normal volunteers. After one night of total SD and under caffeine administration, the insomniacs had significantly longer sleep latency and less total sleep time in MSLT compared to normal volunteers. After SD, healthy volunteers reduced sleep latencies in MSLT with or without caffeine. Patients with insomnia had a higher sensitivity to the diurnal awakening effect of caffeine even after one night of SD. This suggests that changes in the adenosine receptors could, in part, be responsible for the hyperarousal state that has been reported in primary insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16459138/"}

Urban, community-based. Nine hundred fifty-four adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition based current insomnia (46.6 ± 12.6 y; 69.4% female). None. At baseline, participants were divided into four symptom profile groups based on quantitative criteria. Follow-up assessment 1 y later revealed that approximately 60% of participants retained the same symptom profile, and were hence judged to be phenotypes. Stability varied significantly by phenotype, such that sleep onset insomnia (SOI) was the least stable (42%), whereas combined insomnia (CI) was the most stable (69%). Baseline symptom groups (cross-sectionally defined) differed significantly across various clinical indices, including daytime impairment, depression, and anxiety. Importantly, however, a comparison of stable phenotypes (longitudinally defined) did not reveal any differences in impairment or comorbid psychopathology. Another interesting finding was that whereas all other insomnia phenotypes showed evidence of an elevated wake drive both at night and during the day, the 'neither criterion' phenotype did not; this latter phenotype exhibited significantly higher daytime sleepiness despite subthreshold onset and maintenance difficulties. By adopting a stringent, stability-based definition, this study offers timely and important data on the longitudinal trajectory of specific insomnia phenotypes. With the exception of daytime sleepiness, few clinical differences are apparent across stable phenotypes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25325468/"}

Logistic regression analyses are run with sociodemographic, health, and mental health factors as predictors of three outcomes: new prescription medication use, sleep treatment use, and sleep treatment out of a doctor's recommendation in 2010. New sleep medication prescriptions were started by 7.68%, 12.62% started using a new sleep treatment, and 31.93% were using the treatment outside of their doctor's recommendation. Common predictors included greater severity of insomnia, worsening insomnia, older age, and use of psychiatric medications. New prescription medication use was also associated with poorer mental and physical health, whereas new sleep treatment was associated with being White, higher educated, and drinking less alcohol. Starting a new prescription sleep medication may reflect poorer health and higher health care utilization, whereas beginning a sleep treatment may reflect an individual's awareness of treatments and determination to treat their problem.

This was a prospective pilot cohort of pregnant people between 23 to 36 weeks' gestation at a single institution between 2021 and 2022. Standardized questionnaires were used to measure clinical insomnia and anxiety. Objective sleep duration was measured using a wrist-worn actigraphy device. Primary outcomes were systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MAP) non-invasive BP measurements. Separate sequential multivariable linear regression models fit with generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to separately assess associations between anxiety (independent variable) and each BP parameter (dependent variables), after adjusting for potential confounders (Model 1). Additional analyses were conducted adding insomnia and the interaction between anxiety and insomnia as independent variables (Model 2), and adding short sleep duration and the interaction between anxiety and short sleep duration as independent variables (Model 3), to evaluate any moderating effects on BP parameters. Among the 60 participants who completed the study, 15 (25%) screened positive for anxiety, 11 (18%) had subjective insomnia, and 34 (59%) had objective short sleep duration. In Model 1, increased anxiety was not associated with increases in any BP parameters.

Insomnia is disabling and prevalent after childhood cancer (26-29%) and negatively impacts quality of life, fatigue, pain, and general functioning and is often associated with other (mental) health problems. Insomnia and a history of childhood cancer both increase the risk of adverse health outcomes, posing a double burden for adolescents who had childhood cancer. The first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). However, access to this type of care is often limited. The guided online CBT-I treatment \"i-Sleep\" has been developed to facilitate access via online care. i-Sleep is shown effective in adult (breast cancer) patients, but it is unknown if iCBT-I is effective in pediatric oncology. We developed a youth version of i-Sleep. Our aim is to evaluate its effectiveness in a national randomized-controlled clinical trial comparing iCBT-I to a waiting-list control condition at 3 and 6 months (n = 70).

Twenty-eight outpatients were treated by CBT for 8 weeks. The treatment outcome was estimated by means of differences among subjective clinical scales and polysomnography variables assessed before and after the treatment period. The therapeutic effect in a subgroup of 15 patients who had previously received hypnotics and were successively withdrawn during weeks 2-6 was compared to the effect achieved in patients who had not used hypnotics before CBT. There were no significant differences in baseline subjective and objective sleep characteristics between the hypnotic abusers and non-abusers. According to clinical scales and most polysomnographic measures, CBT was highly effective in both groups of subjects; it produced the greatest changes in total sleep time, REM sleep and sleep efficiency. Unexpectedly, discontinuation of hypnotics, as a factor in the analysis, was followed by an additional improvement of sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset parameters. Our study confirmed the efficacy of CBT in both hypnotic-abusing and non-abusing patients with chronic insomnia.

All patients completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), a sleep-related Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) and nightly sleep diaries for 2 weeks prior to receiving their assigned treatment. They then completed sleep diaries throughout an 8-week acute treatment period and during a 2-week period at a posttherapy follow-up. A subset of the sample (n=67) also completed polysomnography immediately before and after completing their assigned treatment. Preliminary regression analyses conducted with a small subset (n=15) of the patients receiving CBT showed those with relatively high levels of unhelpful sleep-related beliefs (Type 1 patients), as reflected by their pretherapy responses to the DBAS and SES questionnaires, showed markedly greater reductions in nocturnal wakefulness in response to CBT than did those (Type 2 patients) reporting less pronounced sleep-related beliefs. Given these findings, we used the regression equation derived from our initial analyses to dichotomize our entire sample into Type 1 (n=82; 52.9%) and Type 2 (n=73; 47.1%) subgroups.

Relative to patients assigned to the PMR and CON conditions, CBT-treated Type 1 patients showed better performance across multiple subjective and objective benchmarks of clinically significant improvement, whereas the CBT-treated Type 2 patients did not. Results suggest that insomnia patients' pretherapy cognitive dispositions predict CBT outcome, and those with a pronounced sense of sleep-related helplessness are best suited for this treatment which targets this cognitive stance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19027437/"}

This randomized clinical trial enrolled 47 FM patients with chronic insomnia complaints. The study compared CBT, sleep hygiene (SH) instructions, and usual FM care alone. Outcome measures were subjective (sleep logs) and objective (actigraphy) total sleep time, sleep efficiency, total wake time, sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and questionnaire measures of global insomnia symptoms, pain, mood, and quality of life. Forty-two patients completed baseline and continued into treatment. Sleep logs showed CBT-treated patients achieved nearly a 50% reduction in their nocturnal wake time by study completion, whereas SH therapy- and usual care-treated patients achieved only 20% and 3.5% reductions on this measure, respectively. In addition, 8 (57%) of 14 CBT recipients met strict subjective sleep improvement criteria by the end of treatment compared with 2 (17%) of 12 SH therapy recipients and 0% of the usual care group. Comparable findings were noted for similar actigraphic improvement criteria. The SH therapy patients showed favorable outcomes on measures of pain and mental well-being. This finding was most notable in an SH therapy subgroup that self-elected to implement selected CBT strategies.

At the global level, dysfunctional beliefs and poor subjective quality of sleep mediated the neuroticism-insomnia path; at the trait-specific level, these variables mediated the anxiety-insomnia path and partially mediated the effects of vulnerability and self-consciousness on insomnia; some other relations were essentially indirect effects (between depression and insomnia).

In a secondary analysis of the Brief Behavioral Therapy for Cancer-Related Insomnia (BBT-CI) clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02165839), the authors examined the effects of BBT-CI on headache outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Patients with breast cancer who were receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either the BBT-CI intervention or the Healthy EAting Education Learning for healthy sleep (HEAL) control intervention, and both were delivered over 6 weeks by trained staff. Headache outcomes and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Mixed-effects models were used to examine longitudinal headache outcomes in the groups according to the intention to treat. Principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were conducted to reduce 16 variables for data-driven phenotyping. Patients in the BBT-CI arm (n = 73) exhibited a significant reduction in headache burden over time (P = .02; effect size [Cohen d] = 0.43), whereas the reduction was not significant among those in the HEAL arm (n = 66). The first principal component was positively loaded by headache, sleep, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting and was negatively loaded by cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed 3 natural clusters. Cluster I (n = 58) featured the highest burden of headache, insomnia, and nausea/vomiting; cluster II (n = 50) featured the lowest HRV despite a low burden of headache and insomnia; and cluster III (n = 31) showed an inverse relation between HRV and headache-insomnia, signifying autonomic dysfunction. BBT-CI is efficacious in reducing headache burden in breast cancer survivors. Patient phenotyping demonstrates a headache type featuring sleep disturbance, nausea/vomiting, and low physical functioning-revealing similarities to migraine.

However, this article examines contemporary scientific understanding of this age-old conundrum, proposing not only that yawning is a universal component of sleep's normal stimulus control paradigm, but that the conditioned yawn reflex might be harnessed to treat insomnia disorder. The core features of yawning as a ubiquitous, involuntary, periodic and conditionable behaviour; its associated actions on arousal, biofeedback and selective attention, as well as thermoregulation and airway patency; and its potential to signal and promote sleep engagement, lead to the proposition that the conditioned yawn reflex as therapy (CYRaT) is a feasible and potentially effective novel therapeutic for sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia disorder.

The I-SSD B cluster performed worse than I-SSD A and I-NSD for sustained attention (P ≤ 0.05). In an exploratory analysis, <i>q</i>-EEG revealed reduced spectral power also in I-SSD B before (Delta, Alpha, Beta-1) and after sleep-onset (Beta-2) compared to I-SSD A and I-NSD (P ≤ 0.05). Two insomnia clusters derived from cluster analysis differ in sleep onset HRV. Preliminary data suggest evidence for three clusters in insomnia with differences for sustained attention and sleep-onset <i>q</i>-EEG.

We investigated whether a composite sleep health score is associated with symptoms of depression among Japanese female hospital nurses. Participants were nurses (n = 2482, all women, age 31.2 ± 8.9 years) working at three general hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. A cross-sectional survey, conducted in 2015, assessed self-reported sleep and symptoms of depression. Sleep health was categorized as \"good\" or \"poor\" across five dimensions: satisfaction, daytime sleepiness, mid-sleep time, efficiency, and duration. A composite sleep health score was calculated by summing the number of \"poor\" dimensions. Depression was defined by depressed mood, loss of interest, or at least one of those symptoms (\"depression symptoms\"). Associations between sleep health and symptoms of depression were evaluated with multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and hypnotic medication use. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, sleep health symptoms of poor satisfaction, efficiency, and duration were significantly associated with depressed mood; daytime sleepiness and poor efficiency were significantly associated with loss of interest; and poor satisfaction, daytime sleepiness, mid-sleep time, and efficiency were significantly associated with having at least one depressive symptom. The composite sleep health score was associated in a graded fashion with greater odds of depression symptoms. Individual and composite sleep health scores were associated with symptoms of depression. Assessing composite measures of multidimensional sleep health may help to better understand the well-known associations between poor sleep and depression and lead to improved intervention strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31954287/"}

However, understanding the transaction between normal variations in emotional experiences and sleep can shed light on the premorbid vulnerabilities that trigger the evolution of affect and sleep into more problematic states. The present study used a 2-week daily sampling approach to examine the impact of day-to-day variations in positive and negative affect on nightly self-reported sleep-onset latency, sleep duration and sleep quality in a sample of young women. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed temporal relations between positive and negative affect states and sleep parameters. Specifically, different aspects of both positive and negative affect were uniquely predictive of sleep indices, with sadness and serenity acting as the most consistent predictors. Additionally, better sleep quality was predictive of greater happiness the following day. These results highlight the importance of how our daily emotional experiences influence our nightly sleep and, in turn, how our sleep has an impact on our daily affect. Moreover, our findings may offer insight into the progression of normative levels of affect and sleep as they develop into comorbid depression, anxiety and insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082413/"}

The main blood-entering components of Anshen Dropping Pills were detected and identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The rationality of the formula was assessed by using enrichment analysis based on the relationship between drugs and symptoms, and core targets of its active components were selected as the the potential anti-insomnia targets of Anshen Dropping Pills through network pharmacology analysis. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction(PPI) network, Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on the core targets. An active component-core target network for Anshen Dropping Pills was constructed. Finally, the effects of low-, medium-, and high-dose groups of Anshen Dropping Pills on sleep episodes, sleep duration, and sleep latency in mice were measured by supraliminal and subliminal pentobarbital sodium experiments. Moreover, total scores of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI) scale was used to evaluate the changes before and after the treatment with Anshen Dropping Pills in a clinical study. The enrichment analysis based on the relationship between drugs and symptoms verified the rationality of the Anshen Dropping Pills formula, and nine blood-entering components of Anshen Dropping Pills were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The network proximity revealed a significant correlation between eight components and insomnia, including magnoflorine, liquiritin, spinosin, quercitrin, jujuboside A, ginsenoside Rb_3, glycyrrhizic acid, and glycyrrhetinic acid. Network pharmacology analysis indicated that the major anti-insomnia pathways of Anshen Dropping Pills involved substance and energy metabolism, neuroprotection, immune system regulation, and endocrine regulation. Seven core genes related to insomnia were identified: APOE, ALB, BDNF, PPARG, INS, TP53, and TNF. In summary, Anshen Dropping Pills could increase sleep episodes, prolong sleep duration, and reduce sleep latency in mice. Clinical study results demonstrated that Anshen Dropping Pills could decrease total scores of PSQI scale. This study reveals the pharmacodynamic basis and potential multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway effects of Anshen Dropping Pills, suggesting that its anti-insomnia mechanisms may be associated with the regulation of insomnia-related signaling pathways.

While it has been frequently shown that older individuals perform more poorly than young adults on a broad range of tasks, these findings do not hold well for periods of nocturnal performance or performance during sleep loss. It is possible that these findings may be accounted for to some extent by the decrease in amplitude of the circadian body temperature curve in older individuals.

A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18673164/"}

Sleep efficiency was derived from daily sleep diaries collected at baseline (days 1-7), early treatment (days 8-21), late treatment (days 22-63), and post week (days 64-70). The behavioral components (sleep restriction, stimulus control) were delivered during late treatment in MBTI. For MBSR and MBTI, the pre-to-post change in mean levels of sleep efficiency were significantly larger than the change in mean levels for the SM control, but the change in IIV was not significantly different. During early and late treatment, MBSR showed a larger increase in mean levels of sleep efficiency and a larger decrease in IIV relative to the SM control. At late treatment, MBTI had a larger increase in the mean level of sleep efficiency compared to SM, but the IIV was not significantly different.

Patients were instructed to wear the glasses from 20:00 hours until bedtime for 2 weeks. We assessed sleep state (sleep quality on a visual analog scale, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire [MEQ], and a sleep diary) and depressive symptoms at baseline and after 2 weeks. Data were analyzed with a full analysis set. In total, 20 patients were randomly assigned to the BB and placebo groups (BB group, n = 10; placebo group, n = 10). There were three dropouts (BB group, n = 1; placebo group, n = 2). At baseline, sleep quality, sleep latency (assessed via a sleep diary), and antipsychotics use differed between the groups. To take account of these differences, the baseline sleep state or depressive symptoms and antipsychotics use were used as covariates in the later analysis. The change scores for sleep quality did not show a significant improvement in the BB group compared with the placebo group (mean [standard deviation, SD] scores for BB versus placebo: 36.1 [31.7] versus 16.2 [15.1], p = 0.43), although half of the BB group showed a clear improvement in sleep quality.

Biological measurements which emerged as potentially useful diagnostic instruments were polysomnography-derived cyclic alternating pattern, actigraphy, and BDNF levels, followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and certain neuroimaging patterns (mainly for the activity of frontal and pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia); yet, these findings need replication, as well as establishment of commonly accepted methodology and diagnostic cut-off points. Routine polysomnography, EEG spectral analysis, heart rate variability, skin conductance, thermoregulation, oxygen consumption, HPA axis, and inflammation indices were not shown to be of satisfactory diagnostic value.

These findings suggest that a mindful nonjudgmental attitude toward the self and a forgiving interpersonal disposition may reduce rumination by helping individuals let go of thoughts, mental images, and emotions, thus promoting better sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36454149/"}

This study explores rumination and worry in insomnia by examining: 1) whether those high and low on rumination and worry differ on subjective sleep measures, and 2) whether rumination and worry are distinct processes in insomnia. Participants (N=242) were diagnosed with an insomnia disorder by sleep experts. Participants completed measures of worry and rumination and maintained a 2-week daily sleep log. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance found no main effect of worry; although high and low ruminators differed on several sleep log indices, including sleep efficiency, wakefulness after sleep onset and sleep quality. Factor analysis supported the idea that rumination and worry are separate constructs. Whereas previous research has focused on worry in insomnia, these findings suggest that rumination is important for understanding sleep disturbance. Further, although rumination and worry are both repetitive thought processes, these results indicate that they are distinct processes within insomnia and should be treated as such. The results are discussed with respect to treatment implications for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20362977/"}

The present study was designed to further evaluate this issue within a large scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term trial. Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for primary insomnia participated in the study from January 2000 through October 2001. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (zolpidem 10 mg or placebo) for a period of 12 weeks. Ten pills were provided in foil packs on an every-other-week basis, and patients were instructed to take no fewer than 3 and no more than 5 pills per week. Sleep was evaluated daily with sleep diaries. Pill use was recorded in the sleep diaries. 199 patients (mean +/- SD age = 41.0 +/- 12.8 years; 71% female) were randomly assigned to treatment. On mean, patients receiving zolpidem exhibited (vs. baseline) a 42% decrease in sleep latency, a 52% reduction in number of awakenings, a 55% decrease in wake time after sleep onset, and a 27% increase in total sleep time. These positive clinical gains did not diminish with time and were not associated with dose escalation. There was also no evidence of rebound insomnia. Over a period of 12 weeks of intermittent treatment with zolpidem, sleep continuity was significantly improved, the clinical gains were sustained, and there was no evidence of subjective rebound insomnia between doses or increases in the amount of medication used during the study interval.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15323600/"}

Although social support was found to be associated with quality of sleep in a recent meta-analysis, this relationship was never studied in older BZD users. This study thus aims to examine how social support is associated with quality of sleep in older BZD users.<b>Method:</b> Seventy-two older adults (age 60-85) using BZD were recruited. Data was collected during the pre-test of the ''PASSE-60+; Support program for a successful withdrawal, NCT02281175'' study. Quality of sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while social support was evaluated with the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ-6).<b>Results:</b> When examining the various dimensions of self-reported sleep quality as a whole, we found no significant association with social support, while controlling for daily BZD dose, anxiety and depression. However, we found a significant association between self-reported diurnal dysfunctions (e.g., daytime sleepiness) and satisfaction with social support.<b>Conclusion:</b> Although the results of our study should be replicated with larger samples, they might indicate that social support is not a significant factor influencing sleep quality in older chronic BZD users. Our results could differ from those found in other populations because of the changes in sleep quality associated with long term BZD use. Longitudinal studies should analyse the relationship between diurnal dysfunctions and satisfaction with social support, to examine if social support could help older adults alleviate their diurnal dysfunctions and eventually facilitate BZD tapering.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30977682/"}

Three placebo response models were established to describe the time-course of sleep parameters measured by objective (polysomnography or actigraphy) or subjective methods (sleep diary or questionnaires). The established models were applied to simulate placebo response distribution under different conditions using Monte Carlo simulations. Fifty-four studies involving 6,416 subjects were included. Placebo response increased over time and reached a plateau at approximately 8 weeks from start of therapy. Established models described the observed data reasonably well based on various diagnostic plots. Baseline sleep parameters affected the placebo response. There were significant positive correlations with placebo response and the severity of sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time at baseline. In addition, placebo response, assessed by subjective and objective methods, was consistent after correcting the baseline levels.

Experimental models of acute sleep loss, of chronic partial sleep deprivation, and of sleep fragmentation in healthy sleepers are helpful models of sleep deficiency produced by insufficient sleep duration, sleep timing, and sleep disorders. Sleep deficiency is associated with changes in markers associated with risk for disease. These include metabolic, inflammatory, and autonomic markers of risk. In addition, sleep disruption and sleep deficits lead to mood instability, lack of positive outlook, and impaired neurobehavioral functioning. On a population level, insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk for hypertension and diabetes. Sleep disturbance is very common, and about half the population will report that they have experienced insomnia at some time in their lives. Approximately 10% of the population describe daytime impairment due to sleep disturbance at night, consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia disorder. The hypothalamic neuropeptides, orexin-A and orexin-B, act through G-protein-coupled receptors (orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors). Dual and selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists have shown efficacy in inducing sleep in men and women with insomnia disorder by accelerating sleep onset and improving sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Further study comparing these medications, in short- and longer-term use models, is recommended. Greater understanding of comparative effects on mood, neurobehavioral, and physiological systems will help determine the extent of clinical utility of dual versus selective orexin receptor antagonists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34052807/"}

Fall frequency during the subsequent year was ascertained by a triannual questionnaire. Use of medications was obtained by examiner interview. In multivariate-adjusted models, relative to those with \"normal\" nighttime sleep duration (>7 to 8 hours per night), the odds of having 2 or more falls in the subsequent year was elevated for women who slept 5 hours or less per night (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.24).

We used summary-level statistics from genome-wide association studies and the latent causal variable (LCV) method to screen the phenome and infer causal relationships between seven sleep-related traits (insomnia, daytime dozing, easiness of getting up in the morning, snoring, sleep duration, napping, and morningness) and 1,527 other phenotypes. We identify 84 inferred causal relationships. Among other findings, connective tissue disorders increase insomnia risk and reduce sleep duration; depression-related traits increase insomnia and daytime dozing; insomnia, napping, and snoring are affected by obesity and cardiometabolic traits and diseases; and working with asbestos, thinner, or glues may increase insomnia risk, possibly through an increased risk of respiratory disease or socio-economic related factors.

This review further discusses frontline sleep interventions aimed at enhancing sleep in individuals experiencing anxiety, such as nonbenzodiazepines/antidepressants, lifestyle and sleep interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Notwithstanding therapeutic success, up to ∼30% of individuals with anxiety can be nonresponsive to frontline treatments. Thus, we address novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that can enhance electroencephalographic slow waves, and might help alleviate sleep and anxiety symptoms.

Previous reviews of behavioral interventions for pediatric insomnia have had a limited focus on a single age group, a specific population, and/or only randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, few reviews have considered non-sleep outcomes of both children and their parents. This scoping review provides a broader context, including studies regardless of research design or population, along with sleep and non-sleep study outcomes. Clear gaps in the literature were identified, highlighting the need for additional research in different populations, including school-age children and adolescents, racial/ethnic groups around the world, as well as youth with medical or psychiatric disorders. In addition, more research is needed on different features of treatment, including the delivery mode, involvement of all family members, non-sleep outcomes, and long-term follow-up.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33387973/"}

This review aimed to describe the state of science with respect to the impact of the latest behavioral and pharmacological interventions on posttraumatic nightmares and insomnia. Published studies that examined evidence for therapeutic effects upon sleep were included. Some behavioral and pharmacological interventions show promise, especially for nightmares, but there is a need for controlled trials that include valid sleep measures and are designed to identify treatment mechanisms.

Epidemiological research indicates that insomnia could lead to depression and/or that common causalities underlie the two disorders. Neurobiological and sleep EEG studies suggest that a heightened level of arousal may play a common role in both conditions and that signs of REM sleep disinhibition may appear in individuals prone to depression. The effects of antidepressant drugs on non-REM and REM sleep are discussed in relation to their use in insomnia comorbid with depression. Empirical treatment approaches are behavioral management of sleep combined with prescription of a sedative antidepressant alone, co-prescription of two antidepressants, or of an antidepressant with a hypnotic drug.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19939713/"}

This study included 30 participants, comprising 15 patients with ID and 15 healthy controls (HCs). Six types of music were selected for sleep aid, and a dot-probe task based on sleep-related attentional bias was utilized to collect behavioral and EEG data. Vigilance bias and disengagement bias were measured using reaction time and EEG FC. Differences in sleep-related attentional bias before and after the intervention of music were explored to evaluate the sleep-aiding effects and identify EEG biomarkers. Compared with HCs, patients with ID showed decreased sleep-related attentional bias of EEG FC between occipital-central and temporal-frontal lobes. Among the six types of music, International Standard Sleep Aid and Lullaby had a greater impact on decreasing vigilance bias in the ID group. Additionally, the International Standard Sleep Aid and Nature Sound were more effective in decreasing disengagement bias in the ID group. This study also examined the resting-state EEG FC of patients with ID before and after the intervention of music. The results showed that the FC in the temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes significantly differed before and after the intervention of music, especially with the use of International Standard Sleep Aid, Lullaby, and Alpha Sound Wave. However, it is worth noting that these three types of music showed no similarities in EEG FC, in contrast to the result of sleep-related attentional bias of EEG FC. This study found that the sleep-related attentional bias of EEG FC has more distinct characteristics when compared to resting-state EEG FC. The results suggest that the sleep-related attentional bias of EEG FC could be a potential biomarker for assessing the sleep-aiding effect of music interventions. International Standard Sleep Aid was the most effective for patients with ID among six types of sleep-aiding music.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep was analysed as a measure of cortical arousal. In addition, patients completed the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), which consists of two subscales, one for cognitive arousal (PSAS-CA) and one for self-reported somatic arousal (PSAS-SA). The relationship between the subscale scores and EEG spectral power was calculated by multi- and univariate analyses of variance. During NREM and REM sleep, patients with ID showed significantly increased spectral power in the EEG gamma band. In addition, patients with ID showed significantly increased scores on both subscales of the PSAS. The PSAS-CA score was significantly associated with increased NREM and REM gamma power, whereas PSAS-SA was associated with decreases in NREM and REM gamma power. Consistent with our hypothesis, patients with ID showed increased cortical and cognitive arousal. Moreover, there was an association between these two arousal domains, which may indicate that cortical arousal during the night is (at least in part) elicited by pre-sleep worry and rumination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36815625/"}

Higher adherence and usefulness to \"managing sleep deprivation, sleepiness and fatigue\" was associated with lower ISI at 6 months postpartum (small and medium effect size, respectively); higher perceived usefulness was associated with lower PROMIS-SRI at 6 months (small effect; all <i>p</i>-values < .05). There were no significant associations among adherence/usefulness and sleep at 2 months postpartum. The overall high perceived usefulness of CBT-I components suggests a strong interest in engaging with perinatal sleep health information. Pregnancy may be a crucial time for delivering sleep strategies before facing caregiving duties and heightened postpartum sleep disruptions.

The aim of the present study was to identify the sleep characteristics of menopausal insomnia by using overnight polysomnography (PSG). Twenty-one subjects with menopausal insomnia (MI) and 13 sex- and age-matched normal control (NC) subjects without sleep complaints took part in the present study. All MI and NC subjects underwent PSG on two consecutive nights. In comparison with NC, MI subjects had non-specific findings such as significantly shorter total sleep time, longer sleep latency, higher wake time after sleep onset, and lower sleep efficiency. As for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep variables, MI subjects had significantly shorter total REM sleep time, fewer numbers of REM sleep periods, longer REM latency, and higher REM density than did the NC subjects. As for the time course of REM density, REM density during the first 3 h period of nocturnal sleep was significantly higher for MI than for NC subjects. Unlike NC subjects, REM density for MI subjects did not tend to rise progressively during nocturnal sleep. The MI subjects had objective evidence of disrupted sleep and the most striking characteristics of this dysfunction were observed in REM sleep variables. The sleep characteristics of MI subjects were found to differ in REM sleep variables from those of patients with major depression (except for REM density). Menopausal insomnia patients appear to be similar to patients with generalized anxiety disorder accompanied by severe sleep disruption. These data lend support to the clinical distinction between menopausal insomnia and insomnia associated with major psychiatric disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15009824/"}

We proposed to explore waking EEG activity in primary insomniacs the evening before, and the morning after, a night of sleep, in order to detect signs of morning hyper-arousal and non-restoring sleep that might explain the subjective feelings despite the absence of objective signs in polysomnography. Pre-sleep (10 pm) and post-sleep (10 am) waking EEG activity was analyzed in 10 non-medicated primary insomniacs and matched control subjects. Beta and Gamma absolute power and EEG temporal coupling were obtained. Participants also evaluated subjective sleep quantity and quality. Insomnia patients evaluated their sleep as non-restorative and insufficient. Compared to pre-sleep, during post-sleep control subjects exhibited significantly decreased Beta and Gamma power and reduced synchronization among anterior and posterior regions, consistent with restoring effects of sleep. Insomnia patients showed no beneficial effects of sleep on these EEG parameters. Insomniacs are hyper-aroused during morning wakefulness and they do not benefit from preceding sleep.

This study aims to examine the occurrence of aggression, sleep disturbances, and suicide risk among Chinese adolescents, along with the relationships between these factors. This is a cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey. Of the original 7011 Chinese adolescent respondents, the analysis included data from 6122 adolescents, aged between 12 and 18 years, from 23 regions, whose average age was 16.12 (±1.44) years, with 48.8% being male. While the chi-square test and t-test were used for analyzing demographic data and continuous variables, respectively, mediation analysis was used to explore the mechanism of experiencing aggression on suicide risk. The respondents' sleep quality, nightmare distress, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and suicide risk were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Nightmare Distress Questionnaire-Chinese version (NDQ-CV), Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale (CADSS), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), and the suicide risk module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), respectively. Four items were used to assess adolescents' experiences with aggression. Of the respondents, 42% reported experiencing aggression by others, especially parental physical maltreatment. Furthermore, 26.9% of adolescents in school, and in particular, 31.8% in senior high school experienced insomnia symptoms. Adolescents who reported experiences of aggression had more severe insomnia symptoms, nightmare distress, fatigue, and a higher risk of suicide when compared with those who did not (all ps < 0.001). Insomnia symptoms, nightmare distress, and fatigue all mediated the relationship between aggression and suicide risk, and there was a chain of mediating effects between these factors [for total indirect effect β = 1.1512, 95% CI (0.9671 to 1.3426), direct effect β = 0.4934, 95% CI (0.1978 to 0.7891), and total effect β = 1.6446, 95% CI (1.3479 to 1.9414)]. Our findings indicate that among adolescents, experiencing aggression is associated with an increased suicide risk.

While CBT-I remains the gold standard for treating nocturnal symptoms, its effects on daytime functioning, which are often the primary concern for patients, are less robust, inconsistently measured, and poorly understood. This narrative review highlights the need to elevate daytime symptoms from secondary outcomes to central targets in both research and clinical practice. Key gaps include the lack of standardised and conceptually clear outcome measures, limited personalisation of CBT-I protocols, and insufficient understanding of the mechanisms linking improved sleep to daytime recovery. Moreover, the ethical implications of emerging digital assessment tools must be addressed to ensure that technological innovation does not come at the cost of participant trust or autonomy. To move the field forward, future research should prioritise daytime functioning as a primary endpoint, adopt ethically grounded multimodal assessment strategies, and explore adaptive, symptom-specific treatment designs. Finally, insomnia should be recognised not only as a disorder in its own right but also as a transdiagnostic and potentially preventable contributor to broader mental health problems. Addressing these challenges may lead to more effective, personalised, and patient-centred care for individuals living with insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40751500/"}

A triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial will be performed. Three clinicians will diagnose and treat every eligible patient individually and independently, producing three prescriptions from three clinicians for every patient. Patients will equally be randomized to one of four groups - medical group A, medical group B, medical group C, or placebo group - and observed for efficacy of treatment. The sample will include primary insomnia patients meeting DSM IV-TR criteria, Spiegel scale score >18, and age 18 to 65 years. A sequential design is employed. Interim analysis will be conducted when between 80 and 160 patients complete the study. The interim study could be stopped and treated as final if a statistically significant difference between treatment and placebo groups can be obtained and core effective drug patterns can be determined. Otherwise, the study continues until the maximum sample size reaches 300.

Normal sleepers given the nocturnal EEG parameters of insomniacs displayed decreased tension, decreased vigor, decreased body temperature, and decreased MSLT values. The spectrum of changes seen in the normal sleepers given an insomniac sleep pattern was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation and not consistent with symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia.

To study this circadian component of sleep tendency, we have analyzed the sleep-wake patterns recorded from 15 free-running subjects in whom the sleep-wake cycle spontaneously desynchronized from the circadian rhythm of body temperature. The analysis indicates that the distribution of sleep onsets during free run is bimodal, with one peak at the temperature trough and, contrary to previous reports, a second peak 9-10 h later. Furthermore, there are two consistent zones in the circadian temperature cycle during which normal subjects rarely fall asleep. We hypothesize that this bimodal rhythm of sleep tendency, revealed under free-running conditions, maintains the same fixed phase relation to the circadian temperature cycle during 24-h entrainment. This would imply that normally entrained individuals should experience a peak of sleep tendency in the midafternoon and a zone of minimal sleep tendency approximately 1-3 h before habitual bedtime.

The results show that NREM power, for all frequencies below the beta range, has slower rise rates and reaches lower levels in the insomniac group, whereas beta power is significantly increased. In REM, insomniacs show lower levels in the delta and theta bands, whereas power in the faster frequency bands is significantly increased. Thus, the pathophysiology of insomnia is characterized not only by the generally acknowledged slow wave deficiency, but also by an excessive hyperarousal of the central nervous system throughout the night, affecting both REM and NREM sleep. This hyperarousal is interpreted in terms of the neuronal group theory of sleep which provides a possible explanation for the discrepancies observed between subjective impressions and objective measures of sleep. Also, it is suggested that the progressive hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical neurons as sleep deepens is slower in the patient population and that this may explain the observed slow wave deficiency. The homeostatic control of slow wave activity, on the other hand, would appear to be intact in the patient population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9751153/"}

DSPD in youth has prevalence as high as 16%, and is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Treatments include appropriate light exposure during the day, melatonin use, developing an evening routine that minimizes arousal-increasing activities, and gradually shifting sleep-wake times toward more functional ones.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33223060/"}

{"id": "8929677", "title": "[Biological models of depression: effect of antidepressants on sleep].", "text": "The relationship between insomnia and depression cannot be summarized as a symptom/disease relationship. It is well admitted now that sleep deprivation has an antidepressant effect on depressed patients. The effect is immediate, global but transient : the relapse occurs after subsequent sleep, diurnal nap or recovery night. On an other hand, sleep architecture is impaired in depressed patients, some of these alterations, especially in REM sleep, might have been considered specific of depressive disease. Antidepressant drugs exert an effect on sleep architecture which is different. This effect varies over time and generally tend to correct sleep impairment. This has led some authors to propose the hypothesis that sleep himself might be involved in the causal process of depression. Three main hypotheses will be considered, excluding those involving circadian rhythm impairment, according to their strong and weak points. For G. Vogel, an excess of REM sleep is the causal process in depression. As a matter of fact, he did show that selective REM sleep deprivation exerts an antidepressant effect following the same temporal profile as antidepressant drugs. An other argument is that the shortening of REM latency and the increased amount of REM sleep in the first half of the night are evidences of the excess of REM sleep and at last, most antidepressant drugs are REM suppressors and may act through REM sleep suppression. The second hypothesis is the process S deficiency proposed by Alexander Borbely, according to his two process model of sleep homeostasis. The impairment of process S, which is reflected by slow wave activity, is responsible for depression. This explain disruptions and shortening of sleep in depressed patients, REM sleep abnormalities being only secondary to the slow wave sleep reduction. More recently, D. Beersma and R. van den Hoofdakker proposed that non REM sleep might be depressogenic after an experiment of selective REM sleep deprivation in normals which showed that non REM sleep deprivation was also largely reduced. REM suppression effects might therefore also be attributed to non REM suppression. All these hypothesis must explain the effect of antidepressant drugs on sleep. There is a large heterogeneity of effects on slow wave, non REM and even REM sleep, hardly compatible with a causal role of sleep, REM or non REM.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8929677/"}

The first-line recommended treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). CBTI is typically delivered in-person or online over one-to-four sessions (brief versions) or five-to-eight sessions (standard versions) by a licensed doctoral or masters-level clinician with extensive training in behavioral sleep medicine. Despite its effectiveness, CBTI has limited scalability. Three main factors inhibit access to and delivery of CBTI including restricted availability of clinical expertise; rigid, resource-intensive treatment formats; and limited capacities for just-in-time monitoring and treatment personalization. Digital technologies offer a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges by providing scalable, personalized, resource-sensitive, adaptive, and cost-effective approaches for evidence-based insomnia treatment. This is a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness randomized trial using a scalable evidence-based digital health software platform, NOCTEM™'s Clinician-Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST™). COAST includes a clinician portal and a patient app, and it utilizes algorithms that facilitate detection of sleep disordered patterns, support clinical decision-making, and personalize sleep interventions. The first aim is to compare three clinician- and system-centered implementation strategies on the reach, adoption, and sustainability of the COAST digital platform by offering (1) COAST only, (2) COAST plus external facilitation (EF: assistance and consultation to providers by NOCTEM's sleep experts), or (3) COAST plus EF and internal facilitation (EF/IF: assistance/consultation to providers by NOCTEM's sleep experts and local champions). The second aim is to quantify improvements in insomnia among patients who receive behavioral sleep care via the COAST platform. We hypothesize that reach, adoption, and sustainability and the magnitude of improvements in insomnia will be superior in the EF and EF/IF groups relative to the COAST-only group. Digital health technologies and machine learning-assisted clinical decision support tools have substantial potential for scaling access to insomnia treatment. This can augment the scalability and cost-effectiveness of CBTI without compromising patient outcomes. Engaging providers, stakeholders, patients, and decision-makers is key in identifying strategies to support the deployment of digital health technologies that can promote quality care and result in clinically meaningful sleep improvements, positive systemic change, and enhanced readiness and health among service members.

Insomniacs were recruited through newspaper advertisements to a web-based survey with validated questionnaires about sleep, anxiety, depression, and use of sleep medications. A self-help book focusing on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia was compared to standard sleep hygiene advice; 77 and 78 participants were randomized to self-help book or sleep hygiene advice, respectively. The response rate was 81.9%. The self-help book gave significantly better scores on the sleep questionnaires compared to sleep hygiene advice. The proportion using sleep medications was reduced in the self-help book group, whereas it was increased in the sleep hygiene group. Compared to pre-treatment, the self-help book improved scores on the sleep (effect sizes 0.61-0.62) and depression (effect size 0.18) scales, whereas the sleep hygiene advice improved scores on some sleep scales (effect sizes 0.24-0.28), but worsened another (effect size -0.36). In addition, sleep hygiene advice increased the number of days per week where they took sleep medications (effect size -0.50). To conclude, in this randomized controlled trial, the self-help book improved sleep and reduced the proportion using sleep medications compared to sleep hygiene advice. The self-help book is an efficient low-threshold intervention, which is cheap and easily available for patients suffering from insomnia. Sleep hygiene advice also improved sleep at follow-up, but increased sleep medication use. Thus, caution is warranted when sleep hygiene advice are given as a single treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21790620/"}

Sleep medication use in insomniacs was associated with female sex and advancing age as well as higher scores in subcomponents of both poor subjective sleep quality and prolonged delay of sleep onset. Depressive symptoms were worst in the group with insomnia symptoms using sleep medication, and were significantly lower in the group without insomnia symptoms using sleep medication. Our study revealed that female sex, advancing age, depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, and prolonged delay of sleep onset appeared as risk factors for sleep medication use. Insomnia symptoms were suspected to act as an exacerbating factor for depressive symptoms.

Data from 703 individuals with major depression recruited from the research database of the sleep laboratory of the Erasme Hospital were analysed. High blood pressure status was defined by the presence of one of the following: self-reports at interview of either a physician-diagnosis or taking antihypertensive medication; or an average systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or an average diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg during at least two medical examinations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the risk of high blood pressure associated with objective insomnia and self-reported insomnia complaints in major depression. After adjustment for major confounding factors associated with high blood pressure, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that severe objective insomnia, low complaints of repeated nighttime awakenings or early morning awakening, and intermediate or low self-reported insomnia complaints were significant risk factors of high blood pressure in major depression. In major depression, severe objective insomnia and lower self-reported insomnia complaints are associated with higher risk of high blood pressure, which justifies a better management of objective insomnia and a better assessment of insomnia complaints in this particular subpopulation to avoid the negative consequences related to the co-occurrence of high blood pressure and major depression. <b>Abbreviations:</b> AHI, Apnea-Hypopnea Index; BDI, Beck Depression Inventory; BMI, Body Mass Index; DSM IV-TR, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition - Text Revision; ESS, Epworth Sleepiness scale; ISI, Insomnia Severity Index; HBP, High Blood Pressure; OSA, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome; REM, rapid eye movement sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30303409/"}

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is considered the gold standard intervention for insomnia and its efficacy has been well demonstrated. However, the core treatment strategies of CBTI require significant behavioural change, which many individuals find challenging. As a result, although CBTI is efficacious, its effectiveness is reduced by modest levels of adherence in typical clinical settings. This is problematic as adherence is essential to attain desired treatment outcomes. Sleep is often a dyadic process, with approximately 60% of Australian adults sharing a bed. Hence, the present study aims to determine whether incorporating bed partners into treatment for insomnia increases treatment adherence and completion. The impact of adherence on symptoms of insomnia will also be examined. This study is a mixed-effects randomised effectiveness trial of partner-assisted CBTI (PA-CBTI). It is an \"effectiveness\" (as opposed to \"efficacy\") trial, due to the focus on \"real world\" clinic-based clients and adherence/attrition as outcomes. Participants will include 120 clients with insomnia who are randomly assigned, in equal numbers, to PA-CBTI, traditional individual CBTI (i-CBTI), or partner-assisted sleep management therapy (PA-SMT; which serves as the control group). All interventions consist of seven weekly 1-h sessions. Treatment outcome is evaluated using clinician-rated treatment adherence, and diary-based adherence to stimulus control and sleep restriction. Clients and partners complete major assessments at pre- and post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcome variables include actigraphy, self-report measures related to sleep, comorbid psychopathology, and relationship functioning. This is the first randomised clinical trial to examine the impact of incorporating the bed partner in the treatment of insomnia. Results will provide new information about the role partners play in clients' insomnia presentation and treatment response, and better define the role of adherence in CBTI. This trial has the potential to optimise treatment outcomes for insomnia by improving adherence and reducing attrition. Results could have far-reaching impacts. Improvements in insomnia have been linked to improvements in mental and physical health and, given the high financial costs of insomnia, this study could have a positive economic impact.

Patients exhibiting seasonal fluctuations in depressive symptoms and sleep patterns throughout the year, or having daytime dysfunction, experienced enhanced CBT-I efficacy, especially for early awakenings insomnia. Conversely, shorter sleep duration predicted a less favorable response to CBT-I, less improvement in daytime dysfunction and sleep disturbance worries.

Laxative use and medical comorbidities were obtained through self-reported questionnaires. Patient insomnia symptoms were based on self-report. Associations between laxative use and objective sleep continuity were analyzed using multivariable linear regression models. Associations between laxative use and insomnia were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, total recording time, and relevant comorbidities, laxative users had a 7.1% lower sleep efficiency (<i>p</i> < 0.001), 25.5-minute higher wake after sleep onset (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and a 29.4-minute lower total sleep time (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than patients not using laxatives. Laxative users were found to be at greater odds of reporting insomnia symptoms (OR = 1.7, <i>p</i> = 0.024) than patients not using laxatives.

However, much remains unknown regarding the evolution of emotional memories and their neural representations over time among individuals with insomnia disorder. We examined the electroencephalographic (EEG) activities during emotional memory encoding, post-encoding sleep, and multiple retrieval phases - including immediate post-encoding, post-sleep, and a 7-day delayed retrieval - among 34 participants with insomnia disorder and 35 healthy control participants. Healthy controls exhibited adaptive dissipation of emotional memory: memory declined over time, accompanied by reduced subjective feelings toward negative memories. In contrast, participants with insomnia exhibited impaired dissipation: they retained both the emotional content and affective tone of the memories, with diminished time-dependent declines in memory and affect. Beyond behavioral performance, only participants with insomnia maintained stable neural representations of emotion over time, a pattern absent in healthy controls. Additionally, during the post-encoding sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep durations predicted the adaptive dissipation of emotional memory over time, but only among healthy participants. These findings highlight abnormalities in emotional memory processing among individuals with insomnia disorder and underscore the important function of SWS and REM sleep in facilitating adaptive emotional memory processing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40888367/"}

Insomnia patients with short sleep duration (< 6 hours) in the first night of laboratory sleep presented with a longer duration of insomnia compared to those with normal sleep duration (≥ 6 hours) in the first night of laboratory sleep. Insomnia patients who were categorised as short sleepers in either night were not more likely to suffer from hypertension (systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg, or a previously established diagnosis). Data analysis showed that insomnia patients with objective short sleep duration were not more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose level of ≥ 126 mg/dl, or a previously established diagnosis). However, the diabetes analysis was only based on a very small number of diabetes cases. As a new finding, insomnia patients who were categorised as short sleepers in either night presented with increases in liver enzyme levels. The finding on insomnia duration supports the concept of two distinct sub-groups of insomnia, namely insomnia with, and without, objectively determined short sleep duration.

Outcomes were self-reported average sleep duration (categorized as ≤5 h, 6 h, or 7-9 h [recommended]) and/or insomnia symptoms (having trouble falling or staying asleep). Associations between military-related factors and the new onset and reoccurrence of these sleep characteristics were determined, after controlling for multiple health and behavioral factors. Military-related factors consistently associated with an increased risk for new onset and/or reoccurrence of short sleep duration and insomnia symptoms included active duty component, Army or Marine Corps service, combat deployment, and longer than average deployment lengths.

Therefore, early diagnostic and treatment is necessary. As symptoms vary according to age, treatment should be strictly age-dependent. Various guideline-oriented and age-dependent treatments will be presented. Beyond, parents often have daytime impairments due to the child's sleep problem and therefore report an improvement of their own sleep after treatment. However, more studies are necessary and randomized controlled and age-oriented studies are necessary with inclusion of comorbid disorders or address sleep disorders in the context of mental disorders. In addition, efficacy of sleep treatment in mental disorders should be studied.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30757971/"}

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the treatment of choice for chronic primary insomnia. However, no randomized controlled study has been conducted on its efficacy for insomnia secondary to cancer. Using a randomized controlled design, this study conducted among breast cancer survivors evaluated the effect of CBT on sleep, assessed both subjectively and objectively, and on hypnotic medication use, psychological distress, and quality of life. Fifty-seven women with insomnia caused or aggravated by breast cancer were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 27) or a waiting-list control condition (n = 30). The treatment consisted of eight weekly sessions administered in a group and combined the use of stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive therapy, sleep hygiene, and fatigue management. Follow-up evaluations were carried out 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment. Participants who received the insomnia treatment had significantly better subjective sleep indices (daily sleep diary, Insomnia Severity Index), a lower frequency of medicated nights, lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater global quality of life at post-treatment compared with participants of the control group after their waiting period. Results were more equivocal on polysomnographic indices. Therapeutic effects were well maintained up to 12 months after the intervention and generally were clinically significant.

In the present analysis, we sought to evaluate how time in bed (TIB) varies relative to the new onset of AI and chronic insomnia. A total of 1,248 subjects were recruited as good sleepers (GS). Subjects were monitored over 1 year with sleep diaries. State transitions were defined, a priori, for AI, recovered from AI (AI-REC), and for chronic insomnia (AI-CI). Two additional groupings were added based on profiles that were unanticipated: subjects that exhibited persistent poor sleep following AI (AI-PPS [those that neither recovered or developed chronic insomnia]) and subjects that recovered from chronic insomnia (CI-REC). All the groups (GS, AI-REC, AI-CI, AI-PPS and CI-REC) were evaluated for TIB differences with longitudinal mixed effects models. Post hoc analyses for the percentage of the groups that were typed as TIB \"restrictors, maintainers, and expanders\" were conducted using longitudinal mixed effects models and contingency analyses. Significant differences for pre-post AI TIB were not detected for the insomnia groups. Trends were apparent for the AI-CI group, which suggested that minor increases in TIB occurred weeks before the declared onset of AI. Additionally, it was found that a significantly larger percentage of AI-CI subjects engaged in sleep extension (as compared to GS). The present data suggest that transition from AI to chronic insomnia does not appear to be initiated by sleep extension and the transition may occur before the elapse of 3 months of ≥3 nights of sleep continuity disturbance. Given these findings, it may be that the mismatch between sleep ability and sleep opportunity is perpetuated over time given the failure to \"naturally\" engage in sleep restriction (as opposed to sleep extension).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33853197/"}

Sleep diary outcomes indicated participants complied with the restriction of time in bed, and that a similar amount of total sleep time (TST) was maintained from pre-to-post-treatment. There was no significant change in daytime sleepiness, and similarly no significant changes observed in objective performance on the Go/NoGo task and AusEd driving simulator. These preliminary results suggest SRT during the acute phase does not appear to place insomnia patients at risk of significant impairments in sleepiness and reaction times.

This pilot study explores the feasibility and effects of closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) as a potential non-invasive intervention to improve sleep, its subjective quality, and memory consolidation in patients with insomnia. A total of 27 patients with chronic insomnia underwent a crossover, sham-controlled study with 2 nights of either CLAS or sham stimulation. Polysomnography was used to record sleep parameters, while questionnaires and a word-pair memory task were administered to assess subjective sleep quality and memory consolidation. The initial analyses included 17 patients who completed the study, met the inclusion criteria, and received CLAS. From those, 10 (58%) received only a small number of stimuli. In the remaining seven (41%) patients with sufficient CLAS, we evaluated the acute and whole-night effect on sleep. CLAS led to a significant immediate increase in slow oscillation (0.5-1 Hz) amplitude and activity, and reduced delta (1-4 Hz) and sigma/sleep spindle (12-15 Hz) activity during slow-wave sleep across the whole night. All these fundamental sleep rhythms are implicated in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Yet, CLAS did not change sleep-dependent memory consolidation or sleep macrostructure characteristics, number of arousals, or subjective perception of sleep quality. Results showed CLAS to be feasible in patients with insomnia. However, a high variance in the efficacy of our automated stimulation approach suggests that further research is needed to optimise stimulation protocols to better unlock potential CLAS benefits for sleep structure and subjective sleep quality in such clinical settings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38467353/"}

Insomnia symptoms were defined as difficulty with sleep induction or maintenance ≥3 nights per week. We assessed social network size and bridging potentials as indicators of social relationships. Social network size is a quantitative measure of the size of social relationships, and bridging potential is a qualitative indicator of the diversity and independence of these relationships. Multivariate regression analysis controlling for confounding factors was performed to evaluate associations between social relationships and insomnia symptoms. Smaller social network size was significantly associated with sleep induction (adjusted odds ratio = 0.866, P = .015) and sleep maintenance (adjusted odds ratio = 0.862, P = .015) difficulties, but only in men.

Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self-report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive-behavioural models to (epi-) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep-wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive-behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first-line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive-behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non-response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation.

Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (\"rapid eye movement sleep instability\"), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious-like wake experience, reflecting pre-sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38811745/"}

The indirect effect of the optimized acupuncture on improving depression emotions through PSQI was 3.052 (95%<i>CI</i> [1.407, 4.697]), accounting for 77.5% of the total effect. Conversely, the indirect effect of improving PSQI through the optimized protocol on depression emotions was 0.479 (95%<i>CI</i> [0.024, 0.935]), representing 14.8% of the total effect. Latent profile analysis identified 3 categories based on emotional and insomnia symptoms, and statistically significant differences in efficacy favoring the optimized acupuncture protocol over the conventional acupuncture protocol were observed only in the subgroup with relatively mild depression and insomnia symptoms (PSQI: 95%<i>CI</i> [-10.98, -5.44], <i>P</i><0.001; HAMD-24: 95%<i>CI</i> [-12.31, -3.73], <i>P</i> =0.001).

The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hang-over). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6132933/"}

Of the 828 respondents, 568 (69%) provided responses to questions about the most preferred strategies and 450 (54%) provided responses about their least preferred strategies. About 48.5% felt their insomnia symptoms were too mild to see a clinician and 23.9% did not think their symptoms warranted sleep medication. Over 40% of students could not avoid work before sleep, have consistent sleep/wake times, or engage in regular exercise because of their busy and inconsistent schedules. Approximately 40-60% could not improve their sleep environment (e.g. better heating and bed) because of the associated costs. Over 80% reported an inability to change their pre-sleep habits (e.g. using electronics close to bedtime, using bed for activities other than sleep or sex). Half of the students disliked relaxation techniques or felt they would not help. Around 30-50% did not believe that changing caffeine and/or alcohol intake would affect their sleep. Medical students may benefit from additional sleep education.

Accordingly, a large archival dataset was used to examine age differences in sleep continuity, problem endorsement, and sleep related daytime dysfunction. Participants were categorized as: Young Adults (18-29 years); Adults (30-44 years); Middle Aged Adults (45-64 years); and Older Adults (65-89 years). Young Adults, Adults, and Middle Aged Adults were 1:1 matched with Older Adults (n = 233) on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, and BMI. MANOVA, ANOVAs, and chi-square analysis were performed to assess for age-related differences. In a sample of 932 adults with self-reported sleep continuity disturbance (i.e., insomnia), sleep continuity was significantly worse in older age groups. This effect was limited to middle and late insomnia with middle aged and older adults waking up with greater frequency and for longer durations of time during the night and in the early morning than younger cohorts. Problem endorsement largely increased across age groups (except for sleep latency) but reports of overall sleep-related daytime dysfunction showed no difference by age. When evaluating sleep continuity disturbance, assessing whether the patient identifies their sleep continuity disturbance as a problem and whether it affects their daytime function can be informative, particularly in older adults. It may serve to reveal (case-by-case) when there are discordances between incidence/severity of illness and problem endorsement/daytime dysfunction.

Aromatherapy is considered a complementary and/ or adjuvant therapeutic approach for treating several illnesses, especially to improve mental health and well-being. The incidence of sleep disorders, specifically insomnia, is nowadays increased, possibly due to urbanization and lifestyle. The studies showed that EOs-based treatments using lavender EO, bergamot EO, cinnamon EO, and rosemary EO (alone or in combinations) could improve sleep quality, duration, and deprivation in healthy subjects and patients, those who suffer from sleep-related issues. The current manuscript details the outcomes of EO-based treatments on the sleep quality of humans and the possible mechanisms associated with the health-promoting properties of EOs. Also, the toxicity and adverse effects of EOs have been discussed. The study indicated that EOs are potent adjuvant therapeutic candidates to manage mood-associated complications in humans. Moreover, the aromatherapeutic field requires detailed studies on toxicity and dose determination, which could provide safe and effective therapeutic results.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225207/"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate critically the role of sleep-related beliefs and behaviours in insomnia after acquired brain injury. Cross-sectional data of 51 outpatients with insomnia disorder and acquired brain injury were used to evaluate associations of the insomnia severity index with the dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep scale and sleep-related behaviours questionnaire. Seven (44%) of the dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep scale items and 10 (31%) of the sleep-related behaviours questionnaire items correlated significantly with insomnia severity. Ten experts were consulted on whether they considered the questionnaire items maladaptive or accurately reflecting coping with conditions experienced by people with acquired brain injury. Although multiple linear regression showed that the total scores of the questionnaires explained a significant part of interindividual differences in insomnia severity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.27, F(2,48) = 8.72, p < 0.01), the experts unanimously rated only four (25%) of the dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep scale items as dysfunctional beliefs and three (9%) of the sleep-related behaviours questionnaire items as safety behaviours. In people with brain injury, sleep related beliefs and behaviours may also play a role in insomnia, especially a diminished perception of control and worry about sleep. However, more than half of the questionnaire items on sleep-related beliefs and behaviours may not be considered inappropriate and maladaptive for the acquired brain injury population, and may reflect adequate observations and efforts in coping with consequences of the brain damage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37443409/"}

{"id": "22578014", "title": "Pharmacotherapy of insomnia.", "text": "Insomnia is one of the most prevalent sleep disorders in developed countries, being surpassed only by chronic sleep deprivation. Patients with insomnia tend to have an altered quality of life, impaired daytime functioning and an increased risk of work accidents and motor vehicle crashes. Insomnia is commonly associated with chronic medical conditions, metabolic illnesses and mental disorders (such as depression and anxiety), with which there is a dual, reciprocal relationship. This paper focuses on current pharmacotherapy options for the treatment of insomnia, particularly benzodiazepine receptor agonists, which nowadays represent the mainstay of hypnotic therapy. The melatonin receptor antagonist, ramelteon, is reviewed (an alternative for some patients with only sleep-onset difficulty), as are sedating antidepressants, which are commonly used 'off-label' to treat insomnia, despite limited efficacy data and potential significant safety concerns. Orexin (OX) antagonists are also discussed, especially those that block OX2 or both OX1 and OX2 receptors, as these are the most promising new agents for the treatment of insomnia, with encouraging results in preliminary clinical trials. Research to evaluate and formulate treatments for insomnia is often complicated by the fact that insomnia is usually of multifactorial etiology. Understanding the molecular and receptor mechanisms involved in promoting sleep in varied disorders could provide future approaches in new drug development. In the long term, more randomized controlled trials are needed to assess both short-term and long-term effects of these medications and their efficacy in comorbid diseases that affect sleep quality or quantity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22578014/"}

Prospective studies traversing the pandemic's onset can elucidate how pre-existing disease vulnerabilities augured risk for later stress-related morbidity. We examined how pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted maladaptive stress reactions and depressive symptoms in response to, and during, the pandemic. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial from 2016 to 2017 comparing digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) against sleep education (N = 208). Thus, we also assessed whether dCBT-I moderated the association between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and pandemic-related distress. Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity was measured at baseline using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test. In April 2020, participants were recontacted to report pandemic-related distress (stress reactions and depression). Controlling for the treatment condition and the degree of COVID-19 impact, higher pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted more stress reactions (β = 0.13, ± 0.07 SE, p = 0.045) and depression (β = 0.22, ± 0.07 SE, p = 0.001) during the pandemic. Further, the odds of reporting clinically significant stress reactions and depression during the pandemic were over twice as high in those with high pre-pandemic sleep reactivity. Notably, receiving dCBT-I in 2016-2017 mitigated the relationship between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and later stress reactions (but not depression). Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted psychological distress 3-4 years later during the COVID-19 pandemic, and dCBT-I attenuated its association with stress reactions, specifically.

This prospective study involved two assessments (April 2020 and 2022). At the baseline (April 2020), sleep quality/duration and insomnia symptoms in participants without current/prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). At the follow-up (April 2022), we asked a group of COVID-19 survivors to retrospectively evaluate the presence of twenty-one symptoms (psychiatric, neurological, cognitive, bodily, and respiratory) that have been experienced one month (n = 713, infection in April 2020-February 2022) and three months after COVID-19 (n = 333, infection in April 2020-December 2021).

Analyses highlighted a significant effect of pre-infection sleep on the number of symptoms one/three months after COVID-19. Previous higher PSQI and ISI scores, and shorter sleep duration significantly increased the risk of almost every long-term symptom at one/three months from COVID-19. Baseline sleep problems were also associated with longer recovery times to return to the pre-infection daily functioning level after COVID-19. This study suggested a prospective dose-dependent association of pre-infection sleep quality/quantity and insomnia severity with the manifestation of post-COVID-19 symptoms.

Sleep disturbance and impulsivity are also risk factors for suicidality. This study investigated the effects of poor sleep and impulsivity on suicidality in shift and non-shift workers. In total, 4572 shift workers (37.0 ± 9.84 years, 2150 males) and 2093 non-shift workers (37.8 ± 9.73 years, 999 males) participated in an online self-report survey. Suicidality was assessed using the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was employed to explore subjective sleep quality, the Insomnia Severity Index to detect insomnia, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale to assess depressive symptoms, and the Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P) to explore impulsivity. Shift workers showed poorer sleep quality, and greater impulsivity and suicidality, than non-shift workers. Impulsivity, sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia were significantly associated with suicidality, independent of depression. For both shift and non-shift workers, sleep quality moderated the association between impulsivity and suicidality. However, the moderating effects of sleep duration and EDS on the association between impulsivity and suicidality were apparent only in non-shift workers, while a moderating effect of insomnia was observed only in shift workers. Shift work, sleep disturbances and impulsivity may exacerbate suicide risk. In addition, the interrelationships among insomnia, EDS, impulsivity, and suicidality may differ between shift and non-shift workers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37393955/"}

The present study was a proof of concept and specifically aimed to provide additional empirical evidence that the link between stressful life events and the onset of acute insomnia is moderated by sleep reactivity. About 1,225 adults with a history of good sleep (Mage = 53.2 years, 68% female, 83% white) were recruited nationwide for an online study on sleep health. Participants completed surveys to assess sleep reactivity (baseline), sleep patterns (daily sleep diary), and stressful life events (weekly survey). All daily and weekly measures were completed for a one-year period. Sleep diary data were used to identify sleep initiation/maintenance difficulties, including whether they met criteria for acute insomnia at any point during the one-year interval. Participants with high sleep reactivity compared to low sleep reactivity were at 76% increased odds of developing acute insomnia during the one-year interval. In general, greater weekly stressful life events were associated with greater insomnia during the subsequent week. Those participants with high sleep reactivity demonstrated a stronger relationship between weekly stressful life events and insomnia, such that they reported the greatest levels of insomnia following weeks where they experienced a greater number of stressful life events. These results further support the sleep reactivity model of insomnia, and specifically, provide evidence that sleep reactivity predicts the incidence of acute insomnia in a sample of participants with no history of insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35776964/"}

University of Glasgow Sleep Centre. Eighteen patients with Primary Insomnia (mean age=42; range 18-64). Patients took part in a 4-week brief sleep restriction intervention, involving two group sessions and two subsequent follow-up phone calls in the home environment. Sleep diaries and global measures of insomnia severity and sleep quality, as expected, demonstrated robust improvements at both post-treatment and 3-month follow-up (all large effect sizes). Daytime functioning/health-related quality of life variables similarly evidenced strong treatment effects (moderate to large effect sizes). Reported side-effects were common, with ≥50% of patients reporting impairment in 8 out of 12 listed symptoms as a consequence of initiating treatment. The four most common side-effects were 'fatigue/exhaustion' (100%), 'extreme sleepiness' (94%), 'reduced motivation/energy' (89%) and 'headache/migraine' (72%) [Mean number of symptoms per patient=7.2 (2.4); range 3-11]. Intriguingly, both side-effect frequency and ratings of side-effect interference were associated with baseline to post-treatment improvements in sleep quality. Qualitative real-time audio-diaries during week 1 of treatment and post-treatment interviews provided rich accounts of side-effects associated with acute SRT implementation; general challenges surrounding treatment implementation and adherence/non-adherence; and modifications to sleep parameters, daytime functioning and perceptions of sleep/sleep period. This work has important implications for the delivery of SRT, particularly concerning awareness of possible 'adverse events' and likely implementation/adherence challenges.

We investigated the relationship between these measures and the hypnotic effect. The correlation between the pharmacodynamic measures and sleep quality was determined in 21 patients with primary insomnia. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships were characterized after administration of 20 mg oral temazepam. The hypnotic effect was determined on the basis of polysomnographic sleep recordings and a subjective sleep evaluation questionnaire. Correlations between pharmacodynamic measures and the improvement of sleep were investigated. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships for the parameters derived from electroencephalography and saccadic eye movements showed considerable interindividual variability. Administration of temazepam led to a significant improvement in the objective parameters sleep period efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency and in the subjective assessment of sleep quality. No significant correlations were observed between the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-derived parameters and the improvement in objective or subjective sleep parameters. In subjects with primary insomnia the administration of 20 mg oral temazepam results in changes in both the pharmacodynamic measures and in quality of sleep. No individual correlations between the pharmacodynamic measures and quality of sleep were observed. We concluded that the investigated pharmacodynamic measures are of value in the first assessment of clinical efficacy and for the selection of the dose(s) to be investigated in subsequent trials that aim at showing clinical efficacy.

As a corollary, we further review studies of the effects of sleep extension on blood pressure regulation. We also discuss epidemiological evidence suggesting that long sleep may also be associated with hypertension and describe the parabolic relationship between total sleep time and blood pressure. We conclude by highlighting gaps in the literature regarding the potential role of gut microbial health in the cross-communication of lifestyle patterns (exercise, diet, and sleep) with blood pressure regulation.

Sleep-related cognition, metacognition, and sleep reactivity also play an important role in insomnia. Our aim was to investigate how these insomnia-related constructs are associated with trait predisposition and pre-sleep arousal in subjects with an insomnia disorder. Fifty-three individuals with insomnia disorder (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (F = 33; 52 + 10)) and 30 healthy controls (F = 18; 51.8 + 12 years) were evaluated with a set of questionnaires, including the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Metacognition Questionnaire - Insomnia (MCQI), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), and Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS). Statistical analyses included multiple regression to elucidate the independent determinants of APS and PSAS. Participants with insomnia presented higher FIRST, MCQI, APS, PSAS scores (p-values <0.001) than healthy controls. In insomnia, APS and cognitive PSAS were best determined by MCQI (respectively, B = 0.09, p = 0.001, B = 0.08, p = 0.02), somatic PSAS by cognitive arousal (PSAS B = 0.35, p = 0.004) CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in insomnia disorders, trait predisposition toward hyperarousal and pre-sleep-cognitive-state-dependent arousal may be closely related to sleep-related metacognitive processes.

Participants reported the number of stressful events they encountered at baseline (Time 1), as well as the level of cognitive intrusion they experienced in response to each stressor. Stressful events (OR = 1.13; P < 0.01) and stress-induced cognitive intrusion (OR = 1.61; P < 0.01) were significant predictors of risk for insomnia one year hence (Time 2). Intrusion mediated the effects of stressful events on risk for insomnia (P < 0.05). Trait sleep reactivity significantly increased risk for insomnia (OR = 1.78; P < 0.01). Further, sleep reactivity moderated the effects of stress-induced intrusion (P < 0.05), such that the risk for insomnia as a function of intrusion was significantly higher in individuals with high sleep reactivity.

A total of 64 participants were included in the study, which consisted of a 1-week baseline period and a 4-week intervention period. They were randomly assigned to either the Warm group (N = 32) or the Sham group (N = 32) and were instructed to wear eye masks (warming or sham) before their habitual bedtime during the intervention period. The study found that the Athens Insomnia Scale score after the intervention was significantly lower in the Warm group compared to the Sham group. Additionally, participants in the warm condition showed a decrease in subjective sleep onset latency, better restorative sleep, and improved subjective anxiety before bedtime. A significant reduction in wake after sleep onset was observed in the Warm group at 4 weeks, and this decrease was significantly associated with the degree of improvement in subjective anxiety before bedtime. Furthermore, regular periocular skin warming before bedtime decreased sleep reactivity and improved well-being. In conclusion, the study suggests that periocular skin warming may be an effective approach for female workers with sleep problems, as it can easily be incorporated into daily life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39313209/"}

Pregnancy-related insomnia has been associated with severe outcomes for both mother and child postnatally. Currently, the treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia is often neglected due to a lack of suitable treatments. This online assessor-masked randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of music listening and sleep hygiene for treating pregnancy-related insomnia. We recruited first-time pregnant women at the end of the second trimester with a report of poor sleep. Participants in the music and sleep hygiene (MSH) group received standard sleep hygiene advice and were instructed to listen to music daily at bedtime for 4 weeks. They could choose from 6 sleep playlists of different genres. Participants randomized to the sleep hygiene alone (SH) group received standard sleep hygiene only. Primary outcomes were sleep quality measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and insomnia severity measured with the Insomnia Severity Index. gov Identifier: NCT04633395. Among the 98 participants receiving the online intervention, 31 participants in the MSH group (62%) and 40 participants in the SH group (80%) completed the postintervention measurements. Both groups experienced improved sleep quality during the intervention period (PSQI change, -2.10; 95% CI, -3.27 to -0.93; P < .001), with no significant difference between the groups. Similarly, insomnia symptoms were reduced (Insomnia Severity Index change, -3.42; 95% CI, -5.02 to -1.83; P < .001) with no significant difference in the effect between groups. There was a significant difference in adherence to sleep hygiene between the MSH and SH groups (42% vs 8%; P = .007). Sleep quality and insomnia severity can be improved in pregnant women with relatively simple interventions like music listening and sleep hygiene advice. These results align with previous research, but larger trials are recommended to support introduction into clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39417384/"}

An expert NOPIA research group review.", "text": "As people age, sleep stages and characteristics transition over time, but sleep deficits can profoundly impact health and cognitive functioning. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to impaired attention and productivity, weakened immunity, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and mental health disorders. Insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, hormonal changes, nocturia, neurological disorders, and life events interfere with sleep patterns and some are linked to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This NOPIA symposium on Lifelong LUTS aimed to analyze the literature on associations between sleep and LUTS, generate ideas for future research, and explore whether there is support for the concept of lifelong LUTS in relation to changes in sleep throughout the lifespan. An international panel of experts took part in an online meeting addressing the role of lifelong LUTS in relationship to sleep and the brain organized by the NOPIA research group. The manuscript summarizes existing literature, hypotheses, future research ideas, and clinical recommendations. Insomnia, sleep fragmentation, hyperarousal, and sensory processing disorders emerged as potential factors in the relationship between sleep and LUTS. Insomnia is often a persistent factor and may have been the initial symptom; however, it is often unrecognized and/or unaddressed in healthcare settings. By recognizing insomnia as a primary driver of various health issues, including nocturia, transitional care aims to address root causes and underlying problems earlier to initiate appropriate treatment. A multidisciplinary approach with collaboration between healthcare professionals from various disciplines, such as urology, sleep medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, and geriatrics, is needed and should include validated measurements such as the insomnia severity index and sleep and voiding diaries. Ensuring ongoing follow-up and monitoring through transitional care is crucial for individuals with persistent sleep problems and LUTS, allowing issues that arise or fluctuate over the lifespan to be addressed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38289321/"}

But do polysomnographic data provide adequate evidence to segregate the three disorders, or might they display fundamentally the same sleep disturbance, differing only in degree? To test the viability of these two alternate hypotheses, the authors performed a meta-analysis of controlled polysomnographic studies of these disorders. A summary measure of degree of sleep disturbance was constructed from five variables: wakefulness after sleep onset, percentage of stage 1 sleep, percentage of stage 3 + 4 sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) latency, and REM density. The results of available studies for each variable were combined using a weighted average of effect sizes. An overall \"sleep disturbance index\" was then calculated by combining the estimates for the five above listed variables. On both the individual measures and especially on the summary index, insomnia, depression, and narcolepsy were arrayed on a simple continuum of progressively more severe sleep disturbance--congruent with the clinical observation that these disorders display progressively more disturbed sleep. These findings suggest that sleep can be disturbed in only a limited number of ways: in evaluating sleep architecture, it may not be possible to elaborate much beyond a single axis of good-to-bad sleep. Thus, polysomnographic measures may not provide adequate evidence to classify insomnia, depression, and narcolepsy as separate entities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1467388/"}

They appear during sleep stage 2 but also in stages 3, 4 and REM (Rapid Eye Movements). Patients with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complain of insomnia, although objective studies have revealed that their sleep is deeper and their awakening threshold is higher. The relationships between PTSD or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) to SS density are not described in the literature. This study aimed to examine the hypothesis that the higher awakening threshold reflects an active defense process which would be manifested in increased sleep spindles in patients with PTSD. A total of 15 PTSD patients (36.3 +/- 11.4 years) comprised the research group and 15 healthy students (27.3 +/- 2.18 years) comprised the control group. Participants underwent a polysomnography study in the sleep laboratory at 'Rambam' Hospital, Haifa, Israel. There was no difference in the sleep spindles density per minute during stage 2 between the research group (2.54 +/- 1.14) and the control group (2.86 +/- 1.3). However, sleep spindles density was highly affected by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such that PTSD patients treated with SSRI's had significantly higher spindles density than the remaining PTSD patients (3.25 +/- 1.1 vs 1.72 +/- 0.46, p=0.0044). Stage 2 was shorter in the research group (47% +/- 8.75%) compared to the control group (58% +/- 8.5%, p=0.0014), while stages 3, 4 were longer (32% +/- 8% vs 18% +/- 6.26%, p<0.001). Sleep spindle density was generally not increased in patients with PTSD, thus other mechanisms are probably responsible for their stabilization of sleep.

Pearson correlations between BDNF and sleep outcomes were calculated. Data analysis was limited to 87 survivors who provided serum samples. Among 87 survivors, the mean age was 61.9 (SD: 11.4) years, 51.7% were women, and 24.1% were non-White. Mean serum BDNF did not significantly increase in acupuncture (n = 50) or CBT-I (n = 37) groups. When analysis was restricted to patients with low baseline BDNF (i.e. levels below the sample median of 47.1 ng/mL), the acupuncture group (n = 22) demonstrated a significant 7.2 ng/mL increase in mean serum BDNF (P = 0.03), whereas the CBT-I group (n = 21) demonstrated a non-significant 2.9 ng/mL increase (P = 0.28). Serum BDNF was not significantly correlated with sleep outcomes (all P > 0.05). Among cancer survivors with insomnia and low baseline BDNF, acupuncture significantly increased serum BDNF levels; however, the clinical significance of this finding requires further investigation.<b>Trial registration no.</b> NCT02356575 (ClinicalTrials.gov).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33752446/"}

It comprises three domains: Alert/Cognition, Mood, and Sleepiness. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the minimum within-patient change for IDSIQ scores that an adult patient with insomnia would consider meaningful. Data were from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial of daridorexant in adults with insomnia. Subjects completed the IDSIQ daily in the evening, with a recall period of 'today', throughout the 3-month double-blind treatment period. Scores were calculated as a weekly average. Each IDSIQ item was scored on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (not at all/none at all) to 10 (very/a lot), with a higher score indicating a greater severity or impact. PRO measures with correlation coefficients ≥0.30 were included in a subsequent anchor-based analysis. For the IDSIQ total score and each IDSIQ domain, meaningful within-patient change was estimated as the minimum score change patients would consider meaningful in an anchor-based analysis using data from PRO instruments capturing daytime and night-time insomnia symptoms (the Insomnia Severity Index [four items, each scored 0-4, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity; assessed at screening, baseline, month 1 and month 3], Patient Global Assessment of Disease Severity [6-point scale from 'none' to 'very severe'; assessed weekly], Patient Global Impression of Severity [4-point scale from 'none' to 'severe'; assessed weekly], and Patient Global Impression of Change [7-point scale from 'very much better' to 'very much worse'; assessed weekly for night-time and daytime symptoms separately]). A supplemental distribution-based analysis was also conducted to support the anchor-based analysis. The analysis included 930 subjects aged 18-88 years. Spearman correlation coefficients for the relationships between score changes/ratings for anchors and the IDSIQ (0.36-0.44 at month 1, 0.45-0.57 at month 3) were all above the prespecified threshold of 0.30. Mean IDSIQ score changes at months 1 and 3 based on the different anchors supported meaningful within-patient change estimates starting at 17 points for the IDSIQ total score, 9 points for the Alert/Cognition domain, and 4 points for the Mood and Sleepiness domains. This analysis demonstrates the meaningful within-patient change for the IDSIQ total score and domain scores, that the instrument is sensitive to changes in the patient experience of insomnia, and that it can be used in clinical trials to evaluate changes in daytime functioning.

We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and extracted items related to subjective sleep quality and sleep duration. Insomnia symptoms were also extracted from the PSQI. The hypothesized models were tested using structural equation modeling. Worse sleep quality, but not shorter sleep duration, was related to worse physical QOL. Both worse sleep quality and shorter sleep duration were related to worse mental QOL. Insomnia symptoms mediated these relationships. Subgroup analyses revealed a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and physical/mental QOL. However, the relationship between sleep quality and physical/mental QOL was consistent regardless of sleep duration. The results suggest that subjective sleep quality has a more coherent association with QOL than subjective sleep duration.

Two RCTs were done by the same group of investigators (Ritterband and colleagues) using the same internet programmes. Post-treatment mean differences between groups showed that the effects of CCBT-I on sleep quality, sleep efficiency, the number of awakenings, sleep onset latency and the Insomnia Severity Index were significant, ranging from small to large effect sizes. However, effects on wake time after sleep onset, total sleep time and time in bed were non-significant. On average, the number needed to treat was 3.59. The treatment adherence rate for CCBT-I was high (78%). The results lend support to CCBT as a mildly to moderately effective self-help therapy in the short run for insomnia.

Whilst research has examined the relationships between perfectionism and insomnia, the mediating role of dysfunctional sleep-related cognition (i.e. sleep-related worry and dysfunctional beliefs about the biological attribution of and consequences of poor sleep) has yet to be examined. This study aimed to determine whether aspects of multidimensional perfectionism were related to increased reporting of insomnia symptoms. In addition, the potential mediating role of dysfunctional sleep-related cognition and anxiety symptoms was examined. Members of the general population (N = 624) completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. The results showed that perfectionism dimensions, anxiety symptoms, and dysfunctional sleep-related cognition were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms. Regression-based mediation analyses further showed that both dysfunctional sleep-related cognition and anxiety significantly mediated the associations between insomnia symptoms and three perfectionism dimensions (i.e. doubts about action, parental expectations, and parental criticism). The experience of perfectionistic tendencies, anxiety, and dysfunctional sleep-related cognition may initiate behavioural strategies (e.g. daytime napping) when faced with an acute sleep problem.

Epidemiologic data show that the co-occurrence of the two disorders is quite frequent. Thus an approach regarding them as a unit promotes biological psychiatric research by revealing new pathophysiological and therapeutic conclusions. Chronobiological results related to mood disorders have recently been described in excellent reviews including Hungarian ones. In the present review, the necessity of treatment of sleep disorders is evaluated in the context of relapse/remission/recurrence. Scientific data suggest that patients with insomnia have a ten-fold risk of developing depression, and insomnia plays an important role in depression relapses, recurrence of depressive episodes and becoming depression chronic. From neurobiological point of view, mood and sleep disorders have many features in common. Research has revealed decreased levels of melatonin and advanced sleep phases (shifted earlier) in depression, and altered and imbalanced monoaminergic pathways, and REM abnormalities in sleep disorders. Some authors suggest that REM abnormalities disappear along with the mood improvement, and the sleep structure can completely restore after remission. However, persistent abnormalities of REM sleep and slow wave sleep have also been found in remission, which increased the risk of the relapse and recurrence. Recently, there is an agreement as to the early treatment of insomnia can prevent the development of mood abnormalities. Alterations of cascades related to neural plasticity can also be a link between sleep and mood disorders. Neural plasticity is closely related to learning, sleeping, and cortisol regulation (coping with stress), and this draws the attention to comorbidity with further disorders (anxiety, dementia).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347243/"}

This United States medical claims database study compares patients diagnosed with insomnia disorder but not receiving treatment ('untreated insomnia' cohort) to patients without an insomnia disorder diagnosis and without treatment ('non-insomnia' cohort). International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes were used as a proxy to represent the three symptom domains (Sleepiness, Alert/Cognition, Mood) of the Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire (IDSIQ), a newly developed and validated tool used in clinical studies to assess daytime functioning in insomnia disorder. Chronic Fatigue (R53.83) and Other Fatigue (R53.83), Somnolence (R40.0) and Disorientation (R41.0) were selected as categories representing one or more IDSIQ domains. Clinical outcomes included cardiovascular events, psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment and metabolic disorders. Approximately 1 million patients were included (untreated insomnia: n = 139,959; non-insomnia: n = 836,975). Compared with the 'non-insomnia' cohort, the 'untreated insomnia' cohort was more likely to experience daytime impairments, with mean differences in occurrences per 100 patient-years for: (a) fatigue, at 27.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 26.81, 27.77, p < 0.01); (b) dizziness, at 4.66 (95% CI 4.40, 4.90, p < 0.01); (c) somnolence, at 4.18 (95% CI 3.94, 4.43, p < 0.01); and (d) disorientation, at 0.92 (95% CI 0.77, 1.06, p < 0.01).

CBTI is highly effective but has limited scalability. It is often unavailable in clinical settings where service members receive sleep care. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to scale and broaden the geographic reach of CBTI services and support increased patient access and engagement in behavioral sleep care. This study aims to evaluate the impact and acceptability of digital CBTI hubs to augment military treatment facilities' capabilities in behavioral sleep medicine. This is a multi-site, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of in-person (face-to-face or virtual) insomnia care as usual at three military sleep clinics versus CBTI delivered remotely and asynchronously through digital CBTI hubs. Digital CBTI hubs are led by licensed, certified clinicians who use NOCTEM's® evidence-based clinical decision support platform COAST™ (Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology). Changes in insomnia severity and daytime symptoms of depression and anxiety will be compared at baseline, at 6-8 weeks, and at 3-month follow-up. Patient satisfaction with insomnia care as usual versus digital CBTI hubs will also be examined. We hypothesize that digital CBTI hubs will be non-inferior to insomnia care as usual for improvements in insomnia and daytime symptoms as well as patient satisfaction with insomnia care. Digital technology has a high potential to scale CBTI accessibility and delivery options required to meet the insomnia care needs of military service members. Digital CBTI hubs using COAST offer a novel approach to broaden service members' access to CBTI and to serve as an augmentation strategy for existing sleep services at military treatment facilities.

DIS, DMS and NRS were associated with daytime fatigue but not excessive sleepiness as measured by the Epworth scale. DIS was associated with the use of sleeping pills or natural sleeping aid compounds in multivariate models.

Insomnia is also a common comorbidity across psychiatric disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia; a key component of this intervention is restriction of sleep opportunity, which optimizes matching of sleep ability and opportunity, leading to enhanced sleep drive. Despite the well-documented efficacy of CBT-I, little is known regarding how CBT-I works at a cellular and molecular level to improve sleep, due in large part to an absence of experimentally-tractable animals models of this intervention. Here, guided by human behavioral sleep therapies, we developed a Drosophila model for sleep restriction therapy (SRT) of insomnia. We demonstrate that restriction of sleep opportunity through manipulation of environmental cues improves sleep efficiency in multiple short-sleeping Drosophila mutants. The response to sleep opportunity restriction requires ongoing environmental inputs, but is independent of the molecular circadian clock. We apply this sleep opportunity restriction paradigm to aging and Alzheimer's disease fly models, and find that sleep impairments in these models are reversible with sleep restriction, with associated improvement in reproductive fitness and extended lifespan. This work establishes a model to investigate the neurobiological basis of CBT-I, and provides a platform that can be exploited toward novel treatment targets for insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30824866/"}

Secondary analyses were performed on data from 74 patients with comorbid insomnia and knee osteoarthritis who completed a randomized clinical trial of 8-session multicomponent CBT-I versus an active behavioral desensitization control condition (BD), including a 6-month follow-up assessment. Data used herein include daily diaries of sleep parameters, actigraphy data, and self-report questionnaires administered at specific time points. Patients who reported at least 30% improvement in self-reported pain from baseline to 6-month follow-up were considered responders (N = 31). Pain responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly at baseline across any sleep continuity measures. At mid-treatment, only TST predicted pain response via t tests and logistic regression, whereas other measures of sleep continuity were nonsignificant. Recursive partitioning analyses identified a minimum cut-point of 382 min of TST achieved at mid-treatment in order to best predict pain improvements 6-month posttreatment. Actigraphy results followed the same pattern as daily diary-based results. Clinically significant pain reductions in response to both CBT-I and BD were optimally predicted by achieving approximately 6.5 hr sleep duration by mid-treatment.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven \"component\" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with \"good\" sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and \"poor\" sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score greater than 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p less than 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinimetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2748771/"}

Although factors related to restorative sleep in healthy subjects have been investigated, evaluations of these factors in patients with depression have been rarely done. Patients with depression are known to have sleep-wake state discrepancy, which can further influence their restorative sleep beyond that associated with depressive symptoms. Thus, we investigated restorative sleep in depressed patients in our current study, and attempted to identify associated factors, with a particular focus on sleep-wake state discrepancy. In the 91 participants evaluated in this cross-sectional study, all subjects filled out questionnaires on their symptoms prior to undergoing polysomnography (PSG). Sleep duration and restorative sleep were evaluated on the morning after the PSG. The association between restorative sleep and various factors was then examined using multiple regression analysis. A negative association with restorative sleep was found through multiple regression analysis for depressive symptoms (β = -0.055, p = 0.007), daytime sleepiness (β = -0.106, p = 0.020), and overestimation of wake after sleep onset (β = -0.006, p = 0.030).

In tests, singular spectrum of particular sleep stages such as awake, REM, stage1 and stage2, are considered. Three clinical groups are successfully classified by using one hidden layer ANN architecture with respect to their singular spectra. The results show that the SSA can be applied to sleep EEG series to support the clinical findings in insomnia if ten trials are available for the specific sleep stages. In conclusion, the SSA can detect the oscillatory variations on sleep EEG. Therefore, different sleep stages meet different singular spectra. In addition, different healthy conditions generate different singular spectra for each sleep stage.

In order to stay close to common clinical practice, data were collected by means of two-week sleep diaries in combination with repeated measurements of subjective alertness and oral temperature. Special measures were taken to minimize the impact of masking upon the temperature measurements. In addition, wrist activity was monitored for an overlapping period of 11 days. Measurements of oral temperature and subjective alertness were fitted with 3 (rd) -degree polynomials, for which the peak times (times of maximum) were identified. Principal Components Analysis of these peak times and the times of bed-in and wake-up for all subjects revealed that the phase estimates for the alertness and the sleep-wake rhythms had a strong interrelationship, which was independent from the temperature phase. Using the 25- and the 75-percentiles of the frequency distribution of the temperature peak times as boundaries, the subjects were classified into early (N = 18), middle (N = 37) and late (N = 19) temperature phase subgroups, which had mean peak times of 14:08 h, 17:43 h and 20:09 h, respectively. Comparisons between the early phase and the late phase subgroups showed that a significant overall MANOVA effect was mainly due to differences in total sleep time (early < late) as calculated from the log, and to differences in the mean nocturnal actigraphic count (early> late). Moreover, the subjective estimates of sleep latency (early < late) and wake after sleep onset (early > late) tended to differ between the two subgroups. The main result of this study, i.e., that insomniacs with a relatively advanced temperature phase had a relatively shorter and more restless sleep, while insomniacs with a relatively delayed temperature phase tended to experience a relatively long sleep latency, supports the conclusion that the addition of oral temperature measurements to a sleep/wake log extends its diagnostic and therapeutic applicability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10916166/"}

Agreement between PSG, actigraphy and sleep diary measurements was evaluated using two-tailed t-tests, Pearson's correlations and the Bland-Altman concordance technique. The only significant difference found between actigraphy and PSG was in latency to persistent sleep, in which actigraphy underestimated sleep latency relative to PSG (P < 0.05). There were moderate positive correlations between actigraphy and PSG for all variables. In contrast, significant differences were observed between sleep diaries and PSG for all sleep variables. Bland-Altman concordance diagrams also demonstrated that, while bias was limited between PSG and the other two measurement types, there were somewhat broad 95% limits of agreement for all sleep variables with both sleep diaries and actigraphy.

Studies have shown that depressed patients not only have disturbances in sleep continuity but have reduced slow wave sleep and disinhibited REM sleep. In particular, REM sleep regulation is characterized by shortened REM latency and increased REM density. It has been suggested that the reciprocal interaction between REM and nonREM sleep, driven by inhibitory aminergic and excitatory cholinergic activity, becomes unbalanced in depression. Exposure to cholinergic stimulants reduces REM latency, particularly in major depressive disorder. In fact, it has been shown that healthy individuals at high risk for developing depression have greater sensitivity to cholinergic stimulation than those not at high risk. While the causality of the insomnia-depression relationship is debated, epidemiological studies have indicated that insomnia is an independent risk factor for depression and other psychiatric disorders.

Of the 1,712 respondents (response rate: 87%), 1,258 male worker subjects (blue-collar 674; white-collar 584) were analyzed after excluding those with mental diseases. The questionnaire included items on basic attributes and lifestyle.

Higher concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and propionate, and total SCFAs, were associated with lower SE and longer SOL after controlling for Body Mass Index (BMI). Concentrations were higher in the short sleep duration phenotype. Age, BMI, TST, and SOL explained 40.7% of the variance in total SCFAs.

Subjective sleep quality and sleep disturbances were examined with regard to self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, seizure-related factors, and demographic factors. The PSQI scores and ISI scores of patients were significantly higher (indicating lower quality sleep and more serious insomnia) than those of the control group. Symptoms associated with depression and anxiety were independently related to impaired subjective sleep quality and insomnia. Affective symptoms explained more of the variance in PSQI scores and ISI scores than did seizure-related or demographic variables. In addition, these variables also seemed to be less powerful contributing factors to subjective sleep quality and insomnia than affective symptoms, several seizure-related factors, such as seizure control, partial seizures and duration of epilepsy, which are also significantly associated with subjective sleep quality and insomnia. In addition, use of lamotrigine (LTG) was also associated with insomnia and use of clonazepam (CZP) and phenobarbital (PB) with daytime sleepiness in patients with epilepsy. Chinese adults with epilepsy have poorer self-reported subjective sleep quality and a higher prevalence of insomnia than the control group. Depressive- and anxiety-related symptoms independently exert an adverse effect on the subjective sleep quality and insomnia of patients. In addition, seizure control, partial seizures, and the duration of epilepsy affect the quality of sleep and insomnia in patients, but seem less powerful predictors of sleep quality and insomnia than affective symptoms. Early identification and treatment of affective symptoms is of great importance in improving the sleep quality and insomnia of patients with epilepsy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28697489/"}

While promoted as safer alternatives to conventional tobacco and as tools for quitting smoking, e-cigarettes have raised alarm about possible long-term health consequences. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to evaluate the association between electronic cigarette consumption and sleep disturbances. We performed comprehensive searches in EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed up to September 18, 2024, to locate studies examining the link between e-cigarette use and sleep duration, sleep disorders, and insomnia. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was performed using R software (Version 4.3). A total of 14 cross-sectional studies were included from 554 unique records screened. E-cigarette users exhibited a notably elevated risk of having shorter sleep duration compared to non-users, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.38 (95% CI: 1.24-1.55). Several studies reported that e-cigarette users also had higher odds of sleep disturbances, such as insomnia and reliance on sleep medications. Among adolescents, e-cigarette use was associated with a 33 to 61% increased risk of inadequate sleep. E-cigarette use may be associated with sleep disturbances, including shorter sleep duration and increased sleep difficulties. Future long term longitudinal studies are warranted for better evidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40951402/"}

We enrolled 420 patients (age 20-79 y) who underwent polysomnography (PSG). They were divided into three groups based on chief complaints: chronic insomnia (CI, n = 69), patients with both obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia (OSA-I, n = 49) or OSA only (OSA, n = 149). Healthy volunteers were also recruited (normal controls [NC], n = 80). We compared differences in PSG parameters and habitual sleep duration and investigated the discrepancy between objective and subjective total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency among four groups. Subjective TST was defined as sleep time perceived by participants the next morning of PSG. SP for TST was highest in the OSA group (median 92.9%), and lowest in the CI group (80.3%). SP of the NC group (91.4%) was higher than the CI, but there was no difference between OSA-I and OSA groups. OSA-I had higher depressive mood compared to the OSA group (p < 0.001). SP was positively associated with the presence of OSA and habitual sleep duration and negatively related to the presence of insomnia and arousal index of PSG. Insomnia patients with (OSA-I) or without OSA (CI) reported the smallest discrepancy between habitual sleep duration and objective TST. Patients with OSA with or without insomnia have different PSG profiles, which suggests that objective measures of sleep are an important consideration for differentiating subtypes of insomnia and tailoring proper treatment.

The spontaneous activity of hippocampal theta cells in head-restrained cats was recorded during slow-wave sleep (SWS), paradoxical sleep (PS), and the attentive state of bird watching (BW). We also recorded theta cell activity during a state of insomnia with pontogeniculoocipital (PGO) waves, which was induced by the administration of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), a selective inhibitor of serotonin synthesis. 2. The time-dependent structure of fluctuations in theta cell activity was evaluated by power spectral analysis and Markovian analysis. The coefficient of variation for these time series was used as a measure of the variability of theta cell activity, which indicates the relative amplitude of fluctuations. 3. During SWS, theta cell activity showed a larger variability and a flat spectrum, i.e., low Markovian properties. During PS, this activity exhibited smaller variability and high spectral density in a low-frequency band (0.01-1.0 Hz), i.e., high Markovian properties. During BW, variability, spectral and Markovian properties were intermediate. 4. The firing pattern of theta cells during PCPA-induced insomnia was similar to that during PS. However, after the administration of either a serotonin agonist, 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, or a choline antagonist, atropine sulfate, theta cell activity no longer exhibited PS-like fluctuations, revealing instead a firing pattern similar to that during SWS. 5. During PS and PCPA-induced insomnia, not only the unit activity of theta cells, but PGO activity and theta wave frequency exhibited slow fluctuations, i.e., the high spectral density in the low-frequency band (0.01-1.0 Hz). 6. Cross-correlation analyses were performed between the fluctuations in theta cell activity, theta wave frequency, and PGO activity. These fluctuations correlated with each other during both PS and PCPA-induced insomnia. Bursts of PGO waves especially contributed to these cross-correlations. 7. These results suggest, first, that the slow fluctuations of the theta cell activity during PS and PCPA-induced insomnia is the physiological expression of the removal of aminergic influences and, secondly, that they are dependent on cholinergic mechanisms, including PGO generators.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2971787/"}

Analysis was carried out for 21 healthy individuals with no diagnosed sleep disorders and 26 subjects diagnosed with acute insomnia during night-time hours. Detrended fluctuation analysis was applied in order to look for 1/f-fluctuations indicative of high complexity. The aim is to investigate whether complexity analysis can differentiate between people who sleep normally and people who suffer from acute insomnia. We hypothesize that the complexity will be higher in subjects who suffer from acute insomnia owing to increased night-time arousals. This hypothesis, although contrary to much of the literature surrounding complexity in physiology, was found to be correct-for our study. The complexity results for nearly all of the subjects fell within a 1/f-range, indicating the presence of underlying control mechanisms. The subjects with acute insomnia displayed significantly higher correlations, confirmed by significance testing-possibly a result of too much activity in the underlying regulatory systems. Moreover, we found a linear relationship between complexity and variability, both of which increased with the onset of insomnia.

Women had their sleep monitored, collected urine samples, and completed questionnaires in a week-long field study, and 53 women met criteria for insomnia types or no insomnia based on reported sleep quality and PSG sleep efficiency. As expected, women with PP-type insomnia were found to have the lowest sleep efficiency, took longer to fall asleep, had more wakefulness after sleep onset, and had more fragmented sleep. Perceptions of stress exposure, either for major or minor events, did not differ among groups. Despite there being no differences in perceived stress exposure, women with both types of insomnia scored higher on psychological distress (SCL-90R), especially on the somatization subscale, than women with no insomnia. Of the physiological stress activation indicators tested, a morning-to-evening difference in urinary cortisol statistically differed across the groups (p <.005). Women in the PP-type insomnia group had the highest levels of urinary cortisol in an early morning urine sample.

The state-of-the-art insomnia detection models that used physiological signals in PSG were successful in classification. However, the sleep stages of unbalanced data in small-time intervals were fed for classification in previous studies. This can be avoided by analyzing the insomnia detection structure in different frequency bands with artificially generated data from the existing one at the preprocessing and post-processing stages. Hence, the paper proposes a double-layered augmentation model using Modified Conventional Signal Augmentation (MCSA) and a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) to generate synthetic signals from raw EEG and synthetic data from extracted features, respectively, in creating training data. The presented work is independent of sleep stage scoring and provides double-layered data protection with the utility of augmentation methods. It is ideally suited for real-time detection using a single-channel EEG provides better mobility and comfort while recording. The work analyzes each augmentation layer's performance individually, and better accuracy was observed when merging both. It also evaluates the augmentation performance in various frequency bands, which are decomposed using discrete wavelet transform, and observed that the alpha band contributes more to detection. The classification is performed using Decision Tree (DT), Ensembled Bagged Decision Tree (EBDT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), and Stacking classifier (SC), attaining the highest classification accuracy of 94% using RF with a greater Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.97 compared to the existing works and is best suited for small datasets.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39379545/"}

Forty-five adults with PTSD and insomnia participated in the study. Fear of sleep was assessed using the Fear of Sleep Inventory; PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale; and sleep disturbance symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, polysomnography, sleep diaries, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for PTSD. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of CBT-I (n = 29) or a waitlist control condition (n = 16). Greater fear of sleep was associated with greater PTSD symptom severity, greater nightmare frequency, and greater hypervigilance intensity. Greater fear of sleep was associated with decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO), reduced total sleep time, and greater disruptive nocturnal behaviors. Following CBT-I, there was a significant reduction in fear of sleep compared to the waitlist condition. These improvements persisted 6 months later. Fear of sleep was related to sleep disturbances specific to trauma rather than \"classic\" insomnia symptoms. Unexpectedly, greater fear of sleep was associated with reduced WASO. These results may be related to having a truncated sleep period and thus more consolidated sleep. Fear of sleep deceased following CBT-I despite not being a permissible target for this research protocol and not being related to insomnia symptoms.

The insomnia group comprised individuals who self-reported meeting the diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia disorder in the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. The ICS is used to independently assess nighttime (ICS-N) and daytime (ICS-D) catastrophic thoughts, and item response theory revealed that each ICS-N and ICS-D item can adequately assess catastrophic thoughts during the night and day, respectively.

Primary outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and polysomnography (PSG) sleep parameters and were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. Patients with lower pretreatment PSG sleep efficiency had lower rates of insomnia remission after active treatment relative to those with higher sleep efficiency (37.8% vs 61.8%). Neither CBTI and SRT produced clinically meaningful effects on PSG sleep. Exploratory analyses revealed that reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal were associated with decreases in PSG sleep latency, but not wake after sleep onset. Our findings support an emerging literature suggesting that insomnia patients with objective sleep disturbance may have blunted response to insomnia therapy. Research is needed to enhance treatments to better improve insomnia in patients with objective sleep disturbance. A lack of observed CBTI and SRT effects on PSG sleep suggests that these therapies may be presently ill-designed to improve objective sleep.

The practice is simple to use and has been clearly laid out, but its role in the treatment of chronic insomnia has not been well studied. Methods In this randomized parallel-design study conducted during 2012-16, we enrolled 41 patients with chronic insomnia to receive conventional intervention of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (n=20) or yoga nidra (n=21). Outcome measures were both subjective using a sleep diary and objective using polysomnography (PSG). Salivary cortisol levels were also measured. PSG was done before the intervention in all patients and repeated only in those who volunteered for the same. Results Both interventions showed an improvement in subjective total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, reduction in total wake duration and enhancement in subjective sleep quality. Objectively, both the interventions improved TST and total wake duration and increased N1% of TST. Yoga nidra showed marked improvement in N2% and N3% in TST. Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly after yoga nidra (p=0.041). Conclusion Improvement of N3 sleep, total wake duration and subjective sleep quality occurred following yoga nidra practice. Yoga nidra practice can be used for treatment of chronic insomnia after supervised practice sessions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34825538/"}

Understanding the role of work in insomnia in the US.", "text": "This study explores the role of work in patient narratives about their experiences with insomnia. \"Work\" includes such facets as the nature of one's occupation, the associated volume or amount of work required, mental demands related to work, work schedules and work-related stress. Interviews conducted with 24 patients aged between 22 and 74 receiving treatment for insomnia at one of two sleep medicine clinics in Oregon and Texas, USA, suggest that work is a pivotal influence in shaping interpretations of the nature of insomnia, its causes, and the efficacy of medical treatment. Results suggest correlations between sleeplessness and modern working lifestyles in American culture, in which labor seems to transcend the physical workplace, manifesting itself in the form of cognitive labor or continued problems into retirement. Patients often cite work as the primary causal agent in the development of their insomnia, their primary reason for needing \"good\" sleep, their impetus for seeking medical attention, and behavioral compliance with a medically prescribed regimen. Insomnia as an illness experience thus serves as a mechanism through which respondents consciously or unconsciously comment on the nature of work in their lives. The medical and social implications of these results are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18006129/"}

All patients completed questionnaires at a primary care centre's first and final visit to assess general anxiety, sleep quality, sleep reactivity to stress, and quality of life. Our analysis showed that sleep quality, sleep reactivity to stress, and quality of life improved significantly for all patients between the first and final visit (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the Fitbit and control groups. Using sleep diary-derived estimates from the first and last week, we found that the control group but not the Fitbit group, increased their average time asleep each night and sleep efficiency (p < 0.05).

However, guideline care is very seldom available and most patients receive no treatment, or less effective second-line pharmacotherapy or sleep hygiene, neither of which are evidence-based for chronic insomnia. The primary challenge for CBT has been supply. There are not enough therapists to meet the enormous demand. We must accelerate clinician training, but this approach can never be sufficient, even with abbreviated, efficient therapies. Fortunately, however, the treatment landscape has also changed dramatically. Fully-automated digital CBT (dCBT) has emerged as a safe, effective, and scalable treatment delivery format. dCBT is software only, so it can be disseminated as readily and widely as sleep medication. Moreover, dCBT can be integrated into services. Just as medications can be delivered through health professionals and health systems, approved dCBT programmes can be the same. However, an ecosystem of psychologically-based care should not necessitate a medical prescription model. Our proposed stepped care framework, comprises both population health and clinical health service initiatives, enabling universal access to guideline care for insomnia. The diverse ways in which CBT may be delivered (in-person, face-to-face, using telehealth, group therapy, digitally) can operate congruently and efficiently to optimise treatment for people at all levels of complexity and need. With safe and clinically effective dCBT products now set to become established as treatments, clearly differentiated from wellness apps, there is potential to rapidly transform insomnia services and, for the first time, to deliver clinical guideline care at international scale.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37642008/"}

We also assessed whether two forms of repetitive negative thought-rumination and worry-are similarly involved in the stress-sleep relationship. Data was collected from 178 participants across the United States via an online platform. Participants completed baseline self-report surveys examining rumination tendencies and worry tendencies. Over the course of 2 weeks, participants completed daily questionnaires assessing daily stress, PSA, and sleep quality. Results indicated that indirect effects from stress to sleep quality via PSA were statistically significant at low and high levels of rumination and worry, and people at high levels of rumination and worry had stronger relationships between stress and PSA.

Theoretical models suggest that potentiation of sleep pressure and reduction of arousal are key mechanisms of action. To our knowledge, this has never been directly tested. We designed a randomized controlled trial with embedded mechanistic measurement to investigate if SRT causally modifies multidimensional assessments of sleep pressure and arousal. Participants aged 25-55 who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to four weeks of SRT or time in bed regularization (TBR), a control intervention that involves prescription of a regular but not reduced time in bed. Sleep pressure was assessed through daily diary appraisal of morning and evening sleepiness, weekly Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores, psychomotor vigilance, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) delta power (0.75-4.5 Hz) from ambulatory polysomnographic recordings. Arousal was assessed through daily diary appraisal of cognitive arousal, the pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and NREM beta power (15-32 Hz). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (2-week period prior to randomization), during the intervention phase (1-4 weeks post-randomization), and at 12-week follow-up. We performed intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed models. For continuous daily measures, the treatment period was split into early (weeks 1-2) and late (weeks 3-4) treatment. Fifty-six participants (39 females, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08) were assigned to SRT (n = 27) or TBR (n = 29). The SRT group showed enhanced sleep pressure relative to TBR, reflected in (1) enhanced sleepiness in the evening during early (d = 1.17) and late treatment (d = 0.92), and in the morning during early treatment (d = 0.47); (2) higher daytime sleepiness on the ESS at weeks-1 and -2 (d = 0.54, d = 0.45); and (3) reduced psychomotor vigilance at week-1 (d = 0.34). The SRT group also showed reduced arousal relative to TBR, reflected in lower levels of daily-monitored cognitive arousal during early treatment (d = 0.53) and decreased PSAS total score at week-4 and week-12 (ds ≥ 0.39). Power spectral analysis of all night NREM sleep revealed an increase in relative, but not absolute, EEG delta power at week-1 and week-4 (ds ≥ 0.52) and a decrease of relative EEG beta power at week-4 (d = 0.11).

It is highly comorbid with medical and psychiatric disorders, and is associated with significantly increased healthcare utilization and costs. Evidence-based psychotherapy, namely Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI), is an effective treatment and recommended over prescription sleep medications. While CBTI is part of a nationwide rollout in the Veterans Health Administration to train hundreds of providers, access to treatment is still limited for many Veterans due to limited treatment availability, low patient and provider knowledge about treatment options, and Veteran barriers such as distance and travel, work schedules, and childcare. Uptake of a briefer, more primary-care-friendly treatment into routine clinical care in Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care settings, where insomnia is typically first recognized and diagnosed, may effectively and efficiently increase access to effective insomnia interventions and help decrease the risks and burdens related to chronic insomnia. This hybrid type I trial is composed of two aims. The first preliminarily tests the clinical non-inferiority of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) versus the current \"gold standard\" treatment, CBTI. The second is a qualitative needs assessment, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to identify potential factors that may affect successful implementation and integration of behavioral treatments for insomnia in the primary care setting. To identify potential implementation factors, individual interviews are conducted with the Veterans who participate in the clinical trial, as well as VA primary care providers and nursing staff.

This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms. After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia. Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study. Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24732691/"}

In order to test the assumed causal relationships, the present study examined the time-dependent course of negative metacognition and worry as well as worry and sleep quality, using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Negative metacognitions, worry and sleep were assessed by self-report questionnaires as well as EMA in 56 GAD patients who carried a portable device for 1 week and logged sleep quality, negative metacognition and worry processes four times a day. Metacognitions, worry and sleep were significantly correlated. Structural equation modeling using multilevel analyses showed a unidirectional relationship of negative metacognitions leading to prolonged worry processes and a bidirectional relationship of worry and sleep quality. These findings support the theoretically derived assumptions on the relationship between negative metacognitions, worry and sleep. Implications for further research as well as clinical implications are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26005837/"}

Automatic sleep staging plays a crucial role in aiding doctors to diagnose insomnia disorder. Only a few studies have been conducted to develop automatic sleep staging methods for insomniacs, and most of them have utilized transfer learning methods, which involve pre-training models on healthy individuals and then fine-tuning them on insomniacs. Unfortunately, significant differences in feature distribution between the two subject groups impede the transfer performance, highlighting the need to effectively integrate the features of healthy subjects and insomniacs. In this paper, we propose a dual-teacher cross-domain knowledge transfer method based on the feature-based knowledge distillation to improve the performance of sleep staging for insomniacs. Specifically, the insomnia teacher directly learns from insomniacs and feeds the corresponding domain-specific features into the student network, while the health domain teacher guide the student network to learn domain-generic features. During the training process, we adopt the OFD (Overhaul of Feature Distillation) method to build the health domain teacher. We conducted the experiments to validate the proposed method, using the Sleep-EDF database as the source domain and the CAP-Database as the target domain. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses advanced techniques, achieving an average sleep staging accuracy of 80.56% on the CAP-Database. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising performance on the private dataset.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38032775/"}

The response rate was 33.5%. Insomnia symptoms were assessed with the validated Bergen Insomnia Scale, and chronic insomnia based on ICSD-3/DSM-5 criteria. Data were analysed with chi-square tests and logistic regression with adjustment for sex, age, education, and circadian preference. The results showed that 34.3% reported using a method or a trick to fall asleep, with relaxation exercises/breathing exercises being the most common. More females (39.5%) compared with males (29.1%) reported the use of a method/trick to fall asleep with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.44.

A randomized, controlled design was used. The design included a 2-week baseline, a 4-week intervention phase (sleep restriction and stimulus control [BT] or sleep restriction and stimulus control plus constructive worry [BT + CW]), and a 2-week follow-up. Twenty-two patients with primary insomnia participated. The primary outcome was the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ), and secondary endpoints were subjective sleep estimates, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). Although both conditions produced significant improvements in subjective sleep estimates, no significant group differences over time were shown for total wake time (TWT) and total sleep time (TST). Both interventions resulted in reductions over time in insomnia severity, worry, and dysfunction. Compared to BT, BT + CW led to a larger decrease in insomnia severity at all three time points (controlled d= 1.10-1.68). In comparison with BT, BT + CW resulted in a larger reduction in worry at two of the time points (controlled d= 0.76-1.64). No significant differences between the two conditions were demonstrated for dysfunction. While more participants responded positively to treatment in the BT + CW (80-100%) than in the BT condition (18-27%), none of the participants remitted. The findings suggest that, compared to BT alone, CW might result in additional improvements in insomnia severity and worry.

Comparison with drug-free insomniacs showed that LBD leads to a complete loss of hypnotic activity and substantial suppression of delta and REM sleep. Only small differences were found between benzodiazepines with different half-life time. Upon withdrawal, recovery from this suppression, especially in REM sleep, occurred, while insomnia did not increase. The patients, however, reported sleeping longer while taking the drug compared with withdrawal. This misperception seems to be a specific effect of benzodiazepines, and contrasts with the full awareness of insomnia upon withdrawal. It is concluded that these effects play a leading role in the patients' inability to escape their sleeping pills. The response of REM sleep to withdrawal should make this a useful measure to objectively confirm low-dose benzodiazepine dependence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2906215/"}

Thirty-nine clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and insomnia were randomized to either 3mg eszopiclone (n=20) or placebo (n=19). Primary outcome measure was change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) over 8 weeks. Secondary outcome measure was change in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MATRICS).

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first choice treatment and effective for people with insomnia and comorbid long-term medical conditions. However, CBT-I has some limitations as it might not always be available or appeal to patients with medical conditions. Furthermore, a small proportion of patients do not respond to CBT-I. Preliminary evidence and clinical experience suggest that low-dose amitriptyline (AM) might be an effective alternative to treat insomnia in patients with medical comorbidity. In this randomized controlled trial, we will determine whether AM is non-inferior to the first choice treatment for insomnia, CBT-I. This study will test if treatment with low-dose amitriptyline for insomnia in patients with medical comorbidity is non-inferior to CBT-I in a multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention arms: 12 weeks AM (starting with 10 mg per day, and if ineffective at 3 weeks, doubling this dose) or 12 weeks of CBT-I consisting of 6 weekly sessions and a follow-up session 6 weeks later. The primary outcome is subjective insomnia severity, measured with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The primary endpoint is at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include sleep quality (e.g., sleep efficiency), questionnaires on daytime functioning (physical functioning and impairment of functioning), and symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain, anxiety) at 12 weeks and 12 months post treatment and relapse of insomnia until 12 months after treatment.

Although alcohol consumption is known to have profound impact on sleep, it is yet unknown as to how binge alcohol affects/alters sleep-wakefulness. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of acute binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study. Under standard aseptic surgical conditions, rats (N = 7) were implanted with sleep-recording electrodes. After postoperative recovery and habituation, baseline sleep-wakefulness was recorded. Subsequently, rats were exposed to binge alcohol treatment as follows: One hour before light onset, a priming dose of 5 g/kg of alcohol was administered followed by 2 subsequent doses (adjusted based on the intoxication level of the rat) approximately 8 hours apart. Sleep-wakefulness was continuously recorded for 3 days post-binge. Acute binge alcohol administration had no significant effect on sleep-wakefulness on post-binge Day 1. However, on post-binge Day 2, after blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0, sleep disruptions were observed manifested by a reversal of sleep-wakefulness as evident from insomnia-like symptoms (significant increase in wakefulness; significant reduction in nonrapid eye movement [NREM] sleep) during the normal sleep (light) period and excessive sleep (significant increase in NREM sleep) during the normal active (dark) period similar to excessive daytime sleepiness in humans. All sleep-wakefulness changes were normalized on Day 3 post-binge. Alcohol hangover is defined as the presence of unpleasant symptoms that peak when BAC is 0.

We acquired actigraphy recordings and sleep diaries of 37 controls and 167 patients with varying degrees of insomnia severity for up to 9 consecutive days in their home environment. Additionally, the participants spent one night in the laboratory, where actigraphy was recorded alongside PSG to check whether sleep, in principle, is well estimated. Despite moderate to strong agreement between actigraphy and PSG sleep scoring in the laboratory, ambulatory actigraphic estimates of average sleep and circadian rhythm variables failed to successfully differentiate patients with insomnia from controls in the home environment. Only total sleep time differed between the groups. Additionally, within-subject variability of sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset was higher in patients.

Sleep complaints such as insomnia and cognitive impairments are prevalent in BC. In general population, sleep is known to contribute greatly to cognition. Thus, improving RAR (and particularly sleep) could help limiting cognitive impairments in BC patients. It has recently been suggested that, in addition to its essential role in spatial memory, the vestibular system contributes to RAR synchronization. Its stimulation could therefore limit both sleep disturbances and spatial memory deficits in BC. The main aim of the ICANSLEEP-2 study is to assess the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on circadian rhythms. The secondary aim is to assess whether GVS improves sleep and spatial memory in BC patients. Two groups with insomnia complaints (Insomnia Severity Index > 7) will be included: a patients' group with BC (n = 50) and a healthy control group without history of cancer (n = 25). There will be two assessment sessions, before and after 2 weeks of GVS. Patients will be randomly assigned to either a GVS group or a sham group (noneffective stimulation). Controls will receive GVS. GVS effects will be quantified and compared between groups. Assessments will include actigraphy, salivary cortisol, polysomnography, a cognitive test battery (including a computer-based task for spatial memory) and validated questionnaires (for psychological functioning and sleep complaints). Current methods for improving sleep in BC have had controversial outcomes regarding sleep structure. We expect GVS to offer a new mean of directly targeting RAR disruptions in BC patients, with beneficial effects on sleep structure. Given the crucial impact of sleep on cognitive functioning, notably spatial memory, improving sleep of BC patients should enhance their cognitive functioning. This study received ethical approval from the Ile de France IV institutional review board on 19 April 2022 (no. ID-RCB: 2022-A00437-36).

Twin studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently found significant genetic overlap between these traits. However, there is considerable variation among studies. The aims of this meta-analysis were therefore: 1) to estimate the mean genetic correlation between sleep problems and psychological distress; 2) to assess heterogeneity among the included studies; and 3) to search for potential moderators that could contribute to this heterogeneity. To this end, we performed several multivariate meta-analyses. The mean genetic correlations were estimated to be 0.55 (CI: 0.47-0.63) for sleep quality and depression, 0.72 (CI: 0.59-0.85) for insomnia symptoms and depression, 0.42 (CI: 0.30-0.54) for sleep quality and anxiety, and 0.75 (CI: 0.59-0.91) for insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Similar results were obtained when depression and anxiety were collapsed (0.54 [CI: 0.44-0.64] for sleep quality and 0.77 [CI: 0.63-0.91] for insomnia symptoms). Sex did not significantly moderate these associations. Study type (twin studies vs GWAS) and age, however, were significant moderators (p < 0.001). These findings highlight the substantial genetic overlap between psychological distress and sleep problems, which appears to be stronger for insomnia symptoms than for sleep quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40848539/"}

However, patient self-report of sleep-wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep-wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n = 92), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 66) or both (n = 119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81 min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10 min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective-objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation.

Given the strong, consistent support of its efficacy, scholars have become increasingly interested in the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms targeted during CBT-I. The purpose of the systematic review was to synthesize findings from the literature regarding the associations among maladaptive sleep beliefs, a cognitive mechanism implicated in maintaining insomnia, and treatment outcomes following CBT-I. The systematic review was completed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Seventeen studies were included in the final sample of reviewed articles and a study quality assessment was performed for all studies included in the review. The results suggested that reductions in maladaptive sleep beliefs were associated with improved insomnia severity; however, reductions in maladaptive beliefs were not associated with changes in sleep efficiency or other sleep parameters. Moreover, in some cases, improved sleep parameters preceded reductions in maladaptive beliefs. Maladaptive sleep beliefs may be an important target for improving insomnia. Targeting maladaptive sleep beliefs may initiate a trickle-down process that limits the influence of other cognitive and behavioral processes maintaining insomnia. Additional investigation is needed to evaluate the directional relationship between improved insomnia symptoms and reduced maladaptive beliefs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37862834/"}

EST attentional bias scores were not correlated with subsequent PSG parameters, and we did not observe a correlation between attentional bias scores on the two tasks. The unexpected relationship between increased attentional bias, in the VDP task, and improved markers of sleep duration and continuity, may be indicative of a homeostatic craving for sleep in those with high attentional bias.

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial among professional firefighters, 27 poor sleepers were assigned randomly to one of the two groups. Two 14 days experimental periods were separated by a 14-day washout phase. Sleep quality was assessed using the Persian version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Six of the 27 enrolled voluntaries dropped out. Two rare side effects of zolpidem occurred in the study. A significant improvement of the PSQI score was detected in zolpidem period versus placebo in both groups (7.14 ± 3.02 vs 12.38 ± 2.51, P<0.001) although zolpidem had no significant effect on time of waking up (6.76 ± 1.21 vs.6.64 ± 1.27, P=0.89). Zolpidem significantly improved all components of PSQI (Subjective sleep quality, Sleep latency, Sleep duration, Habitual sleep efficiency, Sleep disturbances and Daytime dysfunction) in the current study except the use of sleep medication. Sleep onset latency was the component of PSQI with the greatest degree of abnormality among firefighters in a previous study.

{"id": "35504109", "title": "Sleep reactivity as a potential pathway from childhood abuse to adult insomnia.", "text": "Survivors of childhood abuse are prone to adult insomnia, but the mechanisms for this development are poorly understood. Abuse that occurs during sensitive developmental periods might affect risk for insomnia by impacting emerging stress regulatory processes. Sleep reactivity refers to the sensitivity of the sleep system to stress and is a robust risk factor for insomnia. Recent evidence shows stress exposure itself worsens sleep reactivity, thereby increasing insomnia vulnerability. In this preliminary study, we hypothesized the association between childhood abuse experiences and adult insomnia would be mediated through greater sleep reactivity. Community adults were recruited from the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic between June 2020 and June 2021 (N = 241, 88% female, M<sub>age</sub> = 39, SD = 13.40). Participants completed a cross-sectional survey that included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, Insomnia Severity Index, and a measure of general COVID-19 stress. Reporting more frequent childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse was associated with more severe insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only childhood emotional and physical (but not sexual) abuse histories were associated with greater sleep reactivity, which exerted an indirect effect on the relationships between these two abuse types and insomnia symptoms. These findings were robust to the effects of gender, age, and stress about the COVID-19 pandemic. This preliminary study suggests recurrent emotional and physical abuse in childhood might promote later insomnia through heightened sleep reactivity. Stress management interventions could be important to prevent insomnia for abuse survivors by bolstering resilience of the sleep system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35504109/"}

Our study is the first investigation to prove objective efficacy and tolerability of low doses of a sedating antidepressant in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled manner in patients with primary insomnia. Forty-seven drug-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for primary insomnia (mean +/- SD duration of complaints = 11.2+/-9.7 years) received either 25-50 mg of the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of placebo withdrawal. Sleep was measured by polysomnography at baseline and the first night of application, at 4 weeks of treatment and the first to third night of withdrawal, and after 2 weeks of withdrawal. In the doxepin-treated patients who completed the study (N = 20, 47.6+/-11.3), medication significantly increased sleep efficiency after acute (night 1, p < or = .001) and subchronic (night 28, p < or = .05) intake compared with the patients who received placebo (N = 20, 47.4+/-16.8 years of age). Latency to sleep onset was not affected since the patients had normal baseline sleep latencies. Investigators found doxepin to cause significantly (p < or = .05) better global improvement at the first day of treatment. Patients rated sleep quality (p < or = .001) and working ability (p < or = .005) to be significantly improved by doxepin during the whole treatment period. Overall rebound in sleep parameters was not observed, but patients with severe rebound insomnia were significantly more frequent in the doxepin group (night 29, p < .01, night 30, p < or = .01; night 31, p < or = .05). No significant group differences in side effects were found, but 2 doxepin-treated patients dropped out of the study due to specific side effects (increased liver enzymes, leukopenia, and thrombopenia). The results support the effectiveness of low doses of doxepin to improve sleep and working ability in chronic primary insomniacs, although subjective effects were light to moderate, and in some patients, rebound insomnia and specific side effects have to be considered.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465523/"}

In recent years, our laboratory has been involved in a large-scale project aimed at investigating the role of endogenous melatonin in sleep-wake regulation and the effects of nonpharmacological levels of melatonin on sleep. Based on our finding on the precise coupling between the endogenous nocturnal increase in melatonin secretion and the opening of the nocturnal sleep gate, we propose that the role of melatonin in the induction of sleep does not involve the active induction of sleep, but is rather mediated by an inhibition of a wakefulness-producing mechanism in the central nervous system. Our studies also suggest that exogenously administered melatonin may be beneficial in certain types of insomnia that are related to disturbances in the normal secretion of the hormone.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9556097/"}

Primary analyses were regressions controlling for baseline outcomes. One hundred and twenty-seven participants (age M ± SD = 32.62 ± 3.49) were randomized (RB = 44, CBT-I = 42, CTRL = 41). Both interventions were feasible and well-accepted, with few related adverse events reported. Compared to CTRL, the average ISI across T3-T5 was lower for CBT-I (p = .014, effect size [ES] = 0.56, medium) but not RB (p = .270, ES = 0.25, small). Exploratory findings on maternal insomnia diagnosis, sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, beliefs and attitudes about sleep, depression, anxiety, as well as infant sleep outcomes were also presented. CBT-I but not RB reduced prenatal insomnia (very large effect) and prevented postpartum insomnia (medium effect). Further research is needed to examine the effects of both CBT-I and RB on other outcomes such as sleep-related well-being, postpartum depression, and maternal postpartum sleep duration.

Two authors independently read all trials and independently extracted all relevant data. The primary outcomes were sleep quantity and sleep quality. The secondary outcomes were mental alertness on rising, anxiety level, and quality of life. A total of five randomized controlled trials containing 400 participants were analyzed. Ashwagandha extract exhibited a small but significant effect on overall sleep (Standardized Mean Difference -0.59; 95% Confidence Interval -0.75 to -0.42; I2 =  62%). The effects on sleep were more prominent in the subgroup of adults diagnosed with insomnia, treatment dosage ≥600 mg/day, and treatment duration ≥8 weeks. Ashwagandha extract was also found to improve mental alertness on rising and anxiety level, but no significant effect on quality of life. No serious side effects were reported. Ashwagandha extract appears to has a beneficial effect in improving sleep in adults.

A representative sample of 251 women was analysed in age groups above and below 51.5 years (median). PSG was recorded at home during one night. Perceived poor sleep was related to short total sleep time (TST), long wake within total sleep time (WTSP), low sleep efficiency and a high number of awakenings. The older women showed lower TST and sleep efficiency and higher WTSP for a rating of good sleep than did the younger women. For these PSG variables the values for good sleep in the older group were similar to the values for poor sleep in the young group. It was concluded that women perceive different levels of sleep duration, sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset relatively well, but that older women adjust their objective criteria for good sleep downwards.

Chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) mice models was established to investigate the effect of EA at acupoints of Yintang (EX-HN3), Shenmen (HT7), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) on CSD. With the methods of EEG/EMG recordings and chemogenetic manipulations, we explore the role of the dopaminergic projections from ventral tegmental area (VTA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the therapeutic effects of EA on CSD-induced insomnia. We found that EA significantly alleviated CSD-induced insomnia, as indicated by an increased total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the dark period, along with attenuating the CSD-caused hyperactivity of VTA dopamine neurons in mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of the dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc could restore the NREM sleep in CSD mice. Most importantly, the therapeutic effects of EA on CSD-induced insomnia was counteracted by activating the dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc of mice. These findings suggested that the therapeutic effects of EA at EX-HN3, HT7 and SP6 are achieved by targeting the dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc, which could be therapeutic approach for chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40553719/"}

Participants were in one of three groups: insomnia (CUR, n = 299), healthy sleeper (HS, n = 122), or past insomnia (PAST, n = 35). Daily diaries and validated measures were employed to capture six dimensions of sleep health. The CUR group received four 60-minute sessions of CBT-I every 2weeks, and sleep health indices were measured at baseline and post-treatment. The HS and PAST groups were measured only at baseline. Results of the pairwise t tests indicated improvements in sleep satisfaction, alertness (fatigue but not sleepiness), timing, efficiency, and duration (Cohen's d=0.22 to 1.55). ANCOVA models revealed significant differences in sleep health scores between treated insomnia patients and the other two sleep groups. Treated patients demonstrated less bedtime and risetime variability, in addition to lower napping duration. Overall, the study observed significant changes in various domains of sleep health after four sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia; however, differences remain when compared to the other groups in the study. There may be ongoing sleep vulnerability in patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia though future inclusion of a control group would increase internal validity.

Variables to measure efficacy, rebound and withdrawal were assessed daily from day 1 to day 28. Polysomnographic recordings together with sleep cycle analysis were performed on nights 7, 21 and 28. Patients treated with 10 mg zolpidem for 2 weeks had significantly improved sleep efficiency at the end of the randomised double-blind phase compared with the placebo group. Fractionated sleep-cycle analysis showed an increase in slow-wave sleep during the first 2-hour cycle after sleep onset. During the withdrawal placebo week, most of the main sleep variables remained relatively stable in the zolpidem group (nights 22-28), and deteriorated further in the placebo group. At the end of the withdrawal phase, there was a statistically significant difference between groups, in favour of the zolpidem treatment, in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, absolute and percentage of time awake, and percentage of REM sleep. REM sleep, which was normal in both groups at baseline, decreased significantly in the placebo group between nights 22 and 28 (during the withdrawal placebo week) compared with the zolpidem treatment group, and the number of periods of time awake increased. Minor subjective complaints were recorded under zolpidem and were comparable with those under placebo. Zolpidem seemed to improve some important sleep variables, when assessed both objectively and subjectively. The sleep cycle analysis suggested a possible shift of slow-wave sleep to an earlier period of the night, with a more physiological sleep structure. There was no evidence for withdrawal or rebound after stopping the 2 weeks of zolpidem treatment, but rather signs that the effect of zolpidem outlasted active treatment.

They all completed daily sleep diaries and wore an actigraph from baseline to posttreatment, and for 2 weeks at 3-month follow-up. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). Mixed modeling was used to analyze data. SOL discrepancy decreased significantly in BBTi participants compared to SMC participants. The decreases in SOL discrepancy were explained by changes in diary-assessed SOL and subjective sleep quality but not changes in actigraphy-assessed SOL. Although WASO discrepancy and TST discrepancy decreased from baseline to posttreatment and follow-up, the Time by Group interaction effects were not significant indicating that BBTi participants did not experience greater reductions in WASO discrepancy and TST discrepancy than SMC participants.

Twenty-three of 46 children (50%) with persistent insomnia had a professional diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder. In the remaining 50%, although parents denied any previous psychiatric history, 40% displayed psychiatric symptoms as documented by psychometric measures and clinical interview. A significant positive correlation was observed between depressive BASC score and sleep onset latency and an inverse correlation was present with REM sleep latency. The vast majority of children presenting with persistent insomnia exhibit clinical symptoms of an accompanying psychiatric disorder, suggesting that comprehensive psychometric assessments are warranted in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15165531/"}

On the recording night, they wore an Actiwatch-64 and were instructed to press the marker button upon getting into bed, each time they awoke, and at their final awakening. The post-traumatic stress disorder group reported much worse sleep than controls on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for the previous month and somewhat poorer sleep on the recording night. However, on the recording night, neither diary nor actigraphic measures of number of awakenings, total time in bed, nor time lying awake after sleep onset differed between participants with and without post-traumatic stress disorder.

Positively perceived neighborhood social cohesion was associated with fewer insomnia symptoms and decreased odds of poor sleep quality, sleepiness, lethargy, and short sleep duration. Positively perceived neighborhood safety was related to decreased risks of poor sleep quality and sleepiness. Depression and perceived control partially mediated the effects of perceived neighborhood on sleep.

This study examined whether pre-treatment characteristics/traits predict optimal treatment sequences for insomnia patients. A community sample of 211 adults (132 women; Mage = 45.6 ± 14.9 years) with insomnia were recruited. Patients were first treated with behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem (Zol). Non-remitting BT recipients were randomized to a second treatment with either Zol or cognitive therapy; non-remitting Zol recipients underwent BT or Trazodone as a second treatment. Remission rates were assessed at the end of the first and second 6-week treatments. We then compared the remission rates of dichotomous groups formed on the basis of gender, age, pretreatment scores on SF36 and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, the presence/absence of psychiatric/medical comorbidities or pain disorders, and mean subjective sleep duration and efficiency within and across treatment sequences. Lower remission rates were noted for those: with a pain disorder, poor mental health perceptions, high MFI fatigue scores, and lower sleep times and efficiencies. Patients with a pain disorder responded best to the BT-to-Zol sequence, whereas patients with more mental impairment, severe fatigue, short sleep, and low sleep efficiency responded poorly to treatment starting with BT. Pain, fatigue, poor mental health status, and subjective sleep duration and efficiency all affect response to different insomnia treatment sequences.

First, a pressure-relieving mattress and second, a four week individual sleep hygiene and sleep scheduling intervention. The two interventions were evaluated both objectively by actigraphy and subjectively by questionnaires. A total of 315 sleep-wake cycles from nine individuals were evaluated. Three patients improved clinically significantly in five or more of the nine outcomes, i.e. sleep onset latency, nocturnal sleep duration, numbers and duration of napping, movement and fragmentation index, number of steps, metabolic equivalent unit, sleep efficiency and fatigue. The other six patients also showed improvements but to a lesser degree. Physical activity advice was the intervention that yielded most sleep improvements.

Participants meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for insomnia disorder (n = 33) or normal sleepers (n = 32) completed the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) and daily fatigue ratings for 2 weeks. Baseline questionnaires evaluated cognitive factors including unhelpful beliefs about sleep and rumination about fatigue. Hierarchical linear modeling tested the within- and between-participant relationships between sleep quality, total sleep time, and daily fatigue ratings. Mediation analyses tested if cognitive factors mediated the relationship between insomnia and fatigue. Self-reported nightly sleep quality significantly predicted subsequent daily fatigue ratings. Total sleep time was a significant predictor of fatigue within, but not between, participants. Unhelpful sleep beliefs and rumination about fatigue mediated the relationship between insomnia and fatigue reporting. The results suggest that perception of sleep plays an important role in predicting reports of daytime fatigue. These findings could be used in treatment to help shift the focus away from total sleep times, and instead, focus on challenging maladaptive sleep-related cognitions to change fatigue perception.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33245330/"}

As a consequence, the S-allele is found to predispose individuals to a higher risk of sleep quality reduction and clinical insomnia. The present study investigated whether subchronic pre-sleep tryptophan administration could compensate for this predisposition by improving sleep in 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design a sample of homozygous 5-HTTLPR S-allele (<i>n</i> = 47) and L-allele (<i>n</i> = 51) carriers were assessed for subjective (sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) sleep during a treatment protocol consisting of 1 week of placebo (1000 mg/day) and 1 week of tryptophan administration (1000 mg/day). The results support the sleep-promoting effects of tryptophan. Tryptophan improved objective sleep efficiency and objective wake after sleep onset irrespective of allelic variation. There was a marginally significant improvement of subjective sleep quality in the 5-HTTLPR S-allele group but not in the L-allele group following tryptophan relative to placebo intake. In contrast, a significantly poorer sleep quality in the S-allele as opposed to the L-allele group in the placebo condition was not observed in the tryptophan condition.

In a subgroup of insomnia patients without antidepressants, delusional beliefs were negatively associated with rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep. As there are indications that diminutions of sleep spindles are a biomarker for dysfunctional thalamo-cortical circuits underlying the neuropathology of psychosis, we conclude that there might be a sub-group of insomnia patients with fewer sleep spindles which is more vulnerable to developing a psychotic disorder in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32819820/"}

This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of a 6-week home-based aerobic exercise program (EX) compared to that of a 6-week self-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to improve sleep in cancer patients. Forty-one patients (78.1% female, mean age 57 years) with various types of cancer and having insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] score ≥ 8) were randomized to the EX (n = 20) or the CBT-I (n = 21) groups. Measures were completed at pretreatment and posttreatment, as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The EX intervention was statistically inferior to CBT-I in reducing ISI scores at posttreatment but was non-inferior at follow-up. However, no significant group-by-time interaction was found on any outcome and both interventions led to a significant improvement of subjectively-assessed sleep impairments on the ISI, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and most sleep parameters from a daily sleep diary at posttreatment corresponding to medium to large time effects (ds > 0.50 for ISI, PSQI, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total wake time and sleep efficiency). Both interventions produced significant improvements of sleep. However, EX was found to be significantly inferior to CBT-I in reducing ISI scores at posttreatment, which contradicts the initial non-inferiority hypothesis. These findings suggest that CBT-I remains the treatment of choice for cancer-related insomnia, although EX can lead to some beneficial effects.

The aim of this study was to examine the association of poor quality sleep, categorised as recurrent short sleep duration and chronic insomnia symptoms, with the diurnal release of cortisol. We examined this in 3314 participants from an occupational cohort, originally recruited in 1985-1989. Salivary cortisol was measured in 2007-2009 and six saliva samples were collected: (1) waking, (2) waking+0.5h, (3) +2.5h, (4) +8h, (5) +12h and (6) bedtime, for assessment of the cortisol awakening response and the diurnal slope in cortisol secretion. Participants with the first saliva sample collected within 15min of waking and not on steroid medication were examined. Short sleep duration (≤5h) and insomnia symptoms (Jenkins scale, highest quartile) were measured in 1997-1999, 2003-2004 and 2007-2009. Recurrent short sleep was associated with a flatter diurnal cortisol pattern. A steeper morning rise in cortisol was observed among those reporting chronic insomnia symptoms at three time points and among those reporting short sleep twice, compared to those who never reported sleep problems. Participants reporting short sleep on three occasions had higher levels of cortisol later in the day, compared to those never reporting short sleep, indicated by a positive interaction with hours since waking (β=0.02 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03)).

Forty-eight psychiatrically ill patients (DSM-IV diagnoses) who had failed to respond to medicinal treatment for chronic insomnia were referred for and completed behavioral therapy as an adjunct to the pharmacologic treatment of their insomnia. The behavioral treatments included structured sleep hygiene, progressive muscle relaxation, stimulus control, and sleep restriction. The treatment program was accomplished in 6 sessions over 2 months. Follow-up evaluations were completed at 2, 6, and 12 months from the beginning of the treatment program. The outcome of the treatment program was evaluated in terms of the change in (1) self-reported specific sleep parameters, (2) self-ratings of sleep-related day-time state, (3) self-rating of quality of sleep, (4) the use of sleep medication, and (5) the therapist's global rating of improvement. There was a statistically significant change from the baseline in all self-reported specific sleep parameters after 2 months that was sustained after 6 and 12 months. Sleep-related characteristics of daytime state showed statistically significant changes after 2 and 6 months that were maintained after 12 months. Sleep quality had a statistically significant change after 2 months, continued to improve statistically after 6 months, and was maximum after 12 months. Over half the patients (52.7%; 20 of 38) either reduced their sleep medication by half or stopped it completely. The therapist's global rating showed an improvement in 29.2% (N = 14) of patients after 2 months, 56.2% (N = 27) after 6 months, and 68.7% (N = 33) after 12 months.

However, this concept has been questioned by several studies that did not show the presence of sleep-related attentional bias in clinical insomnia or poor sleepers. Our goal in the present study was to test whether the mood state of individuals with insomnia affects the presence of sleep-related attentional bias. To this end, 31 individuals with insomnia and 34 good sleepers were randomly assigned to a negative mood-inducing condition or a control condition. They then completed a visual probe task with three types of pictorial stimuli (general threat, sleep-related negative pictures and sleep-related positive pictures). Vigilance, maintenance and the overall bias indexes were calculated based on the reaction time. We found individuals with insomnia only showed a greater overall bias compared with good sleepers following a negative mood induction, regardless of the pictures presented. In addition, we found that a negative mood state was significantly correlated with the overall attentional bias in good sleepers but not in individuals with insomnia. These findings suggest that sleep-related attentional bias in insomnia can be modulated by mood state.

Forty-five participants aged 60 years or older with insomnia completed self-reported measures assessing depression, anxiety, sleep quality, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep reactivity. Participants were then examined by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) during wakefulness, and spectral analysis was conducted to examine associations of regional frequency band power with these insomnia-precipitating and -maintaining factors. Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep were significantly correlated with higher beta/high-beta frequency band powers, while sleep reactivity was correlated with higher theta and delta frequency band powers. These findings suggest that sleep reactivity of older adults is associated with widespread cortical deactivation leading to poor stress coping, while their dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are associated with hyperactivation which is related to cognitive processes.

In particular, they often appear inadequate to support a diagnosis of insomnia or the effectiveness of a hypnotic compound. In the past years, attention has been focused on the microstructure of sleep, and especially on the periodic distribution of arousal-related phasic events known as Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP). This microstructural rhythm is not only a physiological component of normal NREM sleep, but it also appears highly sensitive in the detection of disturbing factors and drug manipulation. Regardless of the specific context, CAP always translates a condition of arousal instability during sleep. Accordingly, the higher the amount of CAP, the poorer the subjective quality of sleep. In young adults, the physiological amount of CAP Rate (percentage ratio of CAP time to NREM sleep time) ranges around 25%, while CAP Rate rises to 55% when sleep is perturbed by continuous white noise (situational insomnia). The analysis of CAP Rate within this framework of situational insomnia is recommended for evaluating the effects of hypnotic drugs under controlled experimental conditions. Therapeutical doses of zolpidem preserve the regular course of sleep both at the macro- and at the microstructural level, when sleep is recorded under basal conditions. In contrast, during acoustic perturbation, zolpidem reduces the pathological amounts of arousal instability by lowering the values of CAP Rate to 38%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7894540/"}

Similarly to the perception of heart rate variability, sleepiness is thought to be mainly evoked by homeostatic processes and is based on the awareness and recognition of internal body signals. However, the relationship between subjective excessive daytime sleepiness and interoceptive awareness has not been addressed. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between interoceptive awareness and multiple sleep variables including subjective excessive sleepiness in daytime workers. A web questionnaire survey was conducted targeting daytime workers in Japan, and data from 461 participants were used for analyses. Multiple regression analyses showed weak but significant relationships between subjective excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, nightmare distress, and dream frequency and the components of interoception awareness measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness. However, no components of interoceptive awareness were related to workday sleep loss or social jetlag of day workers.

The prescription of sleeping pills remains as an indicator of the medicalization of sleep, while the trend towards the healthicization of sleep as part of healthy lifestyle practice is reflected in the increased focus of the media, pharmaceutical and complementary health care industries on sleep. The paper analyses qualitative data on women aged 40 and over to argue that the medicalization-healthicization framework fails to encapsulate a complete understanding of how women manage sleep disruption within the social context of their lives. It suggests that by looking inside the world of women's sleep we uncover a hidden dimension of self-directed personalized activity which plays a key role in women's response to sleep disruption. We propose an alternative model for the management of women's sleep which incorporates a core of personalised activity, linked to strategies associated with healthicization and medicalization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19774748/"}

There is a growing interest in sleep-promoting agents from natural sources. Nelumbinis Plumula (NP), a traditional Chinese medicine with dual food-medicine homology, has the effects of clearing the heart and calming the mind, showing promising efficacy in treating insomnia. In this study, the effects of NP extract, total alkaloid extract of NP, and crude polysaccharide of NP were measured in para-chlorophenylalanine-induced insomnia rats combined with the pentobarbital sodium experiment. The results indicated both total alkaloid extract and NP total extract could improve insomnia in rats, with the total alkaloid extract demonstrating a stronger effect than NP total extract. Total alkaloid extract significantly prolonged sleep duration and shortened sleep latency. Therefore, total alkaloids in NP appeared to be the main pharmacological substances that exerted sedative effect. Simultaneously, total alkaloid extract could increase the GABA level and reduce the DA level as well as affect the activities of GABRA1, DRD2, 5-HT1A, and AChE proteins. This study can lay an experimental foundation for the further development and application of NP as a remedy for treating insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40332158/"}

Internight variability of sleep often accompanies insomnia. However, few studies have explored the relevance of this 'construct' in the context of diagnosis, clinical impact, treatment effects and/or whether having 'variable sleep' carries any prognostic significance. We explored these questions by conducting secondary analyses of data from a randomized clinical trial. The sample included primary (PI: n = 40) and comorbid insomnia (CMI: n = 41) sufferers receiving four biweekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) or sleep hygiene education. Using the within-subject standard deviations of diary- and actigraphy-derived measures collected for 2-week periods [sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE)], we found that CMI sufferers displayed more variable self-reported SOLs and SEs than PI sufferers. However, higher variability in diary and actigraphy-derived measures was related to poorer sleep quality only within the PI group, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Within both groups, the variability of diary-derived measures was reduced after CBT, but the variability of actigraphy-derived measures remained unchanged. Interestingly, the variability of actigraphy measures at baseline was correlated with PSQI scores at 6-month follow-up. Higher SOL variability was associated with worse treatment outcomes within the PI group, whereas higher WASO variability was correlated with better treatment outcomes within the CMI group. Sleep variability differences across insomnia diagnoses, along with their distinctive correlates, suggest that mechanisms underlying the sleep disruption/complaint and treatment response in both patient groups are distinct. Further studies are warranted to support variability as a useful metric in insomnia studies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22463493/"}

Between 50 and 70 million Americans experience insomnia. Costs of treatment, absenteeism and reduced productivity exceed 42 billion dollars annually. Medication for insomnia can result in impaired memory, fatigue, injuries, reduced health, medication habituation, difficulties in work and relationships and enhanced healthcare usage. Studies have suggested that behavioural management can be beneficial; however, factors contributing to success with behavioural management are unclear. This quantitative correlational study used inventory-based measures. The Self-Efficacy for Sleep Scale, Insomnia Treatment Acceptability Scale, SF-8™ Health Survey, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep Scale were completed by 236 individuals with significant insomnia as measured by Insomnia Severity Index scores of 8 or higher. A significant association was found between sleep self-efficacy and race (p < 0·01). All predicator variables except one were found to be significantly correlated with the self-efficacy for sleep (p < 0·01). For behavioural self-management strategies to be effective for treating insomnia, these reported predictors may need to be assessed and managed. These findings suggest that nurses may want to assess insomnia severity, health status, level of depression and beliefs about sleep prior to beginning or when encountering barriers to the successful utilisation of behavioural approaches to manage sleep. If a patient is found to possess these limiting factors, the nurse may want to address these issues through medication, education and/or other behavioural approaches. Once addressed, the patient may find behavioural management for insomnia to be quite successful.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23574289/"}

Among 6367 patients, 2024 were diagnosed with insomnia (age 43.06 ± 15.19 years; 1110 women and 914 men) according to the ISI and the ISQ. Insomnia patients with severe fatigue (n = 1306) showed higher insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness, depression and longer habitual sleep duration than those without severe fatigue (n = 718). Higher insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms, and longer habitual sleep duration, independently predicted higher fatigue scores. Among insomnia patients with daytime sleepiness (ESS≥10), only habitual sleep duration and depression predicted fatigue scores. The interaction between insomnia severity and daytime sleepiness significantly predicted the severity of fatigue. Depression was a significant mediator between insomnia and fatigue. For 598 insomnia patients undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG), no significant correlations were found between fatigue and any PSG parameters. The current study suggests that managing insomnia or depression may reduce the fatigue of insomnia patients, whereas arbitrary efforts to prolong sleep duration may worsen their fatigue.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31272015/"}

Objective polysomnogram indicators of sleep and arousal activity and self-reported sleep quality were measured. In Study 2 (Prospective), clinical outcomes were assessed after sequential cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and SDB therapy (CPAP, oral appliances, or bilateral turbinectomy) were provided to 17 chronic insomnia patients with SDB. Repeat measures included the Insomnia Severity Index, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and self-reported insomnia indices and CPAP use. In Study 1, seven objective measures of sleep and arousal demonstrated or approached significant improvement during one night of CPAP titration. Sixteen of 19 patients reported improvement in sleep quality. In Study 2, Insomnia Severity Index, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index improved markedly with CBT followed by SDB treatment and achieved an average outcome equivalent to curative status. Improvements were large for each treatment phase; however, of 17 patients, only 8 attained a nonclinical level of insomnia after CBT compared with 15 patients after SDB therapy was added. Self-reported insomnia indices also improved markedly, and self-reported SDB therapy compliance was high. In one small sample of chronic insomnia patients with SDB, objective measures of insomnia, arousal, and sleep improved during one night of CPAP titration. In a second small sample, validated measures of insomnia, sleep quality, and sleep impairment demonstrated clinical cures or near-cures after combined CBT and SDB therapies.

The DSM-IV-TR paradigm, however, has not been validated with objective sleep assessment technology, incorporated nosological constructs from the field of sleep disorders medicine, or adequately addressed the potential for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) sleep problems to manifest as primary, physical disorders, requiring independent medical assessments and therapies. This paradigm may limit understanding of sleep problems in PTSD by promulgating such terms as \"insomnia related to another mental disorder,\" a.k.a. \"psychiatric insomnia.\" Emerging evidence invites a broader comorbidity perspective, based on recent findings that post-traumatic sleep disturbance frequently manifests with the combination of insomnia and a higher-than-expected prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). In this model of complex sleep disturbance, the underlying sleep pathophysiology interacts with PTSD and related psychiatric distress; and this relationship appears very important as demonstrated by improvement in insomnia, nightmares, and post-traumatic stress with successful SDB treatment, independent of psychiatric interventions. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment in PTSD patients with SDB reduced electroencephalographic arousals and sleep fragmentation, which are usually attributed to central nervous system or psychophysiological processes. Related findings and clinical experience suggest that other types of chronic insomnia may also be related to SDB. We hypothesize that an arousal-based mechanism, perhaps initiated by post-traumatic stress and/or chronic insomnia, may promote the development of SDB in a trauma survivor and perhaps other patients with chronic insomnia. We discuss potential neurohormonal pathways and neuroanatomatical sites that may be involved in this proposed interaction between insomnia and SDB.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12524572/"}

Nevertheless, if anxiety may cause sleep disturbances, it is also known that sleep deprivation may produce symptoms which fall within the symptom complex of anxiety. In this paper, some of the methodological issues encountered when studying sleep and anxiety are discussed. Polygraphic recordings of sleep in anxious patients have consistently shown an increased sleep latency and, quite often, also exhibited a reduced sleep time, a reduced total sleep time, less slow-wave sleep, a greater arousal index and an increased duration of wakefulness during sleep. From our own study, we also report anomalies of the first night cycle in anxious poor sleepers who are otherwise indistinguishable from normal controls (with regard to the 'classical' sleep parameters). We have also observed the large interindividual variability of numbers of sleep parameters in anxious people. The question of a potential heterogeneity of the studied groups with regard to their clinical presentation as well as their sleep profile has been raised through our research as well.

Patients with insomnia showed reduced recruitment of the head of the left caudate nucleus during executive functioning, which was not secondary to altered performance or baseline perfusion. Individual differences in caudate recruitment were associated with hyper-arousal severity. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis suggested that attenuated input from a projecting orbitofrontal area with reduced grey matter density contributes to altered caudate recruitment in patients with insomnia. Attenuated caudate recruitment persisted after successful treatment of insomnia, warranting evaluation as a potential vulnerability trait.

Although insomnia disorder is defined in diagnostic systems as a subjective complaint about sleep, this understanding is not consistently applied in clinical settings. There remains a lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms underlying subjective sleep complaints and associated daytime impairments. This systematic umbrella review of meta-analyses aimed to compare subjective and objective health-related variables between patients with insomnia disorder and controls, characterizing insomnia comprehensively. After a systematic literature search, we included six meta-analyses comparing patients with insomnia disorder and controls in terms of subjective sleep (sleep diaries), objective sleep (polysomnography), peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cortisol, objective cognitive performance, blood pressure and EEG spectral power. The pattern of results suggests that differences between patients with insomnia disorder and healthy controls are largest and most consistent for subjective sleep. Objective between-group effect sizes were largest for unspecific stress markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cortisol. Variables expected to be abnormal in those with objective sleep deprivation, such as objective attention and alertness, showed minimal group differences. Also in terms of sleep, effect sizes for subjective variables were consistently larger than those for objective variables. Critical appraisal of the quality of the included meta-analyses using the AMSTAR 2 tool suggested moderate overall confidence in the results, whereby shortcomings in several critical domains such as pre-registration of the study protocol and justification for the inclusion of individual studies have been identified. Our findings highlight that insomnia disorder is characterized by large reductions in subjective sleep quality, in the absence of large objective alterations.

MLT production then commences, becomes circadian, and reaches its highest nocturnal blood levels between the ages of one to three years. During the remainder of childhood, nocturnal peak levels drop progressively by 80%. In adults, these levels show an additional drop of some 10%, mainly during senescence. The large drop in serum MLT during childhood is probably the result of the increase in size of the human body, despite a constant MLT production after infancy. The additional decline of MLT with higher age may be due to a yet unidentified physiological mechanism accompanying senescence. The biological significance of these MLT alterations remains unknown. Since the discovery of MLT, an immediate sedative action of this hormone has been known. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that MLT indeed exerts a sleep-promoting action by accelerating sleep initiation, improving sleep maintenance, and marginally altering sleep architecture. The potential of MLT in the treatment of insomnia is being explored, and the results are promising. Although in most of these studies pharmacological dosages of MLT have been used, preliminary data suggest that similar effects can also be achieved by physiological hormone concentrations.

Nocturnal traffic noise with an intensity of 45-65 dB(A) induced sleep disturbances characterized by an increase in intermittent wakefulness and stage 1 and the number of nocturnal awakenings as well as by a decrease of spindle and REM sleep stages. Subjectively, a decrease of deep sleep and increase of light sleep and middle insomnia was reported. Upon awakening in the morning, mood was significantly deteriorated. The new benzodiazepine OX-373 attenuated the above-described traffic noise-induced changes and produced even oppositional alterations, such as a decrease in stage 1, number of awakenings and stage shifts while increasing stage 2. The drug alone decreased the number of awakenings and stage 1 and augmented stage 4 as compared with placebo, which was subjectively felt as an increase in deep sleep and as a decrease of light sleep, early and middle insomnia. In the morning, there were no signs of 'hangover', which was confirmed also by psychometry. Nor were there any clinically relevant alterations in blood pressure and pulse. Thus, our studies confirmed earlier pharmaco-EEG and psychometric investigations predicting OX-373 as well-tolerated anxiolytic sedative, and suggested further that traffic noise could eventually be utilized as an experimental provocative technique in order to induce a standardized sleep disturbance for early clinical drug evaluation of potentially hypnotic substances.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6118840/"}

In addition, the item \"C3: Sleep duration\" had the highest strength centrality in the network, followed by \"C1: Subjective sleep quality\", \"C4: Habitual sleep efficiency\", \"A2: Psychic anxiety\", \"B1: Anxiety/Somatization\". The findings highlight the crucial role of the strongest regularized partial correlations and bridge symptoms in relation to depression and anxiety.

In addition, poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep are highly prevalent and characterized by considerable racial disparities. Part II of this review discusses physiological mechanisms, including inflammation and appetite hormones, by which sleep impacts multiple facets of women's health during pregnancy and postpartum. These mechanisms are increasingly being delineated, but require further study and better integration with studies of behavioral and physical health outcomes. Further, there are multiple potential strategies for improving maternal sleep, providing the opportunity to tailor treatment approaches to individual needs. Ultimately, as a critical health behavior that is amenable to intervention, sleep provides a promising future direction for measurably impacting clinically relevant health parameters in women of childbearing age.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30826895/"}

This study examined the association of chronic sleep reduction (i.e. symptoms of chronic sleep reduction such as shortness of sleep, sleepiness and irritation), subjective sleep quality and sleep hygiene knowledge with academic achievement (grades and study credits) and study concentration among 1378 higher education students (71% female, mean age 21.73 years, SD = 3.22) in the Netherlands. Demographic, health, lifestyle and study behaviour characteristics were included as covariates in hierarchical regression analyses. After controlling for significant covariates, only chronic sleep reduction remained a significant predictor of lower grades (last exam, average in current academic year). Better sleep quality and sleep hygiene knowledge were associated with better academic achievement, but significance was lost after controlling for covariates, except for a remaining positive association between sleep hygiene beliefs and grades in the current academic year. Moreover, better sleep quality and lower scores on chronic sleep reduction were associated with better study concentration after controlling for significant covariates. To conclude, chronic sleep reduction is associated with academic achievement and study concentration in higher education students. Inadequate sleep hygiene knowledge is moderately associated with worse academic achievement. Future research should investigate whether sleep hygiene interventions improve academic achievement in students of higher education.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28880425/"}

BZD induces a further reduction of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas SWS and REM values remain decreased during non-BZD administration. There is evidence indicating that the nonselective serotonin 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonists, ritanserin, ketanserin, seganserin and ICI-169369, the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist eplivanserin and the 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist pimavanserin, increase SWS in subjects with normal sleep. In addition, it has been shown that prior administration of ritanserin prevents the nitrazepam-induced suppression of SWS in normal subjects. Of note, ritanserin also induced an increase of SWS in poor sleepers, patients with chronic primary insomnia and psychiatric patients with a generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist APD-125 gave rise to a similar effect in patients with chronic primary insomnia. Thus, presently available evidence tends to indicate that the association of a 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist or a 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist with a BZD or a non-BZD hypnotic could be a valid alternative to normalize SWS in patients with primary or comorbid insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20467592/"}

Several questionnaires that measure sleep-related cognitions have been developed and there are indications of conceptual overlap between different cognitive constructs and the questions used to operationalize them. This study examines the convergent validity of three established questionnaires measuring cognitive processes in insomnia: the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-10), and the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS-C). Another objective was to explore how a briefer scale can be structured as well as to investigate this scale's ability to predict incident and persistent insomnia compared to the established scales. 2333 participants from the general population completed surveys on insomnia symptoms and cognitive processes at baseline and 18 months later. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the scales' conceptual overlap as well as distinctive factors. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to investigate the underlying factor structure of the items from the APSQ, the DBAS-10 and the PSAS-C. This analysis formed the basis of the creation of a new short scale: Sleep Worry 7. Binary logistic regressions were used to assess all scales' abilities to predict incident and persistent insomnia. The overlap between the three scales was neither large enough to conclude that they are measuring the same construct, nor could it be confirmed that they measure three distinct questionnaire-specific cognitive processes within insomnia. The brief scale created within this study was able to predict persistent insomnia at similar levels to the three established scales combined, indicating that it captures important cognitions involved in the maintenance of insomnia.

Insomnia is associated with poorer disease outcomes, cognitive impairment and HIV-associated dementia. However there is limited data characterizing the type of sleep disturbances, and the cause. Previous studies report conflicting results, and observed changes in the distribution of REM and SWS were hypothesized to result from co-morbid mood disorders, although this is not established. We carried out this study to determine if there are differences in polysomnographic (PSG) sleep data in age-, sex- and Axis I diagnoses- matched HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients. Eighteen HIV-seropositive insomniacs were matched to HIV-seronegative insomniacs based on age, sex and Axis I diagnoses. Participants spent 2 consecutive nights in a sleep lab recording of PSG data. Multivariate analysis revealed an overall significant match-by-variable interaction (p=0.0126). Follow-up analysis show that compared to HIV-seronegative insomnia controls, HIV-seropositive insomniacs have significantly longer SOL, 8% decreased sleep efficiency, and 8-10% decreased time spent in REM sleep (p's<0.05). This study provides preliminary evidence that even after accounting for differences in age, sex and psychiatric diagnoses, HIV-seropositive patients with insomnia have significantly worse sleep than HIV-seronegative patients with insomnia. Unlike what previous authors have proposed, our results do not support the view that comorbid psychiatric disorders like depression are responsible for the observed differences in PSG findings and the greater incidence of insomnia, in HIV-seropositive patients when compared with other groups of insomnia patients. This suggests the presence of other etiologies including neuronal damage, psychosocial stressors, or comorbid medical conditions.

An ultra-short-acting drug (2 to 3h), such as triazolam, is useful for prolonged latency. Temazepam, lormetazepam and loprazolam provide more prolonged effects (8 to 10h). These benzodiazepines are not free of daytime adverse effects, particularly drowsiness, dependency potential, rebound insomnia and habituation to the drug effect. Zopiclone and zolpidem are new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics that are as effective as benzodiazepines but without the problems associated with the latter.

Forty participants, 20 with DSM-5-defined insomnia disorder and 20 normal-sleepers, participated.

Visual and verbal feedback, related to participants' degree of misperception, was provided on completion of Day 1 testing. Overall, individuals with insomnia perceived their own face as significantly more tired than a baseline neutral photograph was, whereas normal-sleepers perceived themselves as appearing more alert. This pattern of results was only apparent on Day 1. Although no group × day interaction was established, mean scores suggest an improvement in perception on Day 2 amongst individuals with insomnia only. These findings suggest that individuals with insomnia exhibit a misperception of their facial attributes of tiredness, interpreting them in a disorder-consistent manner.

A total of 1,136,583 adolescents aged 11-18 years answered a standardized questionnaire assessing frequency of insomnia symptoms, tiredness and school performance. A clear approximately twofold increasing trend in insomnia symptoms and tiredness was found from the mid-1990s to the end of the 2000s. The increase was evident in all participating age groups and in both genders. After 2008, the increase seems to have stopped. Insomnia symptoms and tiredness were associated with lower school performance and they were more prevalent among girls (11.9 and 18.4%) compared to boys (6.9 and 9.0%, respectively). Unexpectedly, we also observed an increasingly widening gap in school performance between normally vigilant and chronically tired pupils. The underlying causes of these phenomena are unknown, but may concern changes in the broader society. The observed recent increasing trend in adolescents' sleep problems is worrisome: poor sleep quality has also been suggested to associate with clinical or subclinical mood or anxiety disorders and behavioural problems and predispose to sleep and psychiatric disorders later in life.

Based on the literature that maladaptive cognitions predict low adherence and that high levels of cognitive-emotional hyperarousal may be associated with poor outcomes, we propose added focus on cognitive therapy strategies in CBT-I. Specifically, we propose broadening the range of traditional cognitive therapy strategies, utilizing acceptance-based strategies, and fuller integration of the broadened range of cognitive strategies into CBT-I throughout the course of treatment. We also highlight a few other promising emerging approaches to enhance the impact of CBT-I. These include involving partners to promote adherence with CBT-I treatment recommendations, using culturally relevant treatment adaptations to increase retention of patients in treatment, and using strategies for timely identification of barriers to engagement. We propose broadening the public health impact of CBT-I by integrating support for reduction in long-term use of hypnotic sleep medications, which is in line with current medical guidelines. We advocate for a case conceptualization-based approach for implementing CBT-I in a patient-centered manner, flexibly, yet with fidelity, to enhance its impact by addressing the factors above.

This preliminary study examined whether arousal interacted with sleep in associations with gray matter volume of frontal (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) and temporal (right/left hippocampus) regions in adults with chronic widespread pain and insomnia complaints. Forty-seven adults with chronic widespread pain and insomnia (mean age = 46.00, standard deviation = 13.88, 89% women) completed 14 daily diaries measuring sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time (TST), as well as Holter monitor assessments of heart rate variability (measuring physiological arousal), and magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple regressions examined whether average SOL, wake time after sleep onset, or TST were independently or interactively (with arousal/heart rate variability) associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and left/right hippocampus gray matter volumes. Shorter TST was associated with lower right hippocampus volume. TST also interacted with arousal in its association with right hippocampal volume, Specifically, shorter TST was associated with lower volume at highest and average arousal levels. SOL interacted with arousal in its association with anterior cingulate cortex volume, such that, among individuals with lowest arousal, longer SOL was associated with lower volume. Preliminary findings highlight the interactive roles of physiological arousal and insomnia symptoms in associations with neural structure in chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Individuals with the highest physiological arousal may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of shorter TST on hippocampal volume loss. Reducing SOL may only impact anterior cingulate cortex volume in those with lower physiological arousal. Curtis AF, Nair N, Hayse B, et al.

Data were collected from a laboratory overnight recording in 102 healthy adolescents (48 girls, 12-20 years old). Measures included pre-sleep self-reported cognitive/somatic arousal, and cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic activity across the SO transition. Adolescent girls, compared with boys, reported higher pre-sleep cognitive activation (p = 0.025) and took longer to fall asleep (p < 0.05), as defined with polysomnography. Girls also showed a less smooth progression from wake-to-sleep compared with boys (p = 0.022). In both sexes, heart rate (HR) dropped at a rate of ~0.52 beats per minute in the 5 minutes preceding SO, and continued to drop, at a slower rate, during the 5 minutes following SO (p < 0.05). Older girls had a higher HR overall in the pre-sleep period and across SO, compared to younger girls and boys (p < 0.05). The EEG showed a progressive cortical synchronization, with increases in Delta relative power and reductions in Alpha, Sigma, Beta1, and Beta2 relative powers (p < 0.05) in the approach to sleep, in both sexes. Delta relative power was lower and Theta, Alpha, and Sigma relative powers were higher in older compared to younger adolescents at bedtime and across SO (p < 0.05). Our findings show the dynamics of the cortical-cardiac de-arousing process across the SO transition in a non-clinical sample of healthy adolescents. Findings suggest a female-specific vulnerability to inefficient sleep initiation, which may contribute to their greater risk for developing insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31872251/"}

In the present study the impact of tryptophan depletion on polysomnographically recorded sleep in patients with primary insomnia was studied. Fifteen patients with primary insomnia slept for four nights in the sleep laboratory. Prior to the fourth night the tryptophan depletion test was applied. Sleep EEG variables served as outcome parameters. Patients with primary insomnia, compared to baseline values showed a highly significant decrease of serum tryptophan concentrations after the amino acid drink. Concerning sleep parameters, stage 1 (% sleep period time=SPT) was increased, whereas stage 2 (% SPT) was decreased. Indices of phasic activity of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (REM density) were increased after the tryptophan depletion compared to baseline. The results suggest a negative impact of tryptophan depletion on sleep continuity and a stimulating effect on phasic measures of REM sleep in patients with primary insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11927137/"}

Evidence suggests sleep-related thought processes associated with anxiety are involved in the maintenance of insomnia. Previous meta-analyses provide some evidence to suggest cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia moderately improves anxiety, yet little research has investigated the effect of other sleep interventions on anxiety symptoms. The aim of this meta-analysis was to review whether non-pharmacological sleep interventions have an impact on anxiety symptoms immediately post-intervention. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify all randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating non-pharmacological sleep interventions that included anxiety symptoms as an outcome. Forty-three RCTs (n = 5945) met full inclusion criteria and were included in a random-effects meta-analysis model. The combined effect size of non-pharmacological sleep interventions on anxiety symptoms was moderate (Hedges' g = -0.38), indicating a reduction in symptoms. Subgroup analyses found a moderate effect for those with additional physical health difficulties (g = -0.46), a moderate effect for those with additional mental health difficulties (g = -0.47) and a moderate effect for those with elevated levels of anxiety at baseline (g = -0.43). A secondary meta-analysis found a large effect of non-pharmacological sleep interventions on sleep-related thought processes (g = -0.92). These findings indicate non-pharmacological sleep interventions are effective in reducing anxiety and sleep-related thought processes, and these effects may be larger in patients with anxiety.

In particular, the review will examine the experiences related to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with depression have insomnia, which is associated with substantial personal and social costs. Despite these costs, insomnia is often underdiagnosed and viewed as a symptom that disappears when depression abates. However, research indicates that insomnia and depression are overlapping but distinct disorders. Thus, it is important to treat both disorders simultaneously, as improving sleep may, in turn, ease core symptoms of depression. Optimal care and treatment rely on patients' experiences of insomnia and their attitudes toward treatment options. Therefore, it is important to synthesize evidence of patients' experiences of living with insomnia, and the experiences of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions, to understand the consequences of insomnia and to optimize sleep interventions. This systematic review will synthesize qualitative studies exploring how adults with depression experience living with insomnia and how they experience pharmacological or non-pharmacological sleep interventions.

Accurate self-report data help to guide therapy and track progress, both in the clinic and during research trials. Previous research with paper diaries suggests that timely adherence with self-report diaries may be an issue, which can result in biased event recall. University students (N = 31) were asked to track their bedtime and wake time within 30 min of these events on paper-based sleep diaries. Specially designed binders covertly timestamped when participants actually wrote on their sleep diary. We assessed adherence by comparing timestamped diary usage with what participants documented in their sleep diary. Participants self-reported they were adherent with sleep diary instructions 97.9% of the time. However, timestamped data revealed that only 37.1% of diary entries were completed within the instructed timeframe. More than half of participants backfilled diary data, and three participants (9.7%) provided data that completely did not match their actual time of completion. When naïve to the objective tracking of their sleep diary usage, participants greatly over-reported the extent of their adherence. Non-adherence with sleep diary protocols poses a challenge for researchers utilizing this tool as a study outcome in clinical trials and for clinicians attempting to implement behavioral therapies for insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37116434/"}

Recent cognitive models highlight the importance of daytime processes, like processing sleep-related information and interpretations during waking hours, in influencing sleep quality and quantity. The Sleep Preoccupation Scale (SPS) quantifies this daytime cognitive activity related to sleep. This study aimed to translate and validate an Arabic version of the SPS for assessing sleep preoccupation among Arabic speakers. 523 Arabic speakers (mean age 23.6 years, 75% female) from four countries completed the Arabic SPS alongside the Athens Insomnia Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, and the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ). The sample repeated the SPS after two weeks for test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis evaluated the SPS's two-factor structure. Internal consistency, item response theory, and convergent validity with the other scales were examined. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the two-factor model's fit. Measurement invariance results suggest that the SPS exhibits a similar basic factor structure across both insomnia and non-insomnia groups. The Arabic SPS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.92, McDonald's ω = 0.92) and two-way mixed effects, consistency, single rater/measurement intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.95). Most items exhibited satisfactory item response theory fit statistics and discrimination. The SPS total score showed strong positive correlations with insomnia severity (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), generalized anxiety (r = 0.57, p < 0.001), and sleep-related anxiety/preoccupation (r = 0.79, p < 0.001), demonstrating convergent validity. The Arabic version of the SPS demonstrated good psychometric properties and validity, supporting its use for assessing sleep preoccupation among Arabic speakers. This culturally-adapted version enhances sleep assessment capabilities for improving insomnia understanding and treatment within Arabic-speaking populations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39380127/"}

All the subjects had a circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion. Zaleplon compared to placebo increased significantly the melatonin levels at 23:00, 24:00 and 01:00 h. No differences in melatonin levels between placebo and zaleplon were found at 12:00, 22:00 and 02:00 h. Zaleplon compared to placebo increased by 46% the Area Under the Curve of melatonin secretion.

Although chronotype, emotional disturbance, and insomnia vulnerability are important factors for patients with insomnia in general, their effects on shift nurses are unknown. This study explores the relationships between the sleep quality of shift nurses and the variables of chronotype, emotional disturbance, and insomnia vulnerability. A survey was conducted with 398 shift nurses in a medical center. Chronotype, emotional disturbance, insomnia vulnerability, and sleep quality were evaluated using the Smith Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Rating Scale, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. On the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 70.1% of the participants scored higher than 5. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, together with night shift work (b [SE] = 1.05 [0.35], p = .003), higher levels of emotional disturbance (b [SE] = 0.30 [0.05], p < .001) and higher insomnia vulnerability (b [SE] = 0.18 [0.03], p < .001) were predictors of poor sleep quality and that chronotype was not a predictor of poor sleep quality. The multiple mediator model indicated that emotional disturbance significantly mediated an indirect effect of evening chronotype preference on poor subjective sleep quality (one subscale of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). In addition to shift patterns, emotional disturbance and high insomnia vulnerability are factors that may be used to identify shift nurses who face a higher risk of sleep disturbance. Because evening chronotype may indirectly influence subjective sleep quality through the pathway of emotional disturbance, further research into the mechanism that underlies this pathway is warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26166700/"}

Young adults (ages 18-30 years; n = 56) who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia and reported past-month binge drinking wore wrist actigraphy and completed online sleep diaries for 8.5 days (standard deviation = 2.3; 477 reports). Diaries assessed engagement in 11 sleep hygiene recommendations. Multilevel models tested daily associations between sleep behaviors and 3 outcomes: sleep quality, self-reported sleep efficiency, and actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency. Participants self-reported better sleep quality/efficiency on days that they slept in a comfortable environment, limited naps to 30 minutes, and maintained a consistent wake time. They self-reported worse sleep quality and efficiency on nights that they avoided alcohol use before bedtime. No sleep behaviors were significantly associated with actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency after correcting for inflation in type I error. The sleep hygiene recommendations most strongly associated with sleep at the daily level were consistent with stimulus control.

We collected overnight sleep data via polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep data via a morning questionnaire (self-evaluated) and MSLT data via four 20-min naps over 8 h. Subjects included 122 PIPs and 48 GSCs. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time/objective sleep time × 100%. PIPs showed a significant difference (P < 0.001) between sleep time, as determined by PSG (387.8 ± 100 min) and self-report (226.3 ± 160 min), but no difference was obtained for GSCs (440.6 ± 53 versus 435.4 ± 65 min). The means for sleep perception were 56.4 ± 38.8% for the PIPs and 99.3 ± 13.6% for the GSCs (P < 0.001). In the PIPs group, weak but statistically significant negative correlations (r: -0.20 to -0.25) were found for MSLT versus sleep perception and versus self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time. Compared to PIPs with low scores on the MSLT, those with high scores had less sleep perception (%), less self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time and greater sleep misperception time. GSCs did not show significant correlations between MSLT and sleep measures or differences in comparisons between individuals with high and low scores on the MSLT.

The data are drawn from the youth@hordaland study, a large population-based study conducted in 2012, linked to the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) (n = 9077). Psychiatric disorders were based on clinical diagnoses from the NPR, while insomnia, delayed sleep-wake-phase disorder (DSWPD), and other sleep problems/patterns were assessed by self-report questionnaires from youth@hordaland. The prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among adolescents seeking mental health services was 0.6%, yielding an estimated prevalence of 0.07% of the population. However, questionnaire-based measurement of insomnia from the youth@hordaland study indicated that insomnia was highly prevalent across disorders in comparison to a reference group of adolescents who were not within mental health care. Insomnia ranged from 29% among adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (PR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.41-2.29) to 48% among adolescents diagnosed with depression (PR = 2.53, 95% CI 2.19-2.92).

With pre-treatment and post-treatment self-control statistical method, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores were used for evaluating sleep quality. Polysomnogram was used for detecting insomniacs' changes in sleep architecture. The safety of electroacupuncture was evaluated by monitoring the self-designed adverse events and side effects during treatment and post-treatment. Electroacupuncture considerably improved insomniacs' sleep quality and social function during the daytime. Electroacupuncture had certain repairing effect on the disruption in sleep architecture. At the same time, electroacupuncture prolonged slow wave sleep (SWS) time and relatively rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) time.

From those, 46 records met eligibility criteria and were analysed. Among the main findings, it was observed that the Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale has been increasingly used in recent years, with a notable observed upward trend, especially in the last 2 years. In addition to the original measure, only three published adapted versions of the instrument were identified. This suggests that there is limited research on adapting the scale for different populations or contexts. Sleep effort has been increasingly studied in the last few years. Nonetheless, more research on the Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale tool is recommended, including cross-cultural adaptations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38581186/"}

In this study, we investigated the association between insomnia with objective short sleep duration and hypertension in a large clinical sample. We studied 348 patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder based on International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition criteria and 150 normal sleepers. Objective short sleep duration was defined by the median total sleep time of the sample (< 7 hr) measured with 1-night polysomnography. Hypertension was defined based on blood pressure levels, antihypertensive medication use and/or a physician diagnosis. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with chronic insomnia disorder who slept < 7 hr were associated with 2.8-fold increased odds of hypertension compared with normal sleepers who slept ≥ 7 hr (odds ratio = 2.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.068-7.411) or < 7 hr (odds ratio = 2.75, 95% confidence interval = 1.005-7.542), whereas patients with chronic insomnia disorder who slept ≥ 7 hr (odds ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval = 0.537-4.285) or normal sleepers who slept < 7 hr (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval = 0.294-3.904) were not significantly associated with increased odds of hypertension compared with normal sleepers who slept ≥ 7 hr. Linear regression analyses showed that, for every hour decrease in total sleep time, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by 1.014 mmHg (p = 0.045) and 0.923 mmHg (p = 0.015), respectively, in patients with chronic insomnia disorder but not in normal sleepers. Our findings further support that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is a risk factor for hypertension, and objective short sleep duration may be a useful marker of the biological severity of chronic insomnia disorder in clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36704942/"}

The current study aimed to test predictions, informed by the Integrated Motivational-Volitional (IMV) Model of Suicidal Behavior, concerning the role of feelings of defeat and entrapment within the sleep-suicide relationship. Volunteers aged 15 to 17 years (n = 1,045) from Scottish secondary schools completed an anonymous self-report survey assessing insomnia symptoms, nightmares, suicidal ideation, depressive symptomology, and feelings of defeat and entrapment. Both insomnia symptoms and nightmares were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation (independent of depression). Perceptions of both defeat and entrapment were elevated in young people who reported clinically salient insomnia and/or nightmares, relative to those who did not. The relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation was fully mediated by perceptions of defeat and entrapment, whereas nightmares were indirectly associated with suicidal ideation through perceptions of defeat and entrapment. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the psychological mechanisms linking sleep disturbance and suicidality by highlighting the role of defeat and entrapment. Clinically, these findings have the potential to improve suicide risk assessment and prevention in young people experiencing difficulties with their sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29734987/"}

Although previous studies have suggested that individuals who have high sleep reactivity may be resistant to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effects, there have been no studies that have investigated this empirically. This study explored differential treatment responses in CBT-I based on sleep reactivity levels. Participants for this study were nineteen insomnia patients who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder. All participants received four weekly sessions of structured cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Individuals completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Korean version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale-16 (DBAS-16), the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE) and a sleep diary. Participants were classified into two groups based on sleep reactivity level (high and low sleep reactivity). Following treatment, significant changes were found for ISI, K-CESD-R, DBAS-16 and FIRST scores, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, sleep quality and feeling refreshed upon awakening in both groups. Improvements in sleep efficiency was lower in the high sleep reactivity group compared to the low sleep reactivity group. No differences in ISI, K-CESD-R, DBAS-16 scores, and stress event frequency during the treatment duration were found between groups. These findings suggest that sleep reactivity level may be an important factor that affects treatment outcome of CBT-I. Furthermore, the results may suggest that individual response to stress events are more important than the stressor itself.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754367/"}

Participants with ID (n = 39)  and HC (n = 35) demonstrated differentially poor sleep on laboratory adaptation after exposure to the sleep laboratory. Patients with ID had longer rapid eye movement (REM) latency on the first night than on the second sleep night. HC showed increased duration and percentage of N1, decreased duration and percentage of N3, and decreased REM percentage during initial nights compared to subsequent nights.

We hypothesized that insomnia complaints in older adults would be associated with objective differences in sleep compared with those without insomnia complaints. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study in which older adults with insomnia complaints (cases, n=100) were compared with older adults without insomnia complaints (controls, n=100) using dual-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography, study questionnaires and 7 days of at-home actigraphy and sleep diaries. Cases were noted to have reduced objective total sleep time compared with controls (25.8 ± 8.56 min, P=0.003). This was largely due to increased wakefulness after sleep onset, and not increased sleep latency. When participants with sleep-related breathing disorder or periodic limb movement disorder were excluded, the polysomnography total sleep time difference became even larger. Cases also had reduced slow-wave sleep (5.10 ± 1.38 min versus 10.57 ± 2.29 min, effect size -0.29, P=0.04). When comparing self-reported sleep latency and sleep efficiency with objective polysomnographic findings, cases demonstrated low, but statistically significant correlations, while no such correlations were observed in controls.

Based upon the studies presented here, people in the UK sleep today 43 min more than they did in the 1970s because they go to bed earlier (~30 min) and they wake up later (~15 min). The change in sleep duration is driven by night sleep and it is homogeneously distributed across the week. The former results apply to men and women alike, and to individuals of all ages and employment status, including employed individuals, the presumed major victims of the sleep deprivation epidemic and the 24/7 society. In fact, employed individuals have experienced a reduction in short sleeping of almost 4 percentage points, from 14.9% to 11.0%.

One way analysis of variance was used to investigate the relationship of chronotypes with scale scores, and mediation regression analysis was used to investigate the indirect effects of night eating symptoms on disordered eating attitudes. Insomnia and night eating scores of the participants varied statistically according to chronotypes, and both insomnia and night eating scores were associated with the evening type. Findings show that night eating symptoms have a direct effect on the chronotype differences and insomnia and an indirect effect on disordered eating attitudes, by increasing insomnia scores.

The sample included 85 adolescents, 12 to 17 years, with chronic pain recruited from a multidisciplinary pain clinic and headache clinic who received access to an internet-delivered psychological intervention for chronic pain. Baseline sleep assessment included actigraphy monitoring for 7 days and survey measures. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 3 months including core pain-related outcomes, executive functioning, fatigue, positive and negative affect. Results demonstrated that greater baseline insomnia and poorer sleep quality was associated with worse outcome trajectories for pain-related disability, depression, anxiety, fatigue, negative affect, and executive functioning.

The data was sourced from a prospective clinical study on acupuncture treatment of insomnia by \"Tongdu Tiaowei\" acupoint prescription (Baihui [GV20], Yintang [EX-HN3], bilateral Shenmai [BL62] and bilateral Zhaohai [KI6]). Data from 113 insomnia patients were included in the analysis of the present study, with the reduction rate of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) served as the overall clinical efficacy evaluation. First, the feature selection was performed using univariate logistic regression and Boruta algorithm, and the prediction accuracy of the three boosting algorithms - adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) - was compared for selecting the best algorithm. The grid search and ten-fold cross-validation were used to optimize the hyperparameters of the best algorithm. The optimal dataset partitioning method was selected using stratified random partitioning, and the best cut-off value was determined based on the Youden index. The predictive model for the therapeutic efficacy was constructed and its performance was evaluated. Finally, SHAP (shapley additive explanation) analysis was used to visually interpret the model. The features included in the model were the proportion of stage N1 to total sleep duration, the proportion of stage N2 to total sleep duration, R latency from lights out, stage N2 latency from lights out, the awake time after sleep onset, PSQI sleep efficiency score, and the presence of an old tongue (a tongue picture of a dry, rough texture and an old body). XGBoost was identified as the best algorithm, with the optimal probability threshold of 0.76, a corresponding precision of 0.91, a recall of 0.91, a F1 score of 0.91, an accuracy of 0.91, and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.82. Patients who meet the following conditions are more likely to respond to \"Tongdu Tiaowei\" acuoint stimulation:the proportion of N1 phase was about 6%-70% of the total sleep duration, N2 phase latency was less than about 40 min from the time when the lights were off, the wakefulness time was less than about 75 min or 100-300 min after falling asleep, the R phase latency was more than about 75 min from the time when the lights were off. The N2 phase were about 20%-50% of the total sleep duration, PSQI sleep efficiency score was 2 or 3, and there was no appearance of \"old tongue\". The predictive model of the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for insomnia established using XGBoost, along with the preliminary profile of the suitable population constructed using SHAP, provides a reliable auxiliary decision-making tool for acupuncture treatment of insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40854863/"}

In this retrospective study, we analyzed 295 sleep diaries of patients with primary insomnia (43% were male, ages ranging between 17 and 76 years) collected in two clinical centers for insomnia and 536 sleep diaries of normal sleepers (47% were male, ages ranging between 15 and 82 years). We considered the following sleep parameters: time in bed, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, terminal wakefulness, and subjective feeling of rest. Using the Youden index, we calculated the quantitative criteria that performed best for each sleep parameter. Finally, we created receiver operating characteristic curves to test the accuracy of each identified criterion. Individuals with insomnia significantly differed from controls on all sleep indices (p < .001). Differentiation between individuals with insomnia from controls was optimal for terminal wakefulness (>15 minutes, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83), wake after sleep onset (cutoff >20 minutes, AUC = 0.81), total sleep time (<390 minutes, AUC = 0.80), and particularly sleep efficiency (<87.5%, AUC = 0.92, sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.90). Time in bed was the least differentiating variable (<500 minutes, AUC = 0.57). The quantitative criteria of the sleep diary in this study agree with the few available data in the literature.

This study aimed to determine the potential discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep assessments, including the latter made by physicians, by analyzing a 421-participant dataset in Japan comprising multiple nights of in-home sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) data and questionnaire responses on sleep habits or subjective experiences. We employed logistic regression models to examine which subjective and objective sleep parameters physicians are paying attention to when assessing sleep insufficiency, insomnia, sleep quality, and sleep apnea. Questionnaire responses, including subjective sleep assessments, exhibited poor performance predicting physicians' assessments, whereas objective data demonstrated good predictive performance, indicating a discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep assessments. Although the in-home sleep EEG measurements had minimal first night effects, incorporating measurements over multiple nights can improve the detection of objective insomnia. Moreover, we found that participants with severe sleep insufficiency overestimated their sleep duration, whereas those with subjective insomnia but without objective insomnia underestimated it. Additionally, subjective sleep quality reflected sleep efficiency but not the frequency of short awakenings or objective sleep depth. In particular, the effects of apnea on objective sleep quality were not subjectively perceived. Collectively, our findings suggest that subjective sleep assessments alone are insufficient for evaluating sleep health and that health checkups and advice based on sleep EEG measurements may be useful in improving sleep habits and for early detection of sleep disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819218/"}

There is a strong association between trauma-related nightmares and insomnia with higher rates of physical illness, mental distress, and suicide among PTSD patients. Prazosin, an α1-adrenergic antagonist, has shown mixed results in treating these sleep disturbances. This study aims to evaluate the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on insomnia, nightmares, and global PTSD symptoms, and to examine variables that might influence this effect. We conducted a meta-analysis and a novel meta-regression analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing prazosin to placebo in samples of patients with PTSD. Data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and PTSD Pubs. Examined variables were age, gender, military/civilian status, prazosin dose, treatment duration, baseline symptom severity, use of antidepressants, use of benzodiazepines (BDZ), prevalence of depression, and alcohol use disorder. Ten RCTs with 648 patients were included. Analysis revealed prazosin significantly improved insomnia (SMD = -0.654, p = 0.043) and nightmares (SMD = -0.641, p = 0.025), but not overall PTSD symptoms (SMD = -0.428, p = 0.077). Unexpectedly, higher BDZ use was associated with greater improvement in insomnia (β = -0.046; p = 0.01) and PTSD severity (β = -0.037; p = 0.004). These findings suggest that prazosin effectively reduces insomnia and nightmares in PTSD patients. Benzodiazepine co-administration seems to enhance prazosin's efficacy, suggesting that the addition of prazosin might allow for a reduction of BDZ doses in these patients. Further research should empirically test the efficacy of prazosin alone versus prazosin combined with BDZ to confirm these findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39828080/"}

Recent proposals suggested that insomnia with objective short-sleep duration (TST < 7 h) is associated with impaired inhibitory function, leading to a dysregulation of cortical inhibition, which may underlie its prevalence. This study investigated the status of impaired response inhibition in these two phenotypes and examined the potential different effect of response inhibition training on these two phenotypes. Twenty-two healthy controls (HC) and eighty-one patients with ID were recruited, with IDs further categorized into ISSD and INSD (with TST ≥ 7 h). Clinical behavior measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), objective sleep characteristics assessed by all-night sleep electroencephalography, and the accuracy of NoGo trials in the Go/NoGo task were compared among the three groups. Subsequently, within each ID phenotype, participants were divided into training and blank control sub-groups. The two training sub-groups completed Adaptive Go/NoGo training task (Through adaptive difficulty adjustment, the task trains participants' inhibitory control) 15 times over 3 weeks, and all IDs were assessed using sleep-related subjective and objective measures and Go/NoGo task before and after the intervention. ISSD patients exhibited significantly longer sleep latency (p = 0.003) compared to HC, while wakefulness duration (p = 0.004) and light sleep duration (p < 0.001) were shorter than INSD. No significant differences in objective sleep characteristics were observed between INSD and HC. Following adaptive training, the ISSD training sub-group showed decreased scores in PSQI (p = 0.039) and ISI (p = 0.053) compared to their blank control sub-group. In the INSD groups, both training and blank control sub-groups demonstrated reductions in PSQI (p < 0.001), ISI (p < 0.001), and the cognitive arousal sub-dimension of the PSAS scores (p = 0.003) in the post-session test. Impaired response inhibition is a characteristic of ISSD, potentially indicating dysfunctional cortical inhibition, whereas INSD pathogenesis may be related to cognitive-emotional arousal. Response inhibition training effectively alleviates sleep problems in ISSD. These findings provide new insights for developing precise intervention strategies in ID.

Ten English (PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL etc.) and five Chinese (CNKI, WANFANG etc.) databases were searched and the validity of the eligible studies was critically appraised. Thirty-two eligible randomized controlled trials of moderate to high quality which employed polysomnography, actigraphy, or self-assessment sleep quality tools were included. We conducted a meta-analysis using a random effects model with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) as the primary outcome measure (968 adult patients, 13 trials) for trials investigating the effects of traditional Chinese medicine acupressure compared with standard and sham treatments. We performed subgroup analyses to detect sources of heterogeneity, identify the use of acupoints in different populations and explore the contributions of PSQI domains to the total score change. Comparison with the sham group (7 trials with 385 patients) yielded low heterogeneity and an overall effect of 13%-19% improvement in the PSQI score (MD = -3.41, 95% CI -4.08, -2.75; I<sup>2</sup> = 12%). Based on data from four trials (n = 250), sleep latency and sleep duration were most affected. No adverse effects were reported in any of the reviewed trials. Within the limitations of clinical heterogeneity, the results showed that even fragile populations such as the elderly and dialysis patients can benefit from acupressure. Standardized treatment protocols involved 3-5 kg of pressure for one to five minutes per acupoint, delivered three to seven times a week for three to four weeks with the HT7 (Shenmen) acupoint used in most procedures.

The study examines and explores opinion on the optimal contents and format for an occupational therapy intervention to improve poor sleep in this population. Views of clinical and academic topic experts (n = 56), were elicited, examined and explored in three rounds, views from previous rounds being presented back to participants in subsequent rounds. Participants with relevant personal experience (n = 26) then rated and commented on suggestions, with a focus on acceptability. Descriptive statistics and graphs of ratings were triangulated with qualitative content analysis of free-text. Participants emphasised the central importance of intervention personalisation, although the manner and extent of personalisation suggested varied. Many components and domains were acknowledged as important, with the challenge being how to keep such an intervention simple, brief, and feasible for end-users, for sustainable implementation. The strongest consensus was to address evening routine, daytime activity, and environmental interventions. Relaxation, mindfulness, thermoregulation, sensory factors, and cognitive or psychological approaches were rated as less important. There was disagreement on whether to include time in bed restriction, and how to address napping, as well as how far to address medication timing. Clinicians and researchers advocated some version of stimulus control, but participants with personal experience reported low levels of acceptability for this, describing entirely negative experiences using 'the 15-minute rule' (part of stimulus control).

Acupuncture was given once a day, 6 times a week, for a total of 3 weeks in the two groups. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), insomnia severity index (ISI) scores were observed before treatment, after treatment and in follow-up of one month after treatment completion; the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), Beck depression inventory (BDI), fatigue severity scale (FSS), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores were observed before and after treatment; the sleep parameters of polysomnography (PSG), including sleep latency (SL), awake-up time (AT), sleep efficiency (SE) and total sleep time (TST), were observed before and after treatment using polysomnography monitor in the two groups. Compared with those before treatment, the PSQI and ISI scores in both groups were reduced after treatment and in follow-up (<i>P</i><0.05), and the PSQI and ISI scores in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment and in follow-up (<i>P</i><0.05). Compared with those before treatment, the BAI, BDI, FSS and ESS scores in both groups were reduced after treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), and the BAI, BDI, FSS and ESS scores in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment (<i>P</i><0.05). Compared with those before treatment, the SL and AT in both groups were reduced after treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), while SE and TST were increased after treatment (<i>P</i><0.05); after treatment, the SL and AT in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05), while SE and TST in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). On the basis of regular acupoint selection, acupuncture at \"umbilical four-acupoints\" could improve sleep quality, alleviate the severity of insomnia, and improve the comorbid symptoms i.e. anxiety, depression, fatigue and lethargy in patients with chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37313555/"}

However, objective and reliable data on this relationship are scarce, particularly for adolescents. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to test the relationship by assessing both PA and sleep subjectively and objectively. A total of 56 adolescent vocational school students (Mean age=17.98, SD=1.36; 28 males, 28 females) participated in the study. Sleep and PA were subjectively assessed via questionnaires. Accelerometers objectively assessed PA, while sleep-EEG devices objectively assessed sleep. The data supported our prediction that adolescents with high PA levels would have longer TST, fewer wakening at night (WASO), fewer symptoms of insomnia, and higher sleep quality. However, gender influenced this pattern of results in that significant findings were only found between high self-reported PA levels and shorter perceived sleep onset latency (SOL). Though self-reported PA levels were a better predictor of good sleep than objectively assessed PA levels, gender was associated with sleep complaints; females reported more sleep complaints. Results indicate that among a non-clinical sample of adolescents increased PA is favorably associated with restoring sleep. Therefore, PA seems beneficial not only for physical and mental health, but also for sleep restoration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23851332/"}

Despite numerous therapeutic options, a great number of depressed patients do not achieve full remission. In addition, despite good short-term outcomes, long-term therapeutic results remain disappointing and associated with a poor prognosis, raising significant concern in terms of public health. Impaired sleep - especially insomnia - may be at least partly responsible for this problem. Very close relationships between major depressive disorder (MDD) and sleep disorders have been observed. In particular, residual symptoms of sleep disturbance in a remitted patient may predict a relapse of the disease. However, most currently available antidepressants do not always take into consideration the sleep disturbances of depressed patients; some agents long used in clinical practice even appear to worsen them by their sleep-inhibiting properties. But some other new medications were shown to relieve early sleep disturbance in addition to alleviating other depression-related symptoms. This positive impact should promote compliance with medication and psychological treatments, and increase daytime performance and overall functioning.

Primary between-group outcomes included objective average CPAP adherence and changes in objective sleep efficiency by 6 months. Secondary between-group outcomes included rates of immediate CPAP acceptance/rejection, and changes in; sleep parameters, insomnia severity, and daytime impairments by 6 months. Compared to TAU, participants in the CBT-i group had 61 min greater average nightly adherence to CPAP (95% confidence interval [CI] = 9 to 113; p = 0.023, d = 0.38) and higher initial CPAP treatment acceptance (99% vs. 89%; p = 0.034). The CBT-i group showed greater improvement of global insomnia severity, and dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions by 6 months (both: p < 0.001), and greater improvement in sleep impairment measures immediately following CBT-i. There were no between-group differences in sleep outcomes, or daytime impairments by 6 months. In OSA participants with comorbid insomnia, CBT-i prior to initiating CPAP treatment improves CPAP use and insomnia symptoms compared to commencing CPAP without CBT-i. OSA patients should be evaluated for co-occurring insomnia and considered for CBT-i before commencing CPAP therapy.

Whether insomnia with objective short sleep duration responds better to pharmacological treatment compared to CBT-I has not been examined. Participants included 15 patients with chronic insomnia (86.7% female), aged 45.3 ± 8.1 years. Eight patients were randomized to CBT-I and 7 to trazodone. Patients were examined with 2 weeks of actigraphy, salivary cortisol, and the insomnia severity index at 3 time points (pretreatment, 3-month posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up). Mixed between-within-subjects analysis of variance and univariate analysis of covariance were conducted to assess the impact of trazodone and CBT-I on patients' total sleep time, salivary cortisol, and insomnia severity index scores across the 3 time points. Trazodone, but not CBT-I, significantly lengthened total sleep time (when measured with actigraphy) both at posttreatment (51.01 minutes vs -11.73 minutes; P = .051; Cohen's d = 1.383) and at follow-up (50.35 minutes vs -7.56 minutes; P = .012; Cohen's d = 1.725), respectively. In addition, trazodone, but not CBT-I, showed a clinically meaningful decrease in salivary cortisol from pretreatment to posttreatment (-36.07% vs -11.70%; Cohen's d = 0.793) and from pretreatment to follow-up (-21.37% vs -5.79%; Cohen's d = 0.284), respectively. Finally, there were no differences on insomnia severity index scores between the trazodone and the CBT-I groups. The current preliminary, open-label, randomized trial suggests that trazodone, but not CBT-I, significantly improves objective sleep duration and reduces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, suggesting a differential treatment response in the insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype.

Evidence-based PTSD treatment often does not effectively decrease insomnia, and insomnia may interfere with the mechanisms underlying PTSD treatment. This study compared the efficacy of integrated cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and prolonged exposure (PE; CBTI-PE) therapy to sleep hygiene and PE (hygiene-PE) in reducing insomnia and PTSD symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> Ninety-four veterans with insomnia disorder (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] ≥11) and PTSD (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for <i>DSM-5</i> [CAPS-5] diagnosis) were randomized to CBTI-PE or hygiene-PE therapy for 12 weeks of treatment. Recruitment ran from January 2017 to March 2023. Planned outcomes were PTSD symptoms (CAPS-5; PTSD Checklist for <i>DSM-5</i>), quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF [WHOQOL]), and insomnia severity (ISI, subjective sleep efficiency [SE], total sleep time [TST]) between baseline, week 5, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. <b>Results:</b> Randomized participants were 76.6% male, 52.1% white, and mean age was 40.0 years (SD = 11.6). Linear modeling showed PTSD symptoms significantly decreased for most participants, but there were no differences by treatment group (<i>P</i> = .844).

Strategies targeting individuals at elevated risk for MDD may guide effective preventive care. Insomnia is a reliable precursor to depression, preceding half of all incident and relapse cases. Thus, insomnia may serve as a useful entry point for preventing MDD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia, but widespread implementation is limited by a shortage of trained specialists. Innovative stepped-care approaches rooted in primary care can increase access to CBT-I and reduce rates of MDD. We propose a large-scale stepped-care clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with clinician-led CBT-I for insomnia and the prevention of MDD incidence and relapse. Specifically, our care model uses digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) as a first-line intervention to increase care access and reduce the need for specialist resources. Our proposal also adds clinician-led CBT-I for patients who do not remit with first-line intervention and need a more personalized approach from specialty care. We will evaluate negative repetitive thinking as a potential treatment mechanism by which dCBT-I and CBT-I benefit insomnia and depression outcomes. This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination and implementation to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression.

Between November 2019 and November 2021, we recruited 17 primary insomnia patients (PI group) and 20 matched healthy controls (HC group) as study subjects from Zhaoqing First People's Hospital. Before electroacupuncture treatment, all participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) assessments. Resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted before and after two sessions of electroacupuncture at Shenmen and Neiguan acupoints. Before treatment, primary insomnia patients showed higher PSQI (χ2=1.964; P = .017), HAMA (χ2=2.016; P = .027), and HAMD scores (χ2=2.367; P = .013) compared to healthy controls, and increased ReHo values were observed in the left amygdala, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, and left posterior cingulate gyrus in PI patients, while decreased ReHo values were found in the left posterior cingulate gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right precuneus. After treatment, ReHo values increased in the left superior frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right cingulate gyrus, while they decreased in the left amygdala and right angular gyrus. Primary insomnia disrupts brain areas in the default network, salience network, and parts of the affective cognitive network.

We wanted to investigate whether a small dose of melatonin given daily, administered in the afternoon, could advance the sleep timing in teenagers. Twenty-one students, aged 14-19 yrs, with sleep-onset difficulties during school weeks were recruited. The study was a randomized, double blind, placebo (PL)-controlled crossover trial, lasting 5 wks. During the first 6 d in wks 2 and 4, the students received either PL or melatonin (1 mg) capsules between 16:30 and 18:00 h. During the first 6 d of wk 5, all students received melatonin. Wks 1 and 3 were capsule-free. In the last evening of each week and the following morning, the students produced saliva samples at home for later melatonin analysis. The samples were produced the same time each week, as late as possible in the evening and as early as possible in the morning. Both the student and one parent received automatic mobile text messages 15 min before saliva sampling times and capsule intake at agreed times. Diaries with registration of presumed sleep, subjective sleepiness during the day (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) and times for capsule intake and saliva samplings were completed each day. Primary analysis over 5 wks gave significant results for melatonin, sleep and KSS. Post hoc analysis showed that reported sleep-onset times were advanced after melatonin school weeks compared with PL school weeks (p < .005) and that sleep length was longer (p < .05). After the last melatonin school week, the students fell asleep 68 min earlier and slept 62 min longer each night compared with the baseline week. Morning melatonin values in saliva diminished compared with PL (p < .001) and evening values increased (p < .001), indicating a possible sleep phase advance. Compared with PL school weeks, the students reported less wake up (p < .05), less school daytime sleepiness (p < .05) and increased evening sleepiness (p < .005) during melatonin weeks. We conclude that a small dose of melatonin given daily, administered in the afternoon, could advance the sleep timing and make the students more alert during school days even if they continued their often irregular sleep habits during weekends.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23005039/"}

Median sleep latency was significantly lower with zaleplon, 10 and 20 mg, than with placebo during all 4 weeks of treatment and with zaleplon, 5 mg, for the first 3 weeks. Zaleplon, 20 mg, also significantly increased sleep duration compared with placebo in all but week 3 of the study. There was no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of 4 weeks of zaleplon treatment. Zolpidem, 10 mg, significantly decreased sleep latency, increased sleep duration, and improved sleep quality at most timepoints compared with placebo; however, after discontinuation of zolpidem treatment, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms was significantly greater than that with placebo and there was an indication of significant rebound insomnia for some patients in the zolpidem group compared with those in the placebo group. The frequency of adverse events in the active treatment groups did not differ significantly from that in the placebo group. Zaleplon is effective in the treatment of insomnia.

Specific interventions included cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based therapies, bright light therapy, sleep hygiene, and other non-standard interventions. Improvements in sleep disturbance were noted in all studies, but only some studies showed statistical significance. This scoping review identified a relatively small number of relevant studies, involving a relatively small number of participants. Moreover, the studies involved very different interventions, with very different methodologies (including type/time of assessments).

Seven hundred children (ages 5-12, 47.8% male) from the Penn State Child Cohort underwent a nine-hour polysomnography and parent completed Pediatric Behavior Scale. Insomnia symptoms were defined as parent report of difficulty falling and/or staying asleep, sleep disordered breathing as an AHI of ≥1, and objective short sleep duration as a total sleep time < 7.7 h. Children with insomnia symptoms demonstrated more overall behavioral problems than controls. Significant interactions between insomnia symptoms and objective sleep duration on scores of externalizing behaviors, mood variability and school problems were found. Profile analyses showed that children with insomnia symptoms and normal sleep duration were associated with clinically elevated externalizing behaviors, inattention, mood variability, and school problems, while children with insomnia and short sleep duration were associated with an overall elevated profile in which internalizing behaviors were more prominent. Childhood insomnia symptoms are associated with a wide array of behavioral problems, for which objective sleep duration is useful in differentiating behavioral profiles. Children with insomnia symptoms and normal sleep duration had a behavioral profile consistent with limit-setting and rule-breaking behaviors, while children with insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration had a behavioral profile more consistent with internalizing behaviors resembling that of psychophysiological disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27245765/"}

Data analysis was based on secondary analysis of standard in-lab polysomnographic recordings in 20 elderly people with insomnia and 21 elderly good sleepers. Parameters indicating sleep fragmentation, such as number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and percentage of NREM1 were extracted from the polsysomnogram, as well as spectral power, microarousals and sleep spindle index. The correlation between these parameters during the first sleep cycle and the amount of misperceived sleep was assessed in the insomnia group. Additionally, we made a model of the minimum duration that a sleep fragment at sleep onset should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we fitted this model to subjective SOLs of both subject groups. Misperception of SOL was associated with increased percentage of NREM1 and more WASO during sleep cycle 1. For insomnia subjects, the best fit of modelled SOL with subjective SOL was found when assuming that sleep fragments shorter than 30 min at sleep onset were perceived as wake. The model indicated that healthy subjects are less sensitive to sleep interruptions and perceive fragments of 10 min or longer as sleep. Our findings suggest that sleep onset misperception is related to sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night. Moreover, we show that people with insomnia needed a longer duration of continuous sleep for the perception as such compared to controls. Further expanding the model could provide more detailed information about the underlying mechanisms of sleep misperception.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30897458/"}

Sleep problems may include insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, or hypersomnia. A transdiagnostic approach combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) with chronotherapy addressing a broad range of sleep problems has shown promising results in a limited number of studies. The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic sleep intervention for patients with sleep problems comorbid to bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, or attention deficit disorders. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention improves sleep quality compared with a control group. The secondary hypotheses are that the intervention increases subjective and objective sleep efficiency, reduces sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, and severity of insomnia; and that it improves well-being, personal recovery, work ability, and consumption of sleep medication compared with a control group. The study is a randomized controlled trial enrolling 88 outpatients with bipolar disorder, major depression, or attention deficit disorder with symptoms of various sleep problems (insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, or hypersomnia). Patients are allocated to either an intervention group receiving six sessions of transdiagnostic sleep treatment or to a control group receiving a single session of sleep hygiene education. Assessments are made at baseline, at week two, and after 6 weeks in both groups. Actigraphy is performed continuously throughout the 6-week study period for all patients. The primary outcome is changes in the subjective appraisal of sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). The secondary outcomes are changes in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of nocturnal awakenings (based on actigraph and sleep diary data), changes in insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index), well-being (WHO-5 Well-Being Index), personal recovery (INSPIRE-O), work ability (Work Ability Index), and consumption of sleep medication (sleep-diaries). The study was initiated in 2022 and the inclusion period will continue until mid-2024.

Treatment studies including university students aged 18-24 years, participating in a sleep intervention (multi-component, e.g., CBT-I, or single-component, e.g., sleep hygiene) were eligible. Comparator groups were either active, i.e., alternative intervention, or passive, i.e., waitlist control or treatment-as-usual, with study outcomes to include measures of sleep and mental health. Of 3435 references screened, 11 studies involving 5267 participants, with and without insomnia symptoms, were included for a narrative synthesis on intervention designs and methodology. Six studies eligible for meta-analyses showed a moderate effect of sleep interventions in reducing sleep disturbance (SMD = -0.548 [CI: -0.837, -0.258]) at post-treatment, alongside a small effect in improving anxiety (SMD = -0.226 [CI: -0.421, -0.031]) and depression (SMD = -0.295 [CI: -0.513, -0.077]).

Overall, this literature appeared unsystematic and post hoc, with under-developed theoretical frameworks and inconsistent methodologies. Correlates most consistently associated with greater IIV in one or more aspects of sleep/wake patterns were: younger age, non-White race/ethnicity, living alone, physical health conditions, higher body mass index, weight gain, bipolar and unipolar depression symptomatology, stress, and evening chronotype; symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep were associated with higher sleep/wake IIV, which was reduced following sleep interventions. The effects of experimentally reduced sleep/wake IIV on daytime functioning were inconclusive.

Across each sample, dissatisfaction with sleep was more strongly correlated with sleep duration and subjective health than insomnia symptoms, providing additional evidence for distinguishability between the two sleep disturbance factors.

Two-stage structural equation modelling was applied to the available data, where 7 studies examined the cognitive mediator, 'dysfunctional beliefs about sleep', 5 studies examined a hyperarousal mediator, and 3 studies examined the behavioural mediator, 'time in bed'. There was evidence in support of changes in dysfunctional beliefs as a cognitive mediator of insomnia symptom improvement following CBT-I. There was more limited evidence in support of changes in hyperarousal-related mediators, and no significant effect of time in bed as a mediator. Numerous studies recorded diary-based measures of potential behavioural mediators, but analyses of these variables were not typically conducted. The most serious limitation of the evidence base is that the temporal precedence of mediator changes cannot be established.

Their performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective daytime sleepiness were compared across different insomnia groups, and the results were compared between middle-aged adults and older adults. Analysis of covariance indicated that subjective daytime sleepiness was significantly different across the insomnia groups in middle-aged adults based on insomnia group (P=<.0001), but, did not affect objective vigilance performance. In contrast, older adults displayed significantly different PVT response time, but not daytime sleepiness, based on insomnia group (P=0.03). Insomnia impacts psychomotor performance and subjective sleepiness differently, based on age group.

Residual insomnia symptoms were investigated in those who had insomnia symptoms/syndrome at baseline and achieved full remission (according to predetermined diagnostic algorithm) within the following 1 year. Cox regressions were used to determine the hazard ratio (HR) of each residual symptom for predicting relapse in the next 4 years. The nature and severity of residual symptoms were examined with an extended version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which incorporates additional items on sleep quality and specific sleep-related daytime impairments (on daytime fatigue, cognitive functioning, mood, interpersonal relationship, and daily activities). In addition, the presence of depressive symptoms and medical conditions were controlled for in investigating risks of insomnia relapse. A total of 434 participants were included in this study (age ranges from 18 to 94; 65.9% female); 248 of them had relapsed within 4 years. The response rate ranged from 78% to 83%. The most frequently reported residual symptoms with at least moderate severity (ISI items ≥2 on 0-4 ISI item scale) were poor \"Quality of sleep\" (39.2 %), followed by \"difficulty maintaining sleep\" (DMS; 27%). The most common residual daytime impairments related to insomnia were fatigue (24.7 %), mood disturbances (23%) and cognitive disturbances (22.6%). After controlling for baseline insomnia and depression severity and concurrent physical diseases, impairments of cognition (HR = 1.46), poor quality of sleep (HR = 1.43), disturbed mood (HR = 1.39), being female (HR = 1.36), DMS (HR = 1.35), and fatigue (HR = 1.24) were significantly associated with insomnia relapse in the next 4 years.

A wide range of residual symptoms exists in individuals with naturally remitted insomnia. Notably, residual DMS is the most common residual nighttime symptom and the only nighttime symptom associated with insomnia relapse.

Participants completed a battery of clinical measures: Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, abbreviated Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Insomnia Severity Index and, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Associations between class membership and baseline covariates were evaluated. Concurrent sleep aid use fell into six distinct latent class trajectories over a 12-month period: Minimal Use (74.5%), Rx-Dominant (11.3%), NP-Dominant (6.3%), OTC-Dominant (4.3%), Rx-NP-Dominant (2.4%), and Rx-OTC-Dominant (1.1%). The three latent classes with prominent prescribed agent use predicted greater incidence of healthcare professional consultations for their sleep (p < 0.05), poorer sleep quality (p < 0.001), elevated dysfunctional sleep beliefs (p < 0.001), and sleep reactivity (p < 0.001). Compared to the other four latent classes, clinical profiles of Rx-NP-dominant and Rx-OTC-dominant groups endorsed greater severity across measures. Patterns of sleep aid use may provide insight for identifying individuals who may be vulnerable to inappropriate self-medicating practices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089619/"}

This article roughly describes the methods of measuring the different facets of insomnia. A major difficulty in research with insomniacs is seen in the fact that many methods have been developed in research with young healthy volunteers, not with insomniacs. While good sleep is a homogeneous phenomenon, and its quality will be described similarly well by different methods, insomnia is a very heterogeneous syndrome with low intercorrelation of the different measures. Therefore, insomniacs' sleep quality should be assessed from as many points of view as possible.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6674822/"}

The present systematic review aims to document the relationships between insomnia and nightmares in individuals without a concomitant psychopathology. The relationships between insomnia and dreams are also addressed. PsycINFO and Medline were searched for papers published in English or French from 1970 to March 2023. Sixty-seven articles were included for review. Most results support positive relationships between insomnia variables and nightmare variables in individuals with insomnia, individuals with nightmares, the general population, students, children and older adults, and military personnel and veterans. These positive relationships were also apparent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some psychological interventions, such as Imagery Rehearsal Therapy, might be effective in alleviating both nightmares and insomnia symptoms. Regarding the relationships between insomnia and dreams, compared with controls, the dreams of individuals with insomnia are characterized by more negative contents and affects. The results show that insomnia and nightmares are connected and may be mutually aggravating. A model is proposed to explain how insomnia might increase the likelihood of experiencing nightmares, and how nightmares can in turn lead to sleep loss and nonrestorative sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38733767/"}

All-night sleep recordings with 256 channel high-density EEG were analyzed for 8 insomnia subjects (5 females) and 8 sex and age-matched controls without sleep complaints. Spectral analyses were conducted using unpaired t-tests and topographical differences between groups were assessed using statistical non-parametric mapping. Five minute segments of deep NREM sleep were further analyzed using sLORETA cortical source imaging. The initial topographic analysis of all-night NREM sleep EEG revealed that insomnia subjects had more high-frequency EEG activity (> 16 Hz) compared to good sleeping controls and that the difference between groups was widespread across the scalp. In addition, the analysis also showed that there was a more circumscribed difference in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) power bands between groups. When deep NREM sleep (N3) was examined separately, the high-frequency difference between groups diminished, whereas the higher regional alpha activity in insomnia subjects persisted. Source imaging analysis demonstrated that sensory and sensorimotor cortical areas consistently exhibited elevated levels of alpha activity during deep NREM sleep in insomnia subjects relative to good sleeping controls. These results suggest that even during the deepest stage of sleep, sensory and sensorimotor areas in insomnia subjects may still be relatively active compared to control subjects and to the rest of the sleeping brain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943465/"}

A systematic search for eligible articles and dissertations was conducted in six online bibliographic databases. The 11 included studies, with the majority published between 1978 and 1998, were randomised controlled and experimental studies in adults, comparing stimulus control for insomnia with passive and active comparators and assessing insomnia symptoms as outcomes. A random effects model was used to determine the standardised mean difference Hedge's g at post-treatment and follow-up for three sleep diary measures: the number of awakenings, sleep onset latency, and total sleep time. A test for heterogeneity was conducted, forest plots were produced, the risk of publication bias was estimated, and the study quality was assessed. In the trials identified, stimulus control resulted in small to large improvements on sleep onset latency and total sleep time, relative to passive comparators (g = 0.38-0.85). Compared with active comparators, the improvements following stimulus control were negligible (g = 0.06-0.30). Although methodological uncertainties were observed in the included trials, stimulus control appears to be an efficacious treatment for insomnia when compared with passive comparators and with similar effects to active comparators.

In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial subjects (N=70) from TCM treated outpatients were randomized to receive TCM based acupuncture with manual stimulation (experimental) or sham stimulation (control) treatment. Acupuncture was applied to SP6 for 20 minutes on the spleen meridian of the foot in experimental subjects and controls received sham intervention. Significant changes between pre- and post-intervention were found in all electrical conductance values for the 12 meridians (Ryodoraku scores) in either control or experimental groups (fold change from 1.15 to 2.03) (P values <0.00 1). Eight meridians showed significantly different changes in Ryodoraku scores between pre- and post-intervention in the experimental group compared to the control group (fold change from 1.16 to 1.36) (P<0.05). EEG wave signals did not change with intervention in either group (P values ≥0.209). In summary, acupuncture at the SP6 acupoint altered meridian electrical activity of the lung periecardium, har, small intestine, sanjiao, spleen, bladder, and stomach meridians (P values <0.05) in patients with insomnia.

Next, we report the case of a 37 year-old patient who, after a grief situation, began to experience insomnia that was resistant to various conventional treatments, even with dosage adjustment. The insomnia diminished after replacing the conventional pharmacotherapies with full spectrum Cannabis sativa oil, rich in cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Finally, we note that medical societies from several major countries such as England, Australia and Brazil already recommend the use of Cannabis (plants rich in THC and/or CBD) to treat insomnia. These societies base their guidelines on studies that reported a mitigation of the symptoms of insomnia with the use of cannabinoids. However, recent meta-analyses highlight the heterogeneity of the participants, interventions, and results.

Fifty-seven people with insomnia were subdivided into short sleep duration (SSD, sleep time < 6 hr) group and normal sleep duration (NSD, sleep time ≥ 6 hr) group based on polysomnography data. Twenty-nine healthy controls (HC) were matched on age, gender, and education. Cognitive function was assessed using a comprehensive and sensitive neuropsychological test battery. Both objective and subjective insomnia statuses were estimated. Serum BDNF level was measured using enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. Compared with HC, the SSD group showed impaired neuropsychological performances in spatial span, brief visuospatial memory test, fluency, managing emotions, and continuous performance tests. In contrast, NSD had bad performance only in brief visuospatial memory test and continuous performance tests, and relatively better than SSD group in the latter test. People with SSD insomnia but not NSD had decreased BDNF levels compared with HC, and neuropsychological performance was positively correlated with BDNF levels only in SSD group. Primary insomnia was associated with impaired neuropsychological performance, and the impairment might be related to decreased objective sleep duration.

Arousal and valence of the sleep-related stimuli were assessed using a 5-point Likert type scale. Attention biases characterized by difficulty disengaging from and increased avoidance for daytime fatigue, and by difficulty disengaging from alarm clocks were observed in individuals with insomnia disorder compared to controls. On the whole sample, difficulty to disengage from diurnal and nocturnal sleep-related stimuli were related mostly to higher arousal rating of sleep-related stimuli and insomnia severity.

We provide first initial evidence for an attentional bias characterized by on one side, avoidance for diurnal sleep-related stimuli and on other side, disengagement for both diurnal and nocturnal sleep-related stimuli in patients with insomnia.

Existing medication treatments for each condition have risks, particularly in older adults.

Existing behavioural interventions for nocturia or insomnia contain concordant and discordant components. An expert panel (including geriatricians with sleep or nocturia research expertise, sleep psychologists and a behavioural psychologist) was convened to combine and reconcile elements of behavioural treatment for each condition. Concordant treatment recommendations involve using situational self-management strategies such as urge suppression or techniques to influence homeostatic drive for sleep. Fluid modification such as avoiding alcohol and evening caffeine and regular self-monitoring through a daily diary is also appropriate for both conditions. The expert panel resolved discordant recommendations by eliminating overnight completion of voiding diaries (which can interfere with sleep) and discouraging routine overnight voiding (a stimulus control strategy).

The scores of all ten RIS items were compared between tinnitus patients and 94 healthy individuals by separate ANOVAs in order to specify the extent of insomnia specific symptoms in the tinnitus group. In a second step a multiple linear regression analysis was performed in the tinnitus sample with subscales of the TQ (excluding the TQ sleep scale), age and duration of tinnitus as independent variables and the RIS score as the dependent variables. Tinnitus patients differed from healthy controls not only in impaired sleep quality but also in insomnia specific concerns and anxiety. Tinnitus related emotional and cognitive distress and somatic complaints correlated with severity of insomnia, whereas no association of age or duration of tinnitus with severity of insomnia was found.

Parents of all children completed two questionnaires to assess their children's sleep habits and disturbances, and their EFs with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Preschool Version.

The chronic insomnia group showed significant impairment in all the EFs domains. Nocturnal sleep duration, nighttime awakenings, and nocturnal wakefulness correlated with inhibit, plan/organize, working memory, inhibitory self-control, emergent metacognition, and the global executive composite scores in the chronic insomnia group. In the control group, the number of nighttime awakenings correlated with inhibition, inhibitory self-control, and the global executive composite.

The present study evaluated whether CBTI is an efficacious treatment for menopause-related chronic insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious compared with CBTI. In a single-site, randomized controlled trial, 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 ± 5.64 years) with chronic DSM-5 insomnia disorder related to menopause were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education (SHE), SRT, or CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep diaries served as primary outcomes. From baseline to posttreatment, ISI decreased 7.70 points in the CBTI group (p < .001), 6.56 points in the SRT group (p < .001), and 1.12 in the SHE group (p = .01). Although average sleep duration increased in all groups by 6 month follow-up, CBTI patients obtained 40-43 more minutes of nightly sleep than those who received SHE or SRT. Remission rates in the CBTI (54%-84%) and SRT (38%-57%) groups were higher than SHE patients (4%-33%) at posttreatment and 6 month follow-up. CBTI patients were generally more likely to remit than SRT patients. CBTI and SRT effectively treat menopause-related insomnia disorder and are superior to SHE. Response to CBTI and SRT is similar, but CBTI outperforms SRT in improving sleep maintenance, which may increase likelihood of remission.

Personality, coping, and social support questionnaires were assessed before the start of the treatment and were compared between treatment responders and nonresponders. To examine whether these variables were predictive for negative treatment outcome, logistic regression analyses were applied. Treatment nonresponders had a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity. Logistic regression analyses showed that the presence of psychiatric comorbidity was strongly predictive for negative treatment outcome (odds ratios: 20.6 and 10.3 for the 2 outcome definitions). Additionally, higher scores on the cognitive coping strategy called \"refocus on planning\" were associated with worse CBT-I outcome.

VMA events influence physical sleep fragmentation but not necessarily extensive sleep loss or sleep architecture changes. Lack of robust connections between perceived and recorded sleep (and VMA) could be influenced by inadequate detection. There is a need for studies of women in well-defined menopausal transition stages who have no sleep problems, accounting for sleep-related disorders, mood, and other symptoms, with attention to VMS dimensions, distribution of VMS during night and day, and advanced measurement of symptoms and physiologic manifestations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26154276/"}

As part of the EPISONO cohort (São Paulo, Brazil), 925 individuals answered questionnaires, underwent a full-night polysomnography and clinical assessment, and had peripheral blood collected for DNA extraction. Insomnia was diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition; and obstructive sleep apnea was defined according to apnea-hypopnea index. For the objective insomnia phenotype, we combined insomnia diagnosis with total sleep time from polysomnography with a cutoff of 360 minutes, allowing the classification of six groups. Self-reported sleep duration was used to classify the individuals as short (< 6 hours), average (6 to 8 hours) and long (> 8 hours) sleepers. The leukocyte telomere length was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Based on its distribution, we considered leukocyte telomere length < 10th percentile as short telomere and leukocyte telomere length ≥ 10th percentile as non-short telomere. After adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index, only insomnia disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 2.654, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.025-6.873, <i>P</i> = .044), insomnia disorder total sleep time < 360 minutes (OR = 4.205, 95% CI = 1.097-16.117, <i>P</i> = .036) and long sleepers (OR = 2.177, 95% CI = 1.189- 3.987, <i>P</i> = .012) were associated with short telomere.

Previous research has found that sleep-directed hypnosis improves subjective sleep quality, particularly sleep onset latency, in women with PTSD. However, it cannot be assumed that improvements in subjective sleep reports correspond with objectively measured sleep improvements, because research has indicated a lack of agreement across these measures. The current study examined the effects of sleep-directed hypnosis plus cognitive processing therapy (hypCPT) on objective indices of sleep quality measured with actigraphy. <b><i>Method:</i></b> Forty-five women with PTSD were randomized to receive sleep-directed hypCPT or sleep and psychiatric symptom monitoring plus CPT (ssmCPT). Pre- and posttreatment, participants completed 1 week of daily actigraphy assessments of nocturnal sleep onset latency, waking after sleep onset, and total sleep time. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall improvement in objective sleep indices was not observed. Despite this, at posttreatment, treatment completers receiving hypCPT took significantly less time to fall asleep than did women receiving ssmCPT. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> More research is needed to understand and reduce the discrepancy between subjectively and objectively assessed sleep impairments in PTSD. Nevertheless, results indicate that adding sleep-directed hypnosis to trauma-focused therapy may be of some use for individuals with PTSD-related insomnia.

This study examined correlates of benzodiazepine use for sleep in a clinical sample of patients seeking treatment for insomnia at a sleep disorders clinic. The sample consisted of 97 individuals evaluated at a sleep disorders clinic for a presenting complaint of insomnia. Two groups were formed, including one with 61 patients who had been using BZDs for sleep for an average of 56.6 months (SD=68.0), and another with 36 patients who had insomnia but were not using BZDs or any other sleep aid. Logistic regressions, adjusting for an age difference between the user and non-user groups, were performed to examine variables associated with BZD use. Independent variables included demographic, medical, insomnia-related and psychological parameters and subjective sleep-wake characteristics. Unadjusted regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with a pattern of long-term use (>12 months) within the user group.

This study examines how multiple longitudinal measures of sleep disturbances (sleep-initiation insomnia, sleep-maintenance insomnia, sleep-medication usage) are associated with dementia risk. Ten annual waves (2011-2020) of prospective cohort data from a nationally representative U.S. sample of adults aged ≥65 years were analyzed from the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Sleep disturbances were converted into a longitudinal score and measured as sleep-initiation insomnia (trouble falling asleep in 30 minutes), sleep-maintenance insomnia (trouble falling asleep after waking up early), and sleep-medication usage (taking medication to help sleep). Cox regression models analyzed time to dementia diagnosis for a sample of 6,284 respondents. In the unadjusted model, sleep-initiation insomnia was significantly associated with a 51% increased dementia risk (hazard ratio=1.51, 95% CI=1.19, 1.90). Adjusted for sociodemographics, sleep-medication usage was significantly associated with a 30% increased dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio=1.30, 95% CI=1.08-1.56). Adjusted for sociodemographics and health, sleep-maintenance insomnia was significantly associated with a 40% decreased dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio=0.60, 95% CI=0.46, 0.77). These findings suggest that sleep-initiation insomnia and sleep-medication usage may elevate dementia risk.

Qualitative content from interviews indicated that well-established precipitating and perpetuating factors for insomnia may contribute to poor maternal sleep health. Results also revealed a gap in knowledge and language surrounding sleep health among rural mothers. Sleep health is challenged during the transition to motherhood and rural mothers have less access to specialized perinatal and behavioral health care than their urban counterparts. In this sample, poor sleep was attributable to distress in addition to nocturnal infant and child sleep patterns which has implications for psychoeducation and promotion of sleep health in mothers.

Unfortunately, previous research provides limited guidance as to what constitutes the best and most practical management approach for this comorbid patient group. Some preliminary studies show that when cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT-I) is combined with standard OSA therapies for these patients, outcomes are improved. However, the dearth of trained providers capable of delivering CBT-I has long served as a pragmatic barrier to the widespread use of this therapy in clinical practice. The emergence of sophisticated online CBT-I (OCBT-I) programs could improve access, showing promising reductions in insomnia severity. Given its putative scalability and apparent efficacy, some have argued OCBT-I should represent a 1st-stage intervention in a broader stepped care model that allocates more intensive and less assessable therapist-delivered CBT-I (TCBT-I) only to those who show an inadequate response to lower intensity OCBT-I. However, the efficacy of OCBT-I as a 1st-stage therapy within a broader stepped care management strategy for insomnia comorbid with OSA has yet to be tested with comorbid OSA/insomnia patients. This dual-site randomized clinical trial will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to test a stepped care model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1) augmentation of PAP therapy with OCBT-I improves short-term outcomes of comorbid OSA/insomnia and (2) providing a higher intensity 2nd-stage CBT-I to patients who show sub-optimal short-term outcomes with OCBT-I+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. After completing baseline assessment, the comorbid OSA/insomnia patients enrolled will be randomized to a 1st-stage therapy that includes usual care PAP + OCBT-I or UC (usual care PAP + sleep hygiene education). Insomnia will be reassessed after 8 weeks. OCBT-I recipients who meet \"remission\" criteria (defined as an Insomnia Severity Index score < 10) will continue PAP but will not be offered any additional insomnia intervention and will complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8 weeks and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups.

A new clinical specialty has developed with the establishment of sleep disorder centers and a diagnostic classification of sleep and arousal disorders. This new nosological approach has evolved from an extensive base of new scientific information concerning descriptive polygraphic and analysis of clinical case series. Four major categories have been defined: (a) disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (insomnias), (b) disorders of excessive somnolence, (c) disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and (d) dysfunctions associated with sleep. Within this comprehensive classification certain major pathophysiological advances are described for the \"insomnias.\" These include polysomnographic identification of altered sleep stage patterns in the major effective illnesses, insomnias related to hypnotic drugs and alcohol, sleep disturbances associated with sleep-induced respiratory impairment, and sleep-related periodic movements during sleep (nocturnal myoclonus). Excessive daytime somnolence is primarily associated with the hypersomnia sleep-apnea syndrome and with narcolepsy. The relationship between biological rhythms (chronobiology) and disorders of the human sleep-wake schedules is very actively investigated. The recognition that sleep length, internal organization, and timing within neurophysiological circadian time-keeping systems has lead to better diagnosis of these sleep-wake disorders and new chronotherapeutic regimens.

Primary outcomes were feasibility (credibility, adherence, system user-friendliness and adverse effects), and secondary outcomes were changes in symptom severity (insomnia, depression and anxiety). Adherence was generally high, participants' feasibility ratings were favourable, and adverse effects matched previously reported levels for cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. Symptoms of insomnia decreased after the treatment period (Hedge's g = 1.79, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-2.39), as did symptoms of depression and anxiety. FastAsleep can be considered feasible and promising for alleviating insomnia symptoms among patients fit for self-care. Future controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of FastAsleep and its suitability in a stepped care model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36303518/"}

This study assessed the relationship between insomnia and both depression symptoms and blood estradiol levels in women during the early postpartum period. 84 patients were assessed 24-48 h after labor. The main assessment methods were the following psychometric scales: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Serum estradiol levels were measured using ELISA assay. Women who developed postpartum insomnia significantly more often reported insomnia during pregnancy (P = 0.001), were more likely to have suffered from depression in the past (P = 0.007) and had significantly higher BDI (P = 0.002) and EPDS (P = 0.048) scores. Our study demonstrated no significant association between Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and postpartum insomnia. The groups of women with and without postpartum RLS showed no significant differences in the incidence of postpartum insomnia. No significant differences in estradiol levels were observed in women with and without postpartum insomnia. The study showed the following factors to play a major role in development of postpartum insomnia: an increase in Beck Depression Inventory score, a history of depression and a history of insomnia during pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28791548/"}

To evaluate the clinical profile of suvorexant, a novel orexin receptor antagonist approved for treating insomnia at doses up to 20 mg, by sex subgroups. Efficacy analyses by sex were based on pooled data from two similar phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month trials in elderly (≥65 years) and non-elderly (18-64 years) insomnia patients. Two age-adjusted (non-elderly/elderly) dose regimes of 40/30 and 20/15 mg were evaluated, with fewer patients assigned to 20/15 mg. Efficacy was assessed by patient-reported outcomes (N = 1264 women, 707 men) and by polysomnography endpoints in ~75% of patients. Safety analyses by sex (N = 1744 women, 1065 men) included pooled data from the two 3-month trials plus 3-month data from a safety trial of 40/30 mg. The sex subgroup efficacy analyses mirrored the improvements seen for suvorexant 40/30 and 20/15 mg over placebo on patient-reported outcomes and polysomnography sleep maintenance and onset endpoints in the primary analyses; 95% CIs excluded zero in favor of suvorexant for most endpoints in both sexes, and similar efficacy was observed between sexes (95% CIs overlapped). Suvorexant was well-tolerated in women and men, although women in all treatment groups (including placebo) reported more adverse events than men.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) delivered in up to eight weekly telephone sessions (CBTI-Phone, n = 15) versus an information pamphlet control (IPC, n = 15). Sleep/wake diary, sleep-related questionnaires (Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 16-item Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep), and daytime symptom assessments (fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life) were completed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-wk follow-up. Linear mixed models indicated that sleep/wake diary sleep efficiency and total sleep time improved significantly at posttreatment in both groups and remained stable at 12-wk follow-up. More CBTI-Phone than IPC patients showed posttreatment improvements in unhelpful sleep-related cognitions (P < 0.001) and were classified as \"in remission\" from insomnia at follow-up (P < 0.05).

Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the acute effects of the imidazopyridine zolpidem on objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality in the largest of the above-mentioned groups. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, 15 patients (9 females and 6 males aged 51.1 + 11. 3 years) diagnosed as having nonorganic insomnia (ICD-10: F 51.0) related to neurotic and stress-related disorders (F 1.1:12, F 41.2:2 and F 43.2:1) were included. Objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality measures were investigated in 3 subsequent nights in the sleep laboratory (adaptation, baseline/placebo and zolpidem 10 mg night), utilizing clinical, polysomnographic, psychometric and psychophysiological methods. The drug-free patients were matched according to age and sex with 15 normal healthy controls (age 51.2 + 11.8 years). Statistical analysis of polysomnographic variables demonstrated a significant lengthening of the total sleep period (TSP) and total sleep time (TST), an improvement in sleep efficiency and a shortening of sleep latencies after zolpidem as compared with placebo. These changes were opposite to the differences between patients and controls. Concerning sleep architecture, zolpidem increased the length of S4 and S3 + S4 as compared with placebo. Subjective sleep and awakening quality and the thymopsychic variables drive, mood, affectivity and wakefulness in the morning showed no significant changes, as a significant improvement had already occurred from the adaptation to the baseline/placebo night. Noopsychic variables (attention, concentration, attention variability, numerical memory, fine motor activity, reaction time measures) showed similar findings. Moreover, subjective sleep and awakening quality, thymopsychic and noopsychic measures during baseline/placebo recordings did not differ significantly from normative data (except for fine motor activity). Psychophysiological measures did not show any significant alterations either, except for a decrease in systolic blood pressure in the evening. As compared with placebo, zolpidem induced a significant improvement in objective sleep quality, mainly by increasing TSP, TST and sleep efficiency and shortening sleep latencies, thereby normalizing the disorder of initiating and maintaining sleep. Deep sleep stages S3 + S4 increased (although at baseline/placebo these stages did not differ from controls), while S1, S2 and SREM did not change significantly. Subjective sleep and awakening quality as well as thymopsychic and noopsychic performance in the morning mainly showed a placebo and 'first- night effect' phenomenon in these patients.

Yet, sleep is more than duration alone and can be described across multiple domains, such as timing, regularity, satisfaction, alertness, and efficiency. We reviewed observational population-based studies that examined differences in age, sex, and origin across multiple dimensions of sleep. Reviewed literature suggests an increasing prevalence of insomnia symptoms, shorter and less deep sleep in old age. Overall, women report poorer sleep quality than men despite objective measures revealing shorter and more fragmented sleep in men. Minorities generally have poorer quantity and quality of sleep, but multi-ethnic studies have reported mixed results regarding the subjective experience of sleep. In sum, effects of age, sex and origin differ across sleep dimensions, thereby suggesting that the multidimensionality of sleep and how these different aspects interact should be studied across individuals. Studies should include both self-reported measures and objective assessments in diverse population-based samples, as both aspects are important to understand sleep health in the general population.

A total of 25,580 individuals (age range, 15-100 years) from the noninstitutionalized general population representative of 7 European countries (France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Finland) were interviewed by telephone using the Sleep-EVAL system. Nonrestorative sleep was analyzed in relationship to sociodemographic determinants, environmental factors, life habits, health, sleep-wake schedule, and psychological factors. The prevalence of NRS was 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 10.4%-11.2%) in the sample, was higher in women than in men (12.5% vs 9.0%; P<.001), and decreased with age. The United Kingdom (16.1%) and Germany (15.5%) had the highest prevalence of NRS and Spain (2.4%), the lowest. In multivariate analyses, several factors were positively associated with NRS. The most important were younger age, dissatisfaction with sleep, difficulty getting started in the morning, stressful life, presence of anxiety, bipolar or a depressive disorder, and having a physical disease. When compared with subjects who have difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (without NRS), subjects with NRS reported more frequently a variety of daytime impairment (irritability, physical, and mental fatigue) and consulted a physician twice as frequently for their sleeping difficulties than did other subjects with insomnia. Nonrestorative sleep is a frequent symptom in the general population, but its prevalence largely varies between countries. It is often associated with mental disorders and characteristics of sleep deprivation (such as extra sleep time on weekends).

Insomnia, internalizing disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD], generalized anxiety disorder [GAD]), and alcohol abuse or dependence (AAD) were assessed at two time points, while antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) was assessed once. Cholesky decompositions were performed in OpenMx and longitudinal measurement models were run on available phenotypes to reduce measurement error. The latent additive genetic influences on insomnia overlapped significantly (56% for females, 74% for males) with MDD and were shared completely (100%) with GAD. There was significant overlap of latent unique environmental influences, with overlap ranging from 38 to 100% across disorders. In contrast, there was less genetic overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders, with 18% of insomnia's heritability shared with AAD and 23% with ASPD. Latent unique environmental overlap between insomnia and both externalizing disorders was negligible. The evidence for substantial genetic overlap between insomnia and stable aspects of both internalizing disorders suggests that there may be few insomnia-specific genes and investigation into unique environmental factors is important for understanding insomnia development.

Sleeping difficulties associated with insomnia are often linked to chronic sleep deprivation, which has a negative health impact partly due to disruption in the internal synchronisation of biological clocks. These are regulated by clock genes and modulate most biological processes. Most studies addressing circadian rhythm regulation have focused on the role of neurons, yet glial cells also impact circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. Chronic insomnia and sleep loss have been associated with glial cell activation, exacerbated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, altered neuronal metabolism and synaptic plasticity, accelerated age-related processes and decreased lifespan. It is, therefore, essential to highlight the importance of glia-neuron interplay on sleep/circadian regulation and overall healthy brain function. Hence, in this review, we aim to address the main neurobiological mechanisms involved in neuron-glia crosstalk, with an emphasis on microglia and astrocytes, in both healthy sleep, chronic sleep deprivation and chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36804265/"}

Insomnia is a common problem, with 10-20% of the global population using sleep aids. Benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine sleep aids have the potential to cause side effects which may result in falls or other injuries. Lavender oil has anxiolytic properties that may improve sleep and reduce anxiety without the potential for adverse reaction. Silexan, an oral pill produced from lavender essential oil, has limited availability. This review sought to determine if lavender essential oil aromatherapy was as effective as Silexan to enable promotion of the use of essential oil aromatherapy in markets where Silexan is not available. This review considered both experimental and epidemiological studies that included participants 18 years and over utilizing Silexan therapy of any dose or duration compared to inhaled lavender essential oil aromatherapy. The outcomes of interest were sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep quality, disturbed sleep and anxiety. A comprehensive search strategy aimed to find relevant published and unpublished quantitative English language studies from 2010 through to February 16, 2018. Databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. A search of gray literature was also performed. No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. A comprehensive search of the literature uncovered no evidence related to the effectiveness of Silexan compared to inhaled lavender essential oil aromatherapy for sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep quality, disturbed sleep or anxiety in adult patients. Research is needed to determine if lavender essential oil aromatherapy, which is readily available worldwide, can be proven to be as effective as Silexan for improving sleep and anxiety in adult patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30439747/"}

Multiple linear regressions determined whether demographics and sleep hygiene subscales predicted sleep problems. Adolescents referred to our BSM clinic had better overall sleep hygiene than the community-based validation sample, <i>p</i> < .001. They had inadequate sleep hygiene practices related to sleep stability, behavioral arousal, and cognitive/emotional arousal. Demographics and sleep hygiene factors significantly predicted both adolescent-reported insomnia severity and caregiver-reported sleep disturbance, ps < 0.001.

Sleep disorders such as sleep movement disorders, nocturnal front lobe epilepsy, insomnia, and narcolepsy are caused due to low sleep quality. Insomnia is one such sleep disorder where a person has difficulty in getting quality sleep. There is no definitive test to identify insomnia; hence it is essential to develop an automated system to identify it accurately. A few automated methods have been proposed to identify insomnia using either polysomnogram (PSG) or electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to automatically detect insomnia using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals without combining them with any other physiological signals. In the proposed study, an optimal antisymmetric biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (ABWFB) has been used, which is designed to minimize the joint duration-bandwidth localization (JDBL) of the underlying filters. The L<sub>1</sub>-norm feature is computed from the various wavelet sub-bands coefficients of ECG signals. The L<sub>1</sub> norm features are fed to various supervised machine learning classifiers for the automated detection of insomnia. In this work, ECG recordings of seven insomnia patients and six normal subjects are used from the publicly available cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sleep database. We created ten different subsets of ECG signals based on annotations of sleep-stages, namely wake (W), S1, S2, S3, S4, rapid eye moment (REM), light sleep stage (LSS), slow-wave sleep (SWS), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and W + S1+S2+S3+S4+REM for the automated identification of insomnia. Our proposed ECG-based system obtained the highest classification accuracy of 97.87%, F1-score of 97.39%, and Cohen's kappa value of 0.9559 for K-nearest neighbour (KNN) with the ten-fold cross-validation strategy using ECG signals corresponding to the REM sleep stage. The support vector machine (SVM) yielded the highest value of 0.99 for area under the curve with the ten fold cross-validation corresponding to REM sleep stage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33631498/"}

The associations of sleep quality (good/poor) in combination with mid-range (6-8 hours), short (<6) or long (>8) sleep duration with functioning, determined from the SF-36, were evaluated using logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic, relationships, health behaviors, obesity, pain, and mental and physical illness confounders. After adjusting for gender, and age, poor sleep quality in combination with short, mid-range and long sleep was associated with worse physical, emotional and social functioning. Pain and comorbid illness explained much of these associations, while attenuation from other covariates was minor. The associations of poor sleep quality with worse functioning remained after full adjustment regardless of sleep duration, while among people with good quality sleep, only those with long sleep duration reported poorer functioning. Poor sleep quality has robust associations with worse functioning regardless of total duration in the general population.

The aim of the present study was to test the effects of zaleplon (ZAL), a new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug, on the sleep quality of MHD patients with insomnia. The sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh questionnaire in 10 patients (6 males/4 females) with insomnia on MHD; these patients underwent a randomized double-blind crossover study versus placebo (PLA). The main exclusion criterion was the presence of any possible cause of insomnia related to other concurrent diseases. Treatment with ZAL significantly improved the total score of sleep quality (p < 0.03 vs. PLA). The analysis of the single components revealed that treatment with ZAL was associated with a higher subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01 vs. PLA) and a reduced sleep latency (p < 0.01 vs. PLA). The duration of sleep was not modified by ZAL, whereas a significant improvement was detected in habitual sleep efficacy (p < 0.05 vs. PLA). No peculiar side effect was recorded on ZAL. Blood parameters did not change, nor were differences recorded in the dialysis parameters (body weight gain, blood pressure) throughout the study. This study suggests that ZAL has a positive effect on the sleep quality in MHD patients.

Laboratory studies have shown that sleep restriction is associated with an increase in sympathetic nervous activity and a decrease in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensation in beta-cell function, resulting in an impact on glucose homeostasis and an elevated risk of diabetes. Sleep curtailment is also associated with a dysregulation of the neuroendocrine control of appetite, with a reduction of the satiety factor, leptin, and an increase in hunger-promoting hormone, ghrelin.

Melatonin promotes sleep processes and, administered as a drug, it is suitable to improve primary and secondary sleep disorders in humans. Recent magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that human plasma and saliva melatonin levels are partially determined by the pineal gland volume. This study compares the pineal volume in a group of patients with primary insomnia to a group of healthy people without sleep disturbance. Pineal gland volume (PGV) was measured on the basis of high-resolution 3 Tesla MRI (T1-magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo) in 23 patients and 27 controls, matched for age, gender and educational status. Volume measurements were performed conventionally by manual delineation of the pineal borders in multi-planar reconstructed images. Pineal gland volume was significantly smaller (P < 0.001) in patients (48.9 ± 26.6 mm(3) ) than in controls (79 ± 30.2 mm(3) ). In patients PGV correlated negatively with age (r = -0.532; P = 0.026). Adjusting for the effect of age, PGV and rapid eye movement (REM) latency showed a significant positive correlation (rS  = 0.711, P < 0.001) in patients.

Eveningness seems to be negatively correlated with quality of life. The present study investigates influencing factors of this association and proposes a model for the mediating effects of sleep, sleep-related cognitions, and self-efficacy according to chronotype. The sample comprised N = 280 adolescents (172 girls) aged 14-16 yrs (mean = 15.19, SD = .76). Circadian preference, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), sleep disturbances, sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions, and general perceived self-efficacy were assessed online. Morning-orientated adolescents reported significantly higher HRQoL and less insomnia symptoms compared with evening-oriented chronotypes. In the total sample, insomnia symptoms mediated the relationship of chronotype and HRQoL. The strongest predictor of HRQoL in evening types was the degree of sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions. HRQoL in morning types was most strongly predicted by general self-efficacy, i.e., the global confidence in coping abilities. The findings support a negative relationship of eveningness and HRQoL in adolescents. Insomnia symptoms were identified to be mediating factors in this relationship. The influence of the mediating factors on HRQoL differed between morning and evening types. The model provides implications of how to enhance HRQoL in adolescents according to their circadian preference.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131114/"}

This study aimed to synthesize relevant quantitative evidence and evaluate MBSR application and effectiveness for insomnia patients' sleep quality and mental health. A systematic search through eight databases from the earliest available dates until August 2019 was conducted. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of MBSR on sleep quality, anxiety, and depression as outcome measures among insomnia patients comprising patients aged above 18 years were included in this meta-analysis. Each study's quality was assessed using the modified Jadad quality scale. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used to calculate the standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the data analyses. In total, data for 497 patients in seven randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The results revealed that compared to the control group, the MBSR group significantly improved in sleep quality (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.12~ - 0.26, Z = 3.16, p = .002), depression (SMD = -1.83, 95% CI: -2.81-0.84, Z = 3.63, p < .001), and anxiety (SMD = -1.74, 95% CI: -2.90-0.59, Z = 2.96, p = .003).

For studying the sleep characteristics, common complications and widely recognized treatment options for COMISA, Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) and Odds Ratio (OR) were applied to assess the mean and risk differences between compared groups. Outcomes included sleep health parameters and secondary impairments in physical and mental well-being. COMISA showed worse sleep quality than OSA only by PSQI (WMD = 3.38 point) and heavier sleep fragmentation (WMD = 11.46 min) than insomnia only. Besides, COMISA patients showed a higher risk for depression (OR [95%CI] = 5.03[2.31, 10.93]) and PTSD (OR [95%CI] = 3.96[1.85, 8.46]) in comparison with OSA alone.

This study was a post hoc analysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed with 60 depressed, insomniac outpatients. Patients underwent actigraphic monitoring along with sleep diaries over a continuous 2-week period. After one week of baseline monitoring, subjects spent one night in the laboratory with concurrent actigraphic and PSG monitoring with sleep diaries. Actigraphic monitoring and sleep diaries were continued for another week at home, along with initiation of open-label fluoxetine (FLX). Actigraphically recorded laboratory sleep during the night in the laboratory was found to be improved relative to actigraphically recorded sleep at home, with less wake time and greater sleep time and sleep efficiency occurring in the laboratory. In contrast, sleep diaries indicated a slight worsening of sleep in the laboratory compared to home, with significantly more awakenings in the laboratory compared to the week at home before and after the laboratory night. The differences between objective and subjective sleep measurements seen in depressed insomniacs may be influenced by the monitoring setting and measurement modality.

The aim of the study was to examine the level of insomnia, sleepiness, and fatigue in a sample of Polish nurses. <i>Methods</i>: The research was conducted among nurses employed in the Lublin region of Poland. A sample of nurses were invited to participate in a survey in which we measured insomnia, sleepiness, and fatigue using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). <i>Findings</i>: Among the 200 nurses that were surveyed, 141 (70.5%) responded. The findings indicated that a total of 47.8% of the surveyed nurses reported insomnia. Half (50.0%) exceeded the threshold for fatigue relative to the general population. Although no differences in fatigue and sleepiness were observed by level of insomnia between those who did and did not work night shift, we observed an overall correlation between insomnia (AIS) and sleepiness (ESS), as well as between insomnia (AIS) and fatigue (FSS). <i>Conclusions/Application to practice</i>: This sample of Polish nurses displayed problems with sleep quality. The consequences of insomnia and fatigue challenge occupational health workers to go beyond traditional care and standard diagnostic tests. Undertaking preventive measures aimed at reducing health hazards, and the risk of making a mistake at work due to increased sleepiness and fatigue, in nurses are warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32089121/"}

Although the mechanisms linking insomnia with these comorbidities remain unclear, age-related changes in sleep and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation might represent a shared mechanistic pathway. In this study, we assessed the relationship between ANS activity with indices of objective and subjective sleep quality in older adults with insomnia. Forty-three adults with chronic insomnia and 16 age-matched healthy sleeper controls were studied. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), objective sleep quality by electroencephalogram spectral components derived from polysomnography, and ANS activity by measuring 24-h plasma cortisol and norepinephrine (NE). Sleep cycle analysis displayed lower slow oscillatory (SO: 0.5-1.25 Hz) activity in the first cycle in insomnia compared to controls. In insomnia, 24-h cortisol levels were higher and 24-h NE levels were lower than controls. In controls, but not in insomnia, there was a significant interaction between NE level during wake and SO activity levels across the sleep cycles, such that in controls but not in insomnia, NE level during wake was positively associated with the amount of SO activity in the first cycle. In insomnia, lower 24-h NE level and SO activity in the first sleep cycle were associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. Dysregulation of autonomic activity may be an underlying mechanism that links objective and subjective measures of sleep quality in older adults with insomnia, and potentially contribute to adverse health outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33295989/"}

Self-reported typical sleep characteristics and shift work were not associated with PDAC risk. Considering the role of light at night and shift work in circadian disruption and cancer risk, it is plausible that poor sleep health among a general population may be related to cancer risk through similar sleep and circadian disrupting processes.

Fifty-two middle-aged and older insomnia sufferers and 49 matched normal sleepers underwent multiple nights of laboratory and home polysomnography (PSG) and provided concurrent subjective estimates of their sleep. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and inferential tests were used to examine the nature of sleep time perceptions, identify subgroups with distinctive patterns such as perceptions, and explore factors that may contribute to these subgroups' distinctive sleep perceptions. Consistent with previous studies, the insomnia sufferers, as a group, showed a greater tendency to underestimate the time they slept than did the normal sleepers, but the accuracy of sleep time perceptions varied widely within each sample. Correlational analyses showed that study participants in each sample showed a moderate level of consistency in how accurately they estimated sleep time across nights. Subsequent cluster analyses conducted to identify subgroups with distinctive patterns of sleep time perceptions yielded four subgroups within the insomnia sample and three subgroups within the normal sleeper sample. Although the sleep setting significantly affected sleep perceptions for one insomnia subgroup, both laboratory and home objective-subjective sleep comparisons provided similar impressions regarding the relative accuracy of each subgroup's nocturnal sleep/wake perceptions. Finally, varying patterns of subgroup differences were noted across several common psychometric measures. The underestimation of sleep time is not a generic characteristic that separates all insomnia sufferers from normal sleepers.

Although the response shifts could reflect patients' cognitive changes toward their disorders as the interventions aim to achieve, failing to differentiate them from the true change during data analyses could bias the research conclusions. Considering this issue is seldom discussed in sleep studies, this study thus examined the impacts of response-shift items in an intervention study of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) via empirical-data based simulations. We used longitudinal measurement invariance tests to identify the items in an abbreviated version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale that are non-invariant (response shifted) against CBT-I based on data from 114 insomnia patients. The partial invariance model built accordingly was then used as a population model for simulations to examine the impacts of the response-shift items on follow-up paired t-tests. Invariance tests indicate CBT-I would lift the intercept of one item in DBAS-10 and cause non-uniform calibrations in three items. The following up simulations showed that failing to exclude the intercept-lifted item from the calculations of the subscale scores would lower the probability of using paired t-test to correctly detect the treatment effect by up to 53%.

Data were analyzed according to CTT investigating data completeness, item homogeneity and unidimensionality. Polychoric based explorative factor analysis suggested unidimensionality of the SCI, and internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha, 0.91; ordinal alpha, 0.94). SCI scores correlated with the Insomnia Severity Index (-0.88) as well as with sleep quality (-0.85) and perceived stress (-0.50), supporting external construct validity.

Among patients reporting insomnia symptoms, sleep misperception occurs when self-reported sleep duration under-estimates objective measures. Misperception represents a clinical challenge since insomnia management is based entirely on patient self-report. We tested the hypothesis that misperception occurring in sleep apnea patients would improve with subsequent treatment. We compared subjective sleep-wake reports with objective sleep in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (n=405) in two nights of polysomnography (diagnostic and treatment) within a median interval of 92 days. Sleep latency was generally over-estimated, while wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings were under-estimated. None of these estimations differed between diagnostic and treatment polysomnograms. We observed a large spectrum of total sleep time misperception values during the diagnostic polysomnogram, with one third of the cohort under-estimating their total sleep time by at least 60 min. Of those with >60 minute misperception, we observed improved total sleep time perception during treatment polysomnography. Improved perception correlated with improvements in self-reported sleep quality and response confidence. We found no polysomnogram or demographic predictors of total sleep time misperception for the diagnostic polysomnogram, nor did we find objective correlates of improved perception during titration. Our results suggest that misperception may improve with treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients who also exhibit misperception. Within subject changes in misperception are consistent with misperception being, at least to some extent, a state characteristic, which has implications for management of patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24745776/"}

The study was double-blind, controlled with random allocation. Temazepam 20 mg, prepared as a liquid in a soft gelatin capsule, reduced sleep latency and prolonged total sleep time. A reduction in stage shifts to Stages I and II and a reduction in time spent in Stages 0 + I suggest more restful sleep. The sleep \"architecture\" (including REM/NREM cycling, total SWS and REM time) was relatively undisturbed.

{"id": "9358396", "title": "Psychophysiological insomnia: the behavioural model and a neurocognitive perspective.", "text": "A number of paradoxes are apparent in the assessment and treatment of psychophysiological insomnia and sleep state misperception. Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain. In the case of subjective-objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more 'sleep-like' EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset-related mesograde amnesia. As a result, the patient with insomnia maintains a level of information and/or memory processing that blurs the phenomenological distinction between sleep and wakefulness and influences retrospective judgments about sleep initiation and duration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9358396/"}

However, little is known about potentially underlying psychological mechanisms such as threat or craving. As these are associated with distinguishable brain activation patterns, we performed a functional neuroimaging study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain reactivity to sleep-related words in 20 patients with primary insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria and 35 good sleeper controls according to Research Diagnostic Criteria. In addition, an emotional Stroop task was performed in all participants outside the scanner to investigate sleep-related attentional bias. Contrary to the hypotheses, patients with chronic insomnia did not differ from good sleeper controls in terms of threat- or craving-related brain reactivity to sleep-related words. In addition, the emotional Stroop task did not reveal any significant group difference in sleep-related attentional bias. Exploratory analyses did not show any significant correlations between brain reactivity/selective attention to sleep-related words and questionnaire scores/PSG parameters. The results from the present study call into question that attentional bias to sleep-related stimuli is a core feature of chronic insomnia.

In total, 21 studies, including 14 independent samples of 1040 participants with COMISA were included. Downs and Black quality assessments were performed. A meta-analysis including nine primary studies measuring the Insomnia Severity Index indicated that CBTi is associated with a large improvement in insomnia severity (Hedges' g = -0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.35, -0.43). Subgroup meta-analyses indicated that CBTi is effective in samples with untreated obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (five studies, Hedges' g = -1.19, 95% CI -1.77, -0.61) and treated OSA (four studies, Hedges' g = -0.55, 95% CI -0.75, -0.35).

Mindfulness interventions improve sleep (ie, insomnia and daytime sleepiness) and productivity outcomes, and mobile apps provide scalable means of intervention delivery. However, few studies have examined the effects of mindfulness mobile apps on employees, and no research to date has tested the role of sleep improvement as a potential mechanism of action for productivity outcomes. This study examined the effects of Calm, a consumer-based mindfulness app, and sleep coaching, on productivity impairment among retail employees through the indirect effects of changes in insomnia and daytime sleepiness. This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial (N=1029) comparing the use of Calm (n=585, 56.9%) to a waitlist control (n=444, 43.2%) for 8 weeks among employees of a large retail employer in the United States. A subset of individuals with elevated insomnia symptoms also had access to brief sleep coaching with Calm (n=101, 9.8%). Insomnia symptom severity, daytime sleepiness, and productivity impairment (ie, absenteeism, presenteeism, overall productivity impairment, and non-work activity impairment) were assessed at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. Indirect effects were evaluated with latent growth curve modeling to test whether the Calm intervention (Calm group vs waitlist control) was effective in reducing work productivity impairment through changes in sleep disturbance. No significant main effects of Calm intervention on productivity impairment were detected for any outcome at α level of .05, with the exception of non-work activity impairment models, in which Calm intervention reduced non-work activity impairment over time (P=.01 and P=.02 for insomnia and sleepiness models, respectively). Significant indirect effects of insomnia were detected for presenteeism (P=.002), overall work productivity (P=.01), and non-work activity impairment (P=.002); Calm intervention produced significantly greater reductions in insomnia symptoms (relative to waitlist control), and decreases in insomnia were associated with decreases in work productivity impairment. There was no significant indirect effect of change in insomnia on changes in absenteeism (P=.20). Furthermore, we detected no significant indirect effects of daytime sleepiness on productivity impairment. We found that Calm (plus sleep coaching for a small subset of individuals) had beneficial effects on employee sleep, and these benefits on sleep were related to indirect effects on productivity impairment (ie, presenteeism, overall work productivity impairment, and non-work activity impairment). There were no overall main effects of Calm intervention on productivity impairment; however, insomnia appears to be a mechanism associated with benefits for employee productivity. This is one of the first studies to suggest that sleep benefits of a mindfulness mobile app may also indirectly relate to benefits for workplace productivity.

Pre-sleep cognitive arousal is the most important variable in the Gaussian network, acting as a \"bridge\" between the insomnia symptoms and hyperarousal domains, and serving as the gateway that activates most of the insomnia symptoms and hyperarousal in the DAG. Subjective sleep duration is another key driver in the DAG, marking the starting point for insomnia symptoms, while the use of sleep medication represents the endpoint of the pathway.

Twelve sleep maintenance insomniacs and 10 good sleeping postmenopausal female subjects [mean (SD) age = 65.2 (7.4) years] participated in a double-blind, crossover study in which they received a capsule containing either melatonin (5 mg) or a placebo at 1400 hours. Continuous core body temperature and hourly multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) were collected from 1100-2030 hours. Self-reported estimates of global vigor (sleepiness) and affect were collected prior to each MSLT using visual analog scales. Comparison of good and poor sleepers failed to reveal any significant differences in core body temperature, sleep latency, or subjective vigor and affect. However, for both groups combined, melatonin administration [absolute postadministration mean (SEM) = 36.9 (0.05) degrees C] significantly lowered core body temperature compared with placebo [37.1 (0.05) degrees C]. Similarly, melatonin administration significantly reduced latency to stage 1 (SOL1) and stage 2 (SOL2) [absolute postadministration mean SOL1 = 20.1 (1.7) and SOL2 = 20.7 (1.6) minutes] compared with placebo [SOL1 = 24.3 (1.2) and SOL2 = 25.2 (1.1) minutes].

Only acceptability of medications (r = 0.259) and dysfunctional beliefs (r = 0.234) scores had significant bivariate correlations with ITAS-B scores (P < .001). Medication acceptability, dysfunctional beliefs, and self-efficacy accounted for 12.45% of ITAS-B variance in linear regression. Screening for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep may identify patients with interest in behavioral approaches. Improving self-efficacy for sleep may improve acceptance of behavioral insomnia therapies. Interest in behavioral and medication treatments are not mutually exclusive. However, the modest variance reported here suggests other factors impact acceptance of behavioral treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21551399/"}

Although the LSEQ has been used in a variety of populations, published psychometric data on insomnia patients are limited. The LSEQ reliability and construct validity was evaluated in 396 French insomnia patients aged 55 years and over, who were treated with placebo (2 weeks) and melatonin (3 weeks). The results supported LSEQ internal consistency, reliability and construct validity with minor differences from those of the original English version. Then the internal consistency of the LSEQ was evaluated in 257 insomnia patients (age 20-80 years) in France and Israel who, following a 1 week placebo baseline, were randomized to placebo or melatonin treatment for 3 weeks. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's r correlation coefficients for placebo and drug treatment conditions (p<0.001 for all) supported LSEQ internal consistency in different treatment and age groups and in different languages. It is concluded that the consistency, reliability and validity of the four LSEQ domains allows them to be singled out as independent outcome variables in cross cultural sleep research and clinical practice in adult and elderly patients with insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14696019/"}

Forty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=7 per group): normal control, model control, melatonin (MT, 40 mg/kg), and 3-dose DOE (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 g/kg) groups. Rats were raised in a strong-light (10,000 LUX) and -noise (>80 db) environment (12 h/d) for 16 weeks to induce insomnia, and from week 10 to week 16, MT and DOE were correspondingly administered to rats. The behavior tests including sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep experiment, sucrose preference test, and autonomous activity test were used to evaluate changes in sleep and emotions of rats. The metabolic-related indicators such as blood pressure, blood viscosity, blood glucose, and uric acid in rats were measured. The pathological changes in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of rat brain were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. Additionally, the sleep-related factors gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (GA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, we screened potential sleep-improving receptors of DOE using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array and validated the results with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. DOE significantly improved rats' sleep and mood, increased the sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep time and sucrose preference index, and reduced autonomic activity times (P<0.05 or P<0.01). DOE also had a good effect on metabolic abnormalities, significantly reducing triglyceride, blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood viscosity indicators (P<0.05 or P<0.01). DOE significantly increased the GABA content in hippocampus and reduced the GA/GABA ratio and IL-6 level (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In addition, DOE improved the pathological changes such as the disorder of cell arrangement in the hippocampus and the decrease of Nissel bodies. Seven differential genes were screened by PCR array, and the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (Gabra5, Gabra6, Gabrq) were selected for verification. The results showed that DOE could up-regulate their expressions (P<0.05 or P<0.01). DOE demonstrated remarkable potential for improving insomnia, which may be through regulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors expressions and GA/GABA ratio.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40229628/"}

Despite the negative impact of poor sleep on mind and body, most people do not seek treatment. This study aimed to examine the strategies used to improve sleep in the general population with a particular focus on music. A survey was distributed via Facebook advertisements to Danish adults aged ≥18 years. Among 3667 responders, a representative subsample of 1195 participants was randomly selected based on age and sex. Data analysis involved chi-square tests and logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, education, and insomnia status. The results showed that nearly all participants utilised strategies to aid their sleep, with the most common strategies being 'following a routine' (73%), 'reducing caffeine in the afternoon/evening' (65%) and 'lowering the temperature in the bedroom' (62%). Individuals with insomnia utilised significantly more strategies (average 8.4 strategies) compared to those without insomnia (average 6.6 strategies). Among all participants, 20% reported using music for sleep at least 1-2 times/month, whereas 11% used music for sleep weekly, and 4.5% used music almost daily. Music users tended to be younger, and they were also more likely to have insomnia. By evaluating 24 different sleep strategies, this study shows that people do several things to promote sleep in their daily lives. These findings enhance our understanding of sleep behaviour, providing an important fundament for targeting future public health interventions to reduce the use of sleep disruptive strategies and promote strategies known to improve sleep health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39972405/"}

Like many neurologic disorders, a detailed history and physical examination are critical in the evaluation of patients with sleepiness or sleeplessness. Patients who have neurologic disorders are more likely to have poor-quality sleep. Questions about the patient's sleep schedule or screening patients for common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are useful to add to a typical neurologic evaluation to better recognize sleep disorders in this population.

However, it is yet to be determined whether this link is mediated by known cardiovascular risk factors. The current study aimed at investigating the association between primary insomnia, defined as subjectively reported sleep disturbance in the absence of any other pathology or substance intake, and alterations in polysomnographically determined nocturnal heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). A total of 4,581 nocturnal short-term electrocardiographic recordings (5 min each) from 104 participants (58 with primary insomnia, 46 healthy controls) were evaluated for HR as well as for time and frequency domain measures of HRV. In the primary insomnia group, we found a lower wake-to-sleep HR reduction and a lower standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) compared to healthy controls. However, between-group differences in resting HR were not found, and previous results of an increase in sympathovagal balance and a decrease in parasympathetic nocturnal activity in objectively determined insomnia could not be confirmed in our sample of self-report insomnia patients. When restricting our analyses to insomnia patients with objectively determined short sleep duration, we found reduced parasympathetic activity as indicated by decreased high frequency power of HRV, as well as decreased root mean square of successive RRI differences (RMSSD) and percentage of successive RRIs that differ by more than 50 ms (pNN50) values. A lower wake-to-sleep HR reduction and alterations in HRV variables might, at least partially, mediate the increased rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in insomnia patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20626615/"}

It is commonly delivered as part of multicomponent cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT-I) but has also been linked to beneficial effects as a standalone intervention. In order to quantify the efficacy of SRT we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SRT to minimally active or non-active control groups. Primary outcomes were self-reported insomnia severity and sleep diary metrics at post-treatment. Weighted effect sizes were calculated with Hedges' g and risk of bias was assessed by two independent raters with the Cochrane tool. Our search yielded eight RCTs meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Random effects models revealed large treatment effects in favour of SRT versus control for insomnia severity measured with the insomnia severity index (g = -0.93; 95% CI = -1.15, -0.71), sleep efficiency (g = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.52, 1.31), sleep onset latency (g = -0.62; 95% CI = -0.84, -0.40), and wake-time after sleep onset (g = -0.83; 95% CI = -1.11, -0.55). No effects were found for total sleep time (g = 0.02; 95% CI = -0.29, 0.34). Results should be interpreted in the context of the small number of comparisons (≤6 per outcome), high risk of bias (6 out of 8 studies met criteria for high risk), and heterogeneity in study design and SRT administration. Only a small number of studies provided outcomes at follow-up (n ≤ 3), hindering assessment of long-term effects. Sleep restriction therapy effectively improves insomnia severity and sleep continuity in the short term; more studies are needed to assess if effects are sustained at long-term follow-up (>3 m). Post-treatment effect sizes appear as large as multicomponent CBT-I. To reduce risk of bias, future studies should consider testing the effects of SRT against control groups that are matched for non-specific treatment effects. Large-scale pragmatic trials are also needed to test if SRT is effective in clinical practise and to quantify effects on daytime functioning and quality of life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"}

Randomised controlled trial of patients in urban general practice settings in Auckland, New Zealand. Adults with persistent primary insomnia and no mental health or significant comorbidity were eligible. Intervention patients received SSR instructions and sleep hygiene advice. Control patients received sleep hygiene advice alone. Primary outcomes included change in sleep quality at 6 months measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and sleep efficiency (SE%).

Outcome measures included a diagnostic interview for assessment of insomnia disorder, 3-day actigraphy and sleep diary, and serial salivary cortisol measurement. Adults with insomnia had a significantly greater cortisol awakening response (CAR) reference to increase (CARi) but a comparable CAR reference to ground and a comparable cortisol level during afternoon and evening when compared with noninsomniac adults. The association between insomnia disorder and larger CARi was also found in adolescents at late/post puberty but not in pre/early pubertal adolescents. There was an interaction effect between sex and insomnia disorder on CARi level with adult females having larger CARi than adult males. Among subjects with insomnia disorder, those with lower subjective sleep efficiency had higher cortisol levels in the late evening (10:00 pm) in both adults and adolescents. Our study suggests that a series of insomniac indices at both syndromal and symptomatic levels including clinical diagnosis and poor sleep quality are associated with dysfunction of the HPA axis.

However, the effect of alcohol on sleep in P or alcohol non-preferring (NP) rats is unknown. Since alcohol consumption has tremendous impact on sleep, the present study compared the effects of binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness in P and NP rats. Using standard surgical procedures, the P and NP rats were bilaterally implanted with sleep recording electrodes. Following post-operative recovery and habituation, pre-ethanol (baseline) sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 48 h. Subsequently, ethanol was administered beginning with a priming dose of 5 g/Kg followed by two doses of 2 g/Kg every 8 h on the first day and three doses of 3 g/Kg/8 h on the second day. On the following day (post-ethanol), undisturbed sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 24 h. Our initial results suggest that, during baseline conditions, the time spent in each of the three behavioral states: wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, was comparable between P and NP rats. However, the P rats were more susceptible to changes in sleep-wakefulness following 2 days of binge ethanol treatment. As compared to NP rats, the P rats displayed insomnia like symptoms including a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in NREM sleep coupled with a significant increase in wakefulness on post-ethanol day. Subsequent analysis revealed that binge ethanol induced increased wakefulness and reduced NREM sleep in P rats occurred mainly in the dark period. This is the first study that: (1) demonstrates spontaneous sleep-wake profile in P and NP rats, and (2) compares the effects of binge ethanol treatment on sleep in P and NP rats.

It is unknown whether this subjective-objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture 'wake-like' brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro- and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought-like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37678561/"}

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to calculate the optimal cutoff score of the ISCI on the basis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for insomnia. A total of 160 adults with a diagnosis of stroke for more than 3 months were included (median age of 58.5 years, 31% met the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia). The ISCI had a satisfactory Cronbach's alpha of 0.89 and test-retest reliability of 0.78. The CFA revealed that the ISCI exhibited a satisfactory model fit and was associated with the ISI-INA, IGAD-7, and IPHQ-9 (r = -0.81, -0.32, and -0.52, respectively; all P < .001). The ROC test revealed that the optimal cutoff point of ≤23 yielded the highest sensitivity (94%) and specificity (97%). The study results revealed that the 8-item ISCI is a reliable and valid screening tool for detecting insomnia symptoms according to the DSM-5 criteria in the chronic period after stroke.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36854859/"}
{"id": "39289841", "title": "Profiling the sleep architecture of ageing adults using a seven-state continuous-time Markov model.", "text": "Sleep is a complex biological process regulated by networks of neurons and environmental factors. As one falls asleep, neurotransmitters from sleep-wake regulating neurones work in synergy to control the switching of different sleep states throughout the night. As sleep disorders or underlying neuropathology can manifest as irregular switching, analysing these patterns is crucial in sleep medicine and neuroscience. While hypnograms represent the switching of sleep states well, current analyses of hypnograms often rely on oversimplified temporal descriptive statistics (TDS, e.g., total time spent in a sleep state), which miss the opportunity to study the sleep state switching by overlooking the complex structures of hypnograms. In this paper, we propose analysing sleep hypnograms using a seven-state continuous-time Markov model (CTMM). This proposed model leverages the CTMM to depict the time-varying sleep-state transitions, and probes three types of insomnia by distinguishing three types of wake states. Fitting the proposed model to data from 2056 ageing adults in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study, we profiled sleep architectures in this population and identified the various associations between the sleep state transitions and demographic factors and subjective sleep questions. Ageing, sex, and race all show distinctive patterns of sleep state transitions. Furthermore, we also found that the perception of insomnia and restless sleep are significantly associated with critical transitions in the sleep architecture. By incorporating three wake states in a continuous-time Markov model, our proposed method reveals interesting insights into the relationships between objective hypnogram data and subjective sleep quality assessments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39289841/"}

A comprehensive set of sleep architecture features previously associated with hyperarousal were retrospectively analysed focusing on sleep-wake transition probabilities, electroencephalographic spectra and sleep spindles, and enriched with a novel machine learning algorithm called the Wake Electroencephalographic Similarity Index. This analysis included 1710 individuals with insomnia and 1455 individuals without insomnia. Results indicate that individuals with insomnia had a higher likelihood of waking from all sleep stages, and showed increased relative alpha during Wake and N1 sleep and increased theta power during Wake when compared with individuals without insomnia. Relative delta power was decreased and Wake Electroencephalographic Similarity Index scores were elevated across all sleep stages except N3, suggesting more wake-like activity during these stages in individuals with insomnia. Additionally, sleep spindle density was decreased, and spindle dispersion was increased in individuals with insomnia. These findings suggest that insomnia is characterized by a dysfunction in sleep quality with a continuous hyperarousal, evidenced by changes in sleep-wake architecture.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38853521/"}

By follow-up, however, TST increases by almost 1 hour on average. A secondary analysis was undertaken to assess what percentage of participants meet or appreciably exceed baseline TST after cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial assessing acute and maintenance therapies for chronic insomnia (n = 80). The present analyses assessed the percentage of participants that 1) reached (≥ 0 minute increase) and 2) appreciably exceeded (≥ 30 minutes increase) baseline TST as assessed via daily sleep diaries at posttreatment and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following treatment. By the end of acute treatment, 45% of participants reached or exceeded baseline TST. By 24 months follow-up, this percentage had increased to 86%. Only 17% of participants achieved a 30-minute increase in TST by the end of acute treatment, and this proportion only increased to 58% over time. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in its current form does not appreciably increase self-reported TST in a significant proportion of patients with insomnia. Whether participants would benefit from further increases in TST warrants investigation. The further titration of sleep opportunity may be useful to accelerate increases in TST, to extend the effect to a larger subset of patients, and/or to increase the magnitude of the TST gain.

Group-based administration has demonstrated impressive potential for a brief and inexpensive answer to the effective treatment of insomnia in the older population. It is important to identify potential predictors of response to such a treatment format to guide clinicians when selecting the most suitable treatment for their patients. The aim of our study was to identify factors that predict subjective sleep quality of older adults following group-based administration of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Eighty-six adults (41 men; mean age, 64.10 y; standard deviation [SD], 6.80) with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening insomnia were selected from a community-based sample to participate in a 4-week group-based treatment program of CBT-I. Participants were required to complete 7-day sleep diaries and a comprehensive battery of questionnaires related to sleep quality and daytime functioning. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to identify factors predicting subjective sleep quality immediately following treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Sleep diaries reported average nightly sleep efficiency (SE), which was used as the outcome measure of sleep quality. Participants with the greatest SE following treatment while controlling for pretreatment SE were relatively younger and had more confidence in their ability to sleep at pretreatment.

This study compared the effects of a trauma-focused and a non-trauma-focused psychotherapy on sleep, to investigate whether 1) sleep improves with psychotherapy for PTSD; 2) the degree of sleep improvement depends on whether the intervention is trauma or nontrauma-focused; 3) the memory-updating procedure in cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) is associated with sleep improvements; 4) initial sleep duration affects PTSD treatment outcome; and 5) which symptom changes are associated with sleep duration improvements. Self-reported sleep was assessed during a randomized controlled trial (Ehlers et al., 2014) comparing CT-PTSD (delivered weekly or intensively over 7-days) with emotion-focused supportive therapy, and a waitlist. Sleep duration was reported daily in sleep diaries during intensive CT-PTSD. CT-PTSD led to greater increases in sleep duration (55.2 min) and reductions in insomnia symptoms and nightmares than supportive therapy and the waitlist. In intensive CT-PTSD, sleep duration improved within 7 days, and sleep diaries indicated a 40-min sleep duration increase after updating trauma memories. Initial sleep duration was not related to CT-PTSD treatment outcome when initial PTSD symptom severity was controlled.

We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence sleep prediction model and to find factors associated with good sleep using a wrist-worn actigraphy device. We enrolled 109 participants who reported having no sleep disturbances. We developed a sleep prediction model using 733 days of actigraphy data of physical activity and light exposure. Twenty-four sleep prediction models were developed based on different data sources (actigraphy alone, sleep diary alone, or combined data), different durations of data (1 or 2 days), and different analysis methods (extreme gradient boosting, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, logistic regression analysis). The outcome measure of \"good sleep\" was defined as ≥ 90% sleep efficiency. Actigraphy model performance was comparable to sleep diary model performance. Two-day models generally performed better than 1-day models. Among all models, the 2-day, combined (actigraphy and sleep diary), extreme gradient boosting model had the best performance for predicting good sleep (accuracy = 0.69, area under the curve = 0.70).

In this article, we provide a narrative review of the literature on sleep disturbance and CM, highlighting recent advances in sleep research and insights into mechanisms that could mediate a role of sleep disturbances in migraine chronification. We discuss the potential for cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (CBTi) as an intervention for CM with comorbid insomnia. Finally, we propose a model of the mechanisms underlying the interactions among sleep physiology, maladaptive migraine-coping behaviors, and coexisting factors which contribute to sleep disturbances in CM based on conceptual models used in sleep research. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint among patients with CM. CM patients experience more frequent and severe insomnia symptoms than patients with episodic migraine (EM). It has been suggested that sleep disturbances may predispose individuals to migraine attacks, which may affect the pain-processing trigeminovascular system and thus play a role in migraine progression. Encouraging but limited evidence suggests that management of insomnia via behavioral sleep therapy may reverse CM to EM and possibly prevent migraine chronification. Migraine has a complex relationship with sleep. The use of objective sleep study such as polysomnographic microstructural sleep analysis and actigraphy could help connect sleep disturbances and processes related to CM.

Although subjective complaints are severe, polysomnography (PSG) parameters show only modest differences between groups. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as the most aroused sleep state may be especially vulnerable to be perceived as wake. To directly assess possible differences, we determined auditory waking thresholds and sleep perception in patients with ID and healthy control participants (good sleeper controls [GSC]) in N2 and REM sleep. In case-control study, 27 patients with ID and 27 age- and gender-matched controls were included. Four consecutive nights were assessed in the sleep laboratory, with nights 3 and 4 each containing three awakenings either from stable N2 or REM sleep. Awakening thresholds in patients with ID did not differ from GSC, but decreased over the course of the night. Patients with ID indicated significantly more frequently than GSC having been awake when woken from REM sleep but not from N2 and were less sure when indicating they had been asleep. Additionally, participants with ID rated their REM sleep mentation as more emotionally negative compared with GSC.

Five studies modeled a single trajectory, and the other 12 studies identified two to four distinct trajectories. The pooled prevalence of nonoptimal sleep quality and duration trajectories was 36% and 22%, respectively. The mean prevalence of the nonoptimal sleep efficiency trajectory was 15%, while the prevalence of delayed bedtime, late wake-up time, and clinical insomnia trajectories was reported as 51%, 17%, and 13%, respectively.

Sleep quality judgments were most influenced by factors that occur during sleep, followed by feelings and activities upon waking and the day after. There was a significant interaction between wake after sleep onset and feeling refreshed (upon waking) and between feeling refreshed (upon waking) and question type (better or worse night of sleep). Type of sleeper (good vs poor sleepers) did not significantly influence the judgments.

{"id": "31451704", "title": "Rice bran extract supplement improves sleep efficiency and sleep onset in adults with sleep disturbance: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, polysomnographic study.", "text": "We previously reported that rice bran extract supplement (RBS) administration to mice decreased sleep latency and induced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep via inhibition of the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor. Based on this, we performed the first clinical trial to investigate whether RBS would be beneficial to subjects with disturbed sleep. We performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-week study. Fifty subjects with sleep disturbance were enrolled and received either RBS (1,000 mg/day) or placebo. Polysomnography was performed, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Fatigue Severity Scale were administered at the initiation and termination of the study. Compared with the placebo, RBS led to significant polysomnographic changes, including decreased sleep latency (adjusted, P = 0.047), increased total sleep time (P = 0.019), and improved sleep efficiency (P = 0.010). Additionally, the amount of stage 2 sleep significantly increased in the RBS group. When adjusted for caffeine intake, wakefulness after sleep onset, total wake time, and delta activity tended to decrease in the RBS group. RBS administration decreased ESS scores. There were no reported serious adverse events in both groups. RBS improved sleep in adults with sleep disturbance.
