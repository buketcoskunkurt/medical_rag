This review highlights sleep's instrumental biological functions, various sleep problems, and sleep hygiene and lifestyle interventions that can help improve sleep quality. Quality sleep allows for improved cardiovascular health, mental health, cognition, memory consolidation, immunity, reproductive health, and hormone regulation. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders, or disrupted sleep from lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, or other medical issues can lead to significant morbidity and can contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The best treatment for long-term sleep improvement is proper sleep hygiene through behavior and sleep habit modification. Recommendations to improve sleep include achieving 7 to 9Â h of sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep/wake schedule, a regular bedtime routine, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting a contemplative practice. In addition, avoiding many substances late in the day can help improve sleep. Caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and light exposure later in the day are associated with fragmented poor-quality sleep. These sleep hygiene practices can promote better quality and duration of sleep, with corresponding health benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36841492/"}
{"id": "35506356", "title": "Sleep, insomnia and mental health.", "text": "While sleep serves important regulatory functions for mental health, sleep disturbances, in particular insomnia, may favour a state of allostatic overload impairing brain neuroplasticity and stress immune pathways, hence contributing to mental disorders. In this framework, the aim of this work was to link current understanding about insomnia mechanisms with current knowledge about mental health dysregulatory mechanisms. The focus of the present work was on mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, which represent important challenges in clinical practice. Literature searches were conducted on clinical, neurobiological, and therapeutic implications for insomnia comorbid with these mental disorders. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. Insomnia may play an important role as a risk factor, a comorbid condition and transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders including mood/anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Insomnia may also play a role as a marker of disrupted neuroplasticity contributing to dysregulation of different neurobiological mechanisms involved in these different mental conditions. In this framework, insomnia treatment may not only foster normal sleep processes but also the stress system, neuroinflammation and brain plasticity. Insomnia treatment may play an important preventive and neuroprotective role with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia being the treatment with important new evidence of efficacy for insomnia, psychopathology, and indices of disrupted neuroplasticity. On the other hand, pharmacological pathways for insomnia treatment in these mental conditions are still not well defined. Therapeutic options acting on melatonergic systems and new therapeutic options acting on orexinergic systems may represents interesting pathways of interventions that may open new windows on insomnia treatment in mental disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35506356/"}

The introduction of polysomnography into psychiatric research confirmed a disturbance of sleep continuity in patients with depression, revealing not only a decrease in Slow Wave Sleep, but also a disinhibition of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, demonstrated as a shortening of REM latency, an increase of REM density, as well as total REM sleep time. Initial hopes that these abnormalities of REM sleep may serve as differential-diagnostic markers for subtypes of depression were not fulfilled. Almost all antidepressant agents suppress REM sleep and a time-and-dose-response relationship between total REM sleep suppression and therapeutic response to treatment seemed apparent. The so-called Cholinergic REM Induction Test revealed that REM sleep abnormalities can be mimicked by administration of cholinomimetic agents. Another important research avenue is the study of chrono-medical timing of sleep deprivation and light exposure for their positive effects on mood in depression. Present day research takes the view on insomnia, i.e., prolonged sleep latency, problems to maintain sleep, and early morning awakening, as a transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders, being most closely related to depression. Studying insomnia from different angles as a transdiagnostic phenotype has opened many new perspectives for research into mechanisms but also for clinical practice. Thus, the question is: can the early and adequate treatment of insomnia prevent depression? This article will link current understanding about sleep regulatory mechanisms with knowledge about changes in physiology due to depression. The review aims to draw the attention to current and future strategies in research and clinical practice to the benefits of sleep and depression therapeutics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31071719/"}

Treating insomnia has been shown to improve outcomes, including reduced risk of developing cardiovascular and mental health disorders. Insomnia is influenced by the brain's regulation of sleep and wake, which are mutually exclusive events. Insomnia should be treated as a distinct condition, even when occurring with a comorbid diagnosis such as depression or anxiety. Clinicians should implement a multimodal approach to insomnia management, including nonpharmacologic interventions and pharmacologic therapy (when indicated). Pharmacologic agents that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon), low-dose doxepin (tricyclic antidepressant), ramelteon (melatonin receptor agonist), and dual orexin receptor agonists (DORAs, daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant). Unlike other pharmacologic agents, DORAs inhibit wakefulness rather than induce sedation. Additionally, these medications have no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal, and little to no abuse potential. Daridorexant is the newest DORA, has an ideal half-life of 8 hours, and has demonstrated continued efficacy over a 12-month period. Selection of pharmacologic agent should be based on the patient's comorbid conditions, treatment goals and preferences, and other clinical characteristics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37549414/"}

Recent studies support the notion that metabolic processes correlate with sleep. The study of metabolite biomarkers (metabolomics) in a large-scale manner offers unique opportunities to provide insights into the pathology of diseases by revealing alterations in metabolic pathways. This review aims to summarize the status of metabolomic analyses-based knowledge on sleep disorders and to present knowledge in understanding the metabolic role of sleep in psychiatric disorders. Overall, findings suggest that sleep-wake disorders lead to pronounced alterations in specific metabolic pathways, which might contribute to the association of sleep disorders with other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. These alterations are mainly related to changes in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. In insomnia, alterations in branched-chain amino acid and glucose metabolism were shown among studies. In obstructive sleep apnea, biomarkers related to lipid metabolism seem to be of special importance. Future studies are needed to examine severity, subtypes and treatment of sleep-wake disorders in the context of metabolite levels.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33008070/"}

However, some recommendations claim that only hypnotics have been proven effective in the treatment of sleep initiation and maintenance disorders. The aim of this article is to compare the effect of hypnotics and trazodone on sleep, and to analyse the evidence for the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. Three studies investigated the effects of trazodone on sleep in primary insomnia, 5 studies on insomnia in the course of affective disorders and 6 studies on insomnia in other indications (PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol and opiate dependence, somatoform disorder, and insomnia during pregnancy). In the treatment of insomnia, trazodone is less effective than hypnotics in the treatment of sleep onset insomnia (i.e., disorders of falling asleep). For this indication it needs to be administered earlier than hypnotics, at least 1 hour before bedtime. It is, however, very effective in the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, especially in patients with comorbid mental disorders or patients treated with activating antidepressants. Hypnotics and trazodone have the opposite effect on deep sleep. Trazodone increases the duration of deep sleep, which is associated with better sleep quality as assessed by patients. In contrast, hypnotics decrease slow-wave activityin sleep EEG, which is the biomarker of deep sleep. The main mechanism through which trazodone promotes sleep is its antagonistic effect on 5-HT2 serotonin receptors, while hypnotics are agonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAA receptors, and other sedative antidepressants block H1 histamine receptors. This is associated with a low risk of weight gain, which is rare with trazodone treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994734/"}
{"id": "32790576", "title": "Brain mechanisms of insomnia: new perspectives on causes and consequences.", "text": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32790576/"}

Insomnia disorder is associated with depression and other psychiatric disorders, and is an independent risk factor for suicidality and substance use in adolescents, raising the possibility that treating insomnia symptoms in early adolescence may reduce risk for these adverse outcomes.

This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of Ashwagandha root extract on sleep in healthy subjects and also in the subjects having insomnia. We performed a randomized, parallel-group, stratified design, placebo-controlled study. A total of 80 eligible participants, 40 in Arm-A (healthy) and 40 in Arm-B (insomnia) were assigned to two groups, either Ashwagandha or placebo and studied for 8-weeks. The assessment was done based on the sleep parameters (Sleep Onset Latency, Total Sleep Time, Wake After Sleep Onset, Total time in bed, and Sleep Efficiency), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Hamilton Anxiety scale-A questionnaire, mental alertness on rising assessment, and sleep quality questionnaire. Safety and adverse events along with the concomitant medication were also assessed. In both healthy and insomnia subjects, there was a significant improvement in the sleep parameters in the Ashwagandha root extract supplemented group. The improvement was found more significant in insomnia subjects than healthy subjects. Repeat measure Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed the significant improvement in SOL (p 0.013), HAM-A outcomes (pÂ <Â 0.05), mental alertness (p 0.01), and sleep quality (pÂ <Â 0.05) of the insomnia patients. A two-way ANOVA was used to confirm the outcomes that denoted sleep onset latency (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and sleep efficiency (pÂ <Â 0.0001) as the most improved parameters, followed by TST (pÂ <Â 0.002) and WASO(pÂ <Â 0.040).

Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga groups with control groups in women with sleep problems were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined. Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMDâ=â-â0.327, 95% CIâ=â-â0.506 to -â0.148, Pâ<â0.001).

Participants were 959 individuals selected from the community for an epidemiological study of insomnia (Community sample) and 183 individuals evaluated for insomnia treatment and 62 controls without insomnia (Clinical sample). They completed the ISI and several measures of sleep quality, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and quality of life; those in the Clinical sample also completed sleep diaries, polysomnography, and interviews to validate their insomnia/good sleep status and assess treatment response. In addition to standard psychometric indices of reliability and validity, item response theory analyses were computed to examine ISI item response patterns. Receiver operating curves were used to derive optimal cutoff scores for case identification and to quantify the minimally important changes in relation to global improvement ratings obtained by an independent assessor. ISI internal consistency was excellent for both samples (Cronbach Î± of 0.90 and 0.91). Item response analyses revealed adequate discriminatory capacity for 5 of the 7 items. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between total ISI score and measures of fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and depression.

Outcomes were assessed at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size estimates. During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. 42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures.

However, these findings have not been consistent across studies. We review recent evidence for the association between insomnia, short sleep, and weight gain, as well as the relationship between behavioral and pharmacological treatments for sleep and weight. The relationship between insomnia and obesity is mixed, with stronger associations between insomnia with short sleep and obesity than other presentations of insomnia. Short sleep is associated with weight gain. Z-drugs and benzodiazapines do not appear to impact weight, but many antidepressants and antipsychotics that are used for insomnia treatment do cause weight gain. The relationships between insomnia and short sleep with weight gain and obesity are inconsistent. More prospective trials are needed to identify mediators and moderators of this relationship to better develop and deliver effective interventions for both sleep and weight problems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38776004/"}

Subjective sleep was assessed via 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries (use of medication was covaried in all analyses); although there were no statistically significant group differences detected, all groups improved from baseline to posttreatment on subjective sleep efficiency (SE) and total wake time (TWT) and the effect sizes were large. Objective sleep was assessed via overnight polysomnographic monitoring at baseline and posttreatment; analyses revealed both CBT groups improved on TWT (p = .03), but the AD + SH group worsened. There was no statistically significant effect for PSG SE (p = .07). There was a between groups medium effect observed for the AD + SH and CBT + placebo group differences on diary TWT and both PSG variables.

This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported.

While these approaches have been invaluable for identifying insomnia susceptibility genes and mapping the neural networks that underpin sleep-wake regulation, they fail to capture concurrently several of the core clinical diagnostic features of insomnia disorder in humans, where sleep continuity disturbance is self-perpetuating, occurs despite adequate sleep opportunity, and is often not accompanied by significant changes in sleep duration or architecture. In the present review, we discuss these issues and then outline ways animal models can be used to develop approaches that are more ecologically valid in their recapitulation of chronic insomnia's natural aetiology and pathophysiology.

Objective findings derived from polysomnography frequently show much less severe differences to good sleepers than subjective sleep complaints assessed by self-rating questionnaires. However, using more fine-grained methods to characterize the electrophysiology of sleep in insomnia, rather distinct differences between the sleep of good sleepers and patients with insomnia have been noted. These methods include the spectral analysis of the sleep EEG, micro-arousal and CAP (cyclic alternating pattern) analysis as well as the assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) during night-sleep.

Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290199/"}

Perception of wakefulness following serial awakenings from NREM sleep was frequent in both patients and controls, with no significant group difference. High frequency spectral power, as an index of cortical arousal prior to awakening, but not standard measures of sleep, predicted the perception of wakefulness across groups, possibly related to physiological wake-like activity during sleep. Our results support the notion that sleep-wake regulatory systems and direct sleep-wake perception are often intact in patients with insomnia disorder. These results propose empirical support for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia as the first-line treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40473645/"}

Sleep is involved in emotion regulation both in the general population and individuals with various mental disorders. Several studies found that pre-sleep emotional activation of negative and positive emotions disturbs sleep by enhancing emotional excitement. On the other hand, many studies showed that poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation adversely affects the emotional functioning in adults. The results of the studies summarized in this review show that emotional regulation can mediate the effect of insomnia on various psychiatric disorders. Insomnia can be a significant risk factor that should be targeted in various psychiatric disorders.

The literature underlines the close association between impaired sleep quality and difficulties in regulating emotions. Impaired sleep quality is also associated with reduced positive affect and increased negative affect, but little evidence supports a bi-directional association between affective states and sleep. Affect variability in relation to sleep has been less investigated. Initial evidence suggests that high variability in positive affect has a negative impact on sleep. Neurobiological and behavioural evidence indicates that insomnia disorder is associated with emotion dysregulation, negative affect, and a distinct daily profile of affective states.

The low-frequency, high-amplitude slow waves that dominate the electroencephalogram (EEG) during SWS can be quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA). SWS and SWA are regulated very accurately in response to variations in the duration and intensity of wakefulness and sleep. SWA declines more or less independently of circadian phase during the course of a sleep episode, indicating that it is primarily under homeostatic rather than circadian control. An age-related decline in SWS and SWA is well established. In some studies, apprehension, depression and insomnia have been associated with reductions in SWS and SWA. Experimental reductions of SWS through SWS deprivation (without altering total sleep time or REM duration) have been reported to lead to an increase in daytime sleep propensity and reductions in performance. SWS and SWA are therefore thought to contribute to the recovery processes that occur during sleep. Most currently prescribed hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, suppress SWA. Some compounds have been shown to enhance SWS and SWA in healthy volunteers through GAT-1 inhibition, GABA-A modulation, GABA-B modulation, and 5HT2(A) antagonism.

Nonpharmacologic management strategies (e.g., stimulus control, relaxation therapy, sleep hygiene) are therapeutic options that, compared with medication use, provide more sustained effects.

A new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, zaleplon, was very recently approved in the United States. Because of its short half-life, zaleplon will be useful in patients experiencing difficulty in falling asleep and in those who wake up at night and have trouble falling back to sleep. Antidepressants, antihistamines, and alternative medications are other treatment options. To avoid complications of therapy, hypnotic agents should be used at their lowest possible doses and for limited treatment durations.

We recorded electrocardiography, posture, and actigraphy in 33 people without sleep complaints and 158 patients with mild to severe insomnia over 4 d in their home environment.

At the microscale, an increase in HR was often detectable already 60 s prior to as well as following a nocturnal chest, but not wrist, movement. This increase was slightly steeper in insomnia and was associated with insomnia severity, but future EEG recordings are necessary to elucidate whether these changes occur prior to or simultaneously with PSG-indicators of wakefulness.

Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co-morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37537965/"}

This study aimed to determine which modifiable factors, beyond stress, were associated with acute insomnia during a major crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. A global online survey assessed sleep/circadian, stress, mental health, and lifestyle factors between April-May 2020. Logistic regression models analyzed data from 1319 participants (578 acute insomnia, 731 good sleepers), adjusted for demographic differences. Perceived stress was a significant predictor of acute insomnia during the pandemic (OR 1.23, 95% CI1.19-1.27). After adjusting for stress, individuals who altered their sleep-wake patterns (OR 3.36, CI 2.00-5.67) or increased technology use before bed (OR 3.13, CI 1.13-8.65) were at increased risk of acute insomnia. Other sleep factors associated with acute insomnia included changes in dreams/nightmares (OR 2.08, CI 1.32-3.27), increased sleep effort (OR 1.99, CI1.71-2.31) and cognitive pre-sleep arousal (OR 1.18, CI 1.11-1.24). For pandemic factors, worry about contracting COVID-19 (OR 3.08, CI 1.18-8.07) and stringent government COVID-19 restrictions (OR 1.12, CIÂ =1.07-1.18) were associated with acute insomnia. Anxiety (OR 1.02, CI 1.01-1.05) and depressive (OR 1.29, CI 1.22-1.37) symptoms were also risk factors. A final hierarchical regression model revealed that after accounting for stress, altered sleep-wake patterns were a key behavioral predictor of acute insomnia (OR 2.60, CI 1.68-5.81).

Because conditions of sleep loss, which include reduced sleep duration and insomnia, are constant alterations in mood disorders, the aim of this paper was to review the literature on their potential role in the pathogenesis of mood disorders and to propose a novel theoretical model. According to this hypothesis, sleep should be considered the main regulator of several systems and processes whose dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. The model may help explain why sleep disturbances are so strikingly linked to mood disorders, and underscores the need to evaluate, assess and target sleep disturbances in clinical practice, as a priority, in order to prevent and treat mood disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968511/"}

Sleep perception was calculated as self-reported total sleep time/objective total sleep time. The underestimation of sleep duration group was defined based on sleep perception less than the median of the overall sample (85%). Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess the severity of insomnia. The total scores of Insomnia Severity Index decreased significantly after CBT-I in both groups with and without underestimation of sleep duration. Compared to pretreatment, self-reported sleep efficiency increased and total wake time decreased after CBT-I, while the magnitude of changes in sleep efficiency (<i>d</i> = 1.40 vs <i>d</i>=0.81, interaction <i>P</i> = .016) and total wake time (<i>d</i> = -1.82 vs <i>d</i> = -0.85, interaction <i>P</i> < .001) were larger in the underestimation of sleep duration group .

Insomnia appears as an imbalance between the systems that maintain the waking state and those that are in charge of activating sleep generating systems.

Rather than a shortage of sleep, childhood insomnia takes the form of a lack of matching between the child s own rhythm or need to sleep and his or her family or social environment. Insomnia is most frequently caused by environmental, behavioural and psychological factors. A correct diagnosis of childhood insomnia has to be based on determining a procedure to differentiate it from parasomnias or motor disorders affecting waking and sleep.

Globally, large surveys and tightly controlled sleep deprivation or manipulation experiments provide good evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between sleep and subclinical psychotic experiences. The evidence for cause-and-effect using a interventionist-causal model is more ambiguous; it would appear treating insomnia improves psychotic experiences in an insomnia cohort but not in a cohort with schizophrenia.

A two-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted, including depression outpatients with insomnia (<i>n</i>â=â112) in a 1:1 ratio to music intervention and waitlist control group. The intervention group listened to music at bedtime for 4 weeks. Participants received treatment as usual during 8 weeks with assessments at baseline, at 4 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), secondary outcomes comprised Actigraphy, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and World Health Organisation well-being questionnaires (WHO-5, WHOQOL-BREF). The music intervention group experienced significant improvements in sleep quality and well-being at 4 weeks according to global PSQI scores (effect sizeâ=â-2.1, 95%CI -3.3; -0.9) and WHO-5 scores (effect size 8.4, 95%CI 2.7;14.0). At 8 weeks, i.e. 4 weeks after termination of the music intervention, the improvement in global PSQI scores had decreased (effect sizeâ=â-0.1, 95%CI -1.3; 1.1). Actigraphy sleep assessments showed no changes and there was no detection of change in depression symptoms. Music intervention is suggested as a safe and moderately effective sleep aid in depression-related insomnia. <b>Trial registration:</b> Clinicaltrials.gov.

We demonstrate the socio-ecologial impact of sleep health with findings on gender and couples' relationships as exemplars. Robust gender differences in sleep duration and insomnia are due to biological and socio-ecological factors. Gender differences in insufficient sleep vary by country of origin and age whereas gender differences in insomnia reflect minoritized identities (e.g., sexual, gender). Co-sleeping with a partner is associated with longer sleep and more awakenings. Gender differences and couples' sleep were affected by intersecting social and societal influences, which supports a socio-ecological approach to sleep. Recent and seminal contributions to sleep health highlight the importance of observing individual sleep outcomes in a socio-ecological context. Novel methodology, such as global measures of sleep health, can inform efforts to improve sleep and, ultimately, public health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36401678/"}

The present review considers the influence of sleep disturbance on the neurovascular unit; the role of sleep disturbance in neurodegenerative diseases; and relevant strategies of neuro-immuno-endocrine interactions that likely contribute to the restorative power of sleep. Given the latest discoveries about the brain's waste clearance system and its relationship to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, this review gives a brief overview on the molecular mechanisms behind sleep loss-related impairments. Recent evidence indicates that sleep plays a vital role in neuro-immuno-endocrine homeostasis. Sleep loss has been linked to elevated risks for cognitive and mood disorders, underscored by impaired synaptic transmission. The glymphatic system has been shown to be modulated by sleep and implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Interactions between sleep quality, the immune system, and neurodegenerative disease are complex and a challenge to distil. These interactions are frequently bidirectional, because of sleep's characterization as an early symptom and as a potential factor contributing to the development and progression of mood and cognitive disorders.

For this reason, research is needed to identify modifiable individual difference variables that may contribute to better sleep in this population. Temperament and sleep hygiene may be two such factors. As part of a larger study, 167 university students (61.7% female) completed online questionnaires that inquired about temperament (the Adult Temperament Questionnaire; ATQ), sleep hygiene behavior (the Sleep Hygiene Index; SHI), global sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI), and insomnia severity (the Insomnia Severity Index; ISI). Correlations amongst the included measures were in the predicted direction: effortful control was negatively associated with the SHI composite, PSQI global scores, and ISI scores; extraversion was negatively related to PSQI global scores; and negative affect was positively associated with the SHI composite and ISI scores. In addition, the SHI composite mediated the association between effortful control and the PSQI global scores as well as the association between negative affect and PSQI global scores; similar patterns of mediation were found when considering ISI scores, although the direct effects differed. That is, negative affect was directly associated with ISI scores but not PSQI global scores. These findings suggest that interventions designed enhance effortful control, reduce negative affect, and improve sleep hygiene may contribute to better global sleep quality and decrease insomnia in university students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34264959/"}

However, most individuals with transient insomnia do not develop chronic insomnia. The current study investigated the differential contributing factors for these two conditions to further the understanding of this phenomenon. Chronic insomnia patients and normal sleepers with high and low vulnerability to transient insomnia completed measures of pre-sleep arousal, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, and sleep-related safety behaviors. Both cognitive and somatic pre-sleep arousals were identified as significant predictors for transient insomnia. Dysfunctional beliefs regarding worry about insomnia and cognitive arousal were predictors for chronic insomnia. Sleep-related safety behavior, although correlated with insomnia severity, was not a significant predictor for both conditions. Dysfunctional beliefs associated with worry and losing control over sleep are the most critical factors in differentiating chronic insomnia from transient insomnia.

As such, an effective non-drug alternative could prove important in the management of age-related sleep maintenance insomnia. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of bright light exposure in the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Following baseline sleep and circadian rhythms assessment, subjects with sleep-maintenance insomnia were treated with timed exposure to either bright white light or dim red light for 12 consecutive days. Sleep and circadian rhythms recordings were subsequently obtained and measures of sleep quality were compared to assess efficacy of the treatments. Baseline and post-treatment sleep and circadian rhythms assessments took place in the Laboratory of Human Chronobiology, Department of Psychiatry, Cornell University Medical College. The treatment phase of the study was conducted in participants' homes. Sixteen men and women between the ages of 62 and 81 years were studied. All subjects were free of hypnotic medication, and all had experienced sleep disturbance for at least 1 year prior to entering the study. Exposure to bright light resulted in substantial changes in sleep quality. Waking time within sleep was reduced by an hour, and sleep efficiency improved from 77.5% to 90%, without altering time spent in bed. Increased sleep time was in the form of Stage 2 sleep, REM sleep, and slow wave sleep. The effects were remarkably consistent across subjects. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of timed exposure to bright light in the treatment of age-related sleep maintenance insomnia.

Various diagnostic systems emphasize the chronic nature of insomnia and its impact on daily functioning, relying heavily on patient self-reporting due to limitations in objective measures such as polysomnography (PSG). Discrepancies between subjective experiences and objective PSG results highlight the need for more nuanced approaches, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis, which reveals distinct patterns of high-frequency activity in individuals with insomnia. This study explores EEG markers of insomnia by integrating subjective reports with objective physiological markers, specifically ORP (Odds-Ratio-Product) and spectral features, to address inconsistencies found in previous research and clinical settings. Qualitative and quantitative definitions of insomnia are contrasted to highlight differences in sleep architecture and EEG characteristics. The research aims to determine whether groups defined by weekly frequency and daily duration of symptoms have different distribution patterns and which physiological characteristics best distinguish insomnia patients from controls. Our findings suggest that ORP, as a dependent variable, captures the most significant differences in the independent variables across the model.

Sixty-eight subjects with insomnia disorder (DSM-5) and 36 good sleepers were evaluated using: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Daytime Insomnia Symptom Response Scale (DISRS), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).

The aim of this study was to estimate meaningful within-patient change for sTST using clinical trial data. Data were from an open-label trial of zolpidem and pooled data from a phase III placebo-controlled trial of daridorexant. In both trials, adults with moderate to severe insomnia completed the SDQ daily. Meaningful change in sTST was estimated in an anchor-based analysis using outcome measures that were correlated with change in weekly average sTST (Spearman correlation coefficient â¥Â 0.30): the Insomnia Severity Index, patient global assessments and impressions of severity and change in daytime and night-time symptoms (PGA-S, PGI-S, PGI-C), and clinician global impressions of severity and change in patients' daytime symptoms (CGI-S, CGI-C). Meaningful within-patient change estimates were 'triangulated' to identify a value where they converged. In the open-label trial (NÂ =Â 114), subjects with a 1-point or 1-step improvement on the anchors had mean increases in sTST of 60.1-83.2 min at day 8 and 55.5-68.2 min at day 15. For subjects with a 2-point or 2-step improvement on the anchors, mean increases in sTST were 79.6-81.4 min at day 8 and 80.1-93.5 min at day 15. In the phase III trial (NÂ =Â 930), weekly average increases in sTST for subjects with a 1-point or 1-step improvement on the anchors were 39.3-46.7 min at month 1 and 47.3-58.3 min at month 3.

Specifically, this research examined differences in sleep interruption factors, use of sleep promotion aids, sleep characteristics and insomnia management between men and women who are first generation Korean-American older adult immigrants. Older adults feel that their sleep is shallow, interrupted frequently and is insufficient. If sleep changes are severe, it is difficult for older adults to maintain an awakened state during the day. This was a descriptive survey study. The survey included a set of four questionnaires. All measures were self-administered. In the data analysis, descriptive statistics was used to analyse demographic characteristics. The chi-squared test and t-test were used to examine the differences between men and women. Most subjects experienced sleep interruption (n = 43, 82.6%) and were not satisfied with their sleep (n = 42, 80.8%). A quarter of the subjects had experience with complementary/alternative therapies to manage insomnia, although 40 subjects (76.9%) wanted to use complementary/alternative therapies to manage their insomnia. The study shows that first generation Korean-American older adult immigrant men and women report sleep interruptions and dissatisfaction with the quality of their sleep. Women were more likely in want of using complementary/alternative therapies for insomnia management than men. Women may have longed more for their traditional healthcare practices.

Despite being recognized for a long time by the international community, it is still unclear whether this entity really exists, which are its features and boundaries. Much of the debate is fuelled by the lack of a consensus on its precise definition. To help filling some of the existing gaps, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, through which 19 different quantitative definitions were obtained. These definitions were then applied to two distinct datasets. The first consisted of 200 chronic primary insomnia patients, diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The second consisted of 200 age- and sex-matched healthy persons without insomnia. For each dataset, available data from the objective sleep parameters and their subjective estimation were imported and analysed in MATLAB. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of paradoxical insomnia ranged from 8 to 66%, while agreement between different definitions ranged fromÂ -0.19 to 0.9 (using Cohen's kappa coefficient). Based on the results garnered, necessary features for a quantitative definition of paradoxical insomnia were identified. Several open questions remain, such as whether there is a minimum number of hours a patient should sleep to fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia, and whether sleep latency can be used in the definition along with total sleep time. We conclude by advocating continued study of paradoxical insomnia and sleep state misperception and by providing specific directions for future research. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The current understanding of paradoxical insomnia and, more broadly, of sleep state misperception, is greatly hampered by the lack of agreement on a quantitative and evidence-base measure of the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep evaluation. The current study provides a critical analysis about the strength and the limitations of the available definitions, using both a data-driven and a theory-driven approach. The overarching goal is to motivate a rigorous discussion involving the main experts of the field, to build a consensus, and develop an evidence-based measure of sleep state misperception and/or of paradoxical insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30731262/"}

Pharmacological approaches and brain stimulation techniques have recently offered solutions for increasing slow-wave activity during sleep. We used slow (0.75Â Hz) oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation during stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement sleeping insomnia patients for resonating their brain waves to the frequency of sleep slow-wave. Six patients diagnosed with either sleep maintenance or non-restorative sleep insomnia entered the study. After 1 night of adaptation and 1 night of baseline polysomnography, patients randomly received sham or real stimulation on the third and fourth night of the experiment. Our preliminary results show that after termination of stimulations (sham or real), slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation increased the duration of stage 3 of non-rapid eye movement sleep by 33Â Â±Â 26Â min (PÂ =Â 0.026), and decreased stage 1 of non-rapid eye movement sleep duration by 22Â Â±Â 17.7Â min (PÂ =Â 0.028), compared with sham. Slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation decreased stage 1 of non-rapid eye movement sleep and wake time after sleep-onset durations, together, by 55.4Â Â±Â 51Â min (PÂ =Â 0.045).

Available models exist primarily in the psychological domain and derive from the demonstrated efficacy of behavioral treatment approaches to insomnia management. However, these models offer little specific prediction about the anatomic or physiological foundation of chronic primary insomnia. On the other hand, a growing body of data on the physiology of sleep supports a reasonably circumscribed overview of possible pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as the development of physiological models of insomnia to guide future research. As a pragmatic step, these models focus on primary insomnia, as opposed to comorbid insomnias, because the latter is by its nature a much more heterogeneous presentation, reflecting the effects of the distinct comorbid condition. Current understanding of the regulation of sleep and wakefulness in mammalian brain supports four broad candidate areas: 1) disruption of the sleep homeostat; 2) disruption of the circadian clock; 3) disruption of intrinsic systems responsible for the expression of sleep states; or 4) disruption (hyperactivity) of extrinsic systems capable of over-riding normal sleep-wake regulation. This review examines each of the four candidate pathophysiological mechanisms and the available data in support of each.

The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is commonly used for evaluating sleep disturbance; however, this questionnaire is time-consuming owing to the large number of questions. As the usefulness of the Athens insomnia scale (AIS) in patients with CLD is not sufficiently known, the present study aimed to determine whether the AIS and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) could be used as simple alternative questionnaires for evaluating sleep disturbances in patients with CLD. Materials and Methods: A total of 117 patients with CLD were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy were excluded. All patients were examined using the AIS, PSQI, and ESS, and their responses to these questionnaires were statistically analyzed. Results: The number of patients diagnosed with sleep disturbance using the AIS, PSQI, and ESS were 39 (33.3%), 37 (31.6%), and 9 (7.7%), respectively. There was no correlation between PSQI and ESS scores (r = 0.011, p = 0.910); in contrast, the AIS scores showed a significant correlation with the PSQI scores (r = 0.689, p < 0.001).

Finally, CBTI resulted in reduced sleep variability for all sleep diary variables except bedtime. Post-treatment symptom reductions in depression severity were greater among those with high versus low baseline BCS scores (p<0.001). Results suggest that variability in sleep schedules predict reduction in insomnia and depressive severity following group CBTI.

Findings from a prospective community study.", "text": "The purpose was to examine whether sleep hygiene practices are associated with the course of insomnia (incidence, persistence and remission) over 1Â year in the general population. This longitudinal study was carried out in the general population. After excluding anyone with other primary sleep disorder than insomnia, 1638 participants returned a baseline and a 1-year follow-up survey. Questions regarding sleep hygiene practices were administered at baseline, and the status of insomnia was assessed at baseline (T1) and at the 1-year follow-up (T2). Age, gender, mental ill-health, and pain were used as covariates in the analyses. Nicotine use, mental ill-health and pain were independently associated with an increased risk for concurrent insomnia at T1, while mental ill-health was the only risk factor for incident insomnia at T2. Relative to not reporting insomnia at the two time-points, nicotine use, light or noise disturbance, mental ill-health, and pain significantly increased the risk for persistent insomnia over 1Â year. In comparison with those whose insomnia had remitted at the follow-up, reporting an irregular sleep schedule was a significant risk factor for persistent insomnia. Of the nine sleep hygiene practices examined in this study, only three were independently linked to concurrent and future insomnia, respectively; using nicotine late in the evening, light or noise disturbance, and having an irregular sleep schedule. This may have implications for the conceptualization and management of insomnia as well as for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29995266/"}

However, for some authors it is an important cause of insomnia (Guilleminault et al., 1975; Coleman, 1982). Thus, the relationship between periodic leg movements during sleep, sleep disruption and the complaint of patients is particularly complex. We investigated the macro- and micro-structure of sleep with and without leg movements in 10 PLMS patients complaining of insomnia to clarify whether periodic leg movements are responsible for sleep disruption. The total sleep time without periodic leg movements was significantly longer than sleep time with leg movements. Sleep time without leg movements was longer than sleep time with leg movements in stage 2, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Short lasting awakenings were significantly more frequent during periodic leg movements associated sleep whilst long lasting awakenings were equally frequent during sleep with and without periodic leg movements. The percentage of the four electroencephalogram (EEG) activities (delta, theta, alpha and spindles) did not show any significant difference between periodic leg movements associated and not associated with sleep stages and total sleep time. The lack of significant differences in both the macro- and micro-structure of sleep and EEG activity content regarding the association with movements confirm the hypothesis that periodic leg movements did not primarily cause sleep disturbance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10886318/"}

Insomnia per se is a very frequent complaint and can be caused by environmental, medical, mental or psychosocial factors or the intake of drugs. Primary insomnia is an insomnia subtype characterized by the absence of a causative medical or psychiatric factor. From a pathophysiological point of view, persistent hyperarousal on autonomous, emotional, cognitive or neurobiological levels is thought to be the decisive factor for the development and persistence of chronic primary insomnia. This view is supported by studies confirming that patients with primary insomnia display heightened levels of fast frequencies of the sleep EEG, show increased production of cortisol and interleukin-6, and demonstrate increased metabolism in several brain areas during sleep (as measured by positron emission tomography). Furthermore, primary insomnia is coupled with cognitive deficits during waking and with impairments of nocturnal memory consolidation. Just recently, reductions in hippocampal volume size have been reported in patients suffering from primary insomnia. In the light of neurobiological theories of sleep-wake regulation, primary insomnia may be conceptualised as the final common pathway of the interaction of a genetic vulnerability to an imbalance between arousing and sleep-inducing brain centres (which is triggered by psychosocial and/or medical stressors) with perpetuating mechanisms such as maladaptive behaviours, learned sleep-preventing associations and cognitive factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473230/"}

Sleep issues are prevalent in Veterans and may interfere with PE by disrupting the learning and consolidation of fear extinction memories during PE exposures. Here, we examined whether changes in fear extinction across imaginal exposures and PTSD symptoms during PE were predicted by diary-assessed levels of nightly sleep efficiency (SE; i.e., percent of time in bed spent sleeping), which may indirectly index sleep fragmentation and sleep-facilitated memory processes. Participants were Veterans with PTSD and comorbid insomnia (NÂ =Â 40) participating in a clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia plus PE. SE was measured via nightly sleep diaries, fear extinction was operationalized as a reduction in peak distress between weekly imaginal exposures, and PTSD symptoms were assessed bi-weekly. Cross-lagged panel models revealed that higher sleep efficiency during the week predicted lower peak distress at the subsequent imaginal exposure and lower PTSD symptoms at the subsequent assessment, whereas PTSD symptoms and peak distress did not predict subsequent sleep efficiency. Efficient sleep may facilitate fear extinction and PTSD reduction during PE. Targeting sleep efficiency could improve PE effectiveness for Veterans with comorbid insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37099850/"}

A total of 177 subjects (121 in the IN group and 56 in the NC group) were evaluated on the basis of EEG sleep, subjective sleep, sleepiness, performance, mood, personality, and metabolic parameters during a 36-hour laboratory stay. Equal percentages of subjects in each group had 0, 1, or 2 nights of poor EEG sleep, indicating that the IN group was not more likely to have impaired sleep in the laboratory. Results of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory showed that subjects in the IN group had more pathological personality profiles, and results of laboratory studies showed that these subjects had worse mood ratings, less subjective sleepiness, poorer memory performance, and longer midafternoon sleep latencies. Subjects in the IN group also rated their laboratory sleep as poorer in quality with more time awake after sleep onset and longer sleep latencies, but no differences in EEG sleep were observed. Poor nights of EEG sleep were associated with being male, increasing age, and a history of more time awake after sleep onset; among the laboratory tests, poor EEG sleep was associated with worse mood ratings, poorer memory performance, longer sleep latencies (as indicated by higher scores on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), higher sleep/wake ratios for metabolic parameters, lower ratings of sleep quality, and longer perceived sleep latencies. A history of chronic insomnia does not predict poor EEG sleep.

{"id": "26229000", "title": "Sleep at high altitude: guesses and facts.", "text": "Lowlanders commonly report a poor sleep quality during the first few nights after arriving at high altitude. Polysomnographic studies reveal that reductions in slow wave sleep are the most consistent altitude-induced changes in sleep structure identified by visual scoring. Quantitative spectral analyses of the sleep electroencephalogram have confirmed an altitude-related reduction in the low-frequency power (0.8-4.6 Hz). Although some studies suggest an increase in arousals from sleep at high altitude, this is not a consistent finding. Whether sleep instability at high altitude is triggered by periodic breathing or vice versa is still uncertain. Overnight changes in slow wave-derived encephalographic measures of neuronal synchronization in healthy subjects were less pronounced at moderately high (2,590 m) compared with low altitude (490 m), and this was associated with a decline in sleep-related memory consolidation. Correspondingly, exacerbation of breathing and sleep disturbances experienced by lowlanders with obstructive sleep apnea during a stay at 2,590 m was associated with poor performance in driving simulator tests. These findings suggest that altitude-related alterations in sleep may adversely affect daytime performance. Despite recent advances in our understanding of sleep at altitude, further research is required to better establish the role of gender and age in alterations of sleep at different altitudes, to determine the influence of acclimatization and of altitude-related illness, and to uncover the characteristics of sleep in highlanders that may serve as a study paradigm of sleep in patients exposed to chronic hypoxia due to cardiorespiratory disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26229000/"}

The aims of this study were threefold: (a) to determine whether change in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep was related to change in sleep, insomnia symptoms, and impairment following treatment; (b) to determine whether BT, CT, and CBT differ in their effects on dysfunctional beliefs; and (c) to determine whether the treatments differ in their effects on particular kinds of dysfunctional beliefs. Beliefs, sleep, insomnia symptoms, and sleep-related psychosocial impairment were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Greater change in dysfunctional beliefs occurring over the course of BT, CT, or CBT was associated with greater improvement in insomnia symptoms and impairment at posttreatment and both follow-ups. All groups experienced a significant decrease in dysfunctional beliefs during treatment, which were sustained through 6- and 12-month follow-up. Compared with the BT group, a greater proportion of participants in the CT and/or CBT groups endorsed dysfunctional beliefs below a level considered clinically significant at posttreatment and 12-month follow-up. The results demonstrate the importance of targeting dysfunctional beliefs in insomnia treatment, suggest that beliefs may be significantly modified with BT alone, and indicate that cognitive interventions may be particularly powerful in enhancing belief change.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26763501/"}

A total of 74 women (age range=40-59 years old) with insomnia who were either pre or peri/post menopause were evaluated at Laval University's Sleep Disorders Center as part of ongoing clinical trials of insomnia therapies. All participants completed daily sleep diaries for a 2-week period and a series of psychological and insomnia questionnaires, followed by three consecutive nights of polysomnographic evaluation (PSG). A detailed medical history interview was taken by the study physician. PSG measures showed that menopausal women had significantly longer total wake time (TWT, 84.2 vs. 63.2 min, Cohen's d=0.504) and lower sleep efficiency (SE, 81.8% vs. 86.0%, d=0.487) than the non-menopausal women.

Healthy subjects estimated their sleep time correctly, while insomniacs largely underestimated their sleep time. Statistical analysis of the distribution of MI in insomnia patients disclosed the presence of two subgroups, one with moderate sleep misperception (132 patients) and the other with high sleep misperception (27 patients). The latter presented MI values >or=0.9, exhibiting statistical properties different from those with MI <0.9 and from normal subjects.

Results revealed that N1 was smaller during wakefulness and sleep onset for Psy-I, while it was larger for Para-I during these same times. P2 was smaller at sleep onset for Psy-I than for Para-I and GS, while P2 during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep was larger for Para-I than GS. WPNs revealed that Psy-I showed fewer changes in information processing, while Para-I showed larger changes between recording times.

Recently, the investigation of the less than 1âHz oscillations (commonly termed slow oscillations), a hallmark of slow wave sleep, has gained increased interest in research on insomnia. In this context, an intriguing perspective arises from the association between slow oscillations and metabolic waste clearance, an impaired process in individuals suffering from insomnia disorder. Indeed, the exploration of the relationships between cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and glymphatic system functions, which relate to brain metabolic clearance, and sleep slow oscillations may represent a promising avenue for future research in this field. This narrative review examines current knowledge about the intricate interplay among these mechanisms and their implications for insomnia disorder. Particular attention is given to the role of sleep slow oscillations in the clearance of metabolic waste during sleep, their coupling with cerebrospinal fluid oscillations, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying glymphatic function. The review emphasises the relevance of investigating sleep slow oscillations-related mechanisms in insomnia, intending to provide novel insights into the neurophysiological underpinnings of the disorder and contribute to more accurate diagnostic approaches.

Insomnia is one of the most common health complaints reported in the primary care setting. Although non-pharmacological treatments such as the CBT have been suggested to be useful in combating the persistent insomnia, the efficacy and clinical utility of CBT for primary insomnia have yet to be determined. A systematic search of Ovid, MEDLINE, psychINFO, PsycARTICLES, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases of papers published between 1993 and 2004 was conducted, using the following medical subject headings or key words: insomnia, primary insomnia, psychophysiological insomnia, sleep maintenance disorders, sleep initiation disorders, non-pharmacological treatment, and cognitive behavioural therapy. A total of seven papers was included in the review. Stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene education and cognitive restructuring were the main treatment components. Interventions were provided by psychiatrists except for one study, in which the CBT was delivered by nurses. Among beneficial outcomes, improvement of sleep efficacy, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset were the most frequently reported. In addition, participants significantly reduced sleep medication use. Some studies gave follow-up data which indicated that the CBT produced durable clinical changes in total sleep time and night-time wakefulness. These randomized controlled trial studies demonstrated that CBT was superior to any single-component treatment such as stimulus control, relaxation training, educational programmes, or other control conditions. However, heterogeneity in patient assessment, CBT protocols, and outcome indicators made determination of the relative efficacy and clinical utility of the therapy difficult. Therefore, the standard components of CBT need to be clearly defined. In addition, a comprehensive assessment of patients is essential for future studies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15882372/"}

As such, SRT appears to be a viable alternate treatment for those who cannot complete a full course of CBT-I. However, it is unclear whether SRT-a treatment solely focusing on restricting time in bed-increases risk for sleepiness comparably to CBT-I. The current study tested objective sleepiness as an outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing SRT, CBT-I, and attention control in a sample of postmenopausal women in whom insomnia was diagnosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Single-site, randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 Â± 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition insomnia disorder were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep education control (6 sessions); SRT (2 sessions with interim phone contact); and CBT-I (6 sessions). Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment and posttreatment. Risk of excessive sleepiness was evaluated using a symmetry analysis of sleepiness measured through the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). The odds ratios (ORs) of being excessively sleepy versus nonsleepy were not different than 1.0 for both SRT (OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [0.13-6.96]) and CBT-I (OR = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [0.09-4.46]), indicating that the odds of becoming excessively sleepy following treatment was not different from the odds of being nonsleepy. This suggests that excessive sleepiness is not of unique concern following SRT relative to CBT-I or sleep education. SRT appears to have a comparable risk profile for excessive sleepiness as CBT-I, and thus may be considered a safe alternative to CBT-I. Future research should characterize objective measures of excessive sleepiness immediately following sleep restriction.

Participants then tracked their pre-sleep worry and sleep parameters for seven consecutive days. Interpretation bias was assessed using an encoding-recognition task specifically designed for insomnia-related interpretation bias. The CBM-I manipulation utilized ambiguous scenarios to redirect participants away from making insomnia-related interpretations. Results revealed that CBM-I effectively decreased insomnia-consistent interpretation bias compared to the sham treatment, with interpretation bias being absent post-training in the CBM-I group. This reduction did not lead to improvements in pre-sleep worry or any sleep parameters. This study has been the first to investigate the causal role of interpretation bias on symptoms of insomnia. Although results indicated this bias to be modifiable, its causality within the cognitive model proves to be more complicated.

Assessment of the duration of insomnia and quantification of the impact of nocturnal sleep disruption on daytime functioning provide the most reliable indices of severity. Primary insomnia may be due to a number of different causes, such as poor sleep hygiene or circadian rhythm disruption. Insomnia may also be the presenting symptom of other primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea syndrome or nocturnal myoclonus, or of a variety of medical or psychiatric illnesses. The treatment of the patient with insomnia should address the underlying cause, when identifiable. When the cause cannot be identified, treatment should be conservative; nonpharmacologic therapies should be used whenever possible.

State-spaced TVARMA processes with recursive particle filtering provided resilience to nonlinear, nonstationary, and non-Gaussian conditions of biosignals. FIS managed automated sleep scoring robust to intersubjects' and interraters' variability. The similarity distances quantified in a scalar measure the transitions amongst sleep onset stages, computed from expert and automated hypnograms. A statistical set of unpaired two-tailed t -tests suggested that distances d1 , d2, and d3 had larger statistical significance ( ) to characterize sleeping patterns. The logistic regression model classified control and subjects with insomnia with sensitivity 87 % , specificity 75 %, and accuracy 81 %.

{"id": "15892588", "title": "Antidepressants and sleep: a qualitative review of the literature.", "text": "Most antidepressants change sleep; in particular, they alter the physiological patterns of sleep stages recorded overnight with EEG and other physiological measures. These effects are greatest and most consistent on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and tend to be in the opposite direction to the sleep abnormalities found in major depression, but are usually of greater degree. Reductions in the amount of REM sleep and increases in REM sleep onset latency are seen after taking antidepressants, both in healthy volunteers and in depressed patients. Antidepressants that increase serotonin function by blocking reuptake or by inhibiting metabolism have the greatest effect on REM sleep. The decrease in amount of REM sleep appears to be greatest early in treatment, and gradually diminishes during long-term treatment, except after monoamine oxidase inhibitors when REM sleep is often absent for many months. Sleep initiation and maintenance are also affected by antidepressants, but the effects are much less consistent between drugs. Some antidepressants such as clomipramine and the selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), particularly fluoxetine, are sleep-disturbing early in treatment and some others such as amitriptyline and the newer serotonin 5-HT2-receptor antagonists are sleep promoting. However, these effects are fairly short-lived and there are very few significant differences between drugs after a few weeks of treatment. In general, the objectively measured sleep of depressed patients improves during 3-4 weeks of effective antidepressant treatment with most agents, as does their subjective impression of their sleep. Sleep improvement earlier in treatment may be an important clinical goal in some patients, perhaps when insomnia is particularly distressing, or to ensure compliance. In these patients, the choice of a safely used and effective antidepressant which improves sleep in short term is indicated. Patients with other sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome and REM sleep behaviour disorder should be identified before choosing a treatment, as some antidepressants worsen these conditions. Conversely, there is evidence that some antidepressants may be useful in the treatment of sleep disorders such as night terrors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15892588/"}

Thirty patients with average sleep latencies of 81.48 minutes, who reported chronic insomnia for an average of 2.6 years, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: behavioral stimulus control/relaxation training and triazolam.

Comparisons showed that triazolam group latencies returned toward baseline, while behavioral group gains were maintained at follow-up. Triazolam treatment showed superior immediate treatment effects, while behavioral treatment showed superior treatment effects at follow-up, effects that accrued during the training period and differentially persisted at follow-up.

Insomnia can be seen as a perception of disturbed sleep with daytime consequences, but is essentially also a symptom. This paper reviews a number of issues in the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia. The dimensions, daytime consequences and longitudinal aspects of insomnia are considered. Most investigations to date have been geared towards the problem of chronic insomnia and yet we are all likely to suffer from transient insomnia at some point. Psychiatric and psychophysiological disorders have been shown to be the most frequent causes of disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Moreover, there is an apparent disparity between subjective and objective sleep parameters with, for example, objectively disturbed sleep in noncomplaining subjects. The criteria of hypnotic efficacy and the effects of triazolam and flurazepam on sleep and daytime alertness have been investigated in normals, chronic insomniacs and the elderly. In general, chronic insomniacs showed all degrees of daytime alertness regardless of nocturnal sleep parameters. About one-third could be classified as fully alert all day long in spite of their complaints. The effect of flurazepam and triazolam on sleep (improvement) was essentially the same. Daytime effects were most closely related to half-life. The long-acting benzodiazepine, flurazepam, impaired daytime alertness although nocturnal sleep was improved. Triazolam improved not only nighttime sleep but also daytime alertness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6382252/"}

The physical sleeping environment, which is often poor in military-provided housing or barracks, may contribute to poor sleep quality in soldiers. The current study aimed to assess whether the sleeping environment in garrison is related to sleep quality, insomnia risk and military readiness. Seventy-four US army special operations soldiers participated in a cross-sectional study. Soldiers were queried on their sleeping surface comfort and the frequency of being awakened at night by excess light, abnormal temperatures and noise. Subjective sleep quality and insomnia symptoms were also queried, via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Lastly, measures of soldier readiness, including morale, motivation, fatigue, mood and bodily pain, were assessed. Soldiers reporting temperature-related and light-related awakenings had poorer sleep quality higher fatigue and higher bodily pain than soldiers without those disturbances. Lower ratings of sleeping surface comfort were associated with poorer sleep quality and lower motivation, lower morale, higher fatigue and higher bodily pain. Each 1-point increase in sleeping surface comfort decreased the risk for a positive insomnia screen by 38.3%, and the presence of temperature-related awakenings increased risk for a positive insomnia screen by 78.4%. Those living on base had a poorer sleeping environment than those living off base. Optimising the sleep environment-particularly in on-base, military-provided housing-may improve soldier sleep quality, and readiness metrics. Providers treating insomnia in soldiers should rule out environment-related sleep disturbances prior to beginning more resource-intensive treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34301851/"}

Thus, researches focus on the causes and treatment of insomnia, a noteworthy ageing problem. This study aims to investigate the relationship between chronotype and insomnia and whether sleep hygiene mediates this relationship in older adults with depression (OAD). We assessed subjective insomnia severity, sleep hygiene, chronotype, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms of 82 OAD and 70 healthy controls using the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The mediation effect of SHI and ISI scores were evaluated in the relationship between MEQ and BDI total scores in OAD. The results showed that MEQ performed its effect on BDI through ISI with full mediation (effect = -0.16, SE: 0.07, 95% CI: -0.3230 to -0.0336). The mediation effect of SHI and BDI scores were evaluated in the relationship between MEQ and ISI total scores in OAD. In this model, it was found that MEQ significantly performed its effect on ISI through SHI and BDI. BDI and SHI predicted the ISI variable as partial mediators (respectively, effect = -0.05, SE: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.1073 to -0.0100; effect = -0.06, SE: 0.02, 95% CI: -0.1051 to -0.0129).

Five basic steps can help clinicians identify and treat insomnia. The first step is to ask a single question about sleep at every new patient visit, which goes a long way toward detection of patients with insomnia. The second step is to perform an initial evaluation of the problem, including symptoms, contributing factors, and effects on daytime function. Step three is to determine whether the patient is in crisis. True sleep emergencies are rare, and in most cases, treatment can be delayed until another appointment can be made for a full evaluation of the problem. A sleep evaluation constitutes the fourth step and focuses mainly on a thorough sleep history; blood tests and polysomnography rarely have a role. The final step is intervention. Nonpharmacological strategies are a mainstay of treatment for chronic insomnia, but hypnotics have a role in treating transient insomnia and chronic insomnia that does not improve with nonpharmacological treatment or treatment of associated primary conditions. Pharmacological therapy usually consists of benzodiazepines with short half-lives or nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zaleplon, although lack of demonstrated efficacy against sleep maintenance difficulties, one of the primary symptoms of insomnia among older people, limits use of these agents. Emerging nonbenzodiazepine agents such as indiplon and eszopiclone may specifically address sleep maintenance problems in elderly patients and are pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. (Editor's note: Since preparation of this manuscript, the FDA has approved eszopiclone for treatment of insomnia.).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15982376/"}

The study randomized 110 participants (107 women; mean age: 35.5âyears) to CBT-I or to an attention-control group. Participants were assessed at 3 time periods: baseline, post-CBT-I (or attention control), and at time 3 (T3) post-cognitive processing therapy received by all participants. NM reports were extracted from the Fear of Sleep Inventory. Participants with weekly NMs were compared with those with fewer than weekly NMs on outcomes including attrition, insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression. Change in NM frequency was examined. Participants with weekly NMs (55%) were significantly more likely to be lost to follow-up post-CBT-I (37%) compared with participants with infrequent NMs (15.6%) and were less likely to complete T3 (43%) than patients with less frequent NMs (62.5%). NMs were unrelated to differential treatment response in insomnia, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder. Treatment with CBT-I was not associated with reduced NM frequency; however, change in sleep-onset latency from post-CBT-I to T3 predicted fewer NMs at T3. Weekly NMs were associated with attrition but not a reduced change in insomnia symptoms following CBT-I. NM symptoms did not change as a function of CBT-I, but change in sleep-onset latency predicted lower NM frequency. CBT-I trials should screen for NMs and consider augmenting CBT-I to specifically address NMs. Hamilton NA, Russell JA, Youngren WA, etÂ al.

College students' developmental stage and lifestyle are significantly different than the general adult population, yet there have been no studies of CBT-I in this age group. Thirty-four college students (ages 18-27; M=19.71, SD=2.10) were randomly assigned to and completed either six sessions of CBT-I or a 6-week wait list control (WLC). All participants completed 1-week sleep diaries and actigraphy, as well as sleep and daytime functioning questionnaires at baseline and posttreatment. The treatment group repeated all measures at 3-month follow-up. Students who received CBT-I showed greater baseline to posttreatment improvements in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, time awake after sleep onset, sleep quality, insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, general fatigue, and global sleep quality than the WLC group. These improvements were durable at 3-month follow-up. Ninety-four percent of participants in the CBT-I condition completed at least 4 sessions of treatment. Significantly more participants in the CBT-I group than the WLC group responded (68.8% vs 7.7%, respectively) and remitted (68.8% vs 15.4%, respectively).

Additionally, cognitive processes related to sleep quality tend to be predominated by sleep thinking or insomnia thinking. Multiple medical organizations promote Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia as a best practice for clinical management of sleep problems and disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia consists of five components aimed at addressing both the behavioral and cognitive impediments to high quality sleep.

Exercise, sleeping pills usage, and RLS were independently associated with insomnia only in men, while appetite and medium-high risk of OSA were associated with insomnia in women only. In addition, after further adjusting for covariates, prevalence of the insomnia-related symptoms such as sleep induction, total sleep duration, sleep quality and sleepiness during the day was significantly higher in females than in males.

The present study investigated whether brief training in identifying and elaborating an interesting and engaging imagery task for use during the pre-sleep period can reduce unwanted pre-sleep cognitive activity and sleep onset latency. Forty one people with insomnia were given one of three instructional sets to follow on the experimental night; instructions to distract using imagery, general instructions to distract, or no instructions. Based on previous findings reported by Salkovskis & Campbell (1994) 'Behaviour Research and Therapy 32 (1994) 1' and ironic control theory (Wegner, 1994) 'Psychological Review 101 (1994) 34', it was predicted that (1) \"imagery distraction\" would be associated with shorter sleep onset latency and less frequent and distressing pre-sleep cognitive activity compared to the \"no instruction\" group and that (2) \"general distraction\" would be associated with longer sleep onset latency and more frequent and distressing pre-sleep cognitive activity compared to the \"no instruction\" group. Support was found for the first but not the second prediction. The success of the \"imagery distraction\" task is attributed to it occupying sufficient \"cognitive space\" to keep the individual from re-engaging with thoughts, worries, and concerns during the pre-sleep period.

The clinical guideline treatment for chronic insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy. Although typically delivered as \"talking therapy\", cognitive behavioural therapy is not some form of \"psychobabble\". Rather, the Psychobiological Inhibition Model framework for insomnia articulates how specific techniques can correct the various ways in which the expression of normal sleep and circadian brain-behaviour relationships have become disrupted.

The analysis suggested during quit attempts smokers experienced a range of sleep problems that could increase risk of relapse due to a negative impact on psychological state. It also revealed participants thought that CBT-I is something they would use during a quit attempt but suggested changes and additions that would improve engagement and be better tailored to quitting smokers.

A community-based sample of adults (n = 2,892; 59.3% female; 47.9 Â± 13.3 y old) with no lifetime history of insomnia or depression completed web-based surveys across three annual assessments. Participants reported parental history of insomnia, demographic characteristics, sleep reactivity on the Ford Insomnia in Response to Stress Test (FIRST), and insomnia symptoms. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were used to determine insomnia classification. Baseline FIRST scores were used to predict incident insomnia at 1-y follow-up. Two clinically meaningful FIRST cutoff values were identified: FIRST â¥ 16 (sensitivity 77%; specificity 50%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.88, P < 0.001); and FIRST â¥ 18 (sensitivity 62%; specificity 67%; OR = 3.32, P < 0.001). Notably, both FIRST cut-points outperformed known maternal (OR = 1.49-1.59, P < 0.01) and paternal history (P = NS) in predicting insomnia onset, even after controlling for stress exposure and demographic characteristics. Of the incident cases, insomniacs with highly reactive sleep systems reported longer sleep onset latencies (FIRST â¥ 16: 65 min; FIRST â¥ 18: 68 min) than participants with nonreactive insomnia (FIRST < 16: 37 min; FIRST < 18: 44 min); these groups did not differ on any other sleep parameters.

Although a tendency was observed for objective SOL, only the changes on subjective SOL and TST in the pharmacological placebo condition were significantly different from the corresponding changes in the untreated group. No differences were significant for the psychological placebo groups.

The objective of our study was to evaluate sleep perception in insomniacs, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) patients, and healthy volunteers. Our hypothesis was that insomniacs have less sleep perception than healthy individuals and patients with sleep respiratory disorders. We studied 199 individuals who were divided into the following four groups: (1) insomnia group; (2) patients with sleep-disordered breathing; (3) patients with insomnia complaints and an associated sleep respiratory disorder; and (4) healthy individuals with no sleep complaints. All patients were subjected to polysomnography (PSG) followed by a questionnaire addressing their perception about the previous night's sleep. In addition to analysis of all sleep parameters, we determined sleep perception as the percentage of the ratio between total sleep time perceived by the patient and the total sleep time obtained by PSG. Sleep perception was significantly lower in insomnia patients than in sleep-disordered breathing patients or the normal group. In addition, no significant differences across the four groups were observed in sleep efficiency and total sleep time. The results showed that the reported sleep perception of insomniacs is lower than that of sleep-disordered breathing patients or normal individuals.

Since he could not sleep at night and felt the necessity to compose his literary works in an absolutely quiet environment, Kafka deliberately changed his sleep-wake schedule so he could write at night and nap in the afternoon. These maladaptive sleep habits perpetuated his insomnia and led to chronic sleep deprivation resulting in fatigue, lack of concentration and sleep-related auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations.

The idea that temperature and sleep are interrelated is based on evolutionary history. Mammalian sleep developed in association with endothermy, and all species, independent of temporal niche, usually sleep during the circadian trough of their core body temperature (CBT) rhythm. The circadian pattern of CBT results from the balance between heat production and heat loss, the latter being relevant for sleep induction. Sleep under entrained conditions is typically initiated on the declining portion of the CBT curve when its rate of change and body heat loss is maximal. Body heat loss before lights off, via selective vasodilatation of distal skin regions, promotes sleepiness and the rapid onset of sleep. This thermophysiological effect represents the cement between the circadian clock and the sleep-wake cycle, and in turn determines phase of entrainment (Psi) and sleep onset latency (SOL). These interrelationships have been recently studied in a particular subset of the general population, mainly women, who suffer from cold hands and feet (the so-called vasospastic syndrome, VS). Women with VS exhibit not only a lower capacity to lose heat during the daytime but also a prolonged SOL, a disturbed Psi of the circadian clock with respect to the sleep-wake cycle and psychologically, a disposition to turn experienced anger inwards. This naturalistic model leads us to a more general conclusion that regulation of distal skin blood flow may have clinical relevance for insomnia, in particular sleep onset insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17764994/"}

Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is unknown, recent research has demonstrated that normal sleep and wakefulness are controlled by reciprocal inhibition by different brain regions. This sleep-wake control system offers multiple therapeutic targets for the treatment of insomnia; currently, most research and available hypnotic agents target gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the sleep side of the switch. Historically, drugs have evolved from benzodiazepine receptor agonists to nonbenzodiazepines to, most recently, selective extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor agonists. However, these drugs have a differential impact on characteristics of sleep. Among the compounds that modulate the benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors, benzodiazepines suppress stage 3-4 sleep, whereas nonbenzodiazepines have no substantial effect on these stages of sleep. Recently, work on GABA agonists indicates that they increase stage 3-4 sleep. This has been demonstrated via sleep-stage scoring as well as with spectral analysis. Further, this increase in stage 3-4 sleep is associated with a decrease in stage 1 sleep and arousals from sleep. Thus, the GABA agonists may not simply promote sleep, but consolidate it as well. The clinical utility of the increase in slow-wave sleep and the sleep consolidation it produces warrants further investigation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17539704/"}

Moreover, insomnia-associated oxidative stress and inflammation were also studied. From the findings, we found that the SLP-supplemented animals improved their sleeping behaviour and that the major neurotransmitters, hormones, and receptors were maintained at an equilibrium level. Furthermore, the neurotrophin level was increased and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced. The evaluation of oxidative stress markers shows that the antioxidants were significantly boosted, and as a result, lipid peroxidation was prevented.

Participants participated in ecological momentary assessment to determine how daily changes in PTSD- and insomnia-related factors lead to changes in sleep. Multi-level modelling analyses indicated that, after accounting for baseline PTSD symptom severity, PTSD-specific factors were associated with insomnia symptoms, but insomnia-specific factors were not. Only daytime PTSD symptoms and fear of sleep predicted nightmares. Both sleep- and PTSD-related factors play a role in maintaining insomnia among those with PTSD, while nightmares seem to be linked more closely with only PTSD-related factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28771875/"}

In the current review, we present recent advances in understanding the extensive overlap among older adults between anxiety and one specific related sleep problem, insomnia. These proposals suggest that anxiety and insomnia may share a common vulnerability to negative emotionality and at times may act as risk factors for each other in older adults. We also highlight developmental shifts in motivation that are likely to impact cognitive-behavioral mechanisms of anxiety and insomnia.

Sleep is critical for physical and mental health, and non-pharmacological interventions such as maintaining an optimal sleep environment or using stimuli like foot warming can potentially enhance sleep. The socks aim to reduce sleep onset latency and improve sleep dynamics by maintaining foot warmth throughout the night. The study involved 30 participants, selected because they wanted to improve their sleep quality, monitored over a two-week period. Participants wore the technical socks during sleep, and sleep quality was assessed using both subjective measures (the Insomnia Severity Index, ISI) and objective parameters such as total sleep time, sleep phases, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Differences between pre- and post-intervention data were analyzed using paired t-tests. The study found significant improvements in sleep quality, including a reduction in ISI scores from 10.4Â±4.3 to 5.7Â±4.4 (P<0.01), suggesting a decrease in insomnia severity. Slow-wave sleep (SWS), crucial for recovery, increased significantly (P=0.03). Other sleep measures such as REM sleep and total sleep time showed minor, non-significant improvements. No significant changes were observed in heart rate or respiratory rate. The results suggest that wearing technical socks during sleep may help reduce insomnia severity and increase slow-wave sleep. Although further research with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up is needed, the intervention appears to be a promising, non-invasive method for improving sleep quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40396615/"}

Safety behaviors have been identified as contributing to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. They include overt or covert strategies designed to prevent a feared outcome. However, they contribute to the maintenance of the disorder because they prevent unambiguous disconfirmation of unrealistic beliefs and they increase the likelihood that the fear would actually occur. A questionnaire based on the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale was developed to elicit safety behaviors and was administered to 33 people meeting criteria for primary insomnia and 33 nonpatient controls. The data indicated that people with insomnia use a wide range of safety behaviors to prevent feared outcomes. Blind raters determined that the safety behaviors reported included those that: interfere with the regularity of the sleep cycle, interfere with sleep directly, cause paradoxical fuelling of presleep cognitive activity, exacerbate day-time sleepiness, contribute to the day being unpleasant or boring, and those that increase preoccupation with sleep. The clinical implications of these findings and areas for further research are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11838025/"}

IC is critical for sleep-wake regulation. This study evaluates whether computerized IC training can improve sleep in ISSD and explores related neural mechanisms using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Twenty ISSD patients participated in a three-week computerized IC training program (15 sessions), alongside a control group of 17 participants. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), complemented by objective measures from overnight EEG recordings. Neuroimaging analyses focused on changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and functional connectivity (FC) in brain regions associated with IC. Computerized IC training led to significant improvements in both subjective and objective sleep quality, demonstrated by reductions in PSQI and ISI scores, as well as decreased wake time during sleep. Neuroimaging revealed increased ReHo in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC), elevated fALFF in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and enhanced FC between the MOFC and the right rectus gyrus (RG), which correlated with improvements in sleep measures. Computerized IC training appears to be an effective intervention for improving sleep in ISSD, likely by inducing functional changes in prefrontal cortex regions. These findings underscore the potential of IC-targeted treatments for ISSD and highlight the need for future research to evaluate the long-term effects of such interventions.

Participants were 100 adults (mean age = 49.9 years; 66% women) randomly selected from a larger population-based sample enrolled in a longitudinal study of the natural history of insomnia. They completed 12 monthly telephone interviews assessing insomnia, use of sleep aids, stressful life events, and physical and mental health problems in the previous month. A total of 1,125 interviews of a potential 1,200 were completed. Based on data collected at each assessment, participants were classified into one of three subgroups: good sleepers, insomnia symptoms, and insomnia syndrome. At baseline, 42 participants were classified as good sleepers, 34 met criteria for insomnia symptoms, and 24 for an insomnia syndrome. There were significant fluctuations of insomnia over time, with 66% of the participants changing sleep status at least once over the 12 monthly assessments (51.5% for good sleepers, 59.5% for insomnia syndrome, and 93.4% for insomnia symptoms). Changes of status were more frequent among individuals with insomnia symptoms at baseline (mean = 3.46, SD = 2.36) than among those initially classified as good sleepers (mean = 2.12, SD = 2.70). Among the subgroup with insomnia symptoms at baseline, 88.3% reported improved sleep (i.e., became good sleepers) at least once over the 12 monthly assessments compared to 27.7% whose sleep worsened (i.e., met criteria for an insomnia syndrome) during the same period. Among individuals classified as good sleepers at baseline, risks of developing insomnia symptoms and syndrome over the subsequent months were, respectively, 48.6% and 14.5%. Monthly assessment over an interval of 6 months was found most reliable to estimate incidence rates, while an interval of 3 months proved the most reliable for defining chronic insomnia.

The potential for manic or hypomanic symptoms to emerge after sleep deprivation in bipolar disorder raises questions about the appropriateness of these methods for treating insomnia. In a series of patients with bipolar disorder who underwent behavioral treatment for insomnia, the authors found that regularizing bedtimes and rise times was often sufficient to bring about improvements in sleep. Two patients in a total group of 15 patients reported mild increases in hypomanic symptoms the week following instruction on stimulus control. Total sleep time did not change for these individuals. Two of five patients who underwent sleep restriction reported mild hypomania that was unrelated to weekly sleep duration. Sleep restriction and stimulus control appear to be safe and efficacious procedures for treating insomnia in patients with bipolar disorder.

Such observations imply that individuals with PI may not experience the full deactivation of sensory and cognitive processing, resulting in reduced filtering of external sensory information during sleep. To test this hypothesis, gating of sensory information during sleep was tested in participants with primary insomnia (n = 18) and good sleepers (n = 20). Sensory gating was operationally defined as (i) the difference in magnitude of evoked response potentials elicited by pairs of clicks presented during Wake and Stage II sleep, and (ii) the number of K complexes evoked by the same auditory stimulus. During wake the groups did not differ in magnitude of sensory gating. During sleep, sensory gating of the N350 component was attenuated and completely diminished in participants with insomnia. P450, which occurred only during sleep, was strongly gated in good sleepers, and less so in participants with insomnia. Additionally, participants with insomnia showed no stimulus-related increase in K complexes. Thus, PI is potentially associated with impaired capacity to filter out external sensory information, especially during sleep. The potential of using stimulus-evoked K complexes as a biomarker for primary insomnia is discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20529120/"}

Sleep modifications as a function of aging chiefly involve stage 4, which is reduced by about one half between the ages of 19 and 30.

Comparison of a group of 16 insomniacs with 16 age and sex matched normal subjects shows in the insominacs a deficiency of production of slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), most probably linked to a disturbed waking/sleep balance, whereas the other parameters of sleep, especially paradoxical stage, remain unmodified.

However, the relationship between subjective insomnia severity and objective sleep parameters remains unclear. This study aims to (1) explore the relationship between subjective insomnia severity, as measured by ISI scores, and activity-based objective sleep parameters obtained through wearable devices; (2) determine whether subjective perceptions of insomnia align with objective measures of sleep; and (3) identify key psychological and physiological factors contributing to the severity of subjective insomnia complaints. A total of 250 participants, including both individuals with and without insomnia aged 19-70 years, were recruited from March 2023 to November 2023. Participants were grouped based on ISI scores: no insomnia, mild, moderate, and severe insomnia. Data collection involved subjective assessments through self-reported questionnaires and objective measurements using wearable devices (Fitbit Inspire 3) that monitored sleep parameters, physical activity, and heart rate. The participants also used a smartphone app for ecological momentary assessment, recording daily alcohol consumption, caffeine intake, exercise, and stress. Statistical analyses were used to compare groups on subjective and objective measures. Results indicated no significant differences in general sleep structure (eg, total sleep time, rapid eye movement sleep time, and light sleep time) among the insomnia groups (mild, moderate, and severe) as classified by ISI scores (all P>.05). Interestingly, the no insomnia group had longer total awake times and lower sleep quality compared with the insomnia groups. Among the insomnia groups, no significant differences were observed regarding sleep structure (all P>.05), suggesting similar sleep patterns regardless of subjective insomnia severity. There were significant differences among the insomnia groups in stress levels, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome (all Pâ¤.001), with higher severity associated with higher scores in these factors. Contrary to expectations, no significant differences were observed in caffeine intake (P=.42) and alcohol consumption (P=.07) between the groups. The findings demonstrate a discrepancy between subjective perceptions of insomnia severity and activity-based objective sleep parameters, suggesting that factors beyond sleep duration and quality may contribute to subjective sleep complaints.

No systematic analysis of insomnia has been performed, however. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to describe the concept of insomnia. In accordance with Walker and Avant's (2005) methodology of concept analysis, this paper presents a review of the conceptual definitions, characteristics, antecedents and consequences, constructing examples, and empirical references of insomnia. The results indicate that: (1) Insomnia's defining attributes are recognized as an insufficient of quality and quantity for sleep for more than one month. (2) Antecedents of insomnia include changes in life habits, physiological demands caused by sleep time changes, and the experience of uncomfortable sensations. (3) Consequences of insomnia include a poor condition, with physical, psychological, social, and global dimensions. (4) There are many instruments that can be used to inspect insomnia, including questionnaires and tools for physiological measurement. Insomnia is a serious problem with various facets. An understanding of the concept of insomnia will help nurses to perceive this problem in caring for subjects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18836979/"}

Both of them and certain antidepressants adversely affect physiological structure of sleep, while others restore it. The latter drugs must be preferred in therapy of depression accompanying insomnia, and some of them may be effective in treatment of insomnias without depression. Most antidepressants cause REM-reduction, generally with increased serotonin-function. Selective H1-antagonists readily induce sleep, and also the inhibition of cholinergic neurons in the general arousal networks promotes sleep. Sleep continuity is improved by the rise of synaptic level of serotonin. Among tricyclic antidepressants trimipramine and amitriptyline are the best to improve sleep. However, the former has low antidepressant effect and the latter has many adverse side effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, except paroxetine, improve sleep only at the time and to the extent of restoring depression. Paroxetine has beneficial effect on sleep at the beginning of the treatment. Mirtazapine is the first-line sleep promoter among atypical antidepressants, however, its effect on increasing appetite markedly limits its application. Trazodone causes hangover, and mianserin may induce restless legs. Insomnias without depression demand lower dose of antidepressants than depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16780185/"}

Insomnia is defined and described with special attention to differentiating the subjective complaint and the laboratory assessment of objective sleep parameters. Specific disorders causing or associated with sleep disturbance and the complaint of insomnia are described, and some data bearing on relative prevalence of specific disorders are presented. Consideration of sleeping pills involves the evaluation of hypnotic efficacy as a property of the medication on the one hand and the practical clinical application on the other. Properties of different hypnotics are reviewed, including factors that affect the use of hypnotics in clinical practice.

Of 887 children who reported that they were awoken at night, parents considered that 75% were superficial sleepers and 25% were deep sleepers. The prevalence of frequent insomnia, sleepwalking and daytime sleepiness was 13, 7 and 4%, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that onset insomnia was associated with fear of sleeping alone, bone pains, hypnagogic myoclonias, rhythmic movement disorder, enuresis, nocturia, confusion when awoken at night, nightmares, bodily movements during sleep, interrupted sleep, daytime sleepiness and daytime headache or stomach ache. Somnambulism was associated with rhythmic movement disorder, somniloquy, spontaneous confused arousals, nocturia and confusion when awoken at night. Increased risk of daytime sleepiness was found among children with fear of sleeping alone, onset insomnia, rhythmic movement disorder, spontaneous confused arousals, snoring, confusion when awoken, nightmares, bodily movements during sleep and headache or stomach ache. The results support the notion that onset insomnia is a problem with a predominantly psychological and behavioural background, while sleepwalking is a disorder of arousal without major psychological implications.

Based on the findings it is difficult to claim that elderly persons with insomnia are characterized by inappropriate modes of living. There were, however, some (inconsistent) indications that tea consumption, smoking and lack of exercise predicted insomnia. There were also scarce indications for less realistic sleep expectations in bad than in good sleepers. More bad sleepers perceived their sleep as uncontrollable and unpredictable than than good sleepers. Bad sleepers had significantly higher scores for anxiety, neuroticism and depression than good sleepers. Anxiety as well as depression correlated positively with insomnia and negatively with sleep duration. Depression, anxiety or neuroticism often were better predictors of insomnia than health indicators such as perceived health and number of prescribed drugs. The findings suggest that insomnia in relatively healthy elderly is more tightly associated with psychological factors than with modes of living or health indicators. This has some consequences for therapy. In addition to advice concerning modes of living and sleep hygiene, one has to be alert for the possible presence of depression or anxiety.

Underestimating sleep latency and time spent awake after sleep onset were responsible for this difference. Positive sleep state misperception is revealed in chronic cocaine users after 2 weeks of abstinence and is consistent with the previously identified \"occult insomnia\" in this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364419/"}

Patients also wore actigraphs for 7 days at home, were extensively interviewed and filled out psychometric tests. Based on all this information, the patients were then diagnosed according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Averaged over the 3 nights for each insomniac, the mean discrepancy between actigram and PSG was 49 minutes per night. In three-fourths of the cases, actigram and PSG agreed to within 1 hour on the total amount of sleep per night. Discrepancies, however, were not random: In patients with psychophysiologic insomnia and in insomnia associated with psychiatric disease, the actigram typically overestimated sleep when compared with the PSG. In patients with sleep-state misperception, the actigram was either quite accurate or it underestimated sleep when compared with the PSG. Comparing laboratory with home sleep, one-third of all insomniacs slept better in the laboratory and two-thirds slept better at home. In addition, night-by-night variability was higher at home than in the laboratory. Based on our study, we now recommend actigraphy as an additional tool in the clinical evaluation of insomnia, but we believe that in complex cases it should be combined with 1 PSG night in the sleep disorders center.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1519002/"}

All patients filled out a self-assessment questionnaire asking clinical descriptive variables at the baseline of the treatment period; patients received the usual dose of a single type of BZD or BzRA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were self-assessed at the baseline, and the former was re-evaluated at the time of cessation of medication or at the end of the 6-month treatment period. The PSQI included the following sub-items: evaluating sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), frequency of sleep disturbance (C5), use of sleeping medication (C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). Among the patients, 54.6% needed to continue hypnotics for a 6-month treatment period. Logistic regression analysis revealed that, among descriptive variables, only the PSQI score appeared as a significant factor associated with long-term use {odds ratio (OR)â= 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)â= 2.0-4.0}.

The present study included 65 patients treated for chronic insomnia (M = 51.8 years, SD = 10.0; 66.2% female) at a university hospital. Patients received CBT-I over a 6-week period, and change scores from pre- to posttreatment derived from the Insomnia Severity Index, sleep diary, and polysomnography (PSG) were used as indices of sleep improvement. HRV variables (i.e., low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], and the ratio of low to high frequency [LF:HF ratio]) were derived for Stage 2 (S2) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep at pre- and posttreatment. High HF (i.e., parasympathetic activity) and/or low LF:HF ratio (i.e., sympathovagal balance) were used as indices of HRV improvement. Following therapy, sleep improvements, particularly for sleep onset latency, were related with reduced HF in S2 (r = .30, p < .05) and in REM (r = .36, p < .01). A trend was also observed between reduced insomnia symptoms and increased HF in REM (r = -.21, p < .10). Findings suggest that contrary to expectations, sleep improvements following CBT-I were associated with reduced parasympathetic activation and increased sympathovagal balance. Although preliminary, these results raise the question as to whether insomnia treatment might play a role in physiological changes associated with cardiovascular anomalies.

We then determined the impact of BBTI on sleep, sleep quality, and nocturia as assessed by self-report, actigraphy, and polysomnography. Individuals without baseline nocturia responded well to BBTI with significant decrease in sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time assessed by sleep diary and actigraphy; these changes were significantly greater than those in the IC group. In comparison, changes in the same sleep parameters among participants with nocturia were not significantly different from the IC control. Although BBTI showed significant improvement in sleep quality in groups with and without nocturia (as assessed by PSQI and sleep diary), the effect size of these improvements was larger in those without nocturia than in those with nocturia (PSQI d = 0.82 vs. 0.53, diary sleep quality d = 0.83 vs. 0.51).

Diagnostic interviews were held at the laboratory of the Research Institute of Child Development and Education at the University of Amsterdam. Treatment for GT occurred at the mental health care center UvAMinds in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One hundred sixteen adolescents (mean age = 15.6 y, SD = 1.6 y, 25% males) meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia, were randomized to IT, GT, or WL. CBTI of 6 weekly sessions, consisted of psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, restriction of time in bed, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. GT was conducted in groups of 6 to 8 adolescents, guided by 2 trained sleep therapists. IT was applied through an online guided self-help website with programmed instructions and written feedback from a trained sleep therapist. Sleep was measured with actigraphy and sleep logs for 7 consecutive days. Symptoms of insomnia and chronic sleep reduction were measured with questionnaires. Results showed that adolescents in both IT and GT, compared to WL, improved significantly on sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time at post-test, and improvements were maintained at follow-up.

Risk factors for persistent poor sleep were physical health conditions combined with psychologic distress. Shorter objective sleep duration and a family history of sleep problems were risk factors for poor sleep evolving into chronic insomnia.

We exposed rats to a psychological stressor (cage exchange) that initially causes an acute stress response, but several hours later generates a pattern of sleep disturbances similar to that observed in stress-induced insomnia in humans: increased sleep latency, decreased non-REM (nREM) and REM sleep, increased fragmentation, and high-frequency EEG activity during nREM sleep. We examined the pattern of Fos expression to identify the brain circuitry activated, and found increased Fos in the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and parts of the arousal and autonomic systems. Surprisingly, there was simultaneous activation of the sleep-promoting areas, most likely driven by ongoing circadian and homeostatic pressure. The activity in the cerebral cortex and arousal system while sleeping generates a novel intermediate state characterized by EEG high-frequency activity, distinctive of waking, during nREM sleep. Inactivation of discrete limbic and arousal regions allowed the recovery of specific sleep components and altered the Fos pattern, suggesting a hierarchical organization of limbic areas that in turn activate the arousal system and subsequently the cerebral cortex, generating the high-frequency activity. This high-frequency activity during nREM was eliminated in the stressed rats after inactivating parts of the arousal system. These results suggest that shutting down the residual activity of the limbic-arousal system might be a better approach to treat stress-induced insomnia, rather than potentiation of the sleep system, which remains fully active.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18829974/"}

Numerous attempts have been made to investigate nocturnal heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) as potential pathophysiological hallmarks of altered arousal levels in insomnia, with mixed results. We have aimed to overcome some of the pitfalls of previous studies by using a young, medication-free, age- and gender-matched population consisting of 43 students aged 18-30Â years half with a subthreshold insomnia complaint. We employed at-home ambulatory polysomnography and compared this attenuated insomnia group to a good sleeping group. The poor sleepers had significantly higher wake after sleep onset, arousal count, mean HR in all sleep stages (with the exception of Stage 1) and lower sleep efficiency. Consistent with previous research, we also found a significant group-by-sleep stage interaction in the prediction of nocturnal HR, highlighting the insomnia group to have a lower wake-sleep HR reduction compared to good sleepers. When restricting our analyses to insomnia with objectively determined short sleep duration, we found significantly lower standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN; a measure of HRV) compared to good sleepers. Taken together, this lends credence to the hyperarousal model of insomnia and may at least partially explain the increased prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in patients with insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622029/"}

There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the impact of the Sleeping for Two adaptation of CBT-I in pregnancy (in-person or telehealth) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing symptoms of insomnia (primary outcome), as well as increasing gestational length and reducing symptoms of depression (secondary outcomes). A two-arm, single-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the impact of CBT-I compared to TAU among a sample of 62 pregnant women, enrolled between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation, who self-identify as experiencing insomnia. Five weekly individual sessions of CBT-I will be delivered in person or via telehealth depending on physical distancing guidelines. Assessment of insomnia diagnosis by structured interview, self-reported insomnia symptom severity and sleep problems, and sleep quantity and quality as measured by a daily diary and actigraphy will occur at 12-28 weeks of pregnancy (T1), 1 week post-treatment (T2), and 6 months postpartum (T3). CBT-I delivered in pregnancy has the potential to reduce symptoms of insomnia and depression and could lead to reduced risk of preterm birth, all of which can minimize risk of negative maternal and child health and developmental consequences in the short (e.g., infant death) and long terms (e.g., developmental delays). This RCT builds on a successful open pilot trial conducted by our team and will provide further evaluation of a novel evidence-based treatment for pregnancy-related insomnia, which can be widely disseminated and used to treat individuals that are most in need of intervention. Findings will enhance understanding of pregnancy-related sleep problems, as well as means by which to improve the health and sleep of mothers and their children. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03918057.

II: Patients with insomnia.", "text": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9646380/"}

In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided.

Although a systematic ignoring (Â«crying it outÂ») is effective and widely used in behavioral therapy, it has low compliance and its safety is insufficiently studied. Therefore, a systematic ignoring is not a priority method of behavioral therapy and should not be used in children under 6 months of age.

At all study visits, we applied semi-structured interviews to obtain information on clinical and demographic data, as well as on nocturnal sleeping problems. Standardised rating scales of parkinsonism, depression and cognitive impairment were used. The relationship between insomnia and demographic and clinical variables was analysed using population-averaged logistic regression models for correlated data. 231 patients were included at baseline, 142 were available for re-evaluation in 1997 and 89 patients in 2001. Most nocturnal sleeping problems varied little in prevalence over time, whereas problems related to turning in bed and vivid dreaming or nightmares increased. Insomnia was present in 54-60% of the patients at each of the three study visits and varied considerably in individual patients over time. The presence of insomnia was closely related to disease duration, higher Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores and female sex. Insomnia is a highly frequent complaint in patients with PD. It fluctuates over time in individual patients, and its origin seems to be multifactorial. Physicians should be aware of the high prevalence of insomnia in patients with PD and should examine their patients for a possible coexisting depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17098844/"}

First night effects were assessed using the following four variables: sleep efficiency, sleep latency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and REM latency. The 20 subjects who showed the strongest normal FNE were compared with the 20 showing the strongest reverse FNE. The two groups were similar in age, sex, and most aspects of reported home sleep. They differed in their sleep on night 1, but on nights 2 and 3 their sleep was quite similar. Both groups overestimated their sleep latencies on night 1 (by subjective reports) but unlike the normal FNE group, the reverse FNE patients very accurately assessed their sleep latency on nights 2 and 3. Reverse FNE patients had significantly higher scores than normal FNE patients on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) K (defensiveness, guardedness) and Pa (paranoia) scales, and they were less depressed, marginally less anxious, and somewhat more sensation-seeking and more susceptible to boredom.

Twenty-three insomniacs and 20 good sleepers performed a visual priming task in which they were asked to name new and old pictures presented at nine ascending levels of spatial filtering. Both neutral and sleep-related stimuli were used, as previous research evidenced an attentional bias for sleep-related stimuli. Visual priming effect was observed in both groups, suggesting that poor sleep quality does not affect this type of implicit memory. However, the identification process in insomniacs is influenced by the nature of the stimulus to identify: insomniacs recognized both new and old sleep-related stimuli at lower spatial frequencies compared with good sleepers. The tendency to selectively attend to sleep-related stimuli may influence top-down processes occurring during identification of filtering stimuli, by determining a pre-allocation of attentional resources and facilitating identification processes even when sensorial information is scant. Differences in the identification processes of sleep-related stimuli compared with neutral ones should be carefully taken into account as possible pre-clinical markers of insomnia in poor sleepers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251718/"}

The individual and relative roles of these sleep parameters, as well as morning ratings of pain and mood, in predicting subsequent physical activity were examined in multilevel models that took into account variations in relationships at the 'Day' and 'Participant' levels. Of the 5 plausible predictors SQ was the only significant within-person predictor of subsequent physical activity, such that nights of higher sleep quality were followed by days of more physical activity, from noon to 11 pm. The temporal association was not explained by potential confounders such as morning pain, mood or effects of the circadian rhythm.

The EEG data showed that melody and harmony significantly enhance sleep quality, particularly impacting the theta band and the dispersion entropy in the temporal lobes. Conversely, the effect of rhythm in sleep induction appeared less significant, with minimal activity observed in the frontal and parietal lobes. We believe the data provide a foundation for innovative approaches to music composition that emphasize melody and harmony to enhance the therapeutic potential of music in sleep management, while de-emphasizing the role of rhythm.

However, a psychiatric disorder was rated as a contributing factor for 77% of patients who received a first diagnosis of primary insomnia. While neither sleep hygiene nor negative conditioning is a diagnostic criterion in DSM-IV, these results support the face validity of these clinical factors distinguishing between primary insomnia and insomnia related to mental disorders. The use of a psychiatric disorder as an inclusion criterion for insomnia related to mental disorders and an exclusion criterion for primary insomnia reinforces a categorical distinction between the two diagnoses, but the contribution of psychiatric symptoms in primary insomnia appears to be a clinically relevant one. These findings suggest the need for studies on the validity of negative conditioning and sleep hygiene in the etiology of primary insomnia, as well as on the significance of psychiatric disorders, especially depression, in primary insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326824/"}

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of insomnia sleeping characteristics, managing techniques, and attitudes toward sleeping pill usage among pharmacy students. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional web-based study was conducted among pharmacy students of King Saud University, College of Pharmacy, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between February and March 2023. SPSS version 26 was used for data analysis. A P value of <0.05 and was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In this study, 61.7% (n=108) of the students' slept an average of 6-10 h and 35.4% (n=62) slept an average of 6 h. Regarding sleeping patterns, nearly two-thirds (n=112, 64%) of the students had day and night sleeping patterns while more than one-third (n=63, 36%) had only night sleeping patterns. In this study, 2.9% (n=5) of the students had severe clinical insomnia, while 21.7% (n=38) reported moderately severe clinical insomnia, 44% (n=77) of them had subthreshold insomnia, and 31.4% (n= 55) had no clinically significant insomnia. The mean scores of the insomnia severity index were significantly related to the usage of stimulants (P=0.048), average hours of sleep (P=0.0001), and average minutes needed to fall asleep (P=0.0001).

In the present study, we addressed, for the first time, possible consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and home confinement on maternal anxiety, maternal insomnia, and maternal reports of sleep problems among children aged 6-72Â months in Israel (NÂ =Â 264). Our results revealed a high frequency of maternal clinical insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic: 23% during the pandemic, compared to only 11% before the pandemic (retrospective reports about 1-2Â months before the pandemic). About 80% of mothers reported mild-to-high levels of current COVID-19 anxiety. The majority of mothers reported no change in their child's sleep quality, duration, and sleeping arrangement. However, about 30% reported a negative change in child's sleep quality and a decrease in sleep duration, and there were also mothers who reported a positive change. These findings suggest that the changes in sleep patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are varied and that no unified change for the worse should be expected.

Insomnia's high prevalence and disease burden render it an important target for treatment. Further, and importantly, there exist established bidirectional links between insomnia and a range of health conditions, with insomnia both contributing to risk, maintenance and relapse of comorbid conditions. Recent clinical research demonstrates that treating insomnia in its own right is important for resolution of insomnia and for optimising treatment outcomes for comorbid presenting problems. Due to its effectiveness and favourable side-effect profile, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy-Insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment even when comorbid conditions are present. CBT-I is a brief treatment often delivered in four to eight consultations. Individual, group and online CBT-I have each demonstrated effectiveness. Outcomes for online CBT-I are often stronger when individualised clinician support is provided. Specifically assessing for and treating insomnia in clinical practice may provide an opportunity to optimise treatment outcome in many patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34796636/"}

Our objectives were to compare the proportion of informative usual sleep diaries (USD) and light/sleep diaries (LSD) and to evaluate factors influencing the quality of filling them. A monocentric, prospective, controlled interventional study was conducted. Patients included were randomized into two parallel groups: distribution of an USD (used in common practice), versus distribution of a LSD (similar to the USD but with light exposure data). The main outcome was the proportion of diaries returned and correctly filled out. A multivariate logistic regression model was then used to identify factors associated with the correct filling. A total of 325 USD and 324 LSD were distributed. 295 (45.5%) diaries were returned by patients: 158 (48.6%) USD, 137 (42.3%) LSD. The proportion of correctly completed diaries was 25.2% for USD versus 20.4% for LSD, which corresponds to a difference in the proportion of -4.86% [-10.25%; +â[. The hypothesis of non-inferiority of LSD compared to USD cannot therefore be retained for a non-inferiority threshold of -10%. Multivariate analysis identified the level of difficulty experienced by the patient as an important factor influencing the quality of completion (OR =â 0.99 [0.979-0.998]). The proportion of returned sleep diaries was greater in the USD and LSD insomniac subgroup (pâ<â0.0001).

Our objective, therefore, was to explore how patients with depression experience treatment components and how their experiences influence adherence to CBT-I as a full-package treatment. Twelve patients with depression and comorbid insomnia were interviewed after six sessions of CBT-I, and a conventional qualitative content analysis was conducted. Two themes were found. The theme \"I picked what I needed\" showed that participants chose among CBT-I methods. Behavioral methods were considered hard but so effective that they reduced the need to learn other methods. Participants had difficulty learning cognitive methods, such as the restructuring of negative thoughts, owing to lack of energy and cognitive problems aggravated by sleep loss. Sleep hygiene education was regarded as common knowledge. The theme \"Staying on track\" highlighted factors promoting adherence, such as a preference for non-pharmacological treatment, rapid improvement, and support from relatives and therapists. Factors impeding adherence were: a perceived lack of support from the ongoing group setting, side effects of medication, changes in daily routine, and daytime fatigue influencing cognitive and emotional functioning. The study suggests: focusing on adherence throughout treatment; actively using support from relatives and therapists; preferring individual treatment; and prioritizing behavioral treatment components, with cognitive components introduced later in the treatment course when the negative effects on cognitive functioning due to sleep restriction have diminished.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32627595/"}

The present study examined the relationship of stress and coping skills, and the potential mediating role of presleep arousal, to sleep patterns in good sleepers and insomnia sufferers. The sample was composed of 67 participants (38 women, 29 men; mean age, 39.6 years), 40 individuals with insomnia and 27 good sleepers. Subjects completed prospective, daily measures of stressful events, presleep arousal, and sleep for 21 consecutive days. In addition, they completed several retrospective and global measures of depression, anxiety, stressful life events, and coping skills. The results showed that poor and good sleepers reported equivalent numbers of minor stressful life events. However, insomniacs rated both the impact of daily minor stressors and the intensity of major negative life events higher than did good sleepers. In addition, insomniacs perceived their lives as more stressful, relied more on emotion-oriented coping strategies, and reported greater presleep arousal than good sleepers. Prospective daily data showed significant relationships between daytime stress and nighttime sleep, but presleep arousal and coping skills played an important mediating role. The findings suggest that the appraisal of stressors and the perceived lack of control over stressful events, rather than the number of stressful events per se, enhance the vulnerability to insomnia. Arousal and coping skills play an important mediating role between stress and sleep. The main implication of these results is that insomnia treatments should incorporate clinical methods designed to teach effective stress appraisal and coping skills.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12651993/"}

The IC consisted of 6 Internet-based sessions that aimed to promote healthy restorative behavior. Self-report data were assessed at baseline and again after 8 weeks. Additionally, a sleep diary was used starting 1 week before baseline and ending 1 week after postassessment. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included perseverative cognitions (i.e., work-related rumination and worrying), a range of recovery measures and depression. An extended 6-month follow-up was assessed in the IC only. A serial multiple mediator analysis was carried out to investigate mechanisms of change. IC participants displayed a significantly greater reduction in insomnia severity (d = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.77) than did participants of the CC. The IC was also superior with regard to changes in all investigated secondary outcomes. Effects were maintained until a naturalistic 6-month follow-up. Effects on insomnia severity were mediated by both a reduction in perseverative cognitions and sleep effort.

Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day.

The patients involved in the study lived a normal life and belonged to both sexes. In the introduction the author summarizes the different forms of pathological sleep and discusses the pharmacology of some hypnotics on the basis of which a detailed, multifactorial, up-to-date clinical examination of a hypnotic should be planned. He uses up-to-date methods and means for the examination of the drug which meet the requirements of an adequate clinical testing of a hypnotic. The sleep disturbances of the patients have been classified and characterized by the author from the somnological aspects and with somnological methods. Patients with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning, as well as mixed insomnias were differentiated. The effectivity of the drug was evaluated on the basis of data of sleep questionnaires referring to the target symptoms and the results of 24-hour polygraphic monitorings performed in 18 patients. In addition, the eventual hangover effect of the drug was assessed in these patients on the basis of the changes in reaction time, pulse rate, and skin resistance measured by polygraphy, besides placebo control on the day following the intake of the drug. The neurological and other organic side-effects were also examined and registered by means of the self-evaluating questionnaires, target specific interviewing of the patients, as well as by laboratory examinations. The drug proved to be most valuable as a hypnotic in patients with sleep onset and mixed insomnias. The hypnotic action was not so definite in sleep maintenance insomnias, the poorest responses were obtained in early morning insomnia cases. According to the results of polygraphic sleep examinations the two first sleep cycles become normal following the intake of the hypnotic. Parameters characteristic of REM sleep do not show changes. In the examined patients the number of side- and hangover effects attributable to the drug was very low. The author calls the attention to the importance of the observance of the dosage and administration of the drug which may prevent the development of a great number of side-effects. By giving a detailed description of a case history of an insomniac patient the author illustrates how the application field of midazolam may be further extended--within the frames of a sleep therapeutic process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8202870/"}

In our previous work, we have demonstrated the usefulness of other single items for screening purposes, such as for fatigue. The sleep item reads \"I have trouble sleeping through the night\" and is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from \"none or little of the time\" to \"most or all of the time.\" Fifty-two oncology patients were administered the ZSDS and further evaluated with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The sensitivity and specificity of various cutoffs on the ZSDS sleep item were investigated as predictors of the PSQI. Results revealed that the ZSDS single-item screen has poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting insomnia in cancer patients, and that the relationship between insomnia and depression is more complicated than anticipated. The use of this single item, or perhaps any single item, as a means of screening for sleep disturbances in cancer patients may be problematic.

It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, Â±0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, <2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, >97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32409833/"}

Studies using AA versus no treatment, placebo, sham AA, or Western medicine were included. Two (2) independent reviewers were responsible for data extraction and assessment. The efficacy of AA was estimated by the relative risk (RR) using a meta-analysis. Eight hundred and seventy eight (878) papers were searched. Six (6) trials (402 treated with AA among 673 participants) that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved. A meta-analysis showed that AA was chosen with a higher priority among the treatment subjects than among the controls (p < 0.05). The recovery and improvement rates produced by AA was significantly higher than those of diazepam (p < 0.05). The rate of success was higher when AA was used for enhancement of sleeping hours up to 6 hours in treatment subjects (p < 0.05). The efficacy of using Semen vaccariae ear seeds was better than that of the controls (p < 0.01); while magnetic pearls did not show statistical significance (p = 0.28). Six (6) commonly used auricular acupoints were Shenmen (100%), Heart (83.33%), Occiput (66.67%), Subcortex (50%), Brain and Kidney (each 33.33%, respectively). AA appears to be effective for treating insomnia. Because the trials were low quality, further clinical trials with higher design quality, longer duration of treatment, and longer follow-up should be conducted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17718650/"}

Research has shown that almost one-fifth of the Korean adult population does not have sufficient sleep. The lack of sleep is associated with significant medical, psychological, social, and economic issues. People are not only yearning for sufficient sleep but the quality of sleep as well. Usually, the obvious choice will be the use of pharmaceuticals however, these often have various side effects, and the lasting use of these medications could become a concern. Therefore, new non-drug alternatives are sought after. Audio brain entrainment is a procedure that modules neural activities by synchronizing brainwave frequency with pulse tones. By producing frequency tones for the deep sleep stage, it promotes a good night's sleep. In this paper, we developed a pillow integrated with the audio speakers that produce alpha and theta beats that should help improve sleep. Sleep polysomnography was performed on 10 people to compare the effects of the audio stimulus. Initial results showed a positive effect on sleep onset latency, indicating that sleep induction happened. This noninvasive stimulation technique can be a promising candidate for wearable bioelectronics medicine and further neuroscience research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36445544/"}

There has been marked scientific interest in sleep for a century, with the discoveries of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG), sleep-wake system, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and circadian rhythm system. Additionally, the advent of video-polysomnography in clinical research has revealed some of the consequences of disrupted sleep and sleep deprivation in psychiatric disorders. Decades of clinical research have demonstrated that sleep disorders are intimately tied to not only physical disease (e. g., lifestyle-related disease) but psychiatric illness. According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2005), sleep disorders are classified into 8 major categories: 1) insomnia, 2) sleep-related breathing disorders, 3) hypersomnias of central origin, 4) circadian rhythm sleep disorders, 5) parasomnias, 6) sleep-related movement disorders, 7) isolated symptoms, and 8) other sleep disorders. Several sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder, and narcolepsy, may be comorbid or possibly mimic numerous psychiatric disorders, and can even occur due to psychiatric pharmacotherapy. Moreover, sleep disorders may exacerbate underlying psychiatric disorders when left untreated. Therefore, psychiatrists should pay attention to the intimate relationship between sleep disorders and psychiatric symptoms. Sleep psychiatry is an academic field focusing on interrelations between sleep medicine and psychiatry. This mini-review summarizes recent findings in sleep psychiatry. Future research on the bidirectional relation between sleep disturbance and psychiatric symptoms will shed light on the pathophysiological view of psychiatric disorders and sleep disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24050022/"}

Due to chronic patterns, the risk of malignancy and organ damage in patients with PIDs may affect any aspect of life, including sleep patterns. To our knowledge, the prevalence of insomnia and subjective sleep quality have not been investigated in patients with PIDs. Therefore, this pilot study was conducted to investigate sleep quality, the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and fatigue in adult patients with PIDs in Poland. All participants were surveyed using the Athens Insomnia Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, and a questionnaire concerning general health and demographic data. We included 92 participants: 48 women (52.2%) and 44 men (47.8%). Participants' mean age was 41.9 Â± 13.9 years.

The two groups differed in 10 out of 13 questions about habitual sleep and daytime feelings. In contrast, polygraphic measures of baseline sleep indicated only that insomniacs tended to have slightly less total sleep and had a small but significant increase in early morning awakening time. Unlike the descriptions of habitual sleep, the subjects' retrospective reports of the previous night's sleep differed significantly only for the variable of total sleep time, and there were virtually no differences in the description of their status at a given moment. Auditory arousal thresholds were similar in the two groups, and both went back to sleep and stayed asleep with equal facility. These findings suggest that subjectively poor sleep is not necessarily \"light\" sleep. For both groups, arousal thresholds differed across the sleep stages, and thresholds to hearing the subject's name were lower than those in response to electronic tones. Although insomniacs had as much polygraphically defined sleep as controls between the forced awakenings of the arousal threshold studies, they perceived their sleep to be only approximately half as long. Insomniacs described themselves as having been awake more frequently than controls in 8 out of 10 forced awakening situations. In one case, insomniacs also overestimated the time between awakenings. In both groups, there was little relationship between reported habitual aspects of sleep and baseline polygraphically defined sleep variables. On questionnaires the following mornings, however, in both groups there was a positive correlation of subjective quality of sleep on the baseline nights with percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, and a negative correlation to various aspects of slow-wave sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3809325/"}

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Yoga for improvement of subjective and objective sleep quality as well as measures of anxiety, depression, sleepiness, and fatigue in patients with CI. Adults with CI were prospectively included in this single group pre-post study. Baseline assessments included home polysomnography (PSG), 7-day actigraphy, and questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pichot fatigue scale (PS)). Patients practiced Viniyoga, an individualised Yoga practice with daily self-administered exercises, for 14Â weeks. Assessments were repeated at the end of Yoga practice. Twenty-one patients completed the study. Objective sleep measurements revealed no change in PSG parameters after Yoga practice, but a decrease in arousals on actigraphy (pâ<â0.001). Subjective symptoms improved for all questionnaires (PSQI, pâ<â0.001; HAD-A, pâ=â0.020, HAD-D, pâ=â0.001, ESS, pâ=â0.041, PS, pâ=â0.010).

The meanÂ Â±Â SD caffeine consumption was 176.6Â Â±Â 201Â mg/d. Mean habitual sleep duration was 6.8Â Â±Â 1.4Â h. Insomnia symptoms were prevalent in 19.1% to 28.4% of the respondents. Although caffeine consumption was associated with all insomnia symptoms in the unadjusted models, the adjusted models demonstrated a trend toward significance with DSA. Sleep duration was inversely associated with the insomnia symptoms in unadjusted and adjusted analysis. Finally, NRS was associated with an interaction between increased caffeine consumption and sleep duration. The association between caffeine use and insomnia symptoms depends on habitual sleep duration at a population level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27377580/"}

Baseline survey data were collected in 2000-2002 from 40-60-year-old employees of the City of Helsinki, all working at baseline. Baseline data were linked with disability retirement data until the end of 2010, obtained from the Finnish Centre for Pensions registers (N=6042). Sleep duration and self-reported insomnia symptoms (non-restorative sleep and difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep) were derived from the baseline surveys. All-cause disability retirement (N=561) and the most prevalent diagnostic groups - musculoskeletal diseases (43%) and mental disorders (26%) - were examined. Cox regression analysis was used to yield hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A joint association of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with disability retirement was found, implying a higher risk for those with frequent insomnia symptoms. HR for all-cause disability retirement ranged among those with frequent symptoms from 2.02 (95% CI 1.53-2.68, sleeping 7 hours) to 3.92 (95% CI 2.57-5.97, sleeping â¤ 5 hours). Adjusting for sociodemographic, work, and health-related factors attenuated the associations, which nevertheless remained. The associations were similar for the two diagnostic groups, although stronger for those with mental disorders. Frequent insomnia symptoms dominate the joint association of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with subsequent disability retirement. Examining exclusively sleep duration would provide an incomplete understanding of the consequences of poor sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22234460/"}

The present study examined the daily relationship between worry (both during the day and immediately prior to sleep onset) and sleep in 50 high trait worriers who were randomly assigned to one of two interventions aimed at reducing worry as part of a larger study. A daily process approach was utilized wherein participants completed daily reports of sleep and worry during a 7-day baseline period followed by a 14-day intervention period. Results of repeated measures multilevel modeling analyses indicated that worry experienced on a particular day predicted increased sleep disturbance that night during both the baseline and intervention weeks. However, there was no evidence of a bidirectional relationship as sleep characteristics did not predict worry the following day. Additionally, the type of intervention that participants engaged in did not affect the daily relationship between worry and sleep.

In 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that sleep disorders should be dealt with as a public health epidemic. However, it is hard to provide adequate treatment for each insomnia sufferer, since various behavioral characteristics influence symptoms of insomnia collectively. We aim to develop a neural-net based unsupervised user clustering method towards insomnia sufferers in order to clarify the unique traits for each derived groups. Unlike the current diagnosis of insomnia that requires qualitative analysis from interview results, the classification of individuals with insomnia by using various information modalities from smart bands and neural-nets can provide better insight into insomnia treatments. This study, as part of the precision psychiatry initiative, is based on a smart band experiment conducted over 6 weeks on individuals with insomnia. During the experiment period, a total of 42 participants (19 male; average age 22.00 [SD 2.79]) from a large university wore smart bands 24/7, and 3 modalities were collected and examined: sleep patterns, daily activities, and personal demographics. We considered the consecutive daily information as a form of images, learned the latent variables of the images via a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and clustered and labeled the input images based on the derived features. We then converted consecutive daily information into a sequence of the labels for each subject and finally clustered the people with insomnia based on their predominant labels. Our method identified 5 new insomnia-activity clusters of participants that conventional methods have not recognized, and significant differences in sleep and behavioral characteristics were shown among groups (analysis of variance on rank: F<sub>4,37</sub>=2.36, P=.07 for the sleep_min feature; F<sub>4,37</sub>=9.05, P<.001 for sleep_efficiency; F<sub>4,37</sub>=8.16, P<.001 for active_calorie; F<sub>4,37</sub>=6.53, P<.001 for walks; and F<sub>4,37</sub>=3.51, P=.02 for stairs).

The results showed that worry strategy in the pre-sleep period mediates the relationship between metacognitive functions and sleep quality. Particularly, the ability to understand one's mental states and mastery functions could be the two metacognitive domains primarily involved in the dysfunctional metacognitive thought-control activity responsible for reduced sleep quality. The observed effect suggests that inadequate metacognitive functioning is associated with poor sleep quality in healthy subjects via the mediation of dysfunctional worry strategy.

Its alteration favours the genesis of several organic alterations and diseases including sleep disorders and the consumption of several substances of abuse. It has been reported that the work activity, especially that carried out during the night, is able to influence the sleep-wake cycle, promoting the development of insomnia, which, in turn, would subject the worker to a stressful condition such as to encourage adverse behaviour such as the use/abuse of psychotropic substances. Based on the above premises, the aim of our research was to evaluate, in night workers: (i) the pattern of consumption of alcoholic beverages; (ii) the presence of insomnia; and (iii) the possible correlation between alcohol consumption and insomnia disorder. We used the AUDIT-C test (the abbreviated version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and the Insomnia Severity Index to assess alcohol consumption and insomnia disorder, respectively. All questionnaires were completed by workers of both sexes belonging to different types of work activities, exclusively day or night. The results of our research show a higher propensity of night workers to consume alcoholic beverages than those who work during daytime hours, often in binge-drinking mode. In addition, an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed was found to be related to insomnia disorder, especially in night workers.

{"id": "26004526", "title": "Some implications of melatonin use in chronopharmacology of insomnia.", "text": "The last decade has witnessed the emergence of new chronopharmacological perspectives. In the case of sleep disorders, the accumulating evidence suggests that even a minor dysfunction in the biological clock can impact broadly upon body physiology causing increases in sleep onset latency, phase delays or advances in sleep initiation, frequent nocturnal awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, delayed and shortened rapid eye movement sleep and increased periodic leg movements, among others. Thus, restoration of the adequate circadian pattern of proper sleep hygiene, targeted exposure to light and the use of chronobiotic drugs, such as melatonin, which affect the output phase of clock-controlled circadian rhythms, can help to recover the sleep-wake cycle. The optimization of drug effects and/or minimization of toxicity by timing medications with regard to biological rhythms is known as chronotherapeutics. While chronotherapeutical approaches have been particularly successful in the treatment of hypertension, allergies and some forms of cancer, a time-dependent pharmacological approach can be also effective when dealing with sleep disruptions like insomnia. A large proportion of patients under benzodiazepine (BZD)/Z drug treatment fail to achieve a complete and sustained recovery and are left with residual symptoms, like tolerance or dependency, that make relapse or recurrence more likely, and poorer quality of life a reality. Thus the chronic and extensive use of BZD/Z drugs has become a public health issue and has led to multiple campaigns to reduce both prescription and consumption of BZD/Z-drugs.

{"id": "33314496", "title": "The acute effects of sleep restriction therapy for insomnia on circadian timing and vigilance.", "text": "Sleep-restriction therapy (SRT) has been shown to improve insomnia symptoms by restricting sleep opportunity. Curtailment of time in bed affects the duration and consolidation of sleep, but also its timing. While recent work suggests that people with insomnia are characterised by misalignment between circadian and behavioural timing of sleep, no study has investigated if SRT modifies this relationship. The primary aim of the present study was to examine change in phase angle after 2Â weeks of SRT. As a secondary aim, we also sought to assess the effect of SRT on psychomotor vigilance. Following a 1-week baseline phase, participants implemented SRT for 2 consecutive weeks. Phase angle was derived from the difference between the decimal clock time of dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and attempted sleep time. Secondary outcomes included vigilance (assessed via hourly measurement during the DLMO laboratory protocol), sleep continuity (assessed via sleep diary and actigraphy), and insomnia severity. Eighteen participants meeting insomnia criteria (mean [SD] age 37.06Â [8.99]Â years) took part in the study. Consistent with previous research, participants showed robust improvements in subjective and objective sleep continuity, as well as reductions in insomnia severity. The primary outcome (phase angle) was measurable in 15 participants and revealed an increase of 34.8Â min (~0.58Â hr; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-1.15) from baseline to post-treatment (mean [SD] 2.27Â [0.94] versus 2.85Â [1.25]Â hr). DLMO remained relatively stable (20:49 versus 21:01Â hours), while attempted sleep was 46.8Â min later (~0.78Â hr; 95%CI 0.41-1.15; 23:05 versus 23:52Â hours). For psychomotor vigilance, reaction time was delayed (by 52.71Â ms, 95% CI 34.44-70.97) and number of lapses increased (by 5.84, 95% CI 3.93-7.75) after SRT. We show that SRT increases phase angle during treatment, principally by delaying the timing of sleep attempt. Future studies are needed to test if an increase in phase angle is linked to clinical improvement. Finally, reduction in vigilance after SRT appears to be of similar magnitude to normal sleepers undergoing experimental sleep restriction, reinforcing the importance of appropriate safety advice during implementation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314496/"}

Stress exposure was a significant predictor of insomnia onset, such that the odds of developing insomnia increased by 19% for every additional stressor. Chronicity significantly moderated this relationship, such that the likelihood of developing insomnia as a result of stress exposure increased as a function of chronicity. Cognitive intrusion significantly mediated the association between stress exposure and insomnia. Finally, three specific coping behaviors also acted as mediators: behavioral disengagement, distraction, and substance use. Most studies characterize the relationship between stress exposure and insomnia as a simple dose-response phenomenon. However, our data suggest that certain stressor characteristics significantly moderate this association. Stress response in the form of cognitive intrusion and specific maladaptive coping behaviors mediate the effects of stress exposure. These findings highlight the need for a multidimensional approach to stress assessment in future research and clinical practice. Pillai V, Roth T, Mullins HM, Drake CL.

Difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep affects nearly half of all patients over the age of 65, representing an increased prevalence in older versus younger patients. Nocturnal sleep time is decreased, frequent awakenings occur, and daytime napping is common. Age-related changes in sleep physiology correlate with the subjective complaints of disturbed sleep. Multiple etiologies for insomnia in the elderly have been described. Management strategies must include attention to both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic aspects of care, especially with respect to the altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics associated with advanced age.

Among subjects with diagnosed insomnia, users of prescription hypnotics were compared against nonusers. Of 104,274 adults, 1.3 % (n = 1,401) had an insomnia diagnosis. Of those, 45.6 % (n = 639) used prescription hypnotics. For subjects with insomnia, mean PCS and MCS scores were 9.2 and 7.0 points lower (p < 0.001), respectively. After controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, differences remained significant (PCS:5.1; 6.2; p < 0.001). Among subjects with insomnia, HRQoL scores were not different between prescription hypnotic users (n = 639) and nonusers (n = 762). Analysis by drug class revealed lower PCS scores (difference: 7.5, p < 0.001) with benzodiazepine use (n = 129) versus benzodiazepine receptor agonist use (n = 493), but the adjusted difference was not significant (difference: 3.8, p = .018). Diagnosed insomnia was associated with consistent decreases in both physical and mental HRQoL scores, regardless of whether prescription hypnotics were used. Benzodiazepine use may be associated with a further decrease in physical HRQoL scores. Although limited by its retrospective design, this study provides a first look at real-world hypnotic use outcomes at a national level. Important next steps include studies with patients serving as their own controls, and further evaluation of the sensitivity of HRQoL instruments to the effects of insomnia treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25432884/"}

It is increasingly recognized as a distinct disorder, not merely a symptom arising secondary to another medical or psychiatric illness. The subtypes of sleep disturbance-reports of difficulty falling or staying asleep, insufficient sleep duration, early waking-and the presence of next-day impairment and common comorbid conditions require a targeted, individualized approach to therapy. Challenges exist in treating insomnia with commonly used on- and off-label drugs, including low-dose antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and benzodiazepine receptor agonists because of the risk of adverse effects, including impaired next-day functioning.

For studies involving comparisons between poor sleepers and healthy controls, effect size estimates were computed for task-relevant dependent variables. Six of the nine studies comparing poor sleepers and controls revealed statistically significant group differences in support of a differential sleep-related attentional bias (medium-to-large effect sizes), with flicker, dot-probe and Posner tasks being most sensitive to group effects. Due to the paucity of studies and variability in design and measurement, no conclusions could be reached regarding manipulation or induction of attentional bias in good sleepers.

{"id": "21476952", "title": "Pharmacological advances in the treatment of insomnia.", "text": "Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition, and due to ongoing demand from patients suffering with this condition, new pharmacological treatments are actively being sought. As our neurophysiological understanding of insomnia grows, so too do the available treatment options. A significant advance in the treatment of insomnia came with the development of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications, zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. These medications have shorter durations of action than many traditional benzodiazepines and may be associated with less risk of tolerance and abuse. They have also been demonstrated to be helpful in cases in which insomnia is comorbid with depression or anxiety, leading to beneficial effects not only with sleep but also with mood and anxiety symptoms. Melatonin, a naturally-occurring substance intimately involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm, has also been explored as a hypnotic. Little data to date support its use; however, there is evidence that ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, may be helpful for sleep initiation difficulties. Tri-cyclic antidepressants have long been used for insomnia, but use has been limited by unwanted anticholinergic side effects. Low-dose doxepin, at doses of 3 and 6mg, has been demonstrated to have the unique property among its class of being free of anticholinergic effects at those doses. In addition, it seems to have particular efficacy for sleep maintenance insomnia, exhibiting the most robust effects in the latter third of the night. The hypocretin/orexin system has been identified as a possible target. Almorexant, a hypocretin/orexin antagonist displayed evidence of efficacy during Phase III clinical trials but these trials were recently discontinued due to its side effect profile. Another hypocretin/orexin antagonist with a different mechanism of action, MK-4035, is presently in clinical trials. Serotonin antagonists and inverse agonists have been investigated; however, a recent trial with APD125 was discontinued due to lack of efficacy. Sodium oxybate has been used off-label for insomnia by some providers, although data supporting its use are limited. While the sleep-promoting effects of GABA(A) (nonbenzodiazepines and benzodiazepines) enhancement is well-established, newer research examining other mechanisms of action suggest that agents which modulate the histaminergic, serotonergic, melontonergic, and hypocretin/orexin and perhaps GABA-B systems show promise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476952/"}

We analyzed respondents aged 50+ (born 1920-1969) from the 2006-2018 NHIS (n = 162,400) and HRS (n = 28,918). We fit multinomial models among the NHIS sample predicting age-specific optimal sleep duration (optimal for age vs short for age, and optimal for age vs long for age). For the HRS sample, we fit growth curve models predicting age-based insomnia symptom trajectories. The models for both samples adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment. Results regarding sleep duration in the NHIS, suggested that cohorts born in the 1950s and 1960s had significantly higher odds of reporting short sleep duration than cohorts before them. Results from the HRS similarly illustrated that cohorts born in the 1950s and 1960s had significantly higher levels of insomnia symptoms than those born before them. The worsening sleep among cohorts entering midlife was consistent regardless of alternative cohort specification, when age groups or periods were analyzed, and when more extensive covariates were modeled. We observe a pronounced decline in healthy sleeping patterns among American cohorts in midlife, with consistent and striking results across data sets, methods, and measures. These findings have important implications for the well-being and longevity of Americans who have entered midlife in the 21st century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38364372/"}

Whereas sleep disorders have been studied in a few skin conditions, data in a more comprehensive dermatology population are lacking. We sought to describe the prevalence, causes, and consequences of sleep disorders in dermatology patients. In this cross-sectional, single-center study, dermatology patients completed a questionnaire addressing skin-related and non-skin-related health, sleep behavior, causes, and consequences of sleep disorders. According to the Regensburg Insomnia Scale, 27.92% of the 634 participants had insomnia (177 of 634 patients). Of these 177 patients, 115 (64.97%) were subjectively sleep disturbed, with skin-related causes accounting for 55.65% (64 of 115 patients), non-skin-related accounting for 33.04% (38 of 115 patients), and combined accounting for 11.30% (13 of 115 patients). Itch was the leading cause of skin-related sleep disorders (64.49%, 50 of 77 patients), followed by skin-related pain (55.84%, 43 of 77 patients) and skin-related fearful thoughts (54.55%, 42 of 77 patients). Sleep disorders reduced daytime performance in 68.70% (79 of 115 patients) and sleep quality of relatives in 20.87% (24 of 115 patients). The prevalence of insomnia among different diagnostic categories ranged from 20.31% to 50.00%. The most common strategy to improve sleep was taking sleep medication (57.39%, 66 of 115 patients).

Step-wise regression was conducted with a set of independent variables, with PSAS and HAS serving as separate dependent variables. Trait hyperarousal was associated with higher levels of both negative and positive emotionality, as well as negative beliefs about sleep, in both genders. Pre-sleep arousal was associated with greater negative emotionality and internal sleep locus of control, varying by gender. Among women, high pre-sleep arousal was associated with negative emotionality, while in men greater pre-sleep arousal was associated with an internal sleep locus of control.

We speculated that insomnia subtyping with additional power spectral analysis and measurement of response to acute sleep restriction may be informative in overall assessment of ID. To explore alternative classifications of ID subtypes, insomnia patients (nâ=â99) underwent two consecutive overnight sleep studies: (i) habitual sleep opportunity (polysomnography, PSG) and, (ii) two hours less sleep opportunity (electroencephalography, EEG), with the first night compared to healthy controls (nâ=â25). ID subtypes were derived from data-driven classification of PSG, EEG spectral power and interhemispheric EEG asymmetry index. Three insomnia subtypes with different sleep duration and NREM spectral power were identified.

A systematic review of mechanistic evidence and the introduction of the Triple-R model.", "text": "For over 30 yÂ sleep restriction therapy (SRT) has been used to treat insomnia but we know very little about how this therapy exerts its effects. When SRT was first described, it was hypothesised to treat insomnia by addressing four key factors: strengthening homeostatic sleep pressure, inhibiting perpetuating practices (excessive time in bed), attenuating hyperarousal and tightening regulatory control of sleep by the endogenous circadian pacemaker. We conducted a systematic literature review in search of evidence for these putative mechanisms-of-action. A total of 15 randomised and non-randomised studies investigating SRT met inclusion criteria. For each study, we extracted all variables associated with the proposed mechanisms and assessed study quality using a structured appraisal tool. The extracted variables were: time in bed (TIB), napping, variability in sleep, markers of circadian rhythmicity, measurements of sleep pressure/sleepiness, and assessments of arousal. Overall study quality was poor as indicated by a mean quality score of 17 (out of a possible range of 0-31). No study indicated, or indeed was designed to test, whether changes in the proposed mechanisms act as mediators of treatment outcomes. Of all reviewed studies, most reported a reduction in TIB (10/10) and/or revealed a decrease in sleep onset latency (10/14), indexing increased sleep pressure. However, such changes were most often reported at the end of treatment, reflecting an outcome and not a mechanism of SRT per se. Evidence for reduction in arousal (4/4) and night-to-night sleep variability (2/2) was found in only a small number of uncontrolled studies while there was no evidence for change in circadian phase or periodicity (0/1). Our review suggests that SRT targets some of the hypothesised processes but specifically-designed mechanistic evaluations are needed.

To determine the accuracy of sleep duration perception, we investigated 44 healthy subjects participating in multi-day inpatient sleep protocols during which they had extended nighttime and short daytime sleep opportunities but no time cues or knowledge of time of day. The first sleep opportunity was at habitual sleep time and duration. The subsequent 3, 4, or 11 days had 12-h nighttime sleep opportunities and 4-h daytime nap opportunities, potentially creating an experimentally induced \"insomnia\" with substantial time awake during scheduled sleep. Subjective sleep duration estimates were accurate for the first (habitual) sleep opportunity. The subjective reports following nighttime 12-h sleep opportunities significantly underestimated objective sleep duration, while those following daytime 4-h sleep opportunities significantly overestimated objective sleep duration. Misperception errors were not explained by poor sleep efficiency, which was lower during 4-h (~39%) than 12-h opportunities (~71%). Subjective sleep estimates after 4-h opportunities correlated with the percentage of REM and N3 sleep. Subjective sleep estimates following 12-h opportunities were, unexpectedly, negatively correlated with NREM stage 2 sleep. The estimation of sleep duration in the absence of time cues may depend on length of sleep opportunity and/or time of day.

Next, 15 semistructured interviews about sleep-support technologies were conducted to investigate perceived adherence.

A conventional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the causal links between sleep traits and ED. The summary statistics of ED were from individuals of European ancestry (6175 cases vs 217 630 controls). As shown by the random effect inverse-variance-weighting (IVW) estimator, genetically predicted insomnia was causally associated with a 1.15-fold risk of ED (95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.23, P < 0.001). Sleep duration and morningness were not causally associated with ED, as indicated by the IVW (all P > 0.05). These findings were consistent with the results of sensitivity analyses. Based on genetic data, this study provides causal evidence that genetically predicted insomnia increases the risk of ED, whereas sleep duration and chronotype do not.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35946227/"}

Twenty-seven cancer survivors with persistent insomnia were recruited to this qualitative study following completion of treatment for breast (12), prostate (7), colorectal (7), and gynaecological (1) cancers. Eleven males and 16 females (mean age 62Â years), who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder, contributed to one of four focus group discussions, designed to explore the lived experience of persistent insomnia and its management within cancer care services. Poor sleep was a persistently troubling complaint for participants, long after the completion of active cancer treatment. The impact of insomnia was significant for all participants, with six key domains emerging as those most affected: temperament, sociability, physical well-being, cognitive functioning, relationships, and psychological well-being. In terms of insomnia management, participants frequently resorted to unfruitful self-management strategies, due to the lack of professional insomnia expertise within cancer care settings. Three main themes emerged in relation to insomnia management: self-management, seeking professional intervention, and a lack of focus on sleep. A lack of clinician understanding of the importance of sleep health and the poor availability of evidence-based insomnia interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), were highlighted as important gaps in cancer care. Insomnia was found to have a detrimental and pervasive impact on cancer survivors' quality of life, which persisted long into survivorship. There is an absence of professional attention to sleep throughout the cancer care trajectory, contributing to its prevalence, persistence, and impact. In order to break this cycle, sleep health should be integrated as a key aspect of cancer treatment and rehabilitation, much like maintaining a healthy diet and appropriate levels of physical activity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32558129/"}

The present study was undertaken to assess whether modafinil could be used to reduce daytime fatigue, sleepiness, or both in patients with primary insomnia and whether the pharmacologic augmentation of wakefulness might produce improved sleep by itself or in combination with CBT. 30 subjects with primary insomnia were enrolled in this study and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (1) placebo plus CBT, (2) 100 mg modafinil plus CBT, or (3) 100 mg modafinil plus a contact control (monitor-only condition). Subjects were continuously monitored with sleep diaries from study intake until study end (10 weeks) and were evaluated on a weekly basis for changes in sleepiness. The mean age of the group was 41.3 years (SD, 13.4), and 70.4% of subjects were women. All 3 groups exhibited mean sleep latency and wake after sleep-onset times that were more than 30 minutes in duration. The mean pretreatment sleep profiles did not significantly differ. Modafinil, when administered alone, did not significantly affect the patients' sleep profiles. A trend, however, was evident for improved sleep latency. Modafinil, as an adjunct to CBT, tended to (1) reduce daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and (2) enhance compliance with CBT. With respect to the latter, subjects in the modafinil plus CBT group more reliably adhered to the prescribed phase delay in bedtime than did the placebo plus CBT group. These data suggest that modafinil may be used to diminish the negative side effects of CBT (increased daytime sleepiness) and may increase subject compliance with therapy. Whether enhanced daytime function mediates the change in adherence and whether reduced sleepiness and enhanced compliance translate to less patient attrition in the clinical setting remain to be evaluated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15283007/"}

Low energy emission therapy (LEET) has been developed as a potential alternative therapy for this disorder. LEET consists of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields delivered intrabuccally by means of an electrically conducting mouthpiece in direct contact with the oral mucosa. The effect of LEET on chronic psychophysiological insomnia was assessed with polysomnography (PSG) and sleep rating forms on a total of 106 patients at two different centers. Active or inactive LEET was administered for 20 minutes in late afternoon three times a week for a total of 12 treatments. Primary efficacy endpoints evaluating the results were changes from baseline in PSG-assessed total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency (SL). Secondary endpoints were changes in sleep efficiency (SE), sleep stages, and reports by the subjects of SL and TST. There was a significant increase in TST as assessed by PSG between baseline and post-treatment values for the active treatment group (76.0 +/- 11.1 minutes, p = 0.0001). The increase for the inactive treatment group was not statistically significant. The TST improvement was significantly greater for the active group when compared to the inactive group (adjusted for baseline TST; p = 0.020. R1 = 0.20). There was a significant decrease in SL as assessed by PSG between baseline and post-treatment values for the active treatment group (-21.6 +/- 5.9 minutes, p = 0.0006), whereas the decrease noted for the inactive treatment group was not statistically significant. The difference in SL decrease between the two treatment groups was marginally significant (adjusted for baseline SL and center, p = 0.068, R2 = 0.60). The number of sleep cycles per night increased by 30% after active treatment (p = 0.0001) but was unchanged following inactive treatment. Subjects did not experience rebound insomnia, and there were no significant side effects. The data presented in this report indicate that LEET administered for 20 minutes three times a week increased TST and reduced SL in chronic psychophysiological insomnia. LEET is safe and well tolerated and it effectively improved the sleep of chronic insomniacs given 12 treatments over a 4-week period by increasing the number of sleep cycles without altering the percentage of the various sleep stages during the night. The therapeutic action of LEET differs from that of currently available drug therapies in that the sleep pattern noted in insomniacs following LEET treatment more closely resembles nocturnal physiological sleep. This novel treatment may offer an attractive alternative therapy for chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8776791/"}

The study used a four-group parallel design (n=86) to investigate the effects of 12 h of night-time, including polysomnographically monitored sleep ('sleep condition' in PI and GSC), versus 12 h of daytime wakefulness ('wake condition' in PI and GSC) on procedural (mirror tracing task) and declarative memory consolidation (visual and verbal learning task). Demographic characteristics and memory encoding did not differ between the groups at baseline. Polysomnography revealed a significantly disturbed sleep profile in PI compared to GSC in the sleep condition. Night-time periods including sleep in GSC were associated with (i) a significantly enhanced procedural and declarative verbal memory consolidation compared to equal periods of daytime wakefulness in GSC and (ii) a significantly enhanced procedural memory consolidation compared to equal periods of daytime wakefulness and night-time sleep in PI. Across retention intervals of daytime wakefulness, no differences between the experimental groups were observed. This pattern of results suggests that healthy sleep fosters the consolidation of new memories, and that this process is impaired for procedural memories in patients with PI.

Chronic 'true' insomnia is described in terms of precipitating events: fixed behavioural patterns which perpetuate it and the disordered timing of electrophysiological and hormonal events. Specific behavioural factors relevant to an individual patient's insomnia must be identified. The factors are: (i) the patient's expectations of the experience of going to sleep and his/her belief that he can or cannot control the onset of sleep, (ii) the patients' personal theory of the cause of the problem, (iii) what the patient says to himself privately about the problem, (iv) the presence of stimuli in the sleep setting which arouse the patients including objects, persons and behavioural rituals.

We explored whether insomnia with physiological hyperarousal measured by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is associated with body-weight differences. A total of 185 normal sleepers and 440 insomniacs were included in this study. Insomnia was defined by standard diagnostic criteria with symptoms lasting â¥6 months. All subjects underwent one night of laboratory polysomnography followed by a standard MSLT. We used the median MSLT value (i.e., â¥14âmin) to define physiological hyperarousal. BMI was based on measured height (cm) and weight (kg) during the subjects' sleep laboratory visit. BMIâ>â25âkg/m<sup>2</sup> was defined as overweight, while BMIâ<â18.5âkg/m<sup>2</sup> was defined as underweight. After controlling for confounders, the odds of lower weight rather than overweight were significantly increased among insomnia patients with increased MSLT: insomnia with MSLT 14-17âmin and MSLTâ>â17âmin increased the odds of lower weight by approximately 89% (ORâ=â1.89, 95% CI 1.00-4.85) and 273% (ORâ=â3.73, 95% CI 1.51-9.22) compared with normal sleepers, respectively. In contrast, insomnia in patients with MSLT 11-14âmin and 8-11âmin was not different from normal sleepers in terms of body weight.

Twelve consecutive days of acute light treatment were followed by a 3-mo maintenance light-treatment period. Subjects completed laboratory evaluation sessions on five separate occasions (prior to and following the acute light-treatment period, and once per month during the maintenance period). During each laboratory session, performance levels, sleep, and core body temperature were measured. The performance battery consisted of four computerized tasks (Logical Reasoning, Stroop Congruency, Two Letter Visual Search, and Wilkinson Four-Choice Reaction Time) and was administered every 2 h between 10.00 and 18.00 hours. Subjects improved significantly on three of the four tasks from pre-BL to post-BL. During the maintenance period, subjects who received active BL treatment maintained significantly higher performance levels than a control BL group. Light treatment improved sleep efficiency and delayed the phase of the body temperature rhythm. Performance improvements were significantly related only to sleep and not to circadian phase. The implications for non-circadian treatments of sleep maintenance insomnia and cognitive functioning in the elderly are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956206/"}

It is unknown whether insomnia that develops in the context of the menopausal transition (MT) impacts the CV system. We assessed nocturnal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) profiles in women with insomnia disorder in the MT. Twelve women meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia in the MT (age, meanâÂ±âSD: 50.5âÂ±â3.6 y) and 11 controls (age, meanâÂ±âSD: 49.0âÂ±â3.0 y) had polysomnographic recordings on one or two nights during which beat-to-beat BP and HR were assessed and analyzed hourly from lights-out across the first 6 hours of the night and according to sleep stage. Physiological hot flashes were identified from fluctuations in sternal skin conductance. Women with insomnia and controls had similar distributions of sleep stages and awakenings/arousals across hours of the night, although insomnia participants tended to have more wakefulness overall. More women in the insomnia group (7 of 12) than in the control group (2 of 11) had at least one physiological hot flash at night (Pâ<â0.05). Both groups showed a drop in BP in the first part of the night; however, systolic and diastolic BP patterns diverged later, remaining low in controls but increasing in insomnia participants 4 to 6 hours after lights-out (Pâ<â0.05).

The disorders also contribute to significant cognitive, emotional, and physical health challenges. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the US population. It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early-morning waking and is linked to daytime distress and impairment. Common sleep disruptors include environmental factors such as noise, light, and air pollution and also personal habits such as excessive screen use before bedtime. Evaluating patients with insomnia in primary care requires integrating sleep health assessments into routine visits and use of insomnia screening tools and sleep diaries for accurate diagnosis. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia are the preferred treatments. Pharmacotherapy or combination therapy (with cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and pharmacotherapy) may be considered when these interventions are ineffective. Family physicians should weigh the risks and benefits of insomnia medication use carefully for all patients but especially for older adults because of potential adverse effects.

Currently available insomnia medications demonstrate notable side effect profiles and lack well-established evidence regarding their sustained efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Banxia Shumi decoction (BXSMD) in insomnia and the molecular mechanism involved. The effect of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway on BSXMD treatment of insomnia was investigated by using p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) induced insomnia male rat model. The results of open field test, Morris water maze and hypnosis experiments implied that circadian dysrhythmia, increased open-field activity, decreased sleep quality and learning and memory impairments were observed in insomnia male rat. Besides, the levels of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway, 5-HT, MT, MT1 and MT2 were reduced, accompanied with neural tissue damage in insomnia male rats by ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, immunohistochemistry and HE staining. BXSMD alleviated neural tissue damage and improved sleep quality along with cognitive functions (learning and memory) in insomnia male rats. Moreover, BXSMD caused activation of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway and upregulation of 5-HT, MT, MT1 and MT2 levels in insomnia male rats. BDNF overexpression-mediated activation of BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway enhanced the pharmacological effects of BXSMD described above. Notably, MT1/MT2 antagonist attenuated the therapeutic effects of BXSMD on sleep disturbances and neural tissue damage in insomnia male rats, while BDNF knockdown in the hippocampus suppressed BXSMD-mediated activation of MT signaling, sleep enhancement, and neuroprotection. In summary, this study elucidated that BXSMD enhanced MT signaling by activating BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in the hippocampus, thereby ameliorating sleep disorders and neural damage in insomnia male rats.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40991085/"}

Although no significant differences across trimesters were found on the three sleep factors, Sleep Duration and Quality, and Insomnia were worst during the first trimester. Sleep normalized in the second trimester, but the third trimester was characterized by increased Insomnia and decreased Daytime Alertness. The most frequent reasons cited by women for sleep alterations were urinary frequency, backache or ache in the hips and fetal movement.

The sleep diary variable corresponding to the same one night of PSG was used to calculate the sleep discrepancy (diary minus PSG parameter) variables for total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. Regression analyses determined independent and interactive (with insomnia status) associations between cognition and sleep discrepancy, controlling for age, sex, apnea-hypopnea index, and sleep medication usage. Working memory interacted with insomnia status in associations with sleep discrepancy related to TST and sleep efficiency. In those with insomnia, worse working memory was associated with shorter self-reported TST (pâ=â.008) and lower sleep efficiency (pâ=â.04) than PSG measured. In older adults with insomnia, worse working memory may be a contributing factor to sleep discrepancy.

The interviews were conducted using the Sleep-Eval knowledge-based system, a nonmonotonic, level 2 expert system with a causal reasoning mode. Questions investigated nightmares, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), definition, psychopathological traits, and included 12 other groups of information, including sociodemographics, sleep-wake schedule, daytime functioning, psychiatric and medical history, and drug intake. The data from 1,049 subjects suffering from insomnia were considered for this analysis. Bivariate analyses, logistic regression analysis using the method of indicator contrasts for the investigation of independent variables, and calculation of significant odds ratios were performed. Nightmares were reported in 18.3% of the surveyed insomniac population and were two times higher in women than in men. The following factors were found to be significantly associated with nightmares 1) sleep with many awakenings, 2) abnormally long sleep onset, 3) daytime memory impairment following poor nocturnal sleep, 4) daytime anxiety following poor nocturnal sleep, and 5) being a woman. There was a strong association between the report of nightmares in women and the presence of either a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or both disorders together. When the effects of major psychiatric disorders were controlled for, nightmares were significantly associated with being a woman, feeling depressed after a poor night's sleep, and complaining of a long sleep latency. Nightmares can lead to a negative conditioning toward sleep and to chronic sleep complaints. Considering the frequency of nightmares in an adult insomniac population and the significant relationship between nightmares and certain subgroups, nightmares should receive more attention in patients, especially women complaining of disrupted sleep, as high rates of psychiatric disorders were found in this specific group.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9381055/"}

Assessing and treating insomnia and related conditions of sleep loss during peripartum should be a priority in the clinical practice. The aim of this paper was to conduct a systematic review on insomnia evaluation and treatment during peripartum which may be useful for clinicians. The literature review was carried out between January 2000 and May 2021 on the evaluation and treatment of insomnia during the peripartum period. The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase electronic databases were searched for literature published according to the PRISMA guidance with several combinations of search terms \"insomnia\" and \"perinatal period\" or \"pregnancy\" or \"post partum\" or \"lactation\" or \"breastfeeding\" and \"evaluation\" and \"treatment.\" Based on this search, 136 articles about insomnia evaluation and 335 articles on insomnia treatment were found and we conducted at the end a narrative review. According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 41 articles were selected for the evaluation part and 22 on the treatment part, including the most recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Evaluation of insomnia during peripartum, as for insomnia patients, may be conducted at least throughout a clinical interview, but specific rating scales are available and may be useful for assessment. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), as for insomnia patients, should be the preferred treatment choice during peripartum, and it may be useful to also improve mood, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue. Pharmacological treatment may be considered when women who present with severe forms of insomnia symptoms do not respond to nonpharmacologic therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35419652/"}

In many studies, sleep duration and/or quality have also been found to be related to human health. The purpose of this narrative review was to present the relationship between the Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet and sleep quality and duration in different populations. A literature search was conducted based on the phrases \"Mediterranean diet\", \"DASH diet\", and \"MIND diet\" appearing together with \"sleep\" or \"insomnia\" in papers' titles or abstracts. Studies on obstructive sleep apnea or shift work were excluded. The electronic databases were searched via EBSCOhost. Main results: The vast majority of studies showed that there was a beneficial association between the three diets discussed in this review and sleep duration and/or quality; however, most of these results were obtained in cross-sectional analyses. There were only a few studies in which an association between sleep parameters and these diets was not observed. Direction for future studies: Taking into account the significant role of adequate sleep quality in various diseases, even in all-cause mortality, the implementation of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies seems to be necessary to provide further evidence that would allow these associations to be confirmed. In conclusion, the results obtained so far in various populations strongly suggest that healthy dietary patterns abundant in plant foods, are associated with better sleep quality, as well as with a more adequate length of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683584/"}

Data were collected in 2013 and 2014. Four questions were asked on habitual time for sleeping and waking on weekdays and weekends, with 24 possible answers, one for each hour of the day. Analysis of inconsistencies considered the distribution of frequencies of answers as to sleeping and waking times, in addition to compatibility with the school shift. Sleep duration during the week and on weekends was obtained by the difference between sleeping and waking times, and differences of â¤ 4 or â¥ 14 hours were excluded. Mean total sleep duration in seven days was calculated by the formula (weekday sleep duration x 5 + weekend sleep duration x 2)/7.

Sixty-two elderly participants were randomly assigned to either BBT-I or self-monitoring and attention control (SMAC). Sleep was assessed by sleep diaries and actigraphy from baseline to posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up. Mixed models were used to examine changes in sleep variability (within-person standard deviations of weekly sleep parameters) and the hypothesized mediation and moderation effects.

It is conceivable that sleep fragmentation by arousals, a key characteristic of insomnia disorder, could hamper the downregulation of distress. In this study, we sought further support for the idea that insomnia disorder may involve a lasting deficiency to downregulate emotional distress. We used functional MRI in insomnia disorder (n = 27) and normal sleepers (n = 30) to identify how brain activation differs between novel and relived self-conscious emotions. We evaluated whether brain activity elicited by reliving emotional memories from the distant past resembles the activity elicited by novel emotional experiences more in insomnia disorder than in normal sleepers. Limbic areas were activated during novel shameful experiences as compared to neutral experiences in both normal sleepers and insomnia disorder. In normal sleepers, reliving of shameful experiences from the past did not elicit a limbic response. In contrast, participants with insomnia disorder recruited overlapping parts of the limbic circuit, in particular the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, during both new and relived shameful experiences. The differential activity patterns with new and old emotions in normal sleepers suggest that reactivation of the long-term memory trace does not recruit the limbic circuit. The overlap of activations in insomnia disorder is in line with the hypothesis that the disorder involves a deficiency to dissociate the limbic circuit from the emotional memory trace. Moreover, the findings provide further support for a role of the anterior cingulate cortex in insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31135050/"}

Given that little is known about the impact of light pollution on sleep in wild animals, we tested how experimentally elevated light levels affected sleep behaviour of female songbirds rearing 10Â day old chicks. Using a within-subject design, individual sleep behaviour was observed over three consecutive nights in great tits (Parus major), with females sleeping in a natural dark situation on the first and third night, whereas on the second night they were exposed to a light-emitting diode (1.6 lux). Artificial light in the nest box dramatically and significantly affected sleep behaviour, causing females to fall asleep later (95Â min; while entry time was unaffected), wake up earlier (74Â min) and sleep less (56%). Females spent a greater proportion of the night awake and the frequency of their sleep bouts decreased, while the length of their sleep bouts remained equal. Artificial light also increased begging of chicks at night, which may have contributed to the sleep disruption in females or vice versa. The night following the light treatment, females slept 25% more compared to the first night, which was mainly achieved by increasing the frequency of sleep bouts. Although there was a consistent pattern in how artificial light affected sleep, there was also large among-individual variation in how strongly females were affected. When comparing current results with a similar experiment during winter, our results highlight differences in effects between seasons and underscore the importance of studying light pollution during different seasons. Our study shows that light pollution may have a significant impact on sleep behaviour in free-living animals during the reproductive season, which may provide a potential mechanism by which artificial light affects fitness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27179331/"}

Two Academic Medical Centers, United States, and an online survey of healthy controls. Individuals seeking bariatric surgery (n = 427) completed presurgical psychological evaluations at 2 comprehensive bariatric surgery programs. Data on medical co-morbidities and from self-report questionnaires on sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, and depression were abstracted from charts. Data from controls (n = 180) were collected using an online survey tool and compared with bariatric cases. Across study sites, 40.4% of bariatric cases took at least 30 minutes to fall asleep, 46.7% had insufficient total sleep time (<6.5 hr), 65.1% reported general poor sleep quality, and 30.8% reported clinically significant insomnia symptoms. Approximately 20% of the variance in poor sleep quality and insomnia was explained by body mass index, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, and depression. Cases and controls were similar, although bariatric cases reported significantly poorer sleep efficiency. Our results suggest that similar to a control population, the majority of patients seeking bariatric surgery are experiencing sleep difficulties.

Insomnia in neurological disorders stems from a variety of factors, encompassing physical and neuropsychiatric factors, behavioral patterns, and disruptions in the biological clock and circadian rhythm. There are bidirectional connections between neurological disorders and insomnia. Insomnia in neurological disorders worsens symptoms, resulting in heightened depressive symptoms, elevated mortality rates, reduced quality of life, and intensified acute symptoms. Managing comorbid sleep disorders, especially in the presence of psychiatric comorbidities, is crucial. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line recommendation for insomnia management in neurological disorders. Other treatments are second-line strategies. Melatonin may demonstrate effectiveness in addressing insomnia, with soporific and chronobiotic effects. Furthermore, it has the potential to alleviate \"sundowning\" and behavioral disturbances, while generally being well-tolerated. Other treatment options that may be of interest include morning bright light therapy, sedative antidepressants, new orexin dual antagonists and levodopa specifically indicated for Parkinson's disease. Benzodiazepines and z-drugs can be used primarily during acute phases to prevent pharmacotolerance and minimize side effects. However, they should be avoided in patients with neurological disorders and not used in patients over 75 years old due to the risk of falls and confusion.

Under controlled laboratory conditions, light at night (LAN) suppresses melatonin secretion, delays the internal biological rhythm, and reduces sleepiness. Therefore, LAN exposure may cause circadian misalignment and insomnia, though it remains unclear in real-life situations whether LAN exposure is associated with insomnia. To evaluate an association between LAN exposure and sleep quality in home settings, we conducted a cross-sectional community-based study in 857 elderly individuals (mean age, 72.2 years). We evaluated bedroom light intensity using a light meter and subjectively and objectively measured sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and an actigraph, respectively, along with urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion. Compared with the lowest quartile group of LAN intensity, the highest quartile group revealed a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) for subjective insomnia in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, daytime physical activity, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, bedtime, rising time, and day length (adjusted OR, 1.61, 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.45, p=0.029). In addition, higher OR for subjective insomnia was significantly associated with the increase in quartiles of LAN intensity (ptrend=0.043). Consistently, we observed significant association trends between the increase in quartiles of LAN intensity and poorer actigraphic sleep quality, including decreased sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep-onset latency, increased wake-after-sleep onset, shortened total sleep time, and delayed sleep-mid time in multivariate models adjusted for the covariates mentioned above (all ptrend<0.001).

Functional connectivity was analyzed using coherence (COH) across multiple frequency bands.

The ID group revealed sleep stage-specific alterations in brain network functional connectivity, with enhanced alpha connectivity being observed in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increased delta connectivity in both phasic and tonic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. Increased alpha band connectivity in anterior-posterior networks during wakefulness was associated with emotional regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses showed that alpha and delta band connectivity between frontal-occipital regions mediated the relationship between insomnia and emotional dysregulation. These findings reveal the pattern of functional connectivity is differently changed in insomnia disorder across wakefulness and sleep states, and such connectivities play a mediation rolein relationship between chronic sleep disruption and emotional regulation in insomnia disorder.

These inconsistencies may be due to methodological issues related to the affective valence of the sleep-related stimuli.

The current study addresses this by controlling the affective valence of sleep-related words. A total of 107 participants [mean ageÂ =Â 33.22Â years, standard deviation (SD)Â =Â 12.31Â years; 61.7% female] were recruited during an evening event at the Newcastle Science Festival.

Good and poor sleepers were categorized using the PSQI. There were no significant differences between groups on response latency to sleep-related words (t(105) = -0.30, PÂ =Â 0.76). However, the interaction between good versus poor sleepers and word-type on response latency was significant (F(2,210) = 3.06, PÂ <Â 0.05). Poor sleepers took longer to respond to sleep-related words (meanÂ =Â 723.35, SDÂ =Â 172.55) compared to threat words (meanÂ =Â 694.63, SD = 162.17) than good sleepers (meanÂ =Â 713.20, SDÂ =Â 166.32; and meanÂ =Â 716.65, SDÂ =Â 181.14). The results demonstrate the presence of an attention bias towards sleep-related stimuli compared to threat stimuli in poor sleepers. Accordingly, poor sleepers may be consumed by stimuli relevant to their specific difficulties, as well as being more highly attuned to negative cues that signal anxious states. Thus, the present research suggests that there are two opposing forces at play: one which facilitates performance (non-specific threats) and one which hinders performance (personally relevant threats).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23398166/"}

It also assessed whether sleep-onset insomniacs differ from sleep-maintenance/mixed insomniacs in the relations of these variables to sleep parameters. Fourteen sleep-onset insomniacs, 13 sleep-maintenance or mixed insomniacs and 13 normal sleepers were recruited using two sequential questionnaires. The groups differed significantly on diagnostically relevant sleep parameters, assessed over 1 week by sleep diary. After completing standard anxiety, anger and depression inventories, subjects participated in two laboratory procedures during which electrophysiological responses were recorded: orienting response habituation and emotional stress elicitation. The 28 significant correlations of sleep parameters with emotion, habituation and stress measures averaged r = 0.415. In multiple regression analyses, emotion, attention and stress variables accounted for an average of 41% of the variance in sleep parameters (mean R = 0.64). Discriminant function analysis using these variables correctly classified 66% of the subjects into the three groups.

This type of data, however, can provide a more rounded understanding of their impact, utility, reach, and adoption. Findings presented here focus on outcome and patient engagement data of SHUTi (Sleep Health Using the Internet), a digital therapeutic delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), in a large real-world dataset of adults with insomnia. 7216 adults who purchased access to SHUTi between December 2015 and February 2019 are included in the analysis. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was administered at the beginning of each of six treatment Cores of the intervention. Users entered sleep diaries between Cores to track changes in sleep over time and obtain tailored sleep recommendations. Number of Cores completed and sleep diaries entered indicate program usage. Users showed a reduction in mean ISI scores and a corresponding increase in effect size at the start of each subsequent Core (compared to Core 1) (range: dÂ =Â 0.3-1.9). Effect sizes at the last Core relative to the first were moderate-to-large for diary-derived sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset. A reduction in number of medicated nights was also found, with those with severe insomnia showing the largest reduction from last-to-first week of treatment (dÂ =Â 0.3). At the last Core, 61% met criteria for meaningful treatment response (reduction of >7 points on ISI) and 40% met criteria for remission (ISI<8). Engagement was comparable to SHUTi research trials. Consistent with controlled trials, real-world data suggest that digital therapeutics can result in relatively high levels of engagement and clinically meaningful sleep improvements.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35405424/"}

Specifically, the number and density of spontaneous K-complexes were studied in psychophysiological insomnia sufferers. This study took place in a sleep and event-related potentials laboratory. Spontaneous K-complexes were scored during Stage 2 sleep on the second and third nights of a four-consecutive-nights protocol of polysomnographic recordings.

Seven interventions and eight sleep prevalence or sleep-associated factor papers were identified. Intervention research was very limited and the quality of the research design was generally poor. Interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), yoga and mindfulness can be beneficial in a prison setting. This review identified a high prevalence of insomnia in prisons across the world, which was supported by recent evidence. Factors associated with insomnia include anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorder and pain. There is a need for appropriately powered randomised control trials of CBT-I in prisons and a need to use objective measures of sleep quality.

Stratified analyses were conducted to examine whether the associations varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Approximately 35.6 % of young adults slept <7 h, 41.9 % had insomnia, 4.4 % had sleep disorder, and 8.5 % had sleep apnea. More females had insomnia than males (48.6 vs. 35.9 %, P < 0.001). US-born young adults had more sleep disturbances than their foreign-born counterparts. Compared with those sleeping 7-8 h, the adjusted odds ratio of poor general health was 1.60 (95 % confidence interval, 1.08-2.35) for individuals sleeping 6-7 h and 1.88 (1.23-2.86) for those sleeping <6 h. Similar results were found for low mental HRQOL and overall HRQOL. Insomnia, long sleep latency, troubling falling asleep, daytime sleepiness, and frequent sleeping pill use were significantly associated with low mental HRQOL and overall HRQOL. The associations between sleep disturbances and low HRQOL varied little by sex, race/ethnicity, and country of birth.

One hundred seventy-three females with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer were tracked from diagnosis for 12 months. Participants completed monthly sleep assessments using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and 3 monthly health-related quality-of-life assessments using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Breast (EORTC QLQ-C30-BR23) scale. Clinical data on disease status and treatment regimens were also assessed. Prior to diagnosis, 25% of participants reported sleep disturbance, including 8% with insomnia syndrome (IS). Prevalence increased at cancer diagnosis to 46% (18% IS) and remained stable thereafter at around 50% (21% IS). We also explored sleep status transitions. The most common pattern was to remain a good sleeper (34%-49%) or to persist with insomnia (23%-46%). Seventy-seven percent of good sleepers developed insomnia during the 12-month period and 54% went into insomnia remission.

A confidential survey assessed child sleep problems, maternal sleep duration, parental self-efficacy and depressive symptoms in 477 Australian mothers of children aged 3âmonths to 5âyears. We found no relationship between child age and maternal depression, supporting our decision to look beyond postpartum depression. Robust bootstrapped mediation modelling tested the hypothesis that both maternal sleep duration and parental self-efficacy would mediate child sleep problems as predictors of maternal depression. After controlling for child age, results showed a significant parallel mediation effect, demonstrating that maternal sleep duration and parental self-efficacy both mediate the relationship between child sleep problems on maternal depression. While the total effect of child sleep problems on maternal depression was statistically significant, after partialling out the effects of other variables, child sleep problems no longer predicted maternal depression. Akaike information criterion analyses supported the full model, with both mediators explaining meaningful variance in maternal depression. This study expands our knowledge beyond the postpartum period, and divulges the disparate effects of sleep deprivation and parental self-efficacy on the relationship between child sleep and depression in early motherhood.

Sleep initiation is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and endogenous melatonin, both of which are influenced by environmental light. Exposure to evening light is hypothesized to cause circadian phase delay and melatonin suppression before bedtime, resulting in circadian misalignment and sleep-onset insomnia; however, whether exposure to evening light disturbs sleep initiation in home settings remains unclear. In this longitudinal analysis of 192 elderly individuals (mean age: 69.9 years), we measured evening light exposure and sleep-onset latency for 4 days using a wrist actigraph incorporating a light meter and an accelerometer. Mixed-effect linear regression analysis for repeated measurements was used to evaluate the effect of evening light exposure on subsequent sleep-onset latency. The median intensity of evening light exposure and the median sleep-onset latency were 27.3âlux (interquartile range, 17.9-43.4) and 17âmin (interquartile range, 7-33), respectively. Univariate models showed significant associations between sleep-onset latency and age, gender, daytime physical activity, in-bed time, day length and average intensity of evening and nighttime light exposures. In a multivariate model, log-transformed average intensity of evening light exposure was significantly associated with log-transformed sleep-onset latency independent of the former potential confounding factors (regression coefficient, 0.133; 95% CI, 0.020-0.247; pâ=â0.021). Day length and nighttime light exposure were also significantly associated with log-transformed sleep-onset latency (pâ=â0.001 and pâ<â0.001, respectively). In conclusion, exposure to evening light in home setting prolongs subsequent sleep-onset latency in the elderly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24147658/"}

For each patient the examinations were performed consecutively during, one week of pre-treatment (PRE) and post-treatment (POST; 2.0 +/- 1.1 months), using objective (wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep log) measurements. The results were as follows. (1) Subjectively, total sleep time increased and sleep latency shortened significantly at POST compared with PRE. (2) Objectively, the numbers of times of waking decreased, sleep efficiency increased and mean activity in sleep decreased significantly at POST compared with PRE. (3) Dissociations between subjective and objective evaluations about awakening time, total sleep time and sleep latency at PRE improved significantly at POST. From the above-mentioned results, it was suggested that the lack of dissociations between subjective and objective evaluations at POST showed psychophysiologically the reconstruction of sleep a preventing association and breaking free from the entrapment of insomnia.

In this chapter, we review the links between sleep and immunity, focusing on immune changes occurring in the insomnia disorder. During physiological sleep, there is a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-Î±) and a decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). Examinations of ratios of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines allow to identify rather a pro-inflammatory activity at the beginning of the night and confirm then anti-inflammatory during the second part of the night. Immune cells, as NK-cells, decrease in the blood, due to their migration to secondary lymphoid organs, but their activity increases. Inversely, a short sleep duration appears associated with increased inflammatory processes and increased risk of infection.Only few studies have investigated changes in immunity in patients with insomnia disorder. These studies suggest that insomnia disorder is related to deregulation of the immune system, with an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and change in rate of secretion and a decrease in the level of lymphocyte. Insomnia treatments, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I), seems to have a restorative effect not only on sleep, but also on the associated inflammation. Melatonin also seems to reduce inflammation in patients suffering from insomnia disorder.More studies are necessary to better understand the pathophysiology of changes in immune system in patients suffering from insomnia disorders and their clinical implications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36949314/"}

The interest in complementary and alternative medicines for treating or preventing insomnia has increased recently. Centuries-old herbal treatments, popular for their safety and effectiveness, include valerian, passionflower, lemon balm, lavender, and Californian poppy. These herbal medicines have been shown to reduce sleep latency and increase subjective and objective measures of sleep quality. Research into their molecular components revealed that their sedative and sleep-promoting properties rely on interactions with various neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a major role in controlling different vigilance states. GABA receptors are the targets of many pharmacological treatments for insomnia, such as benzodiazepines. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of studies assessing the mechanisms of action of various herbal medicines on different subtypes of GABA receptors in the context of sleep control. Currently available evidence suggests that herbal extracts may exert some of their hypnotic and anxiolytic activity through interacting with GABA receptors and modulating GABAergic signaling in the brain, but their mechanism of action in the treatment of insomnia is not completely understood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33561990/"}

The difference between the groups in terms of PSG was: for the wakefulness time during sleep 16.3% (<i>p</i><0.005), for the number of awakenings during sleep 12.8% (<i>p</i><0.001), for the latency of falling asleep 13.9% (<i>p</i><0.05), for micro-activation index 14.6% (<i>p</i><0.05), for sleep efficiency 4.9% (<i>p</i><0.05).

Especially, persons with age over 60 years frequently suffer from arousal during sleep and early-morning awakening. The reason of this phenomenon can be explained by age-related change in sleepwake regulation, comorbid diseases and psycho-social status. Benzodiazepine derivatives and benzodiazepine agonists have been widely used for treatment of insomnia. These GABA-A receptor agonist hypnotics have sedative effect, possibly causing various adverse events, i.e. falls and hip fracture, anterograde amnesia, next morning hangover especially in the elderly. When making a choice of treatment drugs for the elderly, low dose benzodiazepine hypnotics with relatively high Î©1-selectivity, and newer hypnotics including melatonic receptor agonist or orexin receptor antagonist can become important candidates considering their comorbid diseases or drug interaction with other medications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26065134/"}

Benzodiazepines formed the mainline therapy for many years till the advent of newer nonbenzodiazepine group of drugs including zolpidem. Zolpidem is an imidazo-pyridine compound that enhances the GABA(A) receptor function by interaction with Omega-1 receptor subtype. Its pharmacokinetic profile allows the patients to use it later in the night when having trouble falling asleep without any residual cognitive impairment the next morning.

Insomnia is a significant public health problem because of its high prevalence and management challenges. There is increasing evidence of a strong association between insomnia and various medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Diagnosis of insomnia and treatment planning rely on a thorough sleep history to address contributing and precipitating factors as well as maladaptive behaviors resulting in poor sleep. Using a sleep diary or sleep log is more accurate than patient recall to determine sleep patterns. A sleep study is not routinely indicated for evaluation of insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the mainstay of treatment and is a safe and effective approach. The key challenge of CBT-I is the lack of clinicians to implement it.

This study is based on baseline data collected in a randomized clinical trial comparing CBT-I to acupuncture for cancer survivors with insomnia (Garland, Gehrman, Barg, Xie, & Mao, 2016).

The control group was composed of 18 healthy individuals (mean age 37+/-8 years). Sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of the patients was analyzed with period amplitude analysis (PAA) and associated algorithms, during chronic BZD use (Night 1), and after 15 days of a valerian placebo trial (initiated after washout of BZD, Night 2). Sleep of control subjects was monitored in parallel. Valerian subjects reported significantly better subjective sleep quality than placebo ones, after BZD withdrawal, despite the presence of a few side effects. However, some of the differences found in sleep structure between Night 1 and Night 2 in both the valerian and placebo groups may be due to the sleep recovery process after BZD washout. Example of this are: the decrease in Sleep Stage 2 and in sigma count; the increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and delta count, which were found to be altered by BZD ingestion. There was a significant decrease in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) in valerian subjects when compared to placebo subjects; results were similar to normal controls. Nonetheless, valerian-treated patients also presented longer sleep latency and increased alpha count in SWS than control subjects. The decrease in WASO associated with the mild anxiolytic effect of valerian appeared to be the major contributor to subjective sleep quality improvement found after 2-week of treatment in insomniacs who had withdrawn from BDZs. Despite subjective improvement, sleep data showed that valerian did not produce faster sleep onset; the increase in alpha count compared with normal controls may point to residual hyperarousabilty, which is known to play a role in insomnia. Nonetheless, we lack data on the extent to which a sedative drug can improve alpha sleep EEG.

To identify individualized treatment strategies, it is important to understand the potentially different mechanisms influencing subjective and PSG-determined sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent three major components of insomnia models, i.e., sleep effort, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, and presleep arousal, are associated with subjective insomnia severity and PSG-determined sleep. A sample of 47 patients with primary insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria and 52 good sleeper controls underwent 2 nights of PSG and completed the Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale, the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale and the Insomnia Severity Index. Regression analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of the three predictors on subjective insomnia severity and PSG- determined total sleep time. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, depressive symptoms and group status. The results showed that subjective insomnia severity was associated positively with sleep effort. PSG-determined total sleep time was associated negatively with somatic presleep arousal and dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep. This pattern of results provides testable hypotheses for prospective studies on the impact of distinct cognitive and somatic variables on subjective insomnia severity and PSG-determined total sleep time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25773981/"}

This paper presents a modified version of sleep training which aims to improve sleep but reduce crying in children and increase compliance in parents. Thirty-three children (Mean [SD] age = 27.01 [13.4] mths) from a clinical non-controlled population presenting with Behavioural Insomnia of Childhood, utilised a five-week sleep training method that teaches parents to gradually withdraw their assistance, allowing them to attend and calm their child whenever they choose and not to ignore their cries, components that differ from commonly utilised methods. Post treatment, all negative sleep associations, co-sleeping and family stress were reduced and all measures of sleep significantly improved: total night time sleep; time taken until sleep onset (SOL) and minutes awake during the night (WASO) (all p = < 0.002) with large treatment effects sizes (d = 0.94-1.85).

A between-subjects design was used to compare 26 patients with insomnia and MS, with 31 patients with MS only, and with 26 matched neurological disease-free individuals with insomnia. All patients participated in a standardized clinical interview and completed a battery of self-reported measures of cognitive and somatic presleep arousal experienced at bedtime, sleep- or insomnia-related unhelpful beliefs, and sleep-related safety behaviors. All patients with MS underwent a neurological examination. ID comorbid to MS was strongly associated with increased levels of cognitive and somatic arousal, higher endorsement of dysfunctional beliefs about the consequences of insomnia on daytime functioning, and worry about insomnia and more frequent engagement in sleep-related safety behaviors. Patients with MS with ID did not differ from neurological disease-free individuals with insomnia on these measures. No link was found between MS clinical peculiarities and ID diagnosis. ID comorbid to MS is associated with the classical psychological factors perpetuating ID in neurological disease-free individuals with insomnia.

A Meta-Analysis of Placebo Responses in Insomnia RCTs.", "text": "Little is known about the relative magnitude of placebo responses on objective and subjective measures of sleep continuity. To address this issue, the pre-post effects of placebos on objective and subjective measures (i.e., polysomnography [PSG] and sleep diaries) were evaluated meta-analytically. The guiding hypothesis was that large responses would be observed on sleep diary measures and small responses would be observed on PSG measures. PubMed searches, 1967-2016, yielded 329 possible articles, 17 of which met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present analysis (including 879 subjects with PSG data, 1,209 subjects with diary data, and six studies with both PSG and sleep diary data). Average change and weighted effect sizes (ESs) were computed via modeling for sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Pre-to-post change on PSG measures were: SL -13.7Â min., ESÂ =Â -0.37; WASO -14.3Â min., ESÂ =Â -0.36; and TST 29.8Â min., ESÂ = 0.50. Pre-to-post change on sleep diary measures were: SL -13.5Â min., ESÂ =Â -0.36; WASO -13.3Â min., ESÂ =Â -0.20; and TST 25.5Â min., ESÂ =Â 0.36. The modeled average objective subjective difference per sleep continuity measure was less than 5Â minutes. The modeled average objective subjective difference per sleep continuity measure (in effect sizes) was less than 0.17. The observed outcomes of this analysis suggest that placebos produce comparable effects on objective and subjective measures of sleep continuity. Thus, objective measures do not appear to protect against placebo responses. This being the case and given the importance of the subjective experience of illness severity and recovery, such data suggests that prospectively sampled sleep continuity data (sleep diaries) may be the optimal data for clinical trials, particularly when only one measure is possible.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36094215/"}

Seventy-seven currently employed adults with insomnia disorder (59 females) recruited to a randomized trial of digital versus face-to-face CBT-I. The general health version of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire was used to measure absenteeism, presenteeism, total work impairment, and activity impairment. We assessed changes in work productivity and activity pre-to-post-therapy for the total sample and then for subgroups categorized according to response or remission of insomnia disorder (evaluated using the Insomnia Severity Index). Study participants showed significant improvements in presenteeism (<i>p</i> =Â .001; Cohen's <i>d</i>=Â 0.46), total work impairment (<i>p</i> <Â .001; <i>d</i>=Â 0.48), and activity (<i>p</i> <Â .001; <i>d</i>=Â 0.66), but not absenteeism (<i>p</i> =Â .51; <i>d</i>=Â 0.084) between baseline and follow-up assessment.

A prerequisite for understanding the neurocognitive consequences of primary insomnia is to establish task paradigms that robustly differentiate insomniacs from well-sleeping subjects. We hypothesized that the decline in performance that typically occurs with an increasing cognitive demand would provide a more sensitive measure than performance on a single task version. The hypothesis was tested, first, by assessing the performance on two vigilance tasks with different cognitive demands in 25 elderly patients with primary insomnia and 13 healthy well-sleeping age-matched subjects. Secondly, we investigated the performance response to sleep therapy using a waiting-list controlled design. Sleep therapy consisted of a multi-component intervention including sleep restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, bright-light therapy, structured physical activity and body temperature manipulations. The results show that insomniacs differed markedly from controls in their reaction times across tasks with different cognitive demands: patients responded faster on the 'simple' vigilance task, yet slower on the 'complex' vigilance task. Sleep therapy effectively restored normal performance: patients became significantly slower on the 'simple' task and faster on the 'complex' task, returning to the performance levels of control subjects. These findings indicate that the performance decline associated with increasing cognitive demands is possibly the first sensitive and robust measure of the neurocognitive sequelae of insomnia. We suggest that future studies on cognition in primary insomnia should apply a design that varies task demands.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18844819/"}

Sleep disorder diagnosis heavily depends on accurately classifying sleep stages. Traditionally, this classification has been performed manually by trained sleep technologists that visually inspect polysomnography records. However, in order to mitigate the labor-intensive nature of this process, automated approaches have been developed. These automated methods aim to streamline and facilitate sleep stage classification. This study aims to classify sleep stages in a dataset comprising subjects with insomnia, PLM, and sleep apnea. The dataset consists of PSG recordings from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of the national sleep research resource (NSRR), including 2056 subjects. Among these subjects, 130 have insomnia, 39 suffer from PLM, 156 have sleep apnea, and the remaining 1731 are classified as good sleepers. This study proposes an automated computerized technique to classify sleep stages, developing a machine-learning model with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) capabilities using wavelet-based Hjorth parameters. An optimal biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (BOWFB) has been employed to extract subbands (SBs) from 30 seconds of electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs. Three EEG channels, namely: Fz_Cz, Cz_Oz, and C4_M1, are employed to yield an optimum outcome. The Hjorth parameters extracted from SBs were then fed to different machine learning algorithms. To gain an understanding of the model, in this study, we used SHAP (Shapley Additive explanations) method. For subjects suffering from the aforementioned diseases, the model utilized features derived from all channels and employed an ensembled bagged trees (EnBT) classifier. The highest accuracy of 86.8%, 87.3%, 85.0%, 84.5%, and 83.8% is obtained for the insomniac, PLM, apniac, good sleepers and complete datasets, respectively.

Switching attention and working memory were significantly worse in insomnia patients than controls, while no differences were found for simple or complex sustained attention tasks. Poorer sustained attention in the control, but not the insomnia group, was significantly associated with increased subjective sleepiness. In insomnia patients, poorer sustained attention performance was associated with reduced health-related quality of life and increased insomnia severity. We found that insomnia patients exhibit deficits in higher level neurobehavioral functioning, but not in basic attention.

Insomnia symptoms were ascertained as moderate-to-severe difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep via parent- or self reports at all 3 time points, adult insomnia via self-report in young adulthood, and objective short-sleep duration via polysomnography in childhood and adolescence. Among children with insomnia symptoms, the most frequent trajectory was persistence (43.3%), followed by remission (26.9% since childhood, 11.2% since adolescence) and a waxing-and-waning pattern (18.6%). Among children with normal sleep, the most frequent trajectory was persistence (48.1%), followed by developing insomnia symptoms (15.2% since adolescence, 20.7% in adulthood) and a waxing-and-waning pattern (16.0%). The odds of insomnia symptoms worsening into adult insomnia (22.0% of children, 20.8% of adolescents) were 2.6-fold and 5.5-fold among short-sleeping children and adolescents, respectively.

This work aims to i) review theoretical and fundamental data of chronotherapeutics, and ii) provide practical recommendations. Light therapy (LT) can be used as a first-line monotherapy of moderate to severe depression of all subtypes. LT can be also used as a combination with antidepressant to maximize patients' response rates, which has a clear superiority to antidepressant alone. Sleep deprivation (SD) is a rapid and powerful chronotherapeutic with antidepressant responses within hours in 45-60% of patients with unipolar or bipolar depression. Different strategies should be combined to stabilize the SD antidepressant effect, including concomitant medications, repeated SD, combination with sleep phase advance and/or LT (triple chronotherapy). Melatonin treatment is of interest in remitted patients with mood disorder to prevent relapses or recurrences, if a complaint of insomnia, poor sleep quality or phase delay syndrome is associated. During the acute phase, melatonin could be used as an adjuvant treatment for symptoms of insomnia associated with depression. The cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can be recommend to treat insomnia during euthymic phases.

Through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), sleep and mental conditions were assessed in the ID and HC groups. The dietary intake structure of both groups was observed using the food frequency table. Meanwhile, the relationship between dietary intake and sleep quality was analyzed based on the logistics regression. Individuals in the ID group had significantly higher age, weight, and body mass index compared to the HC group (p<0.01). Individuals within the ID category demonstrated a heightened daily consumption of carbohydrates, grains, tubers, and legumes relative to the healthy control group. In contrast, the intake levels of vegetables, fruits, and nuts were diminished compared to the HC group, with this difference being statistically significant (p<0.01). A positive correlation was observed between the daily consumption of grains, tubers, and legumes and PSQI scores. Conversely, a negative association was found between daily consumption of vegetables and fruits. ID patients exhibit an elevated intake of carbohydrates, whereas the consumption of vegetables, fruits, and nuts is deficient in comparison to the healthy cohort, implying that a distorted dietary structure might be a contributing factor to ID onset. Sensible and scientific dietary guidance is of considerable significance in preventing the onset of ID and facilitating its management. However, the derived conclusions warrant further extensive research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38164851/"}

Only the multifactor subjects' mean posttest sleep latency fell within the good sleeper range.

We examined the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the extent to which demographic, clinical, symptom, and functional characteristics predicted cognition among people with chronic HF and insomnia who participated in a randomized controlled trial of CBT-I. Participants with HF were randomized to group-based CBT-I or an attention control (HF self-management education). Outcomes were measured over 1 year. We measured psychomotor vigilance and self-reported cognitive ability (PROMIS Cognitive Abilities Scale), clinical and demographic characteristics, history of sleep apnea, fatigue, pain, insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), Six Minute Walk, EuroQoL Quality of Life, and wrist actigraphy (sleep characteristics and rest-activity rhythms). We used cosinor analysis to compute rest-activity rhythms and general linear models and general estimating equations to test the effects of predictors over 1 year. The sample included 175 participants (mean age = 63 SD = 12.9 Years; 43% women). There was a statistically significant group-time effect on self-reported cognitive function and increases in the proportion of participants, with < 3 psychomotor vigilance lapses in the CBT-I group. Controlling for group-time effects and baseline cognition, decreased sleepiness, improved rest-activity rhythms, and 6-minute walk distance predicted a composite measure of cognition (psychomotor vigilance lapses and self-reported cognition). CBT-I may improve cognition in adults with chronic HF. A future fully powered randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the extent to which CBT-I improves multiple dimensions of cognition.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy can reduce this discrepancy, but alternative behavioural therapies remain untested. The present exploratory study aimed to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) on reducing sleep discrepancies in comparison with a sleep hygiene, education, and exercise programme (SHEEP). Older adults were randomly allocated into the mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia group (nÂ =Â 55) or the sleep hygiene, education, and exercise programme group (nÂ =Â 58). Subjective and objective sleep parameters were measured using sleep diaries, polysomnography (PSG), and actigraphy. Sleep discrepancies were calculated using the Bland-Altman method for sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Additionally, correlations between the change in sleep discrepancies and the change in subjective sleep quality and trait mindfulness were measured within each group. Sleep onset latency discrepancy measured by polysomnography and actigraphy decreased significantly after the MBTI and SHEEP interventions. In contrast, there was no significant change in wake after sleep onset discrepancy in either group. The change in sleep onset latency discrepancy was correlated with the change in insomnia symptoms and objectively measured trait mindfulness. Mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia was effective in reducing sleep onset latency discrepancies and improving sleep perception in older adults with sleep disturbances, which in turn drove an improvement in sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. Increases in trait mindfulness may have been an important mechanism in improving sleep perception in the mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia group.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35896519/"}

Non-REM sleep and REM sleep are different states of being, sustained by activity in brainstem nuclei, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and thalamus. Such complex phenomenology is subject to many alterations grouped in the new International Classification of Sleep Disorders. The insomnias are the result of interacting psychosocial, psychophysiologic, neurodevelopmental, and medical factors. Proper perspective of each factor provides the clinical strategies to approach medically the symptom-complex of insomnia. The most common cause of daytime hypersomnia is chronic sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea responds to nasal CPAP, but the failure rate approaches 30%. In intolerant patients BiPAP and surgical remedies should be considered. Motor and behavioral abnormalities of sleep may be linked to REM sleep as in the REM sleep behavior disorder. Paroxysmal nocturnal dystonia and nocturnal wanderings may be associated with epilepsy. Intrusions of one state of being (wakefulness, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep) into another result in mixed, poorly defined, or only partially developed states. Dissociation of states may be responsible for confusional arousals, hallucinations, and cateplexy. Senile degeneration of the suprachiasmatic nuclei may underlie the circadian rhythm changes in old age and the \"sundown\" syndrome in demented patients. Misalignment of the hypothalamic pacemaker causes dysregulation of sleep-related physiologic and behavioral variables. Exposure to bright light retrains the pacemaker in night-shift workers, transmeridian travelers, and in patients with seasonal affective syndrome. Benzodiazepine compounds are very effective hypnotics, but should be used sparingly in the elderly to avoid falls, memory lapses, and aggravation of a preexisting sleep apnea syndrome. Sleep laboratory evaluations are indicated in patients with hypersomnia, suspected sleep apnea syndrome, motor-behavioral disorders of sleep, and in many individuals complaining of insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1603736/"}

The endogeneity of wages is taken into account with an instrumental variables approach; we find that the wage rate affects sleeping time in general, corroborating Biddle and Hamermesh's (1990) main conclusion. A ten percent increase in the wage rate leads to an 11-12min decrease in sleep per week. But this number masks several effects. The responsiveness of sleep time to wage rate changes depends upon the sex of the individual, whether or not sleep problems are present and general economic conditions. By far the largest adjustment is found for insomniacs in 2010, a year of general economic downturn in Canada. We also investigate the non-randomness of insomnia in the population by using a Heckman procedure, and find that the sleep time of female non-insomniacs is even more responsive to wage rate changes once account is taken of this selection bias, but otherwise selection was not a problem in our samples.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27987490/"}

Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) may reduce suicidal ideation (SI). However, the role of digital therapeutics in both the alleviation and prevention of SI remains unclear, and treatment mechanisms facilitating SI reductions have not been clearly identified. A total of 658 adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition insomnia disorder enrolled in a single-site randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of digital CBTI relative to attention control. Outcomes were measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. Before treatment, 126 patients endorsed SI (19.1% prevalence). Among those with baseline SI, CBTI patients reported lower SI rates at posttreatment (30.0% vs 54.5%, p = .005) and 1-year follow-up (29.6% vs 46.8%, p = .042) relative to control. PRODCLIN analysis estimated that half of suicidolytic effects of CBTI were mediated through insomnia remission. Among those without baseline SI, CBTI did not directly prevent new onset SI. However, insomnia remitters reported lower rates of new-onset SI at posttreatment relative to non-remitters (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = .009). Mediation analysis supported a significant indirect effect wherein CBTI increased the likelihood of insomnia remission, which was associated with SI prevention (Î±Î² = -3.20, 95% CI = -5.74 to -0.87). Digital CBTI reduces insomnia symptoms, which promotes SI alleviation and prevention. For nonsuicidal patients, digital CBTI may serve as a highly accessible monotherapy for improving sleep, thereby reducing the risk for SI. For suicidal patients, digital CBTI may be appropriately administered as an adjunct treatment to support mainline intervention more directly targeting suicidogenic thoughts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36242607/"}

We assessed whether these FIRST groupings (high/low sleep reactivity) predicted changes in insomnia over time using the Insomnia Severity Index. We also tested if these FIRST groupings predicted insomnia disorder (using Insomnia Severity Index cutoffs) at 3 different time points (T3, T6, and T9). Individuals with high sleep reactivity were more likely to experience a worsening of insomnia. Using logistic regression, we also found that FIRST grouping predicted insomnia disorder. Results remained significant after controlling for estimated premorbid sleep, age, and whether someone had chemotherapy. Our study shows that sleep reactivity may be a robust predictor of insomnia within breast cancer populations.

Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (NÂ =Â 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279980/"}

This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of medications used to treat insomnia. A literature search of Medline, PubMed, and Embase was conducted (January 1966-June 2016). It included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series that had an emphasis on insomnia in an older population. Search terms included medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia: benzodiazepines (triazolam, estazolam, temazepam, flurazepam, and quazepam), nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists (non-BzRAs; zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), suvorexant, ramelteon, doxepin and trazodone. Off-label drugs such as other antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, gabapentin, pramipexole, tiagabine, valerian, and melatonin were also included. Cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep hygiene are considered initial therapy for insomnia. Benzodiazepines are discouraged in the geriatric population, especially for long-term use. Although non-BzRAs have improved safety profiles compared with benzodiazepines, their side effects include dementia, serious injury, and fractures, which should limit their use. Ramelteon has a minimal adverse effect profile and is effective for sleep-onset latency and increased total sleep time, making it a valuable first-line option. Although the data on suvorexant are limited, this drug improves sleep maintenance and has mild adverse effects, including somnolence; residual daytime sedation has been reported, however. Sedating low-dose antidepressants should only be used for insomnia when the patient has comorbid depression. Antipsychotic agents, pramipexole, and tiagabine have all been used for insomnia, but none has been extensively studied in an older population, and all have considerable adverse effects. Gabapentin may be useful in patients with restless leg syndrome or chronic neuropathic pain and insomnia. Diphenhydramine should be avoided in the elderly. Valerian and melatonin are unregulated products that have a small impact on sleep latency and can produce residual sedation. An ideal treatment for insomnia should help to improve sleep latency and sleep duration with limited awakenings and be without significant adverse effects such as daytime somnolence or decreased alertness. Cognitive behavioral therapy should always be first line treatment. Clinical inertia regarding previous prominent use of benzodiazepines and non-BzRAs will be a significant challenge for patients accustomed to their issuance.

On days 1 (T0), 7 (T1), and 14 (T2, if still hospitalized), salivary melatonin for dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and 24-h skin temperature were recorded. In addition, environmental noise, temperature, and illuminance were monitored. Patients in the CircadianCare arm followed 1 of 3 schedules for light/dark, meal, and physical activity timings, based on their diurnal preference/habits. They wore short-wavelength-enriched light-emitting glasses for 45âmin after awakening and short-wavelength light filter shades from 18:00 h until sleep onset.

Similarly, DLMO time significantly advanced in the small group of patients for whom it could be computed on both occasions, with untreated ones starting from earlier baseline values. Patients sleeping near the window had significantly higher sleep efficiency, regardless of treatment arm. As noise fluctuation increased, so did the number of night awakenings, regardless of treatment arm.

We examined the excretion of the major melatonin metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in insomnia patients aged >or=55 years and its relation with the subsequent response to melatonin therapy. We studied 517 insomnia patients, along with 29 age-matched and 30 younger healthy volunteers. Nocturnal urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion was assessed between 10 pm and 10 am. Three hundred and ninety-six of the insomnia patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and for 3 weeks with 2 mg per night of controlled-release melatonin, of which 372 provided complete datasets. Clinical response, assessed with the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, was defined as an improvement of 10 mm or more on the visual analog scales. Mean (+/- SD) 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion was lower in the insomnia patients (9.0 +/- 8.3 microg per night) than in volunteers of the same age (18.1 +/- 12.7 microg per night, P <0.05) and in younger volunteers (24.2 +/- 11.9 microg per night, P <0.05). About 30% of patients (112/372) excreted <or=3.5 microg of sulfatoxymelatonin per night, which is considered to be lower than normal for this age group. These \"low excretors\" had a significantly higher response to melatonin replacement therapy (58% [65/112] vs. 47% [122/260], P <0.05). Low nocturnal melatonin production is associated with insomnia in patients aged 55 years or older, and identifies patients who are somewhat more likely to respond to melatonin replacement.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14715322/"}

This study aimed to determine the extent to which alcohol use affects insomnia symptoms and vice versa in adults reporting symptoms of chronic pain. Participants were 73 individuals (93% women) reporting alcohol use in addition to symptoms of insomnia and chronic pain. They completed daily diaries assessing insomnia symptoms and alcohol use for 14Â days. Multilevel modelling was used to evaluate the bidirectional associations between alcohol use and insomnia symptoms at the daily level. Consistent with laboratory-based research, alcohol use was associated with decreased sleep-onset latency the same night but increased sleep-onset latency 2Â nights later. Specifically, for every alcoholic drink consumed, time to sleep onset decreased by 5.0Â min in the same night but increased by 4.3Â min 2Â nights later. Alcohol use was not significantly associated with subsequent wake after sleep onset or total sleep time, and insomnia symptoms were not significantly associated with subsequent alcohol use. To our knowledge, these data provide the first evidence that alcohol use negatively affects insomnia symptoms up to 2Â days post-consumption in patients reporting symptoms of insomnia and chronic pain. Findings suggest that one drink will have minimal impact on sleep, but heavier drinking (e.g. four-five drinks) may have a clinically significant impact (16-25-min increase in sleep-onset latency).

However, the impact of acute and chronic sleep deficiency on physiologic stressor responses is poorly understood. In a controlled laboratory study with normal sleepers and individuals with chronic sleep-onset insomnia, we measured responses to an acute stressor administered in a sleep deprivation condition or a control condition. Twenty-two adults (aged 22-40 years; 16 females)-11 healthy normal sleepers and 11 individuals with sleep-onset insomnia-completed a 5-day (4-night) in-laboratory study. After an adaptation day and a baseline day, subjects were assigned to a 38-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) condition or a control condition; the study ended with a recovery day. At 8:00 PM after 36 hours awake in the sleep deprivation condition or 12 hours awake in the control condition, subjects underwent a Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST). Salivary cortisol was measured immediately before the MAST at 8:00 PM, every 15 minutes after the MAST from 8:15 PM until 9:15 PM, and 30 minutes later at 9:45 PM. Baseline salivary cortisol was collected in the evening of the baseline day. Additionally, before and immediately upon completion of the MAST, self-report ratings of affect and pain were collected. The MAST elicited a stressor response in both normal sleepers and individuals with sleep-onset insomnia, regardless of the condition, as evidenced by increases in negative affect and pain ratings. Relative to baseline, cortisol levels increased immediately following the MAST, peaked 30 minutes later, and then gradually returned to pre-MAST levels. At the cortisol peak, there was a significant difference across groups and conditions, reflecting a pronounced blunting of the cortisol response in the normal sleepers in the TSD condition and the sleep-onset insomnia group in both the TSD and control conditions. Blunted stressor reactivity as a result of sleep deficiency, whether acute or chronic, may reflect reduced resiliency attributable to allostatic load and may put warfighters at increased risk in high-stakes, rapid response scenarios.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33499519/"}

Epidemiological aspects].", "text": "Very few epidemiological surveys have specifically studied relationships between sleep disturbances and psychiatric diseases. In this review, we preferred to use the classification proposed in 1979 by the Association of Sleep Disorders Centers. It includes four main categories: insomnias, excessive sleepiness, troubles of the wake/sleep schedule and parasomnias. Evaluating psychiatric disorders among general populations is easier owing to DSM III and DSM III-R criteria, but there are not equivalent criteria in evaluating sleep disorders. It is almost impossible to realize polysomnographic recordings in large samples, therefore sleep disorders are to be detected by questionnaires. It has been shown that there is a good correlation between self-reports and polysomnographic recordings among clinical and general samples. The prevalence of insomnia, defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, is estimated between 9 and 31%. It is higher among women, elderly people, separated and divorced subjects, and low educational levels' groups. It has to be noticed that polysomnographic records of some subjective insomniacs are not different from those of good sleepers, sleep latency excepted. These subjective (and not objective) insomniacs have high scores in anxiety scale, depression scale, or psychologic distress. Insomnia is more frequently noted amongst subjects with psychiatric diagnoses, especially major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. Depressive disorders are present in 21-40% of insomniacs versus 0-1% of non-insomniacs, and anxiety disorders in 13-24% of insomniacs versus 3-10% of non-insomniacs. In depressive disorders, sleep alterations are frequently noted: they are difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, decreasing proportion of slow-wave sleep, decreasing time of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and REM sleep latency, and increasing density of REM sleep. Of these modifications, the last two ones seem to be specific for depression. The relationships between sleep, aging and depression are more complex than previously noted. For example, differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects depend on the age of the population. The prevalence of hypersomnia is lower than the insomnia's. It varies between 2 and 4%. It is more frequently noted among young people, and never married subjects. Two specific aetiologies must be looked for: sleep apnea syndrome and narcolepsy. These diagnoses are respectively found in 45% and 24% of hypersomniacs examined in American Sleep Centers. Hypersomnias are objectived by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, which measures the physiologic sleep tendency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1297583/"}

Sleep was recorded in 28 teachers with polysomnography, sleep diaries and actigraphs during one high stress and one low stress condition in the participants home. EEG showed a decrease in sleep efficiency during the high stress condition. Significant interactions between group and condition were seen for REM sleep, arousals and stage transitions. The sensitive group had an increase in arousals and stage transitions during the high stress condition and a decrease in REM, whereas the opposite was seen in the resilient group. Diary ratings during the high stress condition showed higher bedtime stress and lower ratings on the awakening index (insufficient sleep and difficulties awakening). Ratings also showed lower cognitive function and preoccupation with work thoughts in the evening. KSS ratings of sleepiness increased during stress for the sensitive group. Saliva samples of cortisol showed no effect of stress. It was concluded that moderate daily stress is associated with a moderate negative effect on sleep sleep efficiency and fragmentation.

{"id": "16876255", "title": "Treating insomnia: Current and investigational pharmacological approaches.", "text": "Chronic insomnia affects a significant proportion of young adult and elderly populations. Treatment strategies should alleviate nighttime symptoms, the feeling of nonrestorative sleep, and impaired daytime function. Current pharmacological approaches focus primarily on GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRA) have been a mainstay of pharmacotherapy; the classical benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines share a similar mode of action and allosterically enhance inhibitory chloride currents through the GABA(A) receptor, a ligand-gated protein comprising 5 subunits pseudosymmetrically arranged around a core anion channel. Variations in GABA(A) receptor subunit composition confer unique pharmacological, biophysical, and electrophysiological properties on each receptor subtype. Classical benzodiazepines bind non-selectively to GABA(A) receptors containing a gamma2 subunit, whereas non-benzodiazepine hypnotics bind with higher relative affinity to alpha1-containing receptors. The non-benzodiazepine compounds generally represent an improvement over benzodiazepines as a result of improved binding selectivity and pharmacokinetic profiles. However, the enduring potential for amnestic effects, next day residual sedation, and abuse and physical dependence, particularly at higher doses, underscores the need for new treatment strategies. Novel pharmacotherapies in development act on systems believed to be specifically involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. The recently approved melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon, targets circadian mechanisms. Gaboxadol, an investigational treatment and a selective extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor agonist (SEGA), targets GABA(A) receptors containing a delta subunit, which are located outside the synaptic junctions of thalamic and cortical neurons thought to play an important regulatory role in the onset, maintenance, and depth of the sleep process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16876255/"}

Adults (N = 129) receiving buprenorphine for OUD from an outpatient clinic participated in a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed an abbreviated version of NIDA's Phenotyping Assessment Battery, which assessed 6 neurofunctional domains: sleep, negative emotionality, metacognition, interoception, cognition, and reward. Bivariate descriptive statistics compared those with evidence of clinically significant insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] score of â¥11) to those with minimal evidence of clinically significant insomnia symptoms (ISI score of â¤10) across each of the neurofunctional domains. Roughly 60% of participants reported clinically significant insomnia symptoms (ISI score of â¥11). Experiencing clinically significant insomnia symptoms was associated with reporting greater levels of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, stress intolerance, unhelpful metacognition, and interoceptive awareness (ps<0.05). Participants with evidence of clinically significant insomnia were more likely to report that poor sleep was interfering with their OUD treatment and that improved sleep would assist with their treatment (ps<0.05). Insomnia was prevalent among adults receiving buprenorphine for OUD. Insomnia was associated with neurofunctional performance, which may impact OUD treatment trajectories. Our findings indicate potential targets in the development of personalized treatment plans for patients with co-morbid insomnia and OUD.

Many arousals that are not perceived occur during the first REM-NREM cycle. Insomniacs nearly exclusively perceive those arousals occurring after consolidated sleep (at least 15 min) and at the beginning of interrupted sleep intervals. It is suggested that insomniacs perceive these intervals as continuous wakefulness and have difficulty in perceiving short-lasting sleep, whereas controls often do not perceive wakefulness at all.

The present study provides data on sleep patterns and insomnia among Portuguese adolescents. In a cross-sectional study we evaluated 6,919 students from the 7th to the 12th grade from twenty-six secondary schools. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Insomnia was defined based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria and daytime sleepiness was assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Sleep patterns evaluated both sleep duration (\"insufficient\" sleep was defined as < 8 hours per night) and bedtime schedules and regularity. The prevalence of insomnia was 8.3%, insomnia symptoms 21.4% and insufficient sleep 29.3%. All prevalence were higher among girls (P<.001). Average sleep time, on weeknights, was 8:04Â±1:13 hours. On average adolescents went to bed at 22:18Â±1:47 hours, took 21 minutes to fall asleep and woke up at 7:15Â±0:35 hours. Only 6.4% of adolescents stated having a regular bedtime. The majority of adolescents (90.6%) reported having difficulty waking up, 64.7% experienced daytime sleepiness and 53.3% experienced sleep during classes. There are high prevalence of inadequate sleep patterns, insufficient sleep and insomnia among Portuguese adolescents. Insufficient sleep is associated with sleep patterns and social and behavioural factors. These results add to our knowledge of adolescent sleep worldwide.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25476060/"}

An initial experiment found elevated VO2 both at night and during the day in patients with primary insomnia as compared with matched normal sleepers. A second experiment found significant but more modest increases in VO2 in patients with Sleep State Misperception Insomnia [who complain of poor sleep but who had normal sleep by electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria]. In a third experiment, normal young adults were given caffeine 400 mg three times per day (TID) for 1 week as a means of increasing VO2 and possibly producing other symptoms of insomnia. Participants developed many symptoms consistent with those seen in patients with primary insomnia (poor sleep, increased latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, increasing fatigue despite physiological activation, and increased anxiety on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)). In a final experiment, physiological arousal was again produced by caffeine to determine if sleep with elevated arousal would be less restorative. All subjects (Ss) slept for 3.5 h after being given 400 mg of caffeine. During 41 h of sleep deprivation that followed, there was no significant condition difference for the Multiple Sleep Latency Test or mood measures.

{"id": "12506261", "title": "[Etiology of adult insomnia].", "text": "In the article, the author develops an analysis of external and intrapsychic factors related to adults' insomnia. First she undertakes a literature review to describe semiological, evolutive and etiological levels of insomnia. From a semiological point of view, it is usual to differenciate initial insomnia (associated to the first phase of sleeping), intermittent insomnia (related to frequent awakenings) and final insomnia (related to early morning awakenings). From an evolutive point of view, we can identify transitory insomnia (characterized by frequent awakenings) and chronic insomnia. On the other hand, we are allowed to distinguish organic insomnia (disorder where an organic cerebral injury is demonstrated or suspected) from insomnias related to psychiatric or somatic disease or idiopathic one. Then, the author makes a literary review to identify various insomnia causes and points out. Social factors: insomnia rates are higher by divorced, separated or widowed people. Percentages are higher when scholastic level is weak, domestic income is less then 915 O a month, or by unemployed people. Besides, sleep quality is deteriorated by ageing. Sleeping and waking rhythm is able to loose its synchronization. Complaints about insomnia occur far frequently from women than men. Environmental factors: working constraints increase sleep disorders. It is possible to make the same conclusion when we have to face overcharge of external events, deep intrapsychic conflicts (related to grief, unemployment, damage or hospitalization) or interpersonal conflicts' situations where we are confronted to stress related to socio-affective environment, lack of social support or conjugal difficulties. Medical and physiologic causes: legs impatience syndrome, recurrent limbs shakings syndrome, breathe stop during sleep, narcolepsy, excessive medicine or hypnotic drugs use, some central nervous system injuries, every nocturnal awakening (related to aches.), surgical operation. Chronobiological factors: night working or day-night shift produce insomnia by desynchronization. It is the same for time lag related to jet-lag flights. Significant gaps between the internal biological clock and environmental synchronizators, such as phase delay sleep, phase advance sleep, sleep-waking cycle longer than 24 (25) hours, or variations in sleep-awakening cycle, are of less importance. Toxic factors are numerous: amphetamines, antidepressors, medication against anorexia and tubercular disease, caffeine and alcohol excessive use, chronic alcoholism. Behavioral factors: enduring insomnias are related to poor nightroutines (to go to sleep too early, to read or to look at T.V. when going to bed). The same effect is produced by regular intellectual activities close to bedtime or by a late meal in the evening, by an noisy or unhealthy environment, by physical hyperactivity or sleeping after each lunch. Psychiatric factors: insomnia often appears with psychiatric disorders such as a major depressive episode, an anxiety disorder or schizophrenia. Insomnia also is able to open a delirious disorganization or a manic access. Psychological factors: overstimulation of waking system (related to stress overdose or intellectual hyperactivity), conditioning phenomena, fear of not falling asleep, intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts. Third, the author put hypothesis about psychodynamic etiology of chronic insomnia. Following a first assumption, insomnia should be a result of anguish excess related to intrapsychic (and not interpersonal) conflicts which can't lead to a mental elaboration. These conflicts run over dream protective function, generating a breakdown of dream symbolization function. At a clinical level, we are in some cases in front of people enduring sleeping insomnia but more often, we are confronted with an intermittent or early waking insomnia sometimes associated with nightmares. Following a second assumption, insomnia should be a result of psychic functioning invalidation. Here, failure of dream protective and symbolization function is related to anguish excess associated with an amount of external conflicts. Overwhelmed by concretude, insomniac patients present an alexythimic intrapsychic functioning forbiding dream realization. These persons have no possibility to elaborate conflicts especially external overcharge, using dreams or imagination to escape from an intrusive reality and regress to sleeping. Here we are in front of initial sleep insomnia. Following a third hypothesis, some insomnias are related to wakings associated with repetitive nightmares. This type of insomnia should be related to a past traumatic event or activated by actual existential context and produces a too important anguish charge to follow a mental elaboration process and lead to mental symbolic representation. Following a fourth hypothesis, some insomnias are in relation with an impossibility to accept passive position. The last one will expose to a danger consisting either of castration or loneliness and death. To conclude, the author suggests some preventive perspective to face insomnia. Especially, she points out limits of pharmalogical treatments. She underlines the necessity to promote no medical methods to facilitate sleep induction and maintenance, including sleep hygiene measures, relaxation, psychotherapic approach and behavioral methods. She emphasizes the danger of a reductive approach of insomnia which would be focused on a single medical, psychological or environmental dimension. Last but not least, she makes methodological propositions to test from a clinical point of view the four psychodynamic exposed hypotheses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12506261/"}

However, its length can be cumbersome in clinical practice. This study aims to develop a data-driven shortened version of the DBAS-16 that efficiently predicts the DBAS-16 total score among the general population. We collected 1000 responses to the DBAS-16 from the general population through three separate surveys, each focusing on different aspects of insomnia severity and related factors. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on the survey responses, we grouped DBAS-16 items based on response pattern similarities. The most representative item from each group, showing the highest regression performance with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) in predicting the DBAS-16 total score, was selected to create a shortened version of the DBAS-16. Through EFA and XGBoost, we categorized the DBAS-16 items into six distinct groups. Selecting one item from each group, based on the highest coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> values in predicting the DBAS-16 total score. After measuring the R<sup>2</sup> values for all possible combinations of six items, items 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 15 were chosen, exhibiting the highest R<sup>2</sup> value. Based on these six items, we developed the DBAS-6, a data-driven shortened version of the DBAS-16. The DBAS-6 exhibited outstanding predictive ability, achieving the highest R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.90 for predicting the DBAS-16 total score, surpassing that of a previously developed shortened version. Notably, the DBAS-6 efficiently encapsulates the core aspects of the DBAS-16 and demonstrates robust predictive power over heterogeneous test data samples with distinct statistical characteristics from the training data.

We studied ten healthy subjects, aged 55 and older, with both subjective and objective insomnia. Subjective insomnia was the complaint of requiring at least 45 min to fall asleep and sleeping less than six and a half hours per night. Each complaint was present on at least 50% of the nights for at least three months. Objective insomnia was measured polysomnographically and was present on at least two of the last three nights of four consecutive nights of placebo baseline.

The main inclusion criteria were reported primary insomnia according to ICSD criteria, which was confirmed by polysomnographic recording, and the absence of acute diseases. During the study, the patients underwent 8 polysomnographic recordings: i.e., 2 recordings (baseline and study night) at each time point at which the short and long-term effects of placebo and valerian were tested. The target variable of the study was sleep efficiency. Other parameters describing objective sleep structure were the usual features of sleep-stage analysis, based on the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968), and the arousal index (scored according to ASDA criteria, 1992) as a sleep microstructure parameter. Subjective parameters such as sleep quality, morning feeling, daytime performance, subjectively perceived duration of sleep latency, and sleep period time were assessed by means of questionnaires. After a single dose of valerian, no effects on sleep structure and subjective sleep assessment were observed. After multiple-dose treatment, sleep efficiency showed a significant increase for both the placebo and the valerian condition in comparison with baseline polysomnography. We confirmed significant differences between valerian and placebo for parameters describing slow-wave sleep. In comparison with the placebo, slow-wave sleep latency was reduced after administration of valerian (21.3 vs. 13.5 min respectively, p<0.05). The SWS percentage of time in bed (TIB) was increased after long-term valerian treatment, in comparison to baseline (9.8 vs. 8.1% respectively, p<0.05). At the same time point, a tendency for shorter subjective sleep latency, as well as a higher correlation coefficient between subjective and objective sleep latencies, were observed under valerian treatment. Other improvements in sleep structure - such as an increase in REM percentage and a decrease in NREM1 percentage - took place simultaneously under placebo and valerian treatment. A remarkable finding of the study was the extremely low number of adverse events during the valerian treatment periods (3 vs. 18 in the placebo period).

Unstable sleep, which can be detected in all stages, is expressed by the recurrence of arousal complexes (sequences of K-complexes, delta bursts, K-alpha, conventional arousals), which translate a brief (10-15 s) activation of the sleeping brain. These repetitive arousal complexes compose the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). During stable NREM sleep, arousal complexes are rare or absent and the EEG lacks any cyclic pattern (non-CAP). CAP is a spontaneous feature of normal sleep as it is typically involved in stage changes and nocturnal motor activity. The physiological amount of CAP rate (ratio of CAP time to NREM sleep time) varies with age according to a U-shape curve. Within these ranges, sleep is perceived as continuous and restorative. Conversely, an excess of CAP rate fragments sleep and impairs its quality. Polysomnographic investigation reveals that untreated insomniac patients exhibit significantly higher values of CAP rate compared to healthy sleepers. Effective hypnotic treatment restores physiological amounts of CAP rate, with specific differences between the administered drugs.

On many indices evaluating subjective daytime alertness and well-being, the psychophysiologic insomnia patients had scores similar to the OSAS patients. There were no significant differences between the childhood-onset and adult-onset psychophysiologic insomnia patients on most of the investigated items. However, the childhood-onset psychophysiologic insomniinacs had moderately but significantly higher reports of nightmares. This group also reported having had longer sleep latencies, significantly more \"fear of the dark\" and more frequent nightmares during childhood than the adult-onset group. These statistically significant findings reflected only a moderate increase in subjective scores, however, and in general the childhood-onset and adult-onset psychophysiologic insomnia patients were very similar.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8723371/"}

However, the transition to menopause has a direct impact upon sleep. Sleep disturbances are reported by approximately 40%-60% of menopausal women, and insomnia disorder is also prevalent. Diet-based interventions could potentially be used to improve subjective sleep quality in this population, and although there are several promising interventions which have been used in other groups that could be trialled, the evidence base is currently lacking. One particularly promising area for future research is that these interventions might be used alongside, or instead of, established treatments for insomnia disorder. This may also help to prevent the development of longer-term insomnia disorder. Future studies should use well-controlled, adequately powered, clinical trial designs to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving subjective sleep quality, treating insomnia disorder, and preventing acute sleep disturbances from progressing to chronic insomnia. Given the strong association between sleep and neurodegeneration, optimizing sleep in menopausal women, using targeted diet-based strategies, may have significant implications for brain health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40605196/"}

The 7 items were: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking too early, sleep satisfaction, sleep interference with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and worry about sleep. The ISI-3 included items with highest item-total correlations to the 7-item ISI from Sample 1. A 7-item ISI score â¥15 was defined as clinically significant insomnia and served as the primary criterion for the ISI-3. We derived operating characteristics to determine the diagnostic accuracy and cut-points to maximize sensitivity and specificity for both samples. The items with the highest item-total correlations were: sleep dissatisfaction, sleep interference with daily functioning, and worry about sleep problems (rÂ =Â 0.78-0.81); while difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking too early and noticeability of sleep problems by others showed lower correlations (rÂ =Â 0.60-0.74).

The prevalence of insomnia is disproportionately higher in people with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment. In fact, recent meta-analytic evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that insomnia, especially when accompanied by objective short sleep duration, is a risk factor for incident hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, stroke, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and all-cause mortality. Insomnia should, thus, be part of the prevention and management of these adverse health outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated whether treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, the first-line guideline-recommended treatment, or hypnotics/sedatives improves heart- or brain-related outcomes. Studies have also failed to consider insomnia a heterogeneous disorder consisting of distinct phenotypes that result from the relative contribution of biological versus cognitive-behavioral perpetuating factors. Objective short sleep duration has emerged as a marker of physiological hyperarousal in insomnia (ie, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, increased sympathetic nervous system activation, and increased inflammation), as a predictor of insomnia-related adverse heart and brain health outcomes and, potentially, poor response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. This review summarizes the meta-analytic evidence on the association of insomnia with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including current knowledge on the heterogeneity of the disorder. This review also summarizes the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to heart and brain morbidity, which vary across insomnia phenotypes based on objective sleep duration. This review suggests that basic and clinical sciences need to unveil the molecular, cellular, and behavioral mechanisms at play across insomnia phenotypes, as the public health and clinical implications of their association with adverse heart and brain health are demanding immediate attention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40811499/"}

Participants were randomized to either mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI), or an eight-week self-monitoring (SM) condition. Patient-reported outcome measures were total wake time (TWT) from sleep diaries, the pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), measuring a prominent waking correlate of insomnia, and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to determine remission and response as clinical endpoints. Objective sleep measures were derived from laboratory polysomnography and wrist actigraphy. Linear mixed models showed that those receiving a meditation-based intervention (MBSR or MBTI) had significantly greater reductions on TWT minutes (43.75 vs 1.09), PSAS (7.13 vs 0.16), and ISI (4.56 vs 0.06) from baseline-to-post compared to SM. Post hoc analyses revealed that each intervention was superior to SM on each of the patient-reported measures, but no significant differences were found when comparing MBSR to MBTI from baseline-to-post. From baseline to 6-month follow-up, MBTI had greater reductions in ISI scores than MBSR (P < 0.05), with the largest difference occurring at the 3-month follow-up.

Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the relationship between distress from interpersonal problems and sleep and the extent to which relationships differed among insomnia patients and controls. More interpersonal distress was associated with more self-reported arousal and higher percentage of REM. More interpersonal distress was associated with greater insomnia severity and more cognitive presleep arousal for individuals with insomnia, but not for controls. Contrary to expectations, interpersonal distress was associated with shorter sleep latency in the insomnia group. Results were attenuated, but still significant, after adjusting for depression symptoms. Distress from interpersonal problems is associated with greater self-reported arousal and higher percent REM. Individuals with insomnia who report more distress from interpersonal problems have greater insomnia severity and cognitive presleep arousal, perhaps due to rumination.

DL-4-chlorophenylalanine(PCPA)-treated mice received intragastric administration of YA and pentobarbital sodium-induced sleep tests were conducted on days 7, 14, and 29. The levels of key neurotransmitters, cytokines and receptor protein associated with insomnia were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Additionally, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing was performed to assess the impact of YA on gut microbiota, focusing on species abundance and diversity. YA significantly shortened sleep latency (Pâ¯<â¯0.01) and prolonged sleep duration (Pâ¯<â¯0.01) in sleep-deprived mice, effectively improving circadian rhythm disturbances compared to the model group (MOD). Biochemical analysis revealed that YA restored abnormal neurotransmitter levels in brain tissue, increasing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Î³-aminobutyric acid type A receptor Î±-1 subunit (GABAARÎ±1) expression (Pâ¯<â¯0.01) and reducing the glutamate (Glu)/GABA ratio (Pâ¯<â¯0.01). Additionally, the levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression were significantly decreased (Pâ¯<â¯0.05, 0.01), while interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) expression increased (Pâ¯<â¯0.01). YA treatment also significantly increased gut microbiota abundance and diversity, with microbiome profiles in the YA group being closer than those of diazepam group (DZP) to the control group (CON). Notably, YA reversed the dysbiosis of high-abundance gut microbiota species associated with insomnia at both the family and genus levels (Pâ¯<â¯0.05, 0.01). The results of the present study indicated that YA alleviates insomnia symptoms by regulating neurotransmitter and inflammatory cytokines levels, and restoring gut microbia balance. These mechanisms collectively contribute to shortening sleep latency, prolonging sleep duration, and improving sleep quality in a mouse model of insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40347763/"}

An international expert group considered the current state of knowledge based on the most relevant publications in the previous 5Â years, discussed the current challenges in the field of insomnia and identified future priorities. The association of trajectories of insomnia with subsequent quality of life, health and mortality should be investigated in large populations. Prospective health economics studies by separating the costs driven specifically by insomnia and costs attributable to its long-term effects are needed. Ignoring the heterogeneity of insomnia patients leads to inadequate diagnosis and inefficient treatment. Individualized interventions should be promoted. More data are needed on both the impact of sleep on overnight effects, such as emotion regulation, and the potential compensatory effort to counteract diurnal impairments. Another gap is the definition of neurocognitive deficits in insomnia patients compared to normal subjects after chronic sleep loss. There are also a number of key gaps related to insomnia treatment. Expert guidelines indicate cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia as first-line treatment. They neglect, however, the reality of major healthcare providers. The role of combined therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia plus pharmacological treatment, should be evaluated more extensively.

Forty subjects with insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed questionnaires addressing clinical issues of pain severity, medication use, sleep quality, and affective distress. For 2 consecutive nights, each subject then completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph unit on the non-dominant wrist. The results showed that the sleep diaries and the actigraphs provided similar estimates of total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, but differed in the measurement of sleep onset latency and nocturnal awakenings. Both methods of assessment exhibited low to moderate reliability across nights. Measures of the same sleep parameters across the two methods of assessment showed low concordance. Of the clinical variables, pain severity had the strongest association with disturbed sleep, but only using the diary method of assessment. Subjects who reported high pain severity also reported greater sleep impairment than subjects with low pain severity, but this was not confirmed by actigraphy. In general, both methods of assessment point to the significance of insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain as a distinct clinical problem, but the activity monitoring and self-report procedures provide different information.

This work presents a non-linear mixed-effect Markov-chain model based on multinomial logistic functions which characterize the time course of transition probabilities between sleep stages in insomniac patients treated with placebo. Polysomnography measurements were obtained from patients during one night treatment. A population approach was used to describe the time course of sleep stages (awake stage, stage 1, stage 2, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep) using a Markov-chain model. The relationship between time and individual transition probabilities between sleep stages was modelled through piecewise linear multinomial logistic functions. The identification of the model produced a good adherence of mean post-hoc estimates to the observed transition frequencies. Parameters were generally well estimated in terms of CV, shrinkage and distribution of empirical Bayes estimates around the typical values.

In the ICB task, a visual scene, comprising both sleep-related and neutral stimuli, 'flickers' back and forth with one element (sleep or neutral) of the scene changing between presentations.

As per the third International Classification of Sleep disorders (ICSD-3) insomnia can be defined as a state with repeated difficulty in sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. The conventional treatments approved for management of insomnia were benzodiazepines (BZDs) (estazolam, quazepam, triazolam, flurazepam and temazepam) and non-BZDs, also known as z-drugs (zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) doxepin as well as melatonin agonists, e.g. ramelteon. But the potential of these agents to address sleep problems has been limited due to substantial side effects associated with them like hangover, dependence and tolerance, rebound insomnia, muscular atonia, inhibition of respiratory system, cognitive dysfunctions, and increased anxiety. Recently, orexin neuropeptides have been identified as regulators of transition between wakefulness and sleep and documented to aid an initial transitory effect towards wakefulness by activating cholinergic/monoaminergic neural pathways of the ascending arousal system. This has led to the development of orexin peptides and receptors, as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sleep disorders with the advantage of having lesser side effects as compared to conventional treatments.

The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep.

Pregnant women without active depression at enrollment ( N = 159), 18 to 45 years of age, were recruited. In late pregnancy and for up to 6 months postpartum, women completed monthly online questionnaires including the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Repeated-measures multilevel models were used to predict depression and anxiety across the postpartum. The prevalence of insomnia was 20.4%, and the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 67.8% across the first 6 months postpartum. Postpartum insomnia and poor sleep quality at the between-subject and within-subject levels tended to uniquely predict greater depressive and anxiety symptoms, even after controlling for demographic characteristics, prenatal insomnia, and prenatal poor sleep quality. Most of the women in our sample had sleep disturbances across the perinatal period. Consistent with the extant literature, postpartum insomnia and poor sleep quality, but not prenatal measures of sleep, longitudinally predicted greater postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms.

One hypothesis is that they have an indirect fitness benefit by facilitating de-arousal, making it easier to transition from wakefulness to sleep. In humans, regular positive bedtime routines are considered a main pediatric dimension of sleep health. In adults, difficulty in de-arousal at bedtime is a major issue for people with insomnia. Cognitive models of insomnia stress the strict association between arousal and cognitive-emotional factors driving behaviors.

Sleep-related breathing disorders have aÂ high prevalence of around 24% among psychiatric inpatients in Germany. Typical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome should lead to aÂ staged diagnostic process and, if necessary, cardiorespiratory polysomnography. It is not unusual for restless legs syndrome to be caused by psychopharmacological treatment. The primary form was usually treated with dopamine or dopamine agonists but due to the risk of augmentation, alternatives should be considered more often.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35201393/"}

This longitudinal study examines the association between chronic insomnia symptoms, recurrent sleep duration and well-being at older ages. A prospective cohort of UK civil servants (the Whitehall II study). 4491 women and men (25.2% women) with sleep measured 3 times over 10 years and well-being once at age 55-79 years. Insomnia symptoms and sleep duration were assessed through self-reports in 1997-1999, 2003-2004 and 2007-2009. Indicators of well-being, measured in 2007-2009, were the Control, Autonomy, Self-realisation and Pleasure measure (CASP-19) of overall well-being (range 0-57) and the physical and mental well-being component scores (range 0-100) of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). In maximally adjusted analyses, chronic insomnia symptoms were associated with poorer overall well-being (difference between insomnia at 3 assessments vs none -7.0 (SE=0.4) p<0.001), mental well-being (difference -6.9 (SE=0.4), p<0.001) and physical well-being (difference -2.8 (SE=0.4), p<0.001) independently of the other sleep measures. There was a suggestion of a dose-response pattern in these associations. In addition, recurrent short sleep (difference between â¤ 5 h sleep reported at 3 assessments vs none -1.7 (SE=0.7), p<0.05) and recurrent long sleep (difference between >9 h reported at 2 or 3 assessments vs none -3.5 (SE=0.9), p<0.001) were associated with poorer physical well-being. We conclude that in older people, chronic insomnia symptoms are negatively associated with all aspects of well-being, whereas recurrent long and short sleep is only associated with reduced physical well-being.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26832429/"}

Recommendations of the Polish Sleep Research Society, Polish Society of Family Medicine and the Polish Psychiatric Association.", "text": "Insomnia is one of the most common health problems in developed countries. Its prevalence increases with age, with up to one in two people over the age of 65 experiencing symptoms of insomnia. The older people are also the patients who mostly commonly are among chronic sleep medication users. The aim of this article is to present the current recommendations for the management of insomnia in people over 65 years of age. The recommendations were prepared as a position of an expert panel, which included people from a number of clinical disciplines: family medicine, cardiology, psychiatry, sleep medicine and clinical psychopharmacology. The first step in treating sleep disorders is to establish proper diagnosis and, if possible, to initiate causal treatment. Moreover, cognitive and behavioural therapy for insomnia should also be used as the primary form of treatment, which can be supplemented, if not sufficiently effective, with pharmacological treatment. The main group of drugs used for treating insomnia are nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone, zaleplon). However, these drugs do not fully meet the needs of people over 65 years of age, primarily with regard to treatment safety. Therefore other classes of medicines, which are used for treatment of mental disorders, are prescribed off-label in this group of patients. Melatonin in a prolonged-release form is also indicated for this age group due to the high safety of the therapy. The management of insomnia in people over 65 years of age is a challenging task, given the need to seek compromise between treatment efficacy and safety. The treatment plan also has to take into account comorbidities as well as drugs used to treat them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37381588/"}

Values corresponding to visually scored slow wave sleep (stage 3 and 4) showed no significant changes. All-night spectral analysis of the EEG revealed that power density in NREM sleep was significantly increased in the low frequency band (0.25-1.0 Hz) in the zolpidem group during the first 2-h interval. In agreement with previous findings obtained in patients with chronic primary insomnia, zolpidem significantly improved sleep induction and maintenance. Moreover, zolpidem increased power density in the 0.25-1.0 Hz band during short-term and intermediate-term treatment.

Reduced sleep affects social and working functioning, productivity, and patient's quality of life, leading to a total of $100 billion per year in direct and indirect healthcare costs. Primary insomnia is unrelated to any other mental or medical illness; secondary insomnia co-occurs with other underlying medical, iatrogenic, or mental conditions. Epidemiological studies found a 40-50% comorbidity prevalence between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, suggesting a high relevance of mental health in insomniacs. Sleep disturbances also worsen the outcomes of several psychiatric disorders, leading to more severe psychopathology and incomplete remission, plausibly contributing to treatment-resistant conditions. Insomnia and psychiatric disorder coexistence can lead to polypharmacy, namely, the concurrent use of two or more medications in the same patient, regardless of their purpose or rationale. Polypharmacy increases the risk of using unnecessary drugs, the likelihood of drug interactions and adverse events, and reduces the patient's compliance due to regimen complexity. The workup of insomnia must consider the patient's sleep habits and inquire about any medical and mental concurrent conditions that must be handled to allow insomnia to be remitted adequately. Monotherapy or limited polypharmacy should be preferred, especially in case of multiple comorbidities, promoting multipurpose molecules with sedative properties and with bedtime administration. Also, non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia, such as sleep hygiene, relaxation training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be useful in secondary insomnia to confront behaviors and thoughts contributing to insomnia and help optimizing the pharmacotherapy. However, insomnia therapy should always be patient-tailored, considering drug indications, contraindications, and pharmacokinetics, besides insomnia phenotype, clinical picture, patient preferences, and side effect profile.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043331/"}

To shed light on this discrepancy, subjective estimates of sleep and PSG variables were compared in patients with PI and good sleeper controls (GSC). 100 patients with PI (age: 42.57 +/- 12.50 years, medication free for at least 14 days) and 100 GSC (41.12 +/- 13.99 years) with a sex distribution of 46 men and 54 women in each group were included. Both PSG and questionnaire variables showed clear impairments of sleep quality in PI compared with GSC. The arousal index within total sleep time was increased, which was mainly because of a strong increase within rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Subjectively, more PI than GSC subjects estimated wake times longer than obtained from PSG. Linear modeling analysis of subjective wake time in terms of PSG parameters revealed that in addition to PSG defined wake time, REM sleep time contributed significantly to subjective wake time. This REM sleep contribution was larger for PI than for GSC subjects.

The outcomes of the IVW approach were consistent with the remaining 3 methods. The IVW, weighted median, MR Egger, and weighted mode methods in the reverse magnetic resonance imaging investigation did not yield evidence of a causative association between the risk of time type, long sleep duration, and insomnia and abnormal thyroid function. In contrast, the weighted median and weighted mode methods showed a possible causal relationship between hypothyroidism and short sleep duration and daytime sleepiness.

Insomnia-related symptoms, early morning awakenings, being more tired during daytime than other people of same age, use of sleeping pills, excessive daytime sleepiness, probable sleep apnea (4 items about snoring/apnea), and reporting that sleep duration varies between different seasons were examined as determinants of sickness absence over a 7.2 year follow-up. Poisson and gamma regression models were fitted. After adjusting age, all examined sleep disturbances except excessive daytime sleepiness were associated with sickness absence among men (RRs 1.3-2.5). Among women, after adjusting for age, insomnia-related symptoms, early morning awakenings, being more tired than others, and use of sleeping pills were associated with sickness absence (RRs 1.4-1.8). After further adjustments for education, working conditions, health behaviors, and objectively measured mental and somatic health, the associations somewhat attenuated but mainly remained. The optimal sleep duration with the lowest risk of sickness absence was 7.6 hours for women and 7.8 hours for men.

Here, we evaluated memory impairment produced by rodent mild (acute) insomnia models. Insomnia models consisted of either single or repeated exposure to cages previously occupied (dirtied) by an unfamiliar rat for 5-7âdays. Rats were trained in the Morris water maze to remember the platform location (acquisition), and were then exposed to: (a) 6âhr of undisturbed baseline; (b) dirty cage change-induced insomnia (animal placed into a cage dirtied by another rat for 6âhr); or (c) double-dirty cage change-induced insomnia (animal placed into a cage dirtied by another rat for 3âhr, and then another dirty cage 3âhr later). The animal's memory for the platform location was then evaluated in a probe trial. Double-dirty cage change-induced insomnia significantly disrupted sleep, although the effects of dirty cage change-induced insomnia were overall not significant. In the fourth hour of double-dirty cage change-induced insomnia (following the second cage change), sleep episode number and duration alterations indicated sleep fragmentation. Furthermore, power spectral analysis revealed diminished wake and, to a lesser extent, rapid eye movement theta power (indicated by trend difference) in the last 3âhr of exposure. Significant deficits were noted for measures of water maze performance following double-dirty cage change-induced insomnia, indicating impaired memory. In summary, one variant of the rodent insomnia model, double-dirty cage change-induced insomnia, disrupted sleep and attenuated memory consolidation, indicating this paradigm may be useful to evaluate the effects of hypnotics on memory consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30461100/"}

Participants were 188 adults meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for chronic insomnia who were randomized to receive behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, or CBT for insomnia. Treatment agreement/adherence was measured by (a) weekly therapist ratings of patient agreement and homework completion, and (b) adherence to behavioral strategies (ABS) derived from patient-reported sleep diary. Outcome measures were Insomnia Severity Index and insomnia remission (Insomnia Severity Index <8). Therapist ratings of patient agreement as well as homework completion were significantly associated with sleep diary-derived global ABS. Therapist-rated patient agreement and homework completion as well as global ABS predicted greater insomnia symptoms reduction from pretreatment to posttreatment. Patient agreement also predicted insomnia symptoms reduction from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up. Patient agreement, adherence, and ABS measures during treatment significantly predicted insomnia remission at posttreatment, and all but therapist rating of homework completion predicted remission at 6-month follow-up. Greater patient agreement and adherence (therapist ratings and ABS) during treatment predicted better treatment outcome. Therapist-rated treatment agreement and adherence correspond well with patient-reported sleep diary-derived adherence measure.

The purpose of this secondary analysis was to compare actigraphy-customized scoring settings with polysomnography (PSG) for the measurement of sleep outcomes in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have insomnia. Participants underwent overnight sleep assessment simultaneously by PSG and actigraphy at the University of Illinois of Chicago Sleep Science Center. Fifty participants (35 men and 15 women) with mild-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-existing insomnia were included in the analysis. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were calculated independently from data derived from PSG and actigraphy. Actigraphy sleep outcome scores obtained at the default setting and several customized actigraphy settings were compared to the scored PSG results. Although no single setting was optimal for all sleep outcomes, the combination of 10 consecutive immobile minutes for sleep onset or end and an activity threshold of 10 worked well. Actigraphy overestimated TST and SE and underestimated WASO, but there was no difference in variance between PSG and actigraphy in TST and SE when the 10Â ÃÂ 10 combination was used. As the average TST and SE increased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase, and as the average WASO decreased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase.

Insomnia disorder comprises a dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality characterized by difficulty initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, or early morning wakening without the ability to return to sleep, at least 3 nights per week, for at least 3Â months, causing significant impairment or distress in areas of functioning. We will recruit 308 women with a current or prior cancer diagnosis who are currently experiencing insomnia; defined as a score of 16 or less on the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI). Participants will be randomised to dCBT-I or SHE. dCBT-I will be delivered online via 6 sessions. SHE will be provided in an online format. Assessments of sleep and other related parameters, through validated questionnaires, will be taken at 12 and 24Â weeks following intervention. Once 24Â week assessments are completed, participants will crossover to the alternate arm (either SHE or dCBT-I) and undergo a final assessment at week 36. The primary outcome will be the mean continuous change in SCI score in the intervention arm compared to the control arm at 24Â weeks. Additionally, the proportion of women with an SCIÂ >Â 16 at 24Â weeks will be assessed. Secondary outcomes include fatigue, sleep related quality of life, depression, anxiety, and hot flush interference.

Insomnia is the most common. When chronic, it usually reflects psychological/behavioral disturbances. Most insomniacs can be evaluated in an office setting, and a multidimensional approach is recommended, including sleep hygiene measures, psychotherapy, and medication. The parasomnias, including sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares, have benign implications in childhood but often reflect psychopathology or significant stress in adolescents and adults and organicity in the elderly. Excessive daytime sleepiness is typically the most frequent complaint and often reflects organic dysfunction. Narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are chronic brain disorders with an onset at a young age, whereas sleep apnea is more common in middle age and is associated with obesity and cardiovascular problems.

Effects of an antidepressant drug on sleep are important for its clinical profile. Rapid improvement of sleep quality is particularly indicated in depressed patients with insomnia, anxiety, agitation and suicidal thoughts. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of trazodone on sleep in depressed patients in comparison to other sleep promoting antidepressants: agomelatine, amitriptyline, doxepin, mianserine and mirtazapine according to analysis of scientific publications. Sedative antidepressants including trazodone are regarded as treatment of choice in depression with agitation, anxiety or insomnia. They are also frequently used in low dose to promote sleep, as an alternative to hypnotics. Such approach to treatment of insomnia in depressed patients protects them against dependence on hypnotic drugs. Additionally, the antagonistic action of antidepressants on serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors improves not only the sleep continuity, but promotes also slow wave sleep. Trazodone and mirtazapine in comparison to many other antidepressants do not suppress REM sleep. Antidepressants have different effects on sleep. In treatment of depression sedative antidepressants should be administered in the full, recommended dose. However, if they are administered as concomitant treatment only to promote sleep, low doses are indicated.

We pooled eight datasets (NÂ =Â 3053 participants) that assessed repeated measures of sleep diary- and/or actigraphy-determined sleep across multiple days, as well as one-time measures of mental health or sleep disorder symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and insomnia). Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between sleep intraindividual variability and mental health or sleep disorder symptoms. Greater diary- and actigraphy-determined sleep duration intraindividual variability was associated with more depression symptoms (diary: b=0.02, pÂ <Â .001; actigraphy: b=0.03, pÂ =Â .006) and more insomnia symptoms (diary: b=0.02, pÂ <Â .001; actigraphy: b=0.02, pÂ <Â .001). Greater diary-determined sleep efficiency intraindividual variability was associated with fewer anxiety symptoms (b=-0.23, pÂ =Â .019) and fewer insomnia symptoms (b=-0.15, pÂ <Â .001). Greater diary- and actigraphy-determined sleep midpoint intraindividual variability was associated with more insomnia symptoms (diary: b=0.41, pÂ =Â .044; actigraphy: b=0.66, pÂ =Â .021). More inconsistent sleep duration and sleep timing may be a correlate of poorer mental health. Future experimental work should examine whether stabilizing sleep patterns can improve mental health outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38704353/"}

Treatment options are improved sleep hygiene, relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications. Studies examining the effect of hypnotics on insomnia reported that placebo had a substantial beneficial effect. To evaluate whether placebo is an effective treatment for insomnia. We assessed 25 patients with insomnia who were enrolled in a hypnotic study but prior to the study were asked to undergo two full nights in laboratory polysomnography studies: with and without a placebo. Although they were not explicitly told that they were receiving a placebo, the participants knew that the results of these studies would determine whether they met the criteria to participate in the pharmaceutical study. Although the participants acknowledged that they were given a placebo, almost all measures of their sleep improved. With placebo, sleep latency was shortened from 55.8 +/- 43.5 to 39.8 +/- 58.5 minutes (P < 0.05); total sleep time was extended from 283 +/- 72.5 to 362.9 +/- 56.3 minutes, and sleep efficiency improved from 59.57 +/- 14.78 to 75.5 +/- 11.70% (P < 0.05). Interestingly, placebo had no effect on the relative sleep stage distribution (percentage of total sleep time), except for a trend toward increased percentage of REM sleep. Our findings show a clear and significant beneficial effect of placebo on insomnia, despite participants' understanding that they were receiving placebo. These results emphasize the importance of the patients' perception and belief in insomnia treatment, and suggest that in some cases placebo may serve as a treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24079065/"}

Data were collected from 384 representative Australian adolescents aged 13-18 years old (59% male). During school hours, adolescents completed a comprehensive questionnaire battery targeting insomnia criteria and then completed a sleep diary for 7 days. Insomnia symptoms were frequently reported by adolescents (e.g., 34.6% for frequent sleep-related daytime consequences). The proportion of adolescents meeting the diagnositc criteria for insomnia was much smaller: 10.9% of adolescents were classified as having General Insomnia using ICSD-II criteria, and 7.8% were classified as having Primary Insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria. ICSD-II Psychophysiological Insomnia was observed in 3.4% of adolescents. Insomnia diagnoses did not vary according to age, gender, school grade, or socioeconomic status. Using the ICSD-II criteria for General Insomnia resulted in a significantly higher number of insomnia diagnoses than did DSM-IV criteria for Primary Insomnia (p < 0.001) and ICSD-II Psychophysiological Insomnia (p < 0.001). These results reveal that approximately 3 adolescents in the average classroom of 30 are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia, while many more will have insomnia symptoms.

Behavioral interventions can be challenging because of developmental and behavioral features that interfere with treatment. Medication management also can be difficult due to a high burden of side effects, a high rate of paradoxical responses, and frequent treatment resistance. Therefore, new treatment options for insomnia in children with NDDs are needed. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) are a relatively new class of pharmacotherapeutics that induce sleep by inhibiting the orexin signaling pathway. To date, there is little safety or efficacy data on the use of DORAs in children with NDDs. We present four patients with NDDs and insomnia that we treated with the DORA, suvorexant. We found that patients had a wide range of responses, with one patient displaying a robust improvement in sleep onset and maintenance, while another had significant improvement in insomnia symptoms on combination therapy with trazodone. Our final two patients had mild or no benefit from suvorexant therapy. Further research is necessary to establish the safety and efficacy of DORAs in this population and to identify predictive factors, such as specific neurogenetic diagnoses or clinical features, of a positive treatment response.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34611728/"}

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to November 2014. We included randomized controlled trials published in English comparing melatonin with placebo that reported benzodiazepine discontinuation or sleep quality. Two reviewers independently screened trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We included six trials randomizing 322 participants. The mean age of participants was approximately 64 years. The trials used varied tapering strategies to discontinue benzodiazepines over 4-10 weeks while using melatonin. Melatonin had no effect on the odds of successfully discontinuing benzodiazepines (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.21-2.41, p = 0.59). There was important heterogeneity among the trials (I (2) = 76%). The effect of melatonin on sleep quality was inconsistent. Melatonin had no effect on benzodiazepine discontinuation while the effect of melatonin on sleep quality was inconsistent.

Sleep misperception is considered by some investigators a common characteristic of chronic insomnia, whereas others propose it as a separate diagnosis. The frequency and the determinants of sleep misperception in general population samples are unknown. A total of 142 insomniacs and 724 controls selected from a general random sample of 1,741 individuals (aged â¥20 years) underwent a polysomnographic evaluation, completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, and were split into two groups based on their objective sleep duration: \"normal sleep duration\" (â¥6 hours) and \"short sleep duration\" (<6 hours). The discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration was determined by two independent factors. Short sleepers reported more sleep than they objectively had, and insomniacs reported less sleep than controls with similar objective sleep duration. The additive effect of these two factors resulted in underestimation only in insomniacs with normal sleep duration. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 profile of high depression and anxiety and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder. Underestimation of sleep duration is prevalent among insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Anxious-ruminative traits and poor resources for coping with stress seem to mediate the underestimation of sleep duration.

In one patient, midazolam was still effective after 151 days of administration. The ultrashort action (probably 3-4 h) of midazolam could be demonstrated by the distribution of the efficacy parameters, dividing the night into 2-h periods, by the unchanged total sleep length during medication compared with baseline and by the lack of any subjective clinical symptoms of hangover. The quantitative analysis of the signals showed that, although a decrease in the total amount of slow-wave sleep during long-term medication and withdrawal was detected, the total relative power in the delta band increased during drug administration. This was interpreted as redistribution of the delta activity during active medication. A lengthening of REM sleep was found during active medication probably attributable to intranight rebound.

Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data from 37 patients with ID and 30 well-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recorded during wakefulness and different sleep stages and subsequently analyzed. A Markov chain model was used to estimate the transition probability between each stage. The FC between the ACC (set as the seed) and voxels across the whole brain was calculated. A linear mixed effect model was used to determine the group-by-stage interaction of the seed-based connectivity. The correlation between the sleep-stage transition probability and the ACC-based connectivity was explored. Patients with ID exhibited a higher likelihood of transitioning from N2 to wakefulness than HCs. A significant group-by-stage interaction of connectivity with the bilateral ACC was observed in the cerebellar, subcortical, and cortical regions. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found in patients with ID between the transition probability from N2 to wakefulness and the FC of the ACC with the anterior cerebellum in N2 (r = 0.48). This exploratory analysis indicates that enhanced FC between the ACC and cerebellum represents a potential neural pathway underlying the greater likelihood of patients with ID waking during N2 sleep.

Thus, insomniacs have increased beta and decreased alpha activity relative to normals prior to the onset of stage 2 sleep. This agrees with our previous finding of increased presleep physiological activity in insomniacs. However, the present data also suggest that a CNS component of this activity, reflected by increased beta EEG, is reactivated during REM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2420556/"}

An earlier report revealed that, at posttreatment, VCBT-I patients showed significantly greater sleep improvements than CTL, but that PCBT-I produced superior effects than VCBT-I on some sleep and secondary outcomes. In this report, long-term effects are compared. Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group. PCBT-I was composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min, whereas VCBT-I comprised a 60-min animated video and six booklets. Study measures (sleep and secondary variables) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment, and at a 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up. Treatment gains were well sustained at follow-up in both PCBT-I and VCBT-I. As at posttreatment, the remission rate of insomnia at follow-up was greater in PCBT-I than in VCBT-I, which was greater than in CTL. Although face-to-face therapy remains the optimal format to efficaciously administer CBT for insomnia in cancer patients, a minimal intervention, such as the video-based intervention tested in this study, produces significant and sustainable treatment effects.

Comparable sleep parameters across studies included reduced sleep duration/quality, insomnia symptoms (sleep latency, waking up at night, and early awakenings), short and long sleep duration, and daytime napping. The cognitive domains were episodic memory, verbal fluency, perceptual speed, executive functioning, and global cognition (aggregated measure). A series of mixed linear models were run separately in each study and then compared to assess the level and rate of change in cognitive functioning across each sleep disturbance parameter. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, hypnotic usage, depressive symptoms, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular, and metabolic conditions. By using a coordinated analytic approach, comparable construct-level measurements were generated, and results from identical statistical models were qualitatively compared across studies. While the pattern of statistically significant results varied across studies, subjective sleep disturbances were consistently associated with worse cognition and steeper cognitive decline. Insomnia symptoms were associated with poorer episodic memory and participants sleeping less or more than 7-8 hours had a steeper decline in perceptual speed. In addition, daytime napping (>2 hours) was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with all examined cognitive domains. Most observed associations were study-specific (except for daytime napping), and a majority of association estimates remained significant after adjusting for covariates. This rigorous multicenter investigation further supports the importance of sleep disturbance, including insomnia, long and short sleep duration, and daytime napping on baseline cognitive functioning and rate of change among older adults.

In the current study, we examined plasma orexin-A levels in patients with insomnia disorder and in normal sleepers. We also studied the possible mechanisms underlying changes in orexin-A levels between the study groups; this included investigations of prepro-orexin and orexin receptor gene polymorphisms as well as exploration of other variables. We measured plasma orexin-A levels in 228 patients with insomnia disorder and 282 normal sleepers. The results indicated that the patients with insomnia disorder had significantly higher orexin-A levels than normal sleepers (63.42Â±37.56 vs. 54.84Â±23.95pg/ml). A positive relationship was detected between orexin-A level and age in patients with insomnia disorder. Orexin-A levels were elevated in relation to course of insomnia, as well as in relation to increased Insomnia Severity Index score. None of the evaluated prepro-orexin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms were informative between the two study populations. After sequencing all orexin receptor exons, one variation (rs2271933) in the OX1R gene and one variation (rs2653349) in the OX2R gene were found. However, no significant differences were found in either genotypic or allelic frequency distributions between the two study groups.

Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34Â Â±Â 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects. CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI. NAME: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes. URL: clinicaltrials.gov.

MANCOVA revealed significant main effects of poor sleep, sleep complaint, and their interaction on sleep IIV. Poor sleepers exhibited greater IIV across all sleep parameters compared to good sleepers. Similarly, individuals with a sleep complaint exhibited greater IIV compared to individuals with no complaint. The interaction revealed that iSD SOL was significantly greater among CP than NP, and iSD NWAK was significantly greater among CG than NG. Greater night-to-night variability in specific sleep parameters was present among complaining versus noncomplaining sleepers in good and poor sleep subgroups.

{"id": "26866361", "title": "The bidirectional relation between emotional reactivity and sleep: From disruption to recovery.", "text": "Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and greatly affect consecutive emotional reactivity, while sleep quality itself can be strongly affected by reactions to previous emotional events. In this review, we shed light on this bidirectional relation through examples of pathology: insomnia and bipolar disorder. We show that both experimental sleep deprivation and insomnia are related to increased emotional reactivity and increased amygdala activation upon emotional stimuli presentation, and that particularly Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is important for emotional processing and reorganization of emotion-specific brain activity. Increased emotional reactivity affects REM sleep quality and sleep spindles, while REM sleep is particularly affected in insomnia, possibly related to condition-specific hyperarousal levels. Normal sleep onset deactivation of brain regions important for emotional processing (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) is further affected in insomnia. In bipolar disorder, sleep disturbances are common in both symptomatic and nonsymptomatic phases. Both amygdala and ACC volume and function are affected in bipolar disorder, with the ACC showing phase-dependent resting state activity differences. Deficient Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABA-ergic activity of this region might play a role in sleep disturbances and their influence on emotional reactivity, given the inhibitory role of GABA on brain activity during sleep and its deficiency in both bipolar disorder and insomnia. Promising findings of normalizing brain activity in both insomnia and bipolar disorder upon treatment may inspire a focus on treatment studies investigating the normalization of sleep, emotional reactivity, and their corresponding brain activity patterns.

Sleep measures included self-reported adherence to NSF guidelines on sleep duration (sleeping between 7 and 9 hours per night), and self-reported difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia). Brain structural measures included global and regional cortical or subcortical morphometry (thickness, surface area, volume), global and tract-related white matter microstructure, brain age gap (difference between chronological age and age estimated from brain scan), and total volume of white matter lesions. Longer-than-recommended sleep duration was associated with lower overall grey and white matter volumes, lower global and regional cortical thickness and volume measures, higher brain age gap, higher volume of white matter lesions, higher mean diffusivity globally and in thalamic and association fibers, and lower volume of the hippocampus. Shorter-than-recommended sleep duration was related to higher global and cerebellar white matter volumes, lower global and regional cortical surface areas, and lower fractional anisotropy in projection fibers. Self-reported insomnia was associated with higher global gray and white matter volumes, and with higher volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen. Sleeping longer than recommended by the NSF is associated with a wide range of differences in brain structure, potentially indicative of poorer brain health.

The proportion of those sleeping poorly or fairly poorly increased linearly over time; 3.5% among both sexes at the start, and 15.5% among men and 20.9% among women at the end of the follow-up. The last survey indicated a strong association between self-rated health and sleep quality: sleeping poorly or fairly poorly was reported 15 times more frequently by those rating their health as fairly poor than by those rating their health as very good. There was a strong association between indicators of depression and poor sleep. Although many studies have reported increasing frequencies in sleep problems, our results, based on a long-term cohort study, indicate that the majority of people sleep well or fairly well.

Consequently, individuals with highly reactive sleep systems are prone to insomnia disorder after a stressor, engendering risk of psychopathology and potentially impeding recovery from traumatic stress. Thus, there is tremendous value in ameliorating sleep reactivity to foster a sleep system that is robust to stress exposure, ultimately preventing insomnia and its downstream consequences. We reviewed prospective evidence forÂ sleep reactivity as a predisposition to insomnia since our last review on the topic in 2017. We also reviewed studies investigating pre-trauma sleep reactivity as a predictor of adverse post-traumatic sequelae, and clinical trials that reported the effect of behavioural treatments for insomnia on mitigating sleep reactivity. Most studies measured sleep reactivity via self-report using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), demonstrating high scores on this scale reliably indicate a sleep system with a lower capacity to tolerate stress. Nascent evidence suggests elevated sleep reactivity prior to trauma increases the risk of negative posttraumatic outcomes, namely acute stress disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Lastly, sleep reactivity appears most responsive to behavioural insomnia interventions when delivered early during the acute phase of insomnia. Overall, the literature strongly supports sleep reactivity as a premorbid vulnerability to incident acute insomnia disorder when faced with an array of biopsychosocial stressors. The FIRST identifies individuals at risk of insomnia a priori, thereby guiding early interventions toward this vulnerable population to prevent insomnia and promote resilience to adversity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020247/"}

Insomnia severity and sleep quality were measured by the Insomnia Severity Inventory (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Pain and somatic symptoms were measured by the Somatic Symptom Inventory and Visual Analogue Scale for overall pain. Subjects with insomnia scored higher on all measures of pain and somatic symptoms than non-insomnia patients, in both adolescents and adults (P<.001). Both pain and somatic measures were associated with ISI and PSQI scores after controlling for age, sex, depressive and anxiety symptoms. There was an interaction effect between insomnia and female sex on pain and somatic symptoms (P<.05), especially in adults. Pain and somatic symptoms ran in family with moderate heritability (range h(2)=0.15-0.42). The phenotypic associations of ISI and PSQI with pain and somatic measures were both contributed by genetic (range p(G)=0.41-0.96) and environmental (range p(E)=0.27-0.40) factors with a major genetic contribution. In summary, insomnia and poor sleep quality are closely associated with pain and somatic symptoms.

We investigated the effects on daytime sleep of placebo or caffeine after a night of total sleep deprivation (SD).

Six primary insomnia patients (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)) and six normal volunteers with no sleep complaints participated in a double-blind study with caffeine or placebo administered under a cross-over design with each subject serving as his or her own control.

Mean sleep latency under basal MSLT did not differ between the groups. However, insomnia patients had significantly less total sleep during each nap compared to normal volunteers. After one night of total SD and under caffeine administration, the insomniacs had significantly longer sleep latency and less total sleep time in MSLT compared to normal volunteers. After SD, healthy volunteers reduced sleep latencies in MSLT with or without caffeine.

Forty-five nontreated patients with primary insomnia spent three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory, during which polysomnographic recordings were carried out. Nonrapid eye movement and rapid eye movement EEG data were analyzed using spectral analysis. In addition, each participant completed several self-report questionnaires assessing maltreatment in childhood and adolescence, current level of stress, and current depressivity. Insomnia patients with self-reported history of moderate to severe childhood maltreatment (MAL group; n = 25), as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, were compared with insomnia patients without such a history (non-MAL group; n = 20). The MAL group exhibited more absolute and relative beta 1 and beta 2 power in nonrapid eye movement sleep and more absolute beta 1 and beta 2 activity in rapid eye movement sleep than the non-MAL group. Contrary to hypothesis, no group differences were found in gamma frequency band. The results suggest an association between history of childhood maltreatment and increased beta EEG activity particularly during nonrapid eye movement sleep in adult insomnia, what may reflect heightened psychophysiologic arousal during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23545770/"}

(MICADO-study): study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.", "text": "Adolescents and young adults who had childhood cancer are at increased risk for insomnia, due to being critically ill during an important phase of their life for the development of good sleep habits. Insomnia is disabling and prevalent after childhood cancer (26-29%) and negatively impacts quality of life, fatigue, pain, and general functioning and is often associated with other (mental) health problems. Insomnia and a history of childhood cancer both increase the risk of adverse health outcomes, posing a double burden for adolescents who had childhood cancer. The first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). However, access to this type of care is often limited. The guided online CBT-I treatment \"i-Sleep\" has been developed to facilitate access via online care. i-Sleep is shown effective in adult (breast cancer) patients, but it is unknown if iCBT-I is effective in pediatric oncology. We developed a youth version of i-Sleep. Our aim is to evaluate its effectiveness in a national randomized-controlled clinical trial comparing iCBT-I to a waiting-list control condition at 3 and 6âmonths (nâ=â70). The intervention group will be also assessed at 12âmonths to see whether the post-test effects are maintained. Adolescents and young adults aged 12-30âyears with insomnia, diagnosed with (childhood) cancer, currently at least 6âmonths since their last cancer treatment will be eligible. Outcomes include sleep efficiency (actigraphic), insomnia severity (self-report), sleep and circadian activity rhythm parameters, fatigue, health-related quality of life, perceived cognitive functioning, chronic distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and intervention acceptability. Insomnia is prevalent in the pediatric oncology population posing a double health burden for adolescents and young adults who had childhood cancer. If guided iCBT-I is effective, guidelines for insomnia can be installed to treat insomnia and potentially improve quality of life and the health of adolescents and young adults who had childhood cancer.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of discontinuing third-generation hypnotics on the results of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for primary insomnia in patients after long-term abuse. Twenty-eight outpatients were treated by CBT for 8 weeks. The treatment outcome was estimated by means of differences among subjective clinical scales and polysomnography variables assessed before and after the treatment period. The therapeutic effect in a subgroup of 15 patients who had previously received hypnotics and were successively withdrawn during weeks 2-6 was compared to the effect achieved in patients who had not used hypnotics before CBT. There were no significant differences in baseline subjective and objective sleep characteristics between the hypnotic abusers and non-abusers. According to clinical scales and most polysomnographic measures, CBT was highly effective in both groups of subjects; it produced the greatest changes in total sleep time, REM sleep and sleep efficiency. Unexpectedly, discontinuation of hypnotics, as a factor in the analysis, was followed by an additional improvement of sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset parameters. Our study confirmed the efficacy of CBT in both hypnotic-abusing and non-abusing patients with chronic insomnia. The results of this study suggest that tapered withdrawal of third-generation hypnotics during CBT therapy for chronic insomnia could be associated with improvement rather than worsening of sleep continuity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801160/"}

A 3-class model was built by latent class analysis: 17% (nâ=â58) of children constituted the first class, characterized by difficulties in falling asleep, with restlessness, nocturnal restlessness, and awakenings during the night; the second class, characterized by early morning awakenings, comprised 21% (nâ=â71) of children; 62% (nâ=â209) of children fell within the third class because of their high frequency of nocturnal awakenings and difficulties in falling asleep. The first class reported longer sleep latency and the presence of restless legs syndrome and anemia in the family history; depression and/or mood disorders were more frequent in class 2 and allergies and/or food intolerance were more frequent in class 3.

Regression analyses were conducted. Mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS Macro. There were 80.6% who identified themselves as a binge viewer. Among those who binge viewed (n = 341), 20.2% had binge viewed at least a few times a week during the past month. Among poor sleepers (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5), 32.6% had a poor sleep quality associated with being a binge viewer. Higher binge viewing frequency was associated with a poorer sleep quality, increased fatigue and more symptoms of insomnia, whereas regular television viewing was not. Cognitive pre-sleep arousal fully mediated these relationships. New viewing styles such as binge viewing are increasingly prevalent and may pose a threat to sleep. Increased cognitive arousal functions as the mechanism explaining these effects. Measures of media exposure should take into account the user's level of engagement with media.

Our study (1) assessed the sleep and suicide-related correlates of DBs, and (2) examined if change in DBs was associated with change in sleep, in a sample of acutely suicidal adolescents aged 12-18 years in an intensive cognitive behavior therapy-informed treatment program that did not target sleep. Measures of DBs (using the 16-item Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep Scale's (DBAS) total score and four subscale scores: Consequences, Helplessness, Expectations, and Medications), sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, and suicide ideation were administered at program admission and discharge. Total DBs were concurrently associated (all psâ¯<â¯.05) with sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, and suicide ideation, and reduction of DBs was associated with improvement in sleep over treatment. There was some variability in the association between types of DBAS and variables of interest, with the Helplessness subscale showing the strongest and most consistent associations. Limitations include subjective measurements only, a lack of specific insomnia symptom measures, and a nondiverse sample. DBs show promise as a target in the management of suicidal adolescents.

After adjustment for depressive symptoms, elevated state anxiety was associated with higher levels of wake after sleep onset (measured by both actigraphy and sleep log) and shorter sleep onset latency (measured by sleep log). Higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater wake after sleep onset (measured by sleep log).

Of these, 98 were randomized to CBT, 23 were assigned to progressive muscle relaxation training (PMR), and 34 were assigned to a control (sham therapy or wait-list) condition (CON). All patients completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), a sleep-related Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) and nightly sleep diaries for 2 weeks prior to receiving their assigned treatment. They then completed sleep diaries throughout an 8-week acute treatment period and during a 2-week period at a posttherapy follow-up. A subset of the sample (n=67) also completed polysomnography immediately before and after completing their assigned treatment. Preliminary regression analyses conducted with a small subset (n=15) of the patients receiving CBT showed those with relatively high levels of unhelpful sleep-related beliefs (Type 1 patients), as reflected by their pretherapy responses to the DBAS and SES questionnaires, showed markedly greater reductions in nocturnal wakefulness in response to CBT than did those (Type 2 patients) reporting less pronounced sleep-related beliefs. Given these findings, we used the regression equation derived from our initial analyses to dichotomize our entire sample into Type 1 (n=82; 52.9%) and Type 2 (n=73; 47.1%) subgroups. Subsequent comparisons showed CBT-treated Type 1 patients had significantly less wake time after sleep onset during most of the 8-week treatment phase than did the Type 1 and 2 individuals assigned to either PMR or CON. Relative to patients assigned to the PMR and CON conditions, CBT-treated Type 1 patients showed better performance across multiple subjective and objective benchmarks of clinically significant improvement, whereas the CBT-treated Type 2 patients did not. Results suggest that insomnia patients' pretherapy cognitive dispositions predict CBT outcome, and those with a pronounced sense of sleep-related helplessness are best suited for this treatment which targets this cognitive stance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19027437/"}

Forty-two patients completed baseline and continued into treatment. Sleep logs showed CBT-treated patients achieved nearly a 50% reduction in their nocturnal wake time by study completion, whereas SH therapy- and usual care-treated patients achieved only 20% and 3.5% reductions on this measure, respectively. In addition, 8 (57%) of 14 CBT recipients met strict subjective sleep improvement criteria by the end of treatment compared with 2 (17%) of 12 SH therapy recipients and 0% of the usual care group. Comparable findings were noted for similar actigraphic improvement criteria. The SH therapy patients showed favorable outcomes on measures of pain and mental well-being.

Headache outcomes and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Mixed-effects models were used to examine longitudinal headache outcomes in the groups according to the intention to treat. Principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were conducted to reduce 16 variables for data-driven phenotyping. Patients in the BBT-CI arm (n = 73) exhibited a significant reduction in headache burden over time (P = .02; effect size [Cohen d] = 0.43), whereas the reduction was not significant among those in the HEAL arm (n = 66). The first principal component was positively loaded by headache, sleep, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting and was negatively loaded by cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed 3 natural clusters. Cluster I (n = 58) featured the highest burden of headache, insomnia, and nausea/vomiting; cluster II (n = 50) featured the lowest HRV despite a low burden of headache and insomnia; and cluster III (n = 31) showed an inverse relation between HRV and headache-insomnia, signifying autonomic dysfunction.

The Potential of the Conditioned Yawn Reflex as a Novel Treatment for Insomnia Disorder.", "text": "In 1986, Provine, the pioneer of yawning research wrote that 'Yawning may have the dubious distinction of being the least understood, common human behaviour' (p. 120); and so yawning remains some 40âyears later, as something of a biological and social curiosity. However, this article examines contemporary scientific understanding of this age-old conundrum, proposing not only that yawning is a universal component of sleep's normal stimulus control paradigm, but that the conditioned yawn reflex might be harnessed to treat insomnia disorder. The core features of yawning as a ubiquitous, involuntary, periodic and conditionable behaviour; its associated actions on arousal, biofeedback and selective attention, as well as thermoregulation and airway patency; and its potential to signal and promote sleep engagement, lead to the proposition that the conditioned yawn reflex as therapy (CYRaT) is a feasible and potentially effective novel therapeutic for sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia disorder. Much research is required to test this hypothesis, but the article describes preliminary protocols for the administration and testing of CYRaT that might be utilised for this purpose.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40702602/"}

Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor agonists are the traditional medications used to treat insomnia. More recently, orexin inhibitors have been introduced that may have fewer adverse effects, including the development of dependence. To date, only suvorexant and lemborexant have been approved for the treatment of insomnia. However, several other agents are in later stages of development.

Relative rCMR<sub>glc</sub> was significantly lower during recovery NREM sleep compared to baseline in the left frontoparietal cortex, medial frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus, with no significant group differences. Good sleepers, but not insomnia patients, had lower whole-brain glucose metabolism during recovery NREM sleep compared to baseline. Acute sleep restriction improved sleep quality in individual with insomnia. Subgroup analyses including only participants who underwent partial sleep restriction yielded the same pattern of findings. Individuals with insomnia and good sleepers showed similar relative rCMR<sub>glc</sub> responses to acute sleep restriction.

Sleep efficiency, total sleep time, wake within total sleep period (middle insomnia) and wake before buzzer (late insomnia) were significantly deteriorated in both patient groups as compared with controls, while sleep induction time only differed significantly in home recordings. Regarding sleep architecture, stage (S)2 was reduced, S3 and S4 increased in the H-group only, while no intergroup differences were seen in S1, SREM and REM latency. Subjective sleep quality was reduced in both patient groups, but not awakening quality. Psychometric tests in the morning demonstrated for the noopsyche, only a significantly deteriorated psychomotor activity in both patient groups. In the thymopsyche, evening well-being and mood in the morning were reduced in both the L- and H-group, affectivity and morning well-being only in the H-group. The psychopharmacological part of the study was completed by 40 patients (there were 4 drop-outs in the triazolam, 1 in the quazepam group). They were treated after 1 week placebo with either 15-30 mg (median 15 mg) quazepam or 0.25-0.5 mg (median 0.25 mg) triazolam for 4 weeks, and thereafter for 2 weeks with placebo. Anxiety (rated by HAMA and SAS) improved significantly with both drugs and remained improved throughout 2 weeks post-drug placebo, with quazepam being slightly superior to triazolam. Polysomnography demonstrated a shortened sleep onset only after quazepam. Sleep efficiency improved after acute administration of both drugs, but the improvement was maintained by quazepam only (tolerance development with triazolam). Rebound insomnia was observed only in the 1st post-triazolam placebo night (significant intergroup difference based on confirmatory testing).

This preliminary study aimed to develop and test a sleep intervention, namely FIT-IN (Firefighter's Therapy for Insomnia and Nightmares), which was based on existing evidence-based treatment tailored to firefighters in consideration of their occupational characteristics. <i>Methods</i>: This study implemented a single-group pre-post study design, utilizing an intervention developed based on brief behavior therapy for insomnia with imagery rehearsal therapy components. FIT-IN consisted of a total of three sessions (two face-to-face group sessions and one telephone session). Participants were recruited from Korean fire stations, and a total of 39 firefighters participated. Participants completed a sleep diary for two weeks, as well as the following questionnaires to assess their sleep and psychological factors: insomnia severity index (ISI), disturbing dream and nightmare severity index (DDNSI), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), depressive symptom inventory-suicidality subscale (DSI), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).

Specifically, different aspects of both positive and negative affect were uniquely predictive of sleep indices, with sadness and serenity acting as the most consistent predictors. Additionally, better sleep quality was predictive of greater happiness the following day.

Furthermore, protein-protein interaction(PPI) network, Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on the core targets. An active component-core target network for Anshen Dropping Pills was constructed. Finally, the effects of low-, medium-, and high-dose groups of Anshen Dropping Pills on sleep episodes, sleep duration, and sleep latency in mice were measured by supraliminal and subliminal pentobarbital sodium experiments. Moreover, total scores of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI) scale was used to evaluate the changes before and after the treatment with Anshen Dropping Pills in a clinical study. The enrichment analysis based on the relationship between drugs and symptoms verified the rationality of the Anshen Dropping Pills formula, and nine blood-entering components of Anshen Dropping Pills were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The network proximity revealed a significant correlation between eight components and insomnia, including magnoflorine, liquiritin, spinosin, quercitrin, jujuboside A, ginsenoside Rb_3, glycyrrhizic acid, and glycyrrhetinic acid. Network pharmacology analysis indicated that the major anti-insomnia pathways of Anshen Dropping Pills involved substance and energy metabolism, neuroprotection, immune system regulation, and endocrine regulation. Seven core genes related to insomnia were identified: APOE, ALB, BDNF, PPARG, INS, TP53, and TNF. In summary, Anshen Dropping Pills could increase sleep episodes, prolong sleep duration, and reduce sleep latency in mice. Clinical study results demonstrated that Anshen Dropping Pills could decrease total scores of PSQI scale.

A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18673164/"}

We applied the location-scale mixed model to examine changes from baseline in sleep efficiency on data collected from 54 participants with chronic insomnia who were randomized to an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; n = 19), an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI; n = 19), or an 8-week self-monitoring control (SM; n = 16). Sleep efficiency was derived from daily sleep diaries collected at baseline (days 1-7), early treatment (days 8-21), late treatment (days 22-63), and post week (days 64-70). The behavioral components (sleep restriction, stimulus control) were delivered during late treatment in MBTI. For MBSR and MBTI, the pre-to-post change in mean levels of sleep efficiency were significantly larger than the change in mean levels for the SM control, but the change in IIV was not significantly different. During early and late treatment, MBSR showed a larger increase in mean levels of sleep efficiency and a larger decrease in IIV relative to the SM control. At late treatment, MBTI had a larger increase in the mean level of sleep efficiency compared to SM, but the IIV was not significantly different. The location-scale mixed model provides a two-dimensional analysis on the mean and IIV using longitudinal sleep diary data with the potential to reveal insights into treatment mechanisms and outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26951414/"}

All subjects received lorediplon 1, 5, and 10 mg, placebo, and zolpidem 10 mg (i.e., active control). Polysomnographic evaluation revealed that lorediplon (5 and 10 mg) significantly decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and increased total sleep time. Analysis by quarters of the night showed a progressive increasing effectiveness of lorediplon 10 mg across the first three quarters. Lorediplon increased non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep and stage N2 sleep in the second and third quarters. The magnitude of these effects was dose related, with minimal effects seen with 1 mg. No residual effects were observed 13 h post dose. Lorediplon demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in sleep, whereas zolpidem showed a more sustained WASO effect. No next-day hangover effects were observed. These sleep effects are also consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of lorediplon.

We hypothesized that wearing blue-blocking (BB) glasses in the evening may influence circadian rhythm disturbances in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), resulting in improved sleep and mood. We used a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded design. Patients with MDD with sleep onset insomnia were randomly assigned to wearing either BB glasses or clear glasses (placebo). Patients were instructed to wear the glasses from 20:00 hours until bedtime for 2 weeks. We assessed sleep state (sleep quality on a visual analog scale, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire [MEQ], and a sleep diary) and depressive symptoms at baseline and after 2 weeks. Data were analyzed with a full analysis set. In total, 20 patients were randomly assigned to the BB and placebo groups (BB group, n = 10; placebo group, n = 10). There were three dropouts (BB group, n = 1; placebo group, n = 2). At baseline, sleep quality, sleep latency (assessed via a sleep diary), and antipsychotics use differed between the groups. To take account of these differences, the baseline sleep state or depressive symptoms and antipsychotics use were used as covariates in the later analysis. The change scores for sleep quality did not show a significant improvement in the BB group compared with the placebo group (mean [standard deviation, SD] scores for BB versus placebo: 36.1 [31.7] versus 16.2 [15.1], p = 0.43), although half of the BB group showed a clear improvement in sleep quality. The change in MEQ scores did not significantly differ between the groups (p = 0.14), although there was a trend of a shift to morning type in the BB group (3.10 [4.95] points) and to evening type in the placebo group (0.50 [3.89] points). There were no statistically significant changes in depressive symptoms in either group. Across both groups, 40% of the participants reported pain or discomfort from wearing the glasses, which were available in only one size. Thus, the failure to find significant differences may have resulted from the glasses used in this study. Glasses fitted to individual patients may improve efficacy and safety.

Purpose of this WFSBP Task Force consensus paper is to systematically evaluate a series of biomarkers as potential diagnostic tools for insomnia. A newly created grading system was used for assessing the validity of various measurements in establishing the diagnosis of insomnia; these measurements originated from relevant studies selected and reviewed by experts. The measurements with the highest diagnostic performance were those derived from psychometric instruments. Biological measurements which emerged as potentially useful diagnostic instruments were polysomnography-derived cyclic alternating pattern, actigraphy, and BDNF levels, followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and certain neuroimaging patterns (mainly for the activity of frontal and pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia); yet, these findings need replication, as well as establishment of commonly accepted methodology and diagnostic cut-off points. Routine polysomnography, EEG spectral analysis, heart rate variability, skin conductance, thermoregulation, oxygen consumption, HPA axis, and inflammation indices were not shown to be of satisfactory diagnostic value. Apart from psychometric instruments which are confirmed to be the gold standard in diagnosing insomnia, six biomarkers emerge as being potentially useful for this purpose.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36880792/"}

The authors explored rumination as a potential explanatory variable underlying the association of mindfulness with insomnia and sleep quality, with a model encompassing different mindfulness facets and controlling for interpersonal dispositional forgiveness. One hundred adults (74% females, M<sub>age</sub> = 27.62, SD = 8.11) completed measures of Mindfulness, Forgivingness, Rumination, Sleep Quality, and Insomnia. Nonjudging was the main mindfulness facet contributing to better sleep quality. Rumination completely mediated the associations of nonjudgmental attitude with insomnia and sleep quality, and partially mediated the associations of dispositional forgiveness with the outcomes. These findings suggest that a mindful nonjudgmental attitude toward the self and a forgiving interpersonal disposition may reduce rumination by helping individuals let go of thoughts, mental images, and emotions, thus promoting better sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36454149/"}

Participants (N=242) were diagnosed with an insomnia disorder by sleep experts. Participants completed measures of worry and rumination and maintained a 2-week daily sleep log. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance found no main effect of worry; although high and low ruminators differed on several sleep log indices, including sleep efficiency, wakefulness after sleep onset and sleep quality. Factor analysis supported the idea that rumination and worry are separate constructs. Whereas previous research has focused on worry in insomnia, these findings suggest that rumination is important for understanding sleep disturbance. Further, although rumination and worry are both repetitive thought processes, these results indicate that they are distinct processes within insomnia and should be treated as such.

Although social support was found to be associated with quality of sleep in a recent meta-analysis, this relationship was never studied in older BZD users. This study thus aims to examine how social support is associated with quality of sleep in older BZD users.<b>Method:</b> Seventy-two older adults (age 60-85) using BZD were recruited. Data was collected during the pre-test of the ''PASSE-60+; Support program for a successful withdrawal, NCT02281175'' study. Quality of sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while social support was evaluated with the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ-6).<b>Results:</b> When examining the various dimensions of self-reported sleep quality as a whole, we found no significant association with social support, while controlling for daily BZD dose, anxiety and depression. However, we found a significant association between self-reported diurnal dysfunctions (e.g., daytime sleepiness) and satisfaction with social support.<b>Conclusion:</b> Although the results of our study should be replicated with larger samples, they might indicate that social support is not a significant factor influencing sleep quality in older chronic BZD users. Our results could differ from those found in other populations because of the changes in sleep quality associated with long term BZD use.

Experimental models of acute sleep loss, of chronic partial sleep deprivation, and of sleep fragmentation in healthy sleepers are helpful models of sleep deficiency produced by insufficient sleep duration, sleep timing, and sleep disorders. Sleep deficiency is associated with changes in markers associated with risk for disease. These include metabolic, inflammatory, and autonomic markers of risk. In addition, sleep disruption and sleep deficits lead to mood instability, lack of positive outlook, and impaired neurobehavioral functioning. On a population level, insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk for hypertension and diabetes. Sleep disturbance is very common, and about half the population will report that they have experienced insomnia at some time in their lives. Approximately 10% of the population describe daytime impairment due to sleep disturbance at night, consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia disorder. The hypothalamic neuropeptides, orexin-A and orexin-B, act through G-protein-coupled receptors (orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors). Dual and selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists have shown efficacy in inducing sleep in men and women with insomnia disorder by accelerating sleep onset and improving sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Further study comparing these medications, in short- and longer-term use models, is recommended.

In multivariate-adjusted models, relative to those with \"normal\" nighttime sleep duration (>7 to 8 hours per night), the odds of having 2 or more falls in the subsequent year was elevated for women who slept 5 hours or less per night (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.24). This association was not explained by the use of benzodiazepines. Indexes of sleep fragmentation were also associated with an increased risk of falls. For example, women with poor sleep efficiency (<70% of time in bed spent sleeping) had 1.36-fold increased odds of falling compared with others (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.74). Short nighttime sleep duration and increased sleep fragmentation are associated with increased risk of falls in older women, independent of benzodiazepine use and other risk factors for falls.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18779464/"}

The present study aimed to identify novel inferred causal relationships between sleep-related traits and other phenotypes, using a genetics-driven hypothesis-free approach not requiring longitudinal data. We used summary-level statistics from genome-wide association studies and the latent causal variable (LCV) method to screen the phenome and infer causal relationships between seven sleep-related traits (insomnia, daytime dozing, easiness of getting up in the morning, snoring, sleep duration, napping, and morningness) and 1,527 other phenotypes. We identify 84 inferred causal relationships. Among other findings, connective tissue disorders increase insomnia risk and reduce sleep duration; depression-related traits increase insomnia and daytime dozing; insomnia, napping, and snoring are affected by obesity and cardiometabolic traits and diseases; and working with asbestos, thinner, or glues may increase insomnia risk, possibly through an increased risk of respiratory disease or socio-economic related factors. Overall, our results indicate that changes in sleep variables are predominantly the consequence, rather than the cause, of other underlying phenotypes and diseases.

A large population-based study from Norway conducted in 2012, the youth@hordaland study, surveyed 9328 adolescents aged 16-19 years (54% girls). Self-reported sleep measures provided information on sleep duration, sleep deficit, weekday bedtime and bedtime difference and insomnia. The main dependent variables were frequency and amount of alcohol consumption and illicit drug use, in addition to the presence of alcohol and drug problems as measured by CRAFFT. The results showed that all sleep parameters were associated with substance involvement in a dose-response manner. Short sleep duration, sleep deficit, large bedtime differences and insomnia were all significantly associated with higher odds of all alcohol and drug use/misuse measures. The associations were only partly attenuated by sociodemographics factors and co-existing symptoms of depression and ADHD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to examine the association between sleep, and alcohol and drug use, by employing detailed measures of sleep behaviour and problems, as well as validated measures on consumption of alcohol and illicit drug use.

We discuss recent developments from human molecular imaging studies that highlight the role of specific brain neurotransmitter mechanisms, such as the adenosinergic receptor system, on anxiety, arousal, and sleep. This review further discusses frontline sleep interventions aimed at enhancing sleep in individuals experiencing anxiety, such as nonbenzodiazepines/antidepressants, lifestyle and sleep interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Notwithstanding therapeutic success, up to â¼30% of individuals with anxiety can be nonresponsive to frontline treatments. Thus, we address novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that can enhance electroencephalographic slow waves, and might help alleviate sleep and anxiety symptoms.

Six types of music were selected for sleep aid, and a dot-probe task based on sleep-related attentional bias was utilized to collect behavioral and EEG data. Vigilance bias and disengagement bias were measured using reaction time and EEG FC. Differences in sleep-related attentional bias before and after the intervention of music were explored to evaluate the sleep-aiding effects and identify EEG biomarkers. Compared with HCs, patients with ID showed decreased sleep-related attentional bias of EEG FC between occipital-central and temporal-frontal lobes. Among the six types of music, International Standard Sleep Aid and Lullaby had a greater impact on decreasing vigilance bias in the ID group. Additionally, the International Standard Sleep Aid and Nature Sound were more effective in decreasing disengagement bias in the ID group. This study also examined the resting-state EEG FC of patients with ID before and after the intervention of music. The results showed that the FC in the temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes significantly differed before and after the intervention of music, especially with the use of International Standard Sleep Aid, Lullaby, and Alpha Sound Wave. However, it is worth noting that these three types of music showed no similarities in EEG FC, in contrast to the result of sleep-related attentional bias of EEG FC.

Sleep is a process the brain requires for proper functioning. Sleep hygiene can be described as practices to ease sleep and to avoid factors which decrease sleep quality. Inadequate sleep hygiene generally results in disturbance of daily life activities due to inability to sustain sleep quality and daytime wakefulness. Therefore, the importance of development and utilization of measures of sleep hygiene increases. The aim of the study was to assess psychometric properties of the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) in clinical and non-clinical Turkish samples. Data were collected from 106 patients with major depression consecutively admitted to the psychiatry clinic of YÃ¼zÃ¼ncÃ¼ YÄ±l University School of Medicine and 200 were volunteers recruited from community sample who were enrolled at the university. The SHI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were administered to the subjects. Factor structure of the SHI was evaluated with explanatory and multi-sample confirmatory factor analyses. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients of the SHI with the PSQI, ISI and ESS were computed. Item analyses, internal consistency coefficients and intra-class correlations between two repeated applications in both patient and healthy subjects were calculated. The SHI revealed a unidimensional factor structure. Significant strong partial associations of the SHI with depression, insomnia and poor sleep quality and a modest partial association with sleepiness were detected. Cronbach's alphas for the SHI in community sample and patients with major depression were 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. Additionally, we found acceptable three-week temporal reliability in terms of intra-correlation coefficients of r=0.62, p<0.01 for the community sample and of r=0.67, p<0.01 among patients with major depression. The SHI revealed adequate validity and reliability to be used by researchers in Turkish sample. Current results were discussed in light of previous findings and theoretical considerations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25708650/"}

Other nonpharmacologic treatments include exercise, mindfulness, and acupuncture. If these approaches are ineffective, pharmacologic agents may be considered. Medications such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are often prescribed for insomnia but should be avoided, if possible, due to short- and long-term risks associated with their use.

The influence of the menstrual cycle on physiological sleep in midlife women is unknown. The objective of the study was to assess the impact of menstrual cycle phase on the polysomnogram and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of sleep in midlife women, accounting for the presence of an insomnia disorder. This was a laboratory study of 20 women in the early menopausal transition (48.8 Â± 2.9 y), 11 with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, diagnosis of insomnia, studied on one night each in the follicular and luteal menstrual cycle phases. Polysomnographic and sleep EEG indices were measured. Both groups of women had more awakenings (P = .003) and arousals (P = .025) per hour of sleep and less percentage slow wave sleep (P = .024) when progesterone was raised (â¥3 ng/mL(-1)) during the luteal compared with the follicular phase. Both groups had greater spindle density (P = .007), longer spindles (P = .037), and increased 14-17 Hz EEG activity in the luteal phase (P < .05), although for the 15- to 16-Hz bin, this effect was significant only in women without insomnia (P < .001). Women with insomnia had a shorter sleep duration (P = .012), more wakefulness after sleep onset (P = .031), and a lower sleep efficiency (P = .034) than women without insomnia, regardless of menstrual cycle phase. Sleep is more disrupted in the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase in midlife women, whether or not they have an insomnia disorder.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep was analysed as a measure of cortical arousal. In addition, patients completed the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), which consists of two subscales, one for cognitive arousal (PSAS-CA) and one for self-reported somatic arousal (PSAS-SA). The relationship between the subscale scores and EEG spectral power was calculated by multi- and univariate analyses of variance. During NREM and REM sleep, patients with ID showed significantly increased spectral power in the EEG gamma band. In addition, patients with ID showed significantly increased scores on both subscales of the PSAS. The PSAS-CA score was significantly associated with increased NREM and REM gamma power, whereas PSAS-SA was associated with decreases in NREM and REM gamma power. Consistent with our hypothesis, patients with ID showed increased cortical and cognitive arousal. Moreover, there was an association between these two arousal domains, which may indicate that cortical arousal during the night is (at least in part) elicited by pre-sleep worry and rumination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36815625/"}

As for the time course of REM density, REM density during the first 3 h period of nocturnal sleep was significantly higher for MI than for NC subjects. Unlike NC subjects, REM density for MI subjects did not tend to rise progressively during nocturnal sleep. The MI subjects had objective evidence of disrupted sleep and the most striking characteristics of this dysfunction were observed in REM sleep variables. The sleep characteristics of MI subjects were found to differ in REM sleep variables from those of patients with major depression (except for REM density).

While the chi-square test and t-test were used for analyzing demographic data and continuous variables, respectively, mediation analysis was used to explore the mechanism of experiencing aggression on suicide risk. The respondents' sleep quality, nightmare distress, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and suicide risk were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Nightmare Distress Questionnaire-Chinese version (NDQ-CV), Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale (CADSS), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), and the suicide risk module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), respectively.

Furthermore, 26.9% of adolescents in school, and in particular, 31.8% in senior high school experienced insomnia symptoms. Adolescents who reported experiences of aggression had more severe insomnia symptoms, nightmare distress, fatigue, and a higher risk of suicide when compared with those who did not (all ps < 0.001). Insomnia symptoms, nightmare distress, and fatigue all mediated the relationship between aggression and suicide risk, and there was a chain of mediating effects between these factors [for total indirect effect Î² = 1.1512, 95% CI (0.9671 to 1.3426), direct effect Î² = 0.4934, 95% CI (0.1978 to 0.7891), and total effect Î² = 1.6446, 95% CI (1.3479 to 1.9414)].

Moreover, the ethical implications of emerging digital assessment tools must be addressed to ensure that technological innovation does not come at the cost of participant trust or autonomy. To move the field forward, future research should prioritise daytime functioning as a primary endpoint, adopt ethically grounded multimodal assessment strategies, and explore adaptive, symptom-specific treatment designs.

Specifically, it was found that insomniacs display increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective over-estimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole body metabolic rate, and increased multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) values. Normal sleepers given the nocturnal EEG parameters of insomniacs displayed decreased tension, decreased vigor, decreased body temperature, and decreased MSLT values. The spectrum of changes seen in the normal sleepers given an insomniac sleep pattern was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation and not consistent with symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of insomnia, including poor sleep, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8865501/"}

The '5 Principles' encourage people to Value, Prioritise, Personalise, Trust, and Protect their sleep. They are intended to educate about sleep health and to support evidence-based self-management of sleep, and not as an alternative to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is the guideline treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. However, they may bridge an important gap in self-care practices for many people.

An increased incident of cardiovascular events has been observed in patients with insomnia but the relationship between nighttime HR and insomnia remains unclear.

Nineteen sleep-onset insomniacs (SOI) and 14 good sleepers had their sleep analyzed. Linear regression and nonlinear Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) of the HR slope were performed in order to analyze HR dynamics during the sleep onset period. A significant depression in HR fluctuation was identified among the SOI group during the sleep onset period when linear regression and HHT analysis were applied. The magnitude of the HR reduction was associated with both polysomnography-defined and subjective SOL; moreover, we found that the linear regression and HHT slopes of the HR showed great sensitivity with respect to sleep quality. Our findings indicate that HR dynamics during the sleep onset period are sensitive to sleep initiation difficulty and respond to the SOL, which indicates that the presence of autonomic dysfunction would seem to affect the progress of falling asleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26616304/"}

As a result, after the dosage of zolpidem was gradually reduced, the deep sleep time of patients in the two groups was reduced in the first stage. However, with the prolongation of treatment time, the reduction trend of the two groups was gradually alleviated, but no great difference was found between groups (P>0.05). In the second stage of treatment, the deep sleep time of patients in the two groups gradually recovered and increased, and that in Tre group was greater than that in Ctrl group, and the upward trend was significant but differed slightly between groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the insomnia severity index (ISI) scores of the two groups gradually decreased, and that in Tre group was drastically inferior to those of Ctrl group on days 14 and 28 after treatment (both Ps<0.05).

Data are presented from 178 clinic attending insomniacs who completed the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS) and the Sleep Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ). Standard procedures for the psychometric evaluation of scales were adopted. The internal consistency of the DBAS (30 items) was reasonable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.72); however, a revised ten-item short form (DBAS-10) demonstrated a more robust principal component structure than the original scale (three relatively \"pure\" factors explained 55% of the variance). The derived subscales achieved satisfactory internal consistency, and the DBAS-10 demonstrated treatment-related measurement sensitivity. The DBAS-10, nevertheless, correlated highly (r = 0.826) with the DBAS. A four-factor solution for the SDQ is also presented (61% explained variance) with alpha = 0.67. Internal consistency of these subscales ranged from 0.59 to 0.82. The association between the SDQ and DBAS-10 was modest (r = 0.28), suggesting that the scales have some independence.

{"id": "3605382", "title": "Circadian pacemaker interferes with sleep onset at specific times each day: role in insomnia.", "text": "The human circadian pacemaker modulates our desire and ability to fall asleep at different times of day. To study this circadian component of sleep tendency, we have analyzed the sleep-wake patterns recorded from 15 free-running subjects in whom the sleep-wake cycle spontaneously desynchronized from the circadian rhythm of body temperature. The analysis indicates that the distribution of sleep onsets during free run is bimodal, with one peak at the temperature trough and, contrary to previous reports, a second peak 9-10 h later. Furthermore, there are two consistent zones in the circadian temperature cycle during which normal subjects rarely fall asleep. We hypothesize that this bimodal rhythm of sleep tendency, revealed under free-running conditions, maintains the same fixed phase relation to the circadian temperature cycle during 24-h entrainment. This would imply that normally entrained individuals should experience a peak of sleep tendency in the midafternoon and a zone of minimal sleep tendency approximately 1-3 h before habitual bedtime. Our temporal isolation data thereby account quantitatively for the timing of the afternoon siesta and suggest that malfunctions of the phasing of the circadian pacemaker may underlie the insomnia associated with sleep-scheduling disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3605382/"}
{"id": "9751153", "title": "Spectral characteristics of sleep EEG in chronic insomnia.", "text": "To determine whether the spectral characteristics of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of insomniacs differ from that of healthy subjects, we compared in each of the first four non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) episodes: (a) the time courses of absolute power, averaged over the subjects in each group, for the delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta frequency bands; (b) the relationship between these time courses; and (c) the overnight trend of integrated power in each frequency band. The results show that NREM power, for all frequencies below the beta range, has slower rise rates and reaches lower levels in the insomniac group, whereas beta power is significantly increased. In REM, insomniacs show lower levels in the delta and theta bands, whereas power in the faster frequency bands is significantly increased. Thus, the pathophysiology of insomnia is characterized not only by the generally acknowledged slow wave deficiency, but also by an excessive hyperarousal of the central nervous system throughout the night, affecting both REM and NREM sleep. This hyperarousal is interpreted in terms of the neuronal group theory of sleep which provides a possible explanation for the discrepancies observed between subjective impressions and objective measures of sleep. Also, it is suggested that the progressive hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical neurons as sleep deepens is slower in the patient population and that this may explain the observed slow wave deficiency. The homeostatic control of slow wave activity, on the other hand, would appear to be intact in the patient population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9751153/"}

{"id": "8929677", "title": "[Biological models of depression: effect of antidepressants on sleep].", "text": "The relationship between insomnia and depression cannot be summarized as a symptom/disease relationship. It is well admitted now that sleep deprivation has an antidepressant effect on depressed patients. The effect is immediate, global but transient : the relapse occurs after subsequent sleep, diurnal nap or recovery night. On an other hand, sleep architecture is impaired in depressed patients, some of these alterations, especially in REM sleep, might have been considered specific of depressive disease. Antidepressant drugs exert an effect on sleep architecture which is different. This effect varies over time and generally tend to correct sleep impairment. This has led some authors to propose the hypothesis that sleep himself might be involved in the causal process of depression. Three main hypotheses will be considered, excluding those involving circadian rhythm impairment, according to their strong and weak points. For G. Vogel, an excess of REM sleep is the causal process in depression. As a matter of fact, he did show that selective REM sleep deprivation exerts an antidepressant effect following the same temporal profile as antidepressant drugs. An other argument is that the shortening of REM latency and the increased amount of REM sleep in the first half of the night are evidences of the excess of REM sleep and at last, most antidepressant drugs are REM suppressors and may act through REM sleep suppression. The second hypothesis is the process S deficiency proposed by Alexander Borbely, according to his two process model of sleep homeostasis. The impairment of process S, which is reflected by slow wave activity, is responsible for depression. This explain disruptions and shortening of sleep in depressed patients, REM sleep abnormalities being only secondary to the slow wave sleep reduction. More recently, D. Beersma and R. van den Hoofdakker proposed that non REM sleep might be depressogenic after an experiment of selective REM sleep deprivation in normals which showed that non REM sleep deprivation was also largely reduced. REM suppression effects might therefore also be attributed to non REM suppression. All these hypothesis must explain the effect of antidepressant drugs on sleep. There is a large heterogeneity of effects on slow wave, non REM and even REM sleep, hardly compatible with a causal role of sleep, REM or non REM.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8929677/"}

The first-line recommended treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). CBTI is typically delivered in-person or online over one-to-four sessions (brief versions) or five-to-eight sessions (standard versions) by a licensed doctoral or masters-level clinician with extensive training in behavioral sleep medicine. Despite its effectiveness, CBTI has limited scalability. Three main factors inhibit access to and delivery of CBTI including restricted availability of clinical expertise; rigid, resource-intensive treatment formats; and limited capacities for just-in-time monitoring and treatment personalization. Digital technologies offer a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges by providing scalable, personalized, resource-sensitive, adaptive, and cost-effective approaches for evidence-based insomnia treatment. This is a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness randomized trial using a scalable evidence-based digital health software platform, NOCTEMâ¢'s Clinician-Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COASTâ¢). COAST includes a clinician portal and a patient app, and it utilizes algorithms that facilitate detection of sleep disordered patterns, support clinical decision-making, and personalize sleep interventions. The first aim is to compare three clinician- and system-centered implementation strategies on the reach, adoption, and sustainability of the COAST digital platform by offering (1) COAST only, (2) COAST plus external facilitation (EF: assistance and consultation to providers by NOCTEM's sleep experts), or (3) COAST plus EF and internal facilitation (EF/IF: assistance/consultation to providers by NOCTEM's sleep experts and local champions). The second aim is to quantify improvements in insomnia among patients who receive behavioral sleep care via the COAST platform. We hypothesize that reach, adoption, and sustainability and the magnitude of improvements in insomnia will be superior in the EF and EF/IF groups relative to the COAST-only group. Digital health technologies and machine learning-assisted clinical decision support tools have substantial potential for scaling access to insomnia treatment. This can augment the scalability and cost-effectiveness of CBTI without compromising patient outcomes. Engaging providers, stakeholders, patients, and decision-makers is key in identifying strategies to support the deployment of digital health technologies that can promote quality care and result in clinically meaningful sleep improvements, positive systemic change, and enhanced readiness and health among service members.

The proportion using sleep medications was reduced in the self-help book group, whereas it was increased in the sleep hygiene group. Compared to pre-treatment, the self-help book improved scores on the sleep (effect sizes 0.61-0.62) and depression (effect size 0.18) scales, whereas the sleep hygiene advice improved scores on some sleep scales (effect sizes 0.24-0.28), but worsened another (effect size -0.36). In addition, sleep hygiene advice increased the number of days per week where they took sleep medications (effect size -0.50). To conclude, in this randomized controlled trial, the self-help book improved sleep and reduced the proportion using sleep medications compared to sleep hygiene advice. The self-help book is an efficient low-threshold intervention, which is cheap and easily available for patients suffering from insomnia. Sleep hygiene advice also improved sleep at follow-up, but increased sleep medication use.

Data from 703 individuals with major depression recruited from the research database of the sleep laboratory of the Erasme Hospital were analysed. High blood pressure status was defined by the presence of one of the following: self-reports at interview of either a physician-diagnosis or taking antihypertensive medication; or an average systolic blood pressure â¥140Â mmHg or an average diastolic blood pressure â¥90Â mmHg during at least two medical examinations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the risk of high blood pressure associated with objective insomnia and self-reported insomnia complaints in major depression.

In major depression, severe objective insomnia and lower self-reported insomnia complaints are associated with higher risk of high blood pressure, which justifies a better management of objective insomnia and a better assessment of insomnia complaints in this particular subpopulation to avoid the negative consequences related to the co-occurrence of high blood pressure and major depression. <b>Abbreviations:</b> AHI, Apnea-Hypopnea Index; BDI, Beck Depression Inventory; BMI, Body Mass Index; DSM IV-TR, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition - Text Revision; ESS, Epworth Sleepiness scale; ISI, Insomnia Severity Index; HBP, High Blood Pressure; OSA, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome; REM, rapid eye movement sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30303409/"}

As a result, although CBTI is efficacious, its effectiveness is reduced by modest levels of adherence in typical clinical settings. This is problematic as adherence is essential to attain desired treatment outcomes. Sleep is often a dyadic process, with approximately 60% of Australian adults sharing a bed. Hence, the present study aims to determine whether incorporating bed partners into treatment for insomnia increases treatment adherence and completion. The impact of adherence on symptoms of insomnia will also be examined. This study is a mixed-effects randomised effectiveness trial of partner-assisted CBTI (PA-CBTI). It is an \"effectiveness\" (as opposed to \"efficacy\") trial, due to the focus on \"real world\" clinic-based clients and adherence/attrition as outcomes. Participants will include 120 clients with insomnia who are randomly assigned, in equal numbers, to PA-CBTI, traditional individual CBTI (i-CBTI), or partner-assisted sleep management therapy (PA-SMT; which serves as the control group). All interventions consist of seven weekly 1-h sessions. Treatment outcome is evaluated using clinician-rated treatment adherence, and diary-based adherence to stimulus control and sleep restriction. Clients and partners complete major assessments at pre- and post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcome variables include actigraphy, self-report measures related to sleep, comorbid psychopathology, and relationship functioning. This is the first randomised clinical trial to examine the impact of incorporating the bed partner in the treatment of insomnia. Results will provide new information about the role partners play in clients' insomnia presentation and treatment response, and better define the role of adherence in CBTI. This trial has the potential to optimise treatment outcomes for insomnia by improving adherence and reducing attrition. Results could have far-reaching impacts. Improvements in insomnia have been linked to improvements in mental and physical health and, given the high financial costs of insomnia, this study could have a positive economic impact.

This study summarizes all Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) that evaluated interventions to treat insomnia. Review of SRs, conducted in the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM), Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP). A sensitive search was carried out in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify Cochrane SRs that assessed the effects of any type of intervention for people with insomnia. The results, main characteristics of the SRs and the certainty of the evidence obtained from them were synthesized and discussed. Seven SRs were included. They addressed the benefits and harm of acupuncture (n = 1), behavioral interventions (n = 1), music (n = 1), pharmacotherapy (n = 2), phototherapy (n = 1) and physical exercise (n = 1). The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Acupuncture, music, physical exercise, paroxetine, doxepin, trimipramine and trazodone seem to present some benefit for patients with insomnia. However, the uncertainty around these results means that no robust and definitive recommendations for clinical practice can be made until the benefits and harms from each intervention for patients with insomnia have been confirmed through further studies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30892489/"}

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can successfully improve the sleep of patients with insomnia and MDE. Nonetheless, the factors influencing CBT-I's effects in MDE remain uncertain. This study aimed to identify predictors of insomnia improvement following CBT-I, as well as predictors of insomnia response, remission in patients with MDE and specific insomnia subtypes. Initially, we compared a 4-session weekly CBT-I treatment to baseline sleep education (SE) in a control group. This confirmed CBT-I's positive effects and the need to explore predictive factors. Notably, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) predicted reduced insomnia severity with CBT-I. Patients exhibiting seasonal fluctuations in depressive symptoms and sleep patterns throughout the year, or having daytime dysfunction, experienced enhanced CBT-I efficacy, especially for early awakenings insomnia. Conversely, shorter sleep duration predicted a less favorable response to CBT-I, less improvement in daytime dysfunction and sleep disturbance worries. Additionally, MDE with suicide attempts predicted a poorer improvement of daytime dysfunction. Further research is essential to comprehensively grasp the mechanisms behind CBT-I's heightened effectiveness in MDE patients with TRD and seasonal fluctuations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37839317/"}

However, sleep problems are usually not a direct target of interventions for depression. A range of non-pharmacological treatments can reduce sleep problems but it is unclear whether these interventions also reduce other depression symptoms. The aim of this review was to examine whether non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems are effective in reducing symptoms of depression. We carried out a systematic search for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological sleep interventions that measured depression symptoms as an outcome. Forty-nine trials (nÂ =Â 5908) were included in a random effects meta-analysis. The pooled standardised mean difference for depression symptoms after treatment for sleep problems wasÂ -0.45 (95% CI:Â -0.55,-0.36). The size of the effect on depression symptoms was moderated by the size of the effect on subjective sleep quality. In studies of participants with mental health problems, sleep interventions had a large effect on depression symptoms (dÂ =Â -0.81, 95% CI:Â -1.13,-0.49). The findings indicate that non-pharmacological sleep interventions are effective in reducing the severity of depression, particularly in clinical populations. This suggests that non-pharmacological sleep interventions could be offered as a treatment for depression, potentially improving access to treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30579141/"}

This systematic review examines the association between caffeine intake and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia. In January 2019 an extensive search was conducted in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Emcare, Cochrane, PsychInfo, Web of Science and gray literature. Studies were included when they: i) investigated patients diagnosed with dementia, ii) reported neuropsychiatric symptoms, iii) used caffeine or coffee consumption as an intervention, and iv) reported associations between caffeine or coffee consumption and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Studies were excluded when they also included participants without a diagnosis of dementia, or presented a review or expert opinion. Two reviewers independently rated the studies and reached consensus on the appraisal. Of the seven studies eligible for this review, four reported on sleeping difficulties and five on behavioral symptoms. There was no consistent effect of caffeine administration on neuropsychiatric symptoms: e.g., both high caffeine consumption and eliminating caffeine were associated with less apathy, the total Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Nursing Home) decreased after both coffee therapy and after eliminating caffeine, and both caffeine consumption and eliminating caffeine improved sleep. These findings suggest that caffeine can either induce or reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in individual patients with dementia. Therefore, in these patients, caffeine consumption requires a prudent individualized approach and further research on the effects of caffeine on individual neuropsychiatric symptoms is required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051199/"}

A test for unintentional sleep suggested that poor sleep function in insomniacs is related to deficient sleep-controlling mechanisms, rather than psychological trait and state factors. Only sleep onset difficulties were susceptible to situational factors. Daytime performance was not generally impaired in insomniacs, but they had greater difficulties in the morning. Subjective daytime sleepiness was significantly higher and might represent a particular psychological problem for active behavior.

Psychometric study of a patient-reported measure of sleep related beliefs based on existing clinical and research databases. A total of 283 individuals (60% women; mean age of 46.6 years old) with insomnia, including 124 clinical patients and 159 research participants. Participants completed the DBAS, Insomnia Severity Index, Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, daily sleep diaries for 2 weeks, and 3 nights of polysomnography (research sample only) as part of a baseline assessment. The DBAS-16 was found to be reliable, as evidenced by adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.77 for clinical and 0.79 for research samples) and temporal stability (r = 0.83). The factor structure was similar to the original 30-item version, with 4 factors emerging and reflecting: (a) perceived consequences of insomnia, (b) worry/helplessness about insomnia, (c) sleep expectations, and (d) medication. DBAS total scores were significantly correlated with other self-report measures of insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression, but not with specific sleep parameters. The psychometric qualities of this abbreviated DBAS-16 version seem adequate. This patient-reported measure should prove a useful instrument to evaluate the role of sleep related beliefs and attitudes in insomnia and to monitor change on this cognitive variable as a potential moderator of treatment outcome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18041487/"}

Data were collected from veteran drinkers recruited through targeted Facebook advertisements as part of a brief online alcohol intervention. Analyses demonstrated that veterans reported greater willingness to seek insomnia-focused treatment over PTSD- or depression-focused care. Notably, even when participants screened negative for insomnia, they preferred sleep-focused care to PTSD- or depression-focused care. Although one in five veterans with a positive screen would not consider care, veterans screening for both insomnia and PTSD who would consider care had a preference for in-person counseling, and those screening for both insomnia and depression had similar preferences for in-person and mobile app-based/computer self-help treatment. Marginal gender differences were found. Incorporating direct-to-consumer methods into research can help educate stakeholders about methods to expand EBPT access. Though traditional in-person counseling was often preferred, openness to app-based/computer interventions offers alternative methods to provide veterans with EBPTs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29524908/"}

Symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent in the elderly, whereas young people were more likely to report short sleep duration, subjective insufficient sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. A multiple logistic regression model revealed that excessive daytime sleepiness had significant associations with young people, short sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, subjective insufficient sleep and sleep enhancing medication use. Short sleep duration was the strongest predictor of excessive daytime sleepiness. The findings indicate that sleep loss and excessive daytime sleepiness in the Japanese adult population are common, and comparable to those reported in Western countries.

Healthy controls exhibited adaptive dissipation of emotional memory: memory declined over time, accompanied by reduced subjective feelings toward negative memories. In contrast, participants with insomnia exhibited impaired dissipation: they retained both the emotional content and affective tone of the memories, with diminished time-dependent declines in memory and affect. Beyond behavioral performance, only participants with insomnia maintained stable neural representations of emotion over time, a pattern absent in healthy controls. Additionally, during the post-encoding sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep durations predicted the adaptive dissipation of emotional memory over time, but only among healthy participants.

Results showed a significant improvement in sleep and a change (pÂ <Â .05) on a key measure of executive functioning sub task of inhibition (Condition 3 of D-KEF Color-Word Interference Test), a positive trend on the inhibition-switching task (pÂ <Â .10; Condition 4 of D-KEF Color-Word Interference Test), an no change in a measure of verbal memory (HVLT-R Delayed Recall) compared with the active control group. CBT-I is a nonpharmacological intervention that has the potential to cognitively benefit individuals with MCI suffering from comorbid insomnia. Results suggest that a non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep in older adults with MCI also improve cognitive functioning. Further exploration of the mechanisms underlying these improvements is warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29220627/"}

It can present with difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep. We retrospectively evaluated a group of 15 patients affected by major depressive disorder and complaining of insomnia, who started vortioxetine (VOR) treatment for their depressive symptoms. The following questionnaires were captured at baseline and follow-up: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total score significantly decreased between follow-up and baseline (P <Â 0.01), and in several subitems related to sleep quality and continuity. Moreover, Epworth Sleepiness Scale decreased between follow-up and baseline (P <Â 0.01). Finally, Beck Depression Inventory reduction was also evident between follow-up and baseline (P <Â 0.01). This retrospective analysis showing the significant effect of VOR on both depressive symptoms and insomnia in patients showing comorbid major depressive disorder and insomnia invites further research in order to confirm this preliminary evidence.

This study sought to examine the relationships between military-related factors and the new onset and reoccurrence of short sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Millennium Cohort Study data were used to track U.S. military service members over time to examine longitudinal changes in sleep. Outcomes were self-reported average sleep duration (categorized as â¤5 h, 6 h, or 7-9 h [recommended]) and/or insomnia symptoms (having trouble falling or staying asleep). Associations between military-related factors and the new onset and reoccurrence of these sleep characteristics were determined, after controlling for multiple health and behavioral factors. Military-related factors consistently associated with an increased risk for new onset and/or reoccurrence of short sleep duration and insomnia symptoms included active duty component, Army or Marine Corps service, combat deployment, and longer than average deployment lengths. Military officers and noncombat deployers had decreased risk for either sleep characteristic. Time-in-service and separation from the military were complex factors; they lowered risk for â¤5 h sleep but increased risk for insomnia symptoms. Various military-related factors contribute to risk of short sleep duration and/or insomnia symptoms over time, although some factors affect these sleep characteristics differently. Also, even when these sleep characteristics remit, some military personnel have an increased risk of reoccurrence. Efforts to improve sleep prioritization and implement interventions targeting at-risk military populations, behaviors, and other significant factors are warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34216467/"}

Data was obtained from 680 older adults (agedÂ â¥Â 60) with major depression who participated in one of two protocolized open-label antidepressant treatment clinical trials (Maintenance Therapies in Late Life Depression [MTLD-3]; Incomplete Response in Late Life Depression: Getting to Remission [IRL-GRey]). Depression (total score minus sleep items) and sleep (sum of sleep items) outcomes were derived from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in the MLTD-3 and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale in the IRL-GRey. Both datasets identified 5 possible trajectories of insomnia symptoms with about half of the older adults having clinically significant baseline sleep disturbances and minimal improvement following a course of antidepressant treatment (i.e., sub-optimal sleep trajectory). Furthermore, across both datasets, worse baseline depression severity was associated with sub-optimal sleep trajectories. In older adults receiving antidepressant treatment, those with clinically significant baseline sleep disturbances and greater depression severity may require adjunctive sleep-focused treatment to ameliorate sleep symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29069615/"}

The aim of this study was to explore the frequency of NSSI among different longitudinal trajectories of insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration to identify at-risk adolescents. We used questionnaire data collected annually (3 time points over 2Â years) from a sample of Swedish adolescents (Nâ=â1,294; M<sub>age</sub>â=â13.2 [range: 12-15Â years], SDâ=â0.4; 46.8% girls).

Adolescents who reported persistent or increasing sleep problems over time also reported more NSSI. A notable pattern was that adolescents whose insomnia symptoms were high and increasing reported the highest frequency of NSSI, also compared to adolescents who started at the same high level of insomnia symptoms but improved over time. Therefore, measuring NSSI may help identify a risk-group for persistent sleep problems and self-injury.

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co-morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate- to high-quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep-related breathing disorders), in treatment-resistant insomnia, for professional at-risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available.

Two additional groupings were added based on profiles that were unanticipated: subjects that exhibited persistent poor sleep following AI (AI-PPS [those that neither recovered or developed chronic insomnia]) and subjects that recovered from chronic insomnia (CI-REC). All the groups (GS, AI-REC, AI-CI, AI-PPS and CI-REC) were evaluated for TIB differences with longitudinal mixed effects models.

Systematic search was conducted using Prisma guidelines for the screening and ROB-1 for bias analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT). Out of 4995 studies screened, none assess as main purpose the impact of PA on sleep in alcohol users. Still, 81.8% of the selected studies, in their secondary outcomes, highlight PA's positive association with sleep in alcohol users with or without dependence. Main positive sleep outcomes were insomnia and sleep fragmentation reduction as well as sleep quality and duration improvement. There is a lack of publication regarding the impact of PA on sleep in nonclinical alcohol users and AUD patients. Still, PA appears to enhance sleep in both populations. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to produce robust data. In the first instance, feasibility study should be performed as adhesion can be an issue in the population. Finally, different PA programs (frequency, intensity, time, type and duration) should be compared to determine the optimal dose in different AUD status (intoxication, withdrawal and abstinence).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40622082/"}

We found that only PPI exhibited greater inhibition of the corrugator activity in response to sleep-related positive stimuli compared to the other blocks of stimuli. Furthermore, PPI rated the sleep-related negative stimuli as more unpleasant and arousing and showed higher CVT in response to all stimuli as compared to GS. Results were interpreted as indicating that PPI exhibit craving for sleep-related positive stimuli, and also hyper-arousability in response to sleep-related negative stimuli, as compared to GS.

Here we aimed at investigating self-reported racing thoughts in insomnia disorder, and their specific contribution to insomnia severity, as compared to worry and rumination. 72 adults with insomnia disorder, 49 patients with BD in a hypomanic episode and 99 healthy individuals completed the Racing and Crowded Thoughts Questionnaire (RCTQ). Mood symptoms were assessed in patients with insomnia disorder. RCTQ scores were overall higher in insomnia disorder, especially in sleep-onset insomnia, compared to the hypomanic and healthy groups. Moreover, racing thoughts showed an increase in the evening and at bedtime in sleep-onset insomnia. Importantly, racing thoughts at bedtime, but not rumination and worry, were associated with insomnia severity. Our results are the first to show that racing thoughts is a transdiagnostic symptom in mood and sleep disorders.

The Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS) was assessed at baseline to measure PI. As outcome, we considered an infection diary score summing up prospectively reported RTIs. The RIS score correlated significantly with the infection diary score summarizing reported RTIs (correlation coefficient = 0.265, p < 0.001). Adjustments by putative confounders did only marginally affect this relationship. No significant differences in the relationship between RIS score and diary score were found for subgroups including those by gender, body mass index, perceived stress, and comorbidity. People affected by a combination of high PI and obesity were eight times more likely to belong to the group reporting the highest 10% of RTIs compared to the nonobese group with low RIS score (p < 0.001).

Two transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation trials found no superiority of active stimulation for most outcome measures.

Diagnosis of insomnia is challenging because there can be many different causes and the clinical picture can be blurred by the presence of other psychiatric illnesses. Pharmacotherapy provides reliable and rapid relief from insomnia, whereas behavioral therapies help produce long-term improvement. For many years, benzodiazepines have been the mainstay of drug treatment for insomnia. However, these drugs have significant side effects, and tolerance and dependence have discouraged use. Many doctors use sedating antidepressants in low doses to treat chronic insomnia. However, there is little evidence supporting the efficacy of these agents, and many have adverse side effects, including impairment of sleep.

Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self-report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive-behavioural models to (epi-) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep-wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive-behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first-line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive-behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non-response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation.

Mean baseline scores on the SIS ranged from 22.85 (+/-13.41) on Satisfaction with Sleep to 43.49 (+/-21.12) on Mental Fatigue, reflecting impairments due to sleep problems. The SIS was found to be internally consistent (alpha > or = 0.70 for all domains) and have good construct validity. The item-domain correlations were > or = 0.52 with no instance of an item correlating more highly with a domain other than its own. There were some floor and no ceiling effects. The test-retest reliability of the SIS domains ranged between 0.68 and 0.83. Clinical validity assessed through known groups methods was supported. The SIS was responsive to changes on all domains. Preliminary estimates of minimum important difference (MID) were obtained to interpret changes in SIS domains. Limitations include the need for further qualitative research on content validity and the lack of a patient global assessment of change. This study yielded adequate evidence of the validity of the SIS for use in clinical trials and research on MDD patients with comorbid insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19505198/"}

Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (\"rapid eye movement sleep instability\"), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious-like wake experience, reflecting pre-sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38811745/"}

Standard polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) were recorded and used to obtain relative EEG spectral power in each sleep stage during PSG and each session during MSLTs. A series of subjective and objective neurocognitive tests were conducted to evaluate executive function, attention, retrospective and prospective memory and meta-cognition. In PSG and MSLTs, COMISA patients showed combined EEG power characteristics of both CIs and OSA. Specifically, COMISA patients exhibited similar EEG spectral characteristics to CIs, with decreased delta and increased alpha and beta power in NREM sleep stages, and increased beta power in REM and MSLTs. Similar to the EEG spectral power profile of OSA, COMISA patients showed increased delta power in REM and MSLTs. Compared to OSA patients, COMISA patients exhibited worse subjectively measured attention and meta-cognition related to negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry (NEG), which were positively associated with ISI scores. The EEG spectral power characteristics of COMISA patients in overnight PSG and daytime MSLT appear to be the manifestation of elements of both CIs and OSA.

The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hang-over). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6132933/"}

Patients with insomnia tend to have an altered quality of life, impaired daytime functioning and an increased risk of work accidents and motor vehicle crashes. Insomnia is commonly associated with chronic medical conditions, metabolic illnesses and mental disorders (such as depression and anxiety), with which there is a dual, reciprocal relationship. This paper focuses on current pharmacotherapy options for the treatment of insomnia, particularly benzodiazepine receptor agonists, which nowadays represent the mainstay of hypnotic therapy. The melatonin receptor antagonist, ramelteon, is reviewed (an alternative for some patients with only sleep-onset difficulty), as are sedating antidepressants, which are commonly used 'off-label' to treat insomnia, despite limited efficacy data and potential significant safety concerns. Orexin (OX) antagonists are also discussed, especially those that block OX2 or both OX1 and OX2 receptors, as these are the most promising new agents for the treatment of insomnia, with encouraging results in preliminary clinical trials. Research to evaluate and formulate treatments for insomnia is often complicated by the fact that insomnia is usually of multifactorial etiology.

Insomnia was the focus of analysis using chi2 statistics and, additionally, logistic regression to explore the predictors of insomnia. Bedtime was 23:30 and wake-up time was 6:35 on average, with a mean sleep time of 6.77 h on weekdays. The number of subjects with current sleep complaints was 1276, of which 735 (11.7% of the total sample) had insomnia lasting for 1 month or more. Only 37.6% of those were taking hypnotics and/or anxiolytics.

Prospective studies traversing the pandemic's onset can elucidate how pre-existing disease vulnerabilities augured risk for later stress-related morbidity. We examined how pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted maladaptive stress reactions and depressive symptoms in response to, and during, the pandemic. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial from 2016 to 2017 comparing digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) against sleep education (NÂ =Â 208). Thus, we also assessed whether dCBT-I moderated the association between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and pandemic-related distress. Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity was measured at baseline using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test. In April 2020, participants were recontacted to report pandemic-related distress (stress reactions and depression). Controlling for the treatment condition and the degree of COVID-19 impact, higher pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted more stress reactions (Î²Â =Â 0.13, Â±â0.07 SE, pÂ =Â 0.045) and depression (Î²Â =Â 0.22, Â±â0.07 SE, pÂ =Â 0.001) during the pandemic. Further, the odds of reporting clinically significant stress reactions and depression during the pandemic were over twice as high in those with high pre-pandemic sleep reactivity. Notably, receiving dCBT-I in 2016-2017 mitigated the relationship between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and later stress reactions (but not depression). Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted psychological distress 3-4âyears later during the COVID-19 pandemic, and dCBT-I attenuated its association with stress reactions, specifically. Sleep reactivity may inform prevention and treatment efforts by identifying individuals at risk of impairment following stressful events.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36053867/"}

To date, few risk factors for post-COVID-19 conditions have been determined. This study evaluated the role of pre-infection sleep quality/duration and insomnia severity in the incidence of long-term symptoms after COVID-19. This prospective study involved two assessments (April 2020 and 2022). At the baseline (April 2020), sleep quality/duration and insomnia symptoms in participants without current/prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). At the follow-up (April 2022), we asked a group of COVID-19 survivors to retrospectively evaluate the presence of twenty-one symptoms (psychiatric, neurological, cognitive, bodily, and respiratory) that have been experienced one month (nÂ =Â 713, infection in April 2020-February 2022) and three months after COVID-19 (nÂ =Â 333, infection in April 2020-December 2021). In April 2022, participants also reported how many weeks passed to fully recover from COVID-19. Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to estimate the effect of previous sleep on the number of long-term symptoms. Binomial logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the association between sleep variables, the incidence of each post-COVID-19 symptom, and the odds of recovery four/twelve weeks after infection. Analyses highlighted a significant effect of pre-infection sleep on the number of symptoms one/three months after COVID-19. Previous higher PSQI and ISI scores, and shorter sleep duration significantly increased the risk of almost every long-term symptom at one/three months from COVID-19. Baseline sleep problems were also associated with longer recovery times to return to the pre-infection daily functioning level after COVID-19. This study suggested a prospective dose-dependent association of pre-infection sleep quality/quantity and insomnia severity with the manifestation of post-COVID-19 symptoms.

The reasons may be biological mainly the sleep phase delay or psychosocial and environmental. These include academic demands, social activities, sports, internet, television viewing, part-time employment, and use of mobile phone at night, peer and parental influence and socioeconomic status. These changing patterns of sleep in adolescents lead to many behavioral sleep problems like Delayed Sleep-phase Syndrome; Difficulties in falling asleep (insomnia); excessive daytime sleepiness, poor academic performance.

Several sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and insomnia, are thought to contribute to the development of hypertension, although less attention is paid to the relationship between sleep duration and blood pressure independent of sleep disorders per se. Accordingly, this review focuses principally on the physiology of sleep and the consequences of abnormal sleep duration both experimentally and at the population level. Clinical implications for patients with insomnia who may or may not have abbreviated sleep duration are explored. As a corollary, we further review studies of the effects of sleep extension on blood pressure regulation. We also discuss epidemiological evidence suggesting that long sleep may also be associated with hypertension and describe the parabolic relationship between total sleep time and blood pressure. We conclude by highlighting gaps in the literature regarding the potential role of gut microbial health in the cross-communication of lifestyle patterns (exercise, diet, and sleep) with blood pressure regulation. Additionally, we discuss populations at increased risk of short sleep, and specifically the need to understand mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities in women, pregnancy, the elderly, and in African Americans.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536276/"}

Sleep regulation is a multifactorial process. In this chapter, we focus on those phenotypes inherent to sleep that are highly prevalent in the population, and that can be modulated by lifestyle, such as sleep quality and duration, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and daytime sleepiness. We, therefore, leave in the background those phenotypes that constitute infrequent pathologies or for which the current level of scientific evidence does not favour the implementation of practical approaches of this type. Similarly, the regulation of sleep quality is intimately linked to the regulation of the circadian rhythm.

A pilot study.", "text": "Research into the cause of chronic insomnia has identified hyperarousal as a key factor, which is likely to have both trait and state components. Sleep-related cognition, metacognition, and sleep reactivity also play an important role in insomnia. Our aim was to investigate how these insomnia-related constructs are associated with trait predisposition and pre-sleep arousal in subjects with an insomnia disorder. Fifty-three individuals with insomnia disorder (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (Fâ=â33; 52â+â10)) and 30 healthy controls (Fâ=â18; 51.8â+â12 years) were evaluated with a set of questionnaires, including the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Metacognition Questionnaire - Insomnia (MCQI), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), and Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS). Statistical analyses included multiple regression to elucidate the independent determinants of APS and PSAS. Participants with insomnia presented higher FIRST, MCQI, APS, PSAS scores (p-values <0.001) than healthy controls. In insomnia, APS and cognitive PSAS were best determined by MCQI (respectively, Bâ=â0.09, pâ=â0.001, Bâ=â0.08, pâ=â0.02), somatic PSAS by cognitive arousal (PSAS Bâ=â0.35, pâ=â0.004) CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in insomnia disorders, trait predisposition toward hyperarousal and pre-sleep-cognitive-state-dependent arousal may be closely related to sleep-related metacognitive processes. Sleep-related metacognitive processes may be associated with trait hyperarousal within the framework of a mutual relationship, and could, in turn, modulate cognitive pre-sleep-state arousal. A broad range of cognitive and metacognitive processes should be considered when dealing with subjects with insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27823715/"}

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching for eligible articles or dissertations in six online bibliographic databases. Randomised controlled trials and experimental studies comparing PI for insomnia to active and passive comparators and assessing insomnia symptoms as outcomes were included. A random effects model was estimated to determine the standardised mean difference Hedge's g at post-treatment.

The study was pre-registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019137357). A total of 10 trials were identified. Compared to passive comparators, PI led to large improvements in key insomnia symptoms. Relative to active comparators, the improvements were smaller, but still moderate for several central outcomes. Compared to passive comparators, PI resulted in great reductions in sleep-related performance anxiety, one of several proposed mechanisms of change for PI.

Longitudinal. Community-based. 2,316 adults from the Evolution of Pathways to Insomnia Cohort (EPIC) with no history of insomnia or depression (46.8 Â± 13.2 y; 60% female). None. Participants reported the number of stressful events they encountered at baseline (Time 1), as well as the level of cognitive intrusion they experienced in response to each stressor. Stressful events (OR = 1.13; P < 0.01) and stress-induced cognitive intrusion (OR = 1.61; P < 0.01) were significant predictors of risk for insomnia one year hence (Time 2). Intrusion mediated the effects of stressful events on risk for insomnia (P < 0.05). Trait sleep reactivity significantly increased risk for insomnia (OR = 1.78; P < 0.01). Further, sleep reactivity moderated the effects of stress-induced intrusion (P < 0.05), such that the risk for insomnia as a function of intrusion was significantly higher in individuals with high sleep reactivity. Trait sleep reactivity also constituted a significant risk for depression (OR = 1.67; P < 0.01) two years later (Time 3). Insomnia at Time 2 significantly mediated this effect (P < 0.05). This study suggests that premorbid sleep reactivity is a significant risk factor for incident insomnia, and that it triggers insomnia by exacerbating the effects of stress-induced intrusion. Sleep reactivity is also a precipitant of depression, as mediated by insomnia.

We did a phase II study to establish efficacy and physiological mechanism, and a phase III study to confirm efficacy of the melatonin agonist tasimelteon (VEC-162) for treatment of transient insomnia associated with shifted sleep and wake time. We undertook phase II and phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. In a phase II study, 39 healthy individuals from two US sites were randomly assigned to tasimelteon (10 [n=9], 20 [n=8], 50 [n=7], or 100 mg [n=7]) or placebo (n=8). We monitored individuals for 7 nights: 3 at baseline, 3 after a 5-h advance of sleep-wake schedule with treatment before sleep, and 1 after treatment; we measured plasma melatonin concentration for circadian phase assessment. In a phase III study, 411 healthy individuals from 19 US sites, who had transient insomnia induced in a sleep clinic by a 5-h advance of the sleep-wake schedule and a first-night effect in a sleep clinic, were given tasimelteon (20 [n=100], 50 [n=102], or 100 mg [n=106]) or placebo (n=103) 30 min before bedtime. Prespecified primary efficacy outcomes were polysomnographic sleep efficiency (phase II study), latency to persistent sleep (phase III study), and circadian phase shifting (phase II study). Analysis was by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in both studies. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00490945 and NCT00291187. In the phase II study, tasimelteon reduced sleep latency and increased sleep efficiency compared with placebo. The shift in plasma melatonin rhythm to an earlier hour was dose dependent. In the phase III study, tasimelteon improved sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset (ie, sleep maintenance). The frequency of adverse events was similar between tasimelteon and placebo.

Measures included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), and wrist actigraphy-derived sleep parameters. Discrepancy scores were calculated by subtracting actigraphy-derived values from PSQI-derived values for sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE). Correlations between PSQI and actigraphy-derived values were weak. Significant discrepancies, with moderate-to-large effect sizes, were observed between PSQI and actigraphy for SL, TST, and SE, whereby the PSQI yielded longer SL, shorter TST, and less SE than actigraphy. MSNQ elevations correlated with greater PSQI-actigraphy discrepancies in SL and TST. MFIS elevations correlated with greater discrepancies in TST.

Children completed the Sleep Self-Report (SSR) and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) questionnaire (which was adapted for use with children). Parents completed the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ).

Some dysfunctional beliefs about sleep predicted sleep disturbance to a greater extent than others. For example, when controlling for the other DBAS subscales, the 'control and predictability of sleep' subscale, but not the 'sleep requirements expectations' subscale, predicted total SSR score and SSR insomnia items.

Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to impaired attention and productivity, weakened immunity, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and mental health disorders. Insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, hormonal changes, nocturia, neurological disorders, and life events interfere with sleep patterns and some are linked to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This NOPIA symposium on Lifelong LUTS aimed to analyze the literature on associations between sleep and LUTS, generate ideas for future research, and explore whether there is support for the concept of lifelong LUTS in relation to changes in sleep throughout the lifespan. An international panel of experts took part in an online meeting addressing the role of lifelong LUTS in relationship to sleep and the brain organized by the NOPIA research group. The manuscript summarizes existing literature, hypotheses, future research ideas, and clinical recommendations. Insomnia, sleep fragmentation, hyperarousal, and sensory processing disorders emerged as potential factors in the relationship between sleep and LUTS. Insomnia is often a persistent factor and may have been the initial symptom; however, it is often unrecognized and/or unaddressed in healthcare settings. By recognizing insomnia as a primary driver of various health issues, including nocturia, transitional care aims to address root causes and underlying problems earlier to initiate appropriate treatment. A multidisciplinary approach with collaboration between healthcare professionals from various disciplines, such as urology, sleep medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, and geriatrics, is needed and should include validated measurements such as the insomnia severity index and sleep and voiding diaries.

One week after the surgery, cats were treated with two intraperitoneal injections of parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, to induce insomnia. Twenty-four hours after the second injection of PCPA, cats were at the peak of insomnia (strong reduction of both slow wave sleep 2 and rapid-eye movement [REM] sleep). During this period cats were divided into four groups (n = 6) and were injected with either atropine (0.5 mg/kg, IM [3.5 mmol/kg]), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (200 ng, ICV [60 pmol]) or atropine plus VIP (same doses and routes of administration). The control group received saline intramuscularly (IM) intracerebroventricularly and (ICV). Results showed that VIP and atropine injected alone and in combination increased mean total time of REM sleep in PCPA-treated animals.

But do polysomnographic data provide adequate evidence to segregate the three disorders, or might they display fundamentally the same sleep disturbance, differing only in degree? To test the viability of these two alternate hypotheses, the authors performed a meta-analysis of controlled polysomnographic studies of these disorders. A summary measure of degree of sleep disturbance was constructed from five variables: wakefulness after sleep onset, percentage of stage 1 sleep, percentage of stage 3 + 4 sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) latency, and REM density. The results of available studies for each variable were combined using a weighted average of effect sizes. An overall \"sleep disturbance index\" was then calculated by combining the estimates for the five above listed variables. On both the individual measures and especially on the summary index, insomnia, depression, and narcolepsy were arrayed on a simple continuum of progressively more severe sleep disturbance--congruent with the clinical observation that these disorders display progressively more disturbed sleep. These findings suggest that sleep can be disturbed in only a limited number of ways: in evaluating sleep architecture, it may not be possible to elaborate much beyond a single axis of good-to-bad sleep. Thus, polysomnographic measures may not provide adequate evidence to classify insomnia, depression, and narcolepsy as separate entities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1467388/"}

They appear during sleep stage 2 but also in stages 3, 4 and REM (Rapid Eye Movements). Patients with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complain of insomnia, although objective studies have revealed that their sleep is deeper and their awakening threshold is higher. The relationships between PTSD or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) to SS density are not described in the literature. This study aimed to examine the hypothesis that the higher awakening threshold reflects an active defense process which would be manifested in increased sleep spindles in patients with PTSD. A total of 15 PTSD patients (36.3 +/- 11.4 years) comprised the research group and 15 healthy students (27.3 +/- 2.18 years) comprised the control group. Participants underwent a polysomnography study in the sleep laboratory at 'Rambam' Hospital, Haifa, Israel. There was no difference in the sleep spindles density per minute during stage 2 between the research group (2.54 +/- 1.14) and the control group (2.86 +/- 1.3). However, sleep spindles density was highly affected by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such that PTSD patients treated with SSRI's had significantly higher spindles density than the remaining PTSD patients (3.25 +/- 1.1 vs 1.72 +/- 0.46, p=0.0044). Stage 2 was shorter in the research group (47% +/- 8.75%) compared to the control group (58% +/- 8.5%, p=0.0014), while stages 3, 4 were longer (32% +/- 8% vs 18% +/- 6.26%, p<0.001). Sleep spindle density was generally not increased in patients with PTSD, thus other mechanisms are probably responsible for their stabilization of sleep. SSRI's were found to have an important role in spindles density, which supports a serotonergic mechanism in the stabilization of sleep, although it requires further research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19039901/"}

We found substantial variability between participants in the strength of prospective associations between insomnia and mood, which depended on age, gender, bipolar subtype, and a history of rapid cycling. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring sleep in people with BD.

A between-group analysis of variance was performed for each variable, while correlation analysis was performed in UVH patients between otoneurological, SRM/PM, and actigraphy measure scores. When compared with CG subjects, UVH patients were found to be spending less time sleeping and taking more time to go from being fully awake to asleep, based on actigraphy-based sleep analysis. Also, SRM/PM depicted UVH patients to have poor sleep quality and to be more prone to an evening-type behavior. Correlations were found between vestibular-related functionality indexes and subjective sleep quality, as well as between longer disease duration and reduced sleep time. For the first time, a multiparametric sleep analysis was performed on a large population-based sample of chronic UVH patients.

Clustering analysis of D 2 data of various cerebral regions displayed a relatively concentrated tendency, particularly in the Fp 2, the right forehead (F 4) and F 8 regions. Factor analysis of ApEn data showed a significant change in Fp 2, F 8, O 1 and right occipital (O 2) regions.

It comprises three domains: Alert/Cognition, Mood, and Sleepiness. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the minimum within-patient change for IDSIQ scores that an adult patient with insomnia would consider meaningful. Data were from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial of daridorexant in adults with insomnia. Subjects completed the IDSIQ daily in the evening, with a recall period of 'today', throughout the 3-month double-blind treatment period. Scores were calculated as a weekly average. Each IDSIQ item was scored on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (not at all/none at all) to 10 (very/a lot), with a higher score indicating a greater severity or impact. PRO measures with correlation coefficients â¥0.30 were included in a subsequent anchor-based analysis. For the IDSIQ total score and each IDSIQ domain, meaningful within-patient change was estimated as the minimum score change patients would consider meaningful in an anchor-based analysis using data from PRO instruments capturing daytime and night-time insomnia symptoms (the Insomnia Severity Index [four items, each scored 0-4, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity; assessed at screening, baseline, month 1 and month 3], Patient Global Assessment of Disease Severity [6-point scale from 'none' to 'very severe'; assessed weekly], Patient Global Impression of Severity [4-point scale from 'none' to 'severe'; assessed weekly], and Patient Global Impression of Change [7-point scale from 'very much better' to 'very much worse'; assessed weekly for night-time and daytime symptoms separately]). A supplemental distribution-based analysis was also conducted to support the anchor-based analysis. The analysis included 930 subjects aged 18-88 years. Spearman correlation coefficients for the relationships between score changes/ratings for anchors and the IDSIQ (0.36-0.44 at month 1, 0.45-0.57 at month 3) were all above the prespecified threshold of 0.30. Mean IDSIQ score changes at months 1 and 3 based on the different anchors supported meaningful within-patient change estimates starting at 17 points for the IDSIQ total score, 9 points for the Alert/Cognition domain, and 4 points for the Mood and Sleepiness domains. This analysis demonstrates the meaningful within-patient change for the IDSIQ total score and domain scores, that the instrument is sensitive to changes in the patient experience of insomnia, and that it can be used in clinical trials to evaluate changes in daytime functioning.

Epidemiologic data show that the co-occurrence of the two disorders is quite frequent. Thus an approach regarding them as a unit promotes biological psychiatric research by revealing new pathophysiological and therapeutic conclusions. Chronobiological results related to mood disorders have recently been described in excellent reviews including Hungarian ones. In the present review, the necessity of treatment of sleep disorders is evaluated in the context of relapse/remission/recurrence. Scientific data suggest that patients with insomnia have a ten-fold risk of developing depression, and insomnia plays an important role in depression relapses, recurrence of depressive episodes and becoming depression chronic. From neurobiological point of view, mood and sleep disorders have many features in common. Research has revealed decreased levels of melatonin and advanced sleep phases (shifted earlier) in depression, and altered and imbalanced monoaminergic pathways, and REM abnormalities in sleep disorders. Some authors suggest that REM abnormalities disappear along with the mood improvement, and the sleep structure can completely restore after remission. However, persistent abnormalities of REM sleep and slow wave sleep have also been found in remission, which increased the risk of the relapse and recurrence. Recently, there is an agreement as to the early treatment of insomnia can prevent the development of mood abnormalities. Alterations of cascades related to neural plasticity can also be a link between sleep and mood disorders. Neural plasticity is closely related to learning, sleeping, and cortisol regulation (coping with stress), and this draws the attention to comorbidity with further disorders (anxiety, dementia).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347243/"}

Compared with the 'non-insomnia' cohort, the 'untreated insomnia' cohort was more likely to experience daytime impairments, with mean differences in occurrences per 100 patient-years for: (a) fatigue, at 27.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 26.81, 27.77, pâ<â0.01); (b) dizziness, at 4.66 (95% CI 4.40, 4.90, pâ<â0.01); (c) somnolence, at 4.18 (95% CI 3.94, 4.43, pâ<â0.01); and (d) disorientation, at 0.92 (95% CI 0.77, 1.06, pâ<â0.01). During the 1-year look-back period, patients in the 'untreated insomnia' cohort were also more likely to have been diagnosed with arterial hypertension (40.9% vs. 26.3%), psychiatric comorbidities (40.1% vs. 13.2%), anxiety (29.2% vs. 8.5%), depression (26.1% vs. 8.1%) or obesity (21.3% vs. 11.1%) compared with those in the 'non-insomnia' cohort. This large-scale study confirms the substantial burden of insomnia disorder on patients in a real-world setting, with significant daytime impairment and numerous comorbidities. This reinforces the need for timely insomnia disorder diagnosis and treatments that improve both sleep, as well as daytime functioning.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37537544/"}

Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) is the standard of care for the treatment of insomnia recommended by the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the American College of Physicians. CBTI is highly effective but has limited scalability. It is often unavailable in clinical settings where service members receive sleep care. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to scale and broaden the geographic reach of CBTI services and support increased patient access and engagement in behavioral sleep care. This study aims to evaluate the impact and acceptability of digital CBTI hubs to augment military treatment facilities' capabilities in behavioral sleep medicine. This is a multi-site, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of in-person (face-to-face or virtual) insomnia care as usual at three military sleep clinics versus CBTI delivered remotely and asynchronously through digital CBTI hubs. Digital CBTI hubs are led by licensed, certified clinicians who use NOCTEM'sÂ® evidence-based clinical decision support platform COASTâ¢ (Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology). Changes in insomnia severity and daytime symptoms of depression and anxiety will be compared at baseline, at 6-8Â weeks, and at 3-month follow-up. Patient satisfaction with insomnia care as usual versus digital CBTI hubs will also be examined. We hypothesize that digital CBTI hubs will be non-inferior to insomnia care as usual for improvements in insomnia and daytime symptoms as well as patient satisfaction with insomnia care. Digital technology has a high potential to scale CBTI accessibility and delivery options required to meet the insomnia care needs of military service members. Digital CBTI hubs using COAST offer a novel approach to broaden service members' access to CBTI and to serve as an augmentation strategy for existing sleep services at military treatment facilities. The pragmatic approach leveraging technology in this trial has the potential to rapidly inform clinical practice within the Defense Health Agency as well as other healthcare systems.

Participants filled out a paper-pencil questionnaire composed of 157 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, sleeping habits and environment, sleep quality and sleep symptoms, and health status. We found 32.1% (95% confidence interval: 29.5-34.8%) of the sample reported having difficulty initiating (DIS) or maintaining sleep (DMS) or non-restorative sleep accompanied with sufficient sleep (NRS) at least 4 nights per week: 6.3% of the sample had DIS, 14.5% had DMS and 18.0% had NRS. Results from logistic regressions showed that restless legs symptoms, breathing pauses during sleep and depressive or anxious mood were associated with DIS and DMS but not NRS. Living in an urban area (OR:2.0) and drinking alcohol daily (OR:4.6) were associated only with NRS. Daytime symptoms were reported by over 75% of subjects with insomnia symptoms. DIS, DMS and NRS were associated with daytime fatigue but not excessive sleepiness as measured by the Epworth scale. DIS was associated with the use of sleeping pills or natural sleeping aid compounds in multivariate models. Insomnia symptoms occurring at least 4 nights per week are frequent in Sweden, affecting about a third of the population. Subjects with NRS have a distinctly different profile than those with DIS or DMS, which suggests different etiological causes for this symptom.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21087896/"}

Insomnia is also a common comorbidity across psychiatric disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia; a key component of this intervention is restriction of sleep opportunity, which optimizes matching of sleep ability and opportunity, leading to enhanced sleep drive. Despite the well-documented efficacy of CBT-I, little is known regarding how CBT-I works at a cellular and molecular level to improve sleep, due in large part to an absence of experimentally-tractable animals models of this intervention. Here, guided by human behavioral sleep therapies, we developed a Drosophila model for sleep restriction therapy (SRT) of insomnia. We demonstrate that restriction of sleep opportunity through manipulation of environmental cues improves sleep efficiency in multiple short-sleeping Drosophila mutants. The response to sleep opportunity restriction requires ongoing environmental inputs, but is independent of the molecular circadian clock. We apply this sleep opportunity restriction paradigm to aging and Alzheimer's disease fly models, and find that sleep impairments in these models are reversible with sleep restriction, with associated improvement in reproductive fitness and extended lifespan. This work establishes a model to investigate the neurobiological basis of CBT-I, and provides a platform that can be exploited toward novel treatment targets for insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30824866/"}

Secondary analyses were performed on data from 74 patients with comorbid insomnia and knee osteoarthritis who completed a randomized clinical trial of 8-session multicomponent CBT-I versus an active behavioral desensitization control condition (BD), including a 6-month follow-up assessment. Data used herein include daily diaries of sleep parameters, actigraphy data, and self-report questionnaires administered at specific time points. Patients who reported at least 30% improvement in self-reported pain from baseline to 6-month follow-up were considered responders (N = 31). Pain responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly at baseline across any sleep continuity measures. At mid-treatment, only TST predicted pain response via t tests and logistic regression, whereas other measures of sleep continuity were nonsignificant. Recursive partitioning analyses identified a minimum cut-point of 382 min of TST achieved at mid-treatment in order to best predict pain improvements 6-month posttreatment. Actigraphy results followed the same pattern as daily diary-based results. Clinically significant pain reductions in response to both CBT-I and BD were optimally predicted by achieving approximately 6.5 hr sleep duration by mid-treatment. Thus, tailoring interventions to increase TST early in treatment may be an effective strategy to promote long-term pain reductions.

No previous study has used factorial Mendelian randomization (MR) which may reduce confounding, reverse causation, and measurement error. Thus, it is prudent to study joint effects using robust methods to propose sleep-targeted interventions which lower the risk of AMI. The causal interplay between combinations of two sleep traits (including insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, or chronotype) on the risk of AMI was investigated using factorial MR. Genetic risk scores for each sleep trait were dichotomized at their median in UK Biobank (UKBB) and the second survey of the TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study (HUNT2). A combination of two sleep traits constituting 4 groups were analyzed to estimate the risk of AMI in each group using a 2Ã2 factorial MR design. In UKBB, participants with high genetic risk for both insomnia symptoms and short sleep had the highest risk of AMI (hazard ratio (HR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.18), although there was no evidence of interaction (relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) 0.03; 95% CI -0.07, 0.12). These estimates were less precise in HUNT2 (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.93, 1.13), possibly due to weak instrumentsÂ and/or small sample size.

Using the 25- and the 75-percentiles of the frequency distribution of the temperature peak times as boundaries, the subjects were classified into early (N = 18), middle (N = 37) and late (N = 19) temperature phase subgroups, which had mean peak times of 14:08 h, 17:43 h and 20:09 h, respectively. Comparisons between the early phase and the late phase subgroups showed that a significant overall MANOVA effect was mainly due to differences in total sleep time (early < late) as calculated from the log, and to differences in the mean nocturnal actigraphic count (early> late). Moreover, the subjective estimates of sleep latency (early < late) and wake after sleep onset (early > late) tended to differ between the two subgroups. The main result of this study, i.e., that insomniacs with a relatively advanced temperature phase had a relatively shorter and more restless sleep, while insomniacs with a relatively delayed temperature phase tended to experience a relatively long sleep latency, supports the conclusion that the addition of oral temperature measurements to a sleep/wake log extends its diagnostic and therapeutic applicability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10916166/"}

This study examined the use of actigraphy in the measurement of sleep of patients with depression and insomnia. Fifty-four patients diagnosed with a current major depressive episode and chronic insomnia underwent a baseline overnight study with concurrent actigraphic and polysomnography (PSG) monitoring, as well as subjective sleep diaries. Agreement between PSG, actigraphy and sleep diary measurements was evaluated using two-tailed t-tests, Pearson's correlations and the Bland-Altman concordance technique. The only significant difference found between actigraphy and PSG was in latency to persistent sleep, in which actigraphy underestimated sleep latency relative to PSG (Pâ<â0.05). There were moderate positive correlations between actigraphy and PSG for all variables. In contrast, significant differences were observed between sleep diaries and PSG for all sleep variables. Bland-Altman concordance diagrams also demonstrated that, while bias was limited between PSG and the other two measurement types, there were somewhat broad 95% limits of agreement for all sleep variables with both sleep diaries and actigraphy. In summary, actigraphic measurements of sleep more closely approximated those of PSG than did sleep diaries in this sample of depressed insomniacs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447050/"}

Studies have shown that depressed patients not only have disturbances in sleep continuity but have reduced slow wave sleep and disinhibited REM sleep. In particular, REM sleep regulation is characterized by shortened REM latency and increased REM density. It has been suggested that the reciprocal interaction between REM and nonREM sleep, driven by inhibitory aminergic and excitatory cholinergic activity, becomes unbalanced in depression. Exposure to cholinergic stimulants reduces REM latency, particularly in major depressive disorder. In fact, it has been shown that healthy individuals at high risk for developing depression have greater sensitivity to cholinergic stimulation than those not at high risk. While the causality of the insomnia-depression relationship is debated, epidemiological studies have indicated that insomnia is an independent risk factor for depression and other psychiatric disorders. As we learn more about the interplay between these pathophysiologies, we will be able to make better treatment decisions for our patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18346672/"}

However, few studies have investigated depression among blue-collar and white-collar workers in the manufacturing industry. The purpose of this study was to clarify the factors associated with depressive symptoms, focusing on lifestyles and insomnia. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted of 1,963 workers at an annual health checkup in a manufacturing company. Of the 1,712 respondents (response rate: 87%), 1,258 male worker subjects (blue-collar 674; white-collar 584) were analyzed after excluding those with mental diseases. The questionnaire included items on basic attributes and lifestyle. The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and The Center for Epidemiologic Studies for Depression Scale (CES-D) were used to evaluate insomnia and depressive symptoms. The incidence of depressive symptoms with CES-D scores of â¥16 was 15.1% in both the blue-collar and the white-collar workers. Insomnia with AIS scores of â¥6 were encountered in 18.8% of the blue-collar workers and 18.3% of the white-collar workers. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that for the blue-collar workers, depressive symptoms were associated with \"AIS scores â¥6\" (Odds ratio (OR): 10.93; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.12-19.15), \"not get rid of fatigue with sleep\" (OR: 3.36; 95%CI: 1.85-6.09), \"skip breakfast over 3 times a week\" (OR: 3.10; 95%CI:1.42-6.76), \"no family living together\" (OR: 2.08; 95%CI: 1.05-4.12), and \"commuting time\" (OR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.00-1.02).

This study explores associations between SCFAs and sleep continuity and compares SCFA concentrations in short vs. normal sleep insomnia phenotypes in older adults. Fifty-nine participants with insomnia symptoms (â¥â65Â years), completed 2Â weeks of objective sleep monitoring (actigraphy), and were divided into short and normal sleep duration phenotypes via cluster analysis. Sleep measures included total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Stool samples were collected and fecal SCFA concentrations were determined by gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GCMS). Higher concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and propionate, and total SCFAs, were associated with lower SE and longer SOL after controlling for Body Mass Index (BMI). Concentrations were higher in the short sleep duration phenotype. Age, BMI, TST, and SOL explained 40.7% of the variance in total SCFAs.

Adults with epilepsy who visited our epilepsy clinic from July 2015 to March 2016 were enrolled in our study. Both patients and healthy controls completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). Subjective sleep quality and sleep disturbances were examined with regard to self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, seizure-related factors, and demographic factors. The PSQI scores and ISI scores of patients were significantly higher (indicating lower quality sleep and more serious insomnia) than those of the control group. Symptoms associated with depression and anxiety were independently related to impaired subjective sleep quality and insomnia. Affective symptoms explained more of the variance in PSQI scores and ISI scores than did seizure-related or demographic variables. In addition, these variables also seemed to be less powerful contributing factors to subjective sleep quality and insomnia than affective symptoms, several seizure-related factors, such as seizure control, partial seizures and duration of epilepsy, which are also significantly associated with subjective sleep quality and insomnia. In addition, use of lamotrigine (LTG) was also associated with insomnia and use of clonazepam (CZP) and phenobarbital (PB) with daytime sleepiness in patients with epilepsy. Chinese adults with epilepsy have poorer self-reported subjective sleep quality and a higher prevalence of insomnia than the control group. Depressive- and anxiety-related symptoms independently exert an adverse effect on the subjective sleep quality and insomnia of patients. In addition, seizure control, partial seizures, and the duration of epilepsy affect the quality of sleep and insomnia in patients, but seem less powerful predictors of sleep quality and insomnia than affective symptoms.

During SWS, theta cell activity showed a larger variability and a flat spectrum, i.e., low Markovian properties. During PS, this activity exhibited smaller variability and high spectral density in a low-frequency band (0.01-1.0 Hz), i.e., high Markovian properties. During BW, variability, spectral and Markovian properties were intermediate. 4. The firing pattern of theta cells during PCPA-induced insomnia was similar to that during PS. However, after the administration of either a serotonin agonist, 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, or a choline antagonist, atropine sulfate, theta cell activity no longer exhibited PS-like fluctuations, revealing instead a firing pattern similar to that during SWS. 5. During PS and PCPA-induced insomnia, not only the unit activity of theta cells, but PGO activity and theta wave frequency exhibited slow fluctuations, i.e., the high spectral density in the low-frequency band (0.01-1.0 Hz). 6. Cross-correlation analyses were performed between the fluctuations in theta cell activity, theta wave frequency, and PGO activity. These fluctuations correlated with each other during both PS and PCPA-induced insomnia. Bursts of PGO waves especially contributed to these cross-correlations. 7. These results suggest, first, that the slow fluctuations of the theta cell activity during PS and PCPA-induced insomnia is the physiological expression of the removal of aminergic influences and, secondly, that they are dependent on cholinergic mechanisms, including PGO generators.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2971787/"}

Analysis was carried out for 21 healthy individuals with no diagnosed sleep disorders and 26 subjects diagnosed with acute insomnia during night-time hours. Detrended fluctuation analysis was applied in order to look for 1/f-fluctuations indicative of high complexity. The aim is to investigate whether complexity analysis can differentiate between people who sleep normally and people who suffer from acute insomnia. We hypothesize that the complexity will be higher in subjects who suffer from acute insomnia owing to increased night-time arousals. This hypothesis, although contrary to much of the literature surrounding complexity in physiology, was found to be correct-for our study. The complexity results for nearly all of the subjects fell within a 1/f-range, indicating the presence of underlying control mechanisms. The subjects with acute insomnia displayed significantly higher correlations, confirmed by significance testing-possibly a result of too much activity in the underlying regulatory systems. Moreover, we found a linear relationship between complexity and variability, both of which increased with the onset of insomnia. Complexity analysis is very promising and could prove to be a useful non-invasive identifier for people who suffer from sleep disorders such as insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24501273/"}

Women had their sleep monitored, collected urine samples, and completed questionnaires in a week-long field study, and 53 women met criteria for insomnia types or no insomnia based on reported sleep quality and PSG sleep efficiency. As expected, women with PP-type insomnia were found to have the lowest sleep efficiency, took longer to fall asleep, had more wakefulness after sleep onset, and had more fragmented sleep. Perceptions of stress exposure, either for major or minor events, did not differ among groups. Despite there being no differences in perceived stress exposure, women with both types of insomnia scored higher on psychological distress (SCL-90R), especially on the somatization subscale, than women with no insomnia. Of the physiological stress activation indicators tested, a morning-to-evening difference in urinary cortisol statistically differed across the groups (p <.005). Women in the PP-type insomnia group had the highest levels of urinary cortisol in an early morning urine sample. These data provide support for the hypothesis that, in midlife women, cognitive or emotional arousal with chronic stress neuroendocrine activation underlies chronic insomnia, particularly the PP-type.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12271110/"}

The state-of-the-art insomnia detection models that used physiological signals in PSG were successful in classification. However, the sleep stages of unbalanced data in small-time intervals were fed for classification in previous studies. This can be avoided by analyzing the insomnia detection structure in different frequency bands with artificially generated data from the existing one at the preprocessing and post-processing stages. Hence, the paper proposes a double-layered augmentation model using Modified Conventional Signal Augmentation (MCSA) and a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) to generate synthetic signals from raw EEG and synthetic data from extracted features, respectively, in creating training data. The presented work is independent of sleep stage scoring and provides double-layered data protection with the utility of augmentation methods. It is ideally suited for real-time detection using a single-channel EEG provides better mobility and comfort while recording. The work analyzes each augmentation layer's performance individually, and better accuracy was observed when merging both. It also evaluates the augmentation performance in various frequency bands, which are decomposed using discrete wavelet transform, and observed that the alpha band contributes more to detection. The classification is performed using Decision Tree (DT), Ensembled Bagged Decision Tree (EBDT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), and Stacking classifier (SC), attaining the highest classification accuracy of 94% using RF with a greater Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.97 compared to the existing works and is best suited for small datasets.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39379545/"}

Actigraphy-derived objective sleep measures, subjective sleep diary measures, the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS), Hewitt-Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (HFMPS) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) were collected. High perfectionism levels were associated with poor sleep, but these relationships differed between objective and subjective measures.

In contrast, perfectionism via HFMPS total score and subscales of Socially Prescribed Perfectionism and Parental Expectations predicted objective sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency. Additionally, stress mediated the relationships between objective sleep efficiency and Concern over Mistakes and Doubts about Actions. Perfectionism demonstrated stronger associations with subjective than objective sleep measures. Higher Parental Expectations and Socially Prescribed Perfectionism may increase one's vulnerability to objectively measured poor sleep.

Forty-five adults with PTSD and insomnia participated in the study. Fear of sleep was assessed using the Fear of Sleep Inventory; PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale; and sleep disturbance symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, polysomnography, sleep diaries, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for PTSD. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of CBT-I (n = 29) or a waitlist control condition (n = 16). Greater fear of sleep was associated with greater PTSD symptom severity, greater nightmare frequency, and greater hypervigilance intensity. Greater fear of sleep was associated with decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO), reduced total sleep time, and greater disruptive nocturnal behaviors. Following CBT-I, there was a significant reduction in fear of sleep compared to the waitlist condition. These improvements persisted 6 months later. Fear of sleep was related to sleep disturbances specific to trauma rather than \"classic\" insomnia symptoms. Unexpectedly, greater fear of sleep was associated with reduced WASO. These results may be related to having a truncated sleep period and thus more consolidated sleep. Fear of sleep deceased following CBT-I despite not being a permissible target for this research protocol and not being related to insomnia symptoms.

Previous studies have shown that the central amygdala (CeA) plays a crucial role in stress regulation, with the somatostatin neurons in the CeA (CeA<sup>SST+</sup>) involved in adaptive stress responses. However, the role of CeA<sup>SST+</sup> neurons in stress-induced sleep-onset insomnia remains unclear. In this study, we found that the activity of CeA<sup>SST+</sup> neurons is closely associated with stressful events using fiber photometry in mice. Acute optogenetic activation of CeA<sup>SST+</sup> neurons induced a rapid transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to wakefulness. Semi-chronic optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>SST+</sup> neurons led to prolonged sleep-onset latency and increased wakefulness. Chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons ameliorated sleep-onset insomnia induced by stressful stimuli, but did not affect sleep-wake behavior under physiological conditions. Collectively, our results suggested that CeA<sup>SST+</sup> neurons are a key neural substrate for modulating stress-induced sleep-onset insomnia, without influencing physiological sleep.

The insomnia group comprised individuals who self-reported meeting the diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia disorder in the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. The ICS is used to independently assess nighttime (ICS-N) and daytime (ICS-D) catastrophic thoughts, and item response theory revealed that each ICS-N and ICS-D item can adequately assess catastrophic thoughts during the night and day, respectively. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the ICS-N and ICS-D were good. Further, the ICS-N and ICS-D had a significant positive correlation with insomnia severity, hyperarousal, sleep-related safety behaviors, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and anxiety symptoms. Multiple regression analyses with insomnia severity as the dependent variable in the insomnia group demonstrated that catastrophic thoughts were more strongly associated with insomnia severity than sleep-related safety behaviors and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. The interaction between nighttime catastrophic thoughts and sleep-related safety behaviors increased insomnia severity. The Japanese versions of ICS-N and ICS-D were found to be superior in measuring insomnia-related catastrophic thoughts and to have high reliability and validity.

Secondary analysis of a single-site, randomized controlled trial. 113 postmenopausal women (56.40Â Â±Â 5.34 years) with menopause-related insomnia disorder were randomized to three treatment conditions: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), sleep restriction therapy (SRT), or sleep education control. Primary outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and polysomnography (PSG) sleep parameters and were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. Patients with lower pretreatment PSG sleep efficiency had lower rates of insomnia remission after active treatment relative to those with higher sleep efficiency (37.8% vs 61.8%). Neither CBTI and SRT produced clinically meaningful effects on PSG sleep. Exploratory analyses revealed that reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal were associated with decreases in PSG sleep latency, but not wake after sleep onset. Our findings support an emerging literature suggesting that insomnia patients with objective sleep disturbance may have blunted response to insomnia therapy. Research is needed to enhance treatments to better improve insomnia in patients with objective sleep disturbance. A lack of observed CBTI and SRT effects on PSG sleep suggests that these therapies may be presently ill-designed to improve objective sleep.

We must accelerate clinician training, but this approach can never be sufficient, even with abbreviated, efficient therapies. Fortunately, however, the treatment landscape has also changed dramatically. Fully-automated digital CBT (dCBT) has emerged as a safe, effective, and scalable treatment delivery format. dCBT is software only, so it can be disseminated as readily and widely as sleep medication. Moreover, dCBT can be integrated into services. Just as medications can be delivered through health professionals and health systems, approved dCBT programmes can be the same. However, an ecosystem of psychologically-based care should not necessitate a medical prescription model. Our proposed stepped care framework, comprises both population health and clinical health service initiatives, enabling universal access to guideline care for insomnia.

Participants aged 25-55 who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to four weeks of SRT or time in bed regularization (TBR), a control intervention that involves prescription of a regular but not reduced time in bed. Sleep pressure was assessed through daily diary appraisal of morning and evening sleepiness, weekly Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores, psychomotor vigilance, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) delta power (0.75-4.5 Hz) from ambulatory polysomnographic recordings. Arousal was assessed through daily diary appraisal of cognitive arousal, the pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and NREM beta power (15-32 Hz). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (2-week period prior to randomization), during the intervention phase (1-4 weeks post-randomization), and at 12-week follow-up.

Of 138 patients with complete data, 123 (89.1%) reported poor sleep quality, and 87 (63%) met the threshold for possible insomnia. The strongest correlates of poor subjective sleep were female gender (<i>Î²Â </i>=Â 0.19, <i>p =Â </i>.02), greater depressive symptom severity (<i>Î²Â </i>=Â 0.28, <i>p =Â </i>.001), and worse physical health (<i>Î²Â </i>=Â -0.19, <i>p =Â </i>.04). Of 118 patients reporting problems with sleep since their cancer diagnosis, 95 discussed the issue with a medical provider; medications were recommended most often (37; 38.9%); only 9 (9.5%) received recommendations for cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) or other CBT. Patients with cancer seeking treatment for depression report very high rates of poor subjective sleep quality and insomnia, underscoring the importance of providing and referring to guideline-concordant sleep interventions in oncology supportive care contexts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35098834/"}

It is highly comorbid with medical and psychiatric disorders, and is associated with significantly increased healthcare utilization and costs. Evidence-based psychotherapy, namely Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI), is an effective treatment and recommended over prescription sleep medications. While CBTI is part of a nationwide rollout in the Veterans Health Administration to train hundreds of providers, access to treatment is still limited for many Veterans due to limited treatment availability, low patient and provider knowledge about treatment options, and Veteran barriers such as distance and travel, work schedules, and childcare. Uptake of a briefer, more primary-care-friendly treatment into routine clinical care in Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care settings, where insomnia is typically first recognized and diagnosed, may effectively and efficiently increase access to effective insomnia interventions and help decrease the risks and burdens related to chronic insomnia. This hybrid type I trial is composed of two aims. The first preliminarily tests the clinical non-inferiority of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) versus the current \"gold standard\" treatment, CBTI. The second is a qualitative needs assessment, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to identify potential factors that may affect successful implementation and integration of behavioral treatments for insomnia in the primary care setting. To identify potential implementation factors, individual interviews are conducted with the Veterans who participate in the clinical trial, as well as VA primary care providers and nursing staff. It is increasingly important to better understand barriers to, and facilitators of, implementing insomnia interventions in order to ensure that Veterans have the best access to care. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the potential for new avenues of treatment delivery, like BBTI in the primary care setting, which can benefit Veterans who may not have adequate access to specialty mental health providers trained in CBTI.

Eight-session weekly individual CBT-I delivered by a licensed clinical psychologist or a board-certified psychiatrist. Measures included continuous monitoring of sleep with diary and actigraphy; prepolysomnography and postpolysomnography and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); and pre, mid, and post self-report questionnaires, with follow-up of CBT-I participants 6 mo later. CBT-I was superior to the waitlist control condition in all sleep diary outcomes and in polysomnography-measured total sleep time. Compared to waitlist participants, CBT-I participants reported improved subjective sleep (41% full remission versus 0%), disruptive nocturnal behaviors (based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Addendum), and overall work and interpersonal functioning. These effects were maintained at 6-mo follow-up. Both CBT-I and waitlist control participants reported reductions in PTSD symptoms and CAPS-measured nightmares. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved sleep in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, with durable gains at 6 mo.

This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms. After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia. Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study. Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24732691/"}

Automatic sleep staging plays a crucial role in aiding doctors to diagnose insomnia disorder. Only a few studies have been conducted to develop automatic sleep staging methods for insomniacs, and most of them have utilized transfer learning methods, which involve pre-training models on healthy individuals and then fine-tuning them on insomniacs. Unfortunately, significant differences in feature distribution between the two subject groups impede the transfer performance, highlighting the need to effectively integrate the features of healthy subjects and insomniacs. In this paper, we propose a dual-teacher cross-domain knowledge transfer method based on the feature-based knowledge distillation to improve the performance of sleep staging for insomniacs. Specifically, the insomnia teacher directly learns from insomniacs and feeds the corresponding domain-specific features into the student network, while the health domain teacher guide the student network to learn domain-generic features. During the training process, we adopt the OFD (Overhaul of Feature Distillation) method to build the health domain teacher. We conducted the experiments to validate the proposed method, using the Sleep-EDF database as the source domain and the CAP-Database as the target domain. The results demonstrate that our method surpasses advanced techniques, achieving an average sleep staging accuracy of 80.56% on the CAP-Database.

Although both conditions produced significant improvements in subjective sleep estimates, no significant group differences over time were shown for total wake time (TWT) and total sleep time (TST). Both interventions resulted in reductions over time in insomnia severity, worry, and dysfunction. Compared to BT, BT + CW led to a larger decrease in insomnia severity at all three time points (controlled d= 1.10-1.68). In comparison with BT, BT + CW resulted in a larger reduction in worry at two of the time points (controlled d= 0.76-1.64).

Comparison with drug-free insomniacs showed that LBD leads to a complete loss of hypnotic activity and substantial suppression of delta and REM sleep. Only small differences were found between benzodiazepines with different half-life time. Upon withdrawal, recovery from this suppression, especially in REM sleep, occurred, while insomnia did not increase. The patients, however, reported sleeping longer while taking the drug compared with withdrawal. This misperception seems to be a specific effect of benzodiazepines, and contrasts with the full awareness of insomnia upon withdrawal. It is concluded that these effects play a leading role in the patients' inability to escape their sleeping pills.

ISI significantly improved more in eszopiclone (mean=-10.7, 95% CI=-13.2; -8.2) than in placebo (mean=-6.9, 95% CI=-9.5; -4.3) with a between-group difference of -3.8 (95% CI=-7.5; -0.2). MATRICS score change did not differ between groups. On further analysis there was a significant improvement in the working memory test, letter-number span component of MATRICS (mean=9.8Â±9.2, z=-2.00, p=0.045) only for subjects with schizophrenia on eszopiclone. There were improvements in sleep diary items in both groups with no between-group differences. Psychiatric symptoms remained stable. Discontinuation rates were similar. Sleep remained improved during single-blind placebo phase after eszopiclone was stopped, but the working memory improvement in patients with schizophrenia was not durable. Eszopiclone stands as a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of insomnia in patients with schizophrenia.

Its socioeconomic burden is enormous while diagnosis and treatment are difficult. A novel approach that reveals associations between insomnia genetic propensity and sleep phenotypes in youth may help understand the core of the disease isolated from comorbidities and pave the way for new treatments. We obtained quantitative nocturnal sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) features in 456 participants (18-31y, 49 women). Sleep EEG was recorded during a baseline night following at least 7Â days of regular sleep times. We then assessed daytime sleep onset latency in a subsample of NÂ =Â 359 men exposed to manipulations affecting sleep pressure. We sampled saliva or blood for polygenic risk score (PRS) determination. The PRS for ID was computed based on genome-wide common single nucleotide polymorphism assessments. Participants also completed a battery of behavioral and cognitive tests.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first choice treatment and effective for people with insomnia and comorbid long-term medical conditions. However, CBT-I has some limitations as it might not always be available or appeal to patients with medical conditions. Furthermore, a small proportion of patients do not respond to CBT-I. Preliminary evidence and clinical experience suggest that low-dose amitriptyline (AM) might be an effective alternative to treat insomnia in patients with medical comorbidity. In this randomized controlled trial, we will determine whether AM is non-inferior to the first choice treatment for insomnia, CBT-I. This study will test if treatment with low-dose amitriptyline for insomnia in patients with medical comorbidity is non-inferior to CBT-I in a multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.

Binge alcohol consumption has serious negative consequence on mental and physical health. Although alcohol consumption is known to have profound impact on sleep, it is yet unknown as to how binge alcohol affects/alters sleep-wakefulness. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of acute binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study. Under standard aseptic surgical conditions, rats (N = 7) were implanted with sleep-recording electrodes. After postoperative recovery and habituation, baseline sleep-wakefulness was recorded. Subsequently, rats were exposed to binge alcohol treatment as follows: One hour before light onset, a priming dose of 5 g/kg of alcohol was administered followed by 2 subsequent doses (adjusted based on the intoxication level of the rat) approximately 8 hours apart. Sleep-wakefulness was continuously recorded for 3 days post-binge. Acute binge alcohol administration had no significant effect on sleep-wakefulness on post-binge Day 1. However, on post-binge Day 2, after blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0, sleep disruptions were observed manifested by a reversal of sleep-wakefulness as evident from insomnia-like symptoms (significant increase in wakefulness; significant reduction in nonrapid eye movement [NREM] sleep) during the normal sleep (light) period and excessive sleep (significant increase in NREM sleep) during the normal active (dark) period similar to excessive daytime sleepiness in humans. All sleep-wakefulness changes were normalized on Day 3 post-binge. Alcohol hangover is defined as the presence of unpleasant symptoms that peak when BAC is 0.

To this date, however, there is little evidence that the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of insomnia can significantly benefit from actigraphy recordings. Using a case-control design, we therefore critically examined whether mean or within-subject variability of actigraphy sleep estimates or circadian patterns add to the understanding of sleep complaints in insomnia. We acquired actigraphy recordings and sleep diaries of 37 controls and 167 patients with varying degrees of insomnia severity for up to 9 consecutive days in their home environment. Additionally, the participants spent one night in the laboratory, where actigraphy was recorded alongside PSG to check whether sleep, in principle, is well estimated. Despite moderate to strong agreement between actigraphy and PSG sleep scoring in the laboratory, ambulatory actigraphic estimates of average sleep and circadian rhythm variables failed to successfully differentiate patients with insomnia from controls in the home environment. Only total sleep time differed between the groups. Additionally, within-subject variability of sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset was higher in patients. Insomnia research may therefore benefit from shifting attention from average sleep variables to day-to-day variability or from the development of non-motor home-assessed indicators of sleep quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36217775/"}

Subjectively, sleep quality was considered mediocre during the use of a benzodiazepine hypnotic. One week after the discontinuation, an increase in sleep latency was observed in the placebo group, whereas zolpidem induced a significant decrease in sleep latency. Deterioration of other sleep variables (probably rebound) was not suppressed by zolpidem. An explanation for this could be the selective pharmacological profile of zolpidem.

Changes of sleep structure caused by hypnotics seem not always to be felt as such by patients.

Sleep complaints such as insomnia and cognitive impairments are prevalent in BC. In general population, sleep is known to contribute greatly to cognition. Thus, improving RAR (and particularly sleep) could help limiting cognitive impairments in BC patients. It has recently been suggested that, in addition to its essential role in spatial memory, the vestibular system contributes to RAR synchronization. Its stimulation could therefore limit both sleep disturbances and spatial memory deficits in BC. The main aim of the ICANSLEEP-2 study is to assess the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on circadian rhythms. The secondary aim is to assess whether GVS improves sleep and spatial memory in BC patients. Two groups with insomnia complaints (Insomnia Severity Index > 7) will be included: a patients' group with BC (n = 50) and a healthy control group without history of cancer (n = 25). There will be two assessment sessions, before and after 2 weeks of GVS. Patients will be randomly assigned to either a GVS group or a sham group (noneffective stimulation). Controls will receive GVS. GVS effects will be quantified and compared between groups. Assessments will include actigraphy, salivary cortisol, polysomnography, a cognitive test battery (including a computer-based task for spatial memory) and validated questionnaires (for psychological functioning and sleep complaints). Current methods for improving sleep in BC have had controversial outcomes regarding sleep structure. We expect GVS to offer a new mean of directly targeting RAR disruptions in BC patients, with beneficial effects on sleep structure.

However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10Â min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration.

A significant improvement of the PSQI score was detected in zolpidem period versus placebo in both groups (7.14 Â± 3.02 vs 12.38 Â± 2.51, P<0.001) although zolpidem had no significant effect on time of waking up (6.76 Â± 1.21 vs.6.64 Â± 1.27, P=0.89). Zolpidem significantly improved all components of PSQI (Subjective sleep quality, Sleep latency, Sleep duration, Habitual sleep efficiency, Sleep disturbances and Daytime dysfunction) in the current study except the use of sleep medication. Sleep onset latency was the component of PSQI with the greatest degree of abnormality among firefighters in a previous study. Interestingly, sleep latency was the component of PSQI with the most treatment effect of zolpidem in the current study. Zolpidem can be used asa part of treatment regimens in short time management of poor sleep quality among professional firefighters.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26553086/"}
{"id": "35504109", "title": "Sleep reactivity as a potential pathway from childhood abuse to adult insomnia.", "text": "Survivors of childhood abuse are prone to adult insomnia, but the mechanisms for this development are poorly understood. Abuse that occurs during sensitive developmental periods might affect risk for insomnia by impacting emerging stress regulatory processes. Sleep reactivity refers to the sensitivity of the sleep system to stress and is a robust risk factor for insomnia. Recent evidence shows stress exposure itself worsens sleep reactivity, thereby increasing insomnia vulnerability. In this preliminary study, we hypothesized the association between childhood abuse experiences and adult insomnia would be mediated through greater sleep reactivity. Community adults were recruited from the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic between June 2020 and June 2021 (NÂ =Â 241, 88% female, M<sub>age</sub>Â =Â 39, SDÂ =Â 13.40). Participants completed a cross-sectional survey that included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, Insomnia Severity Index, and a measure of general COVID-19 stress. Reporting more frequent childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse was associated with more severe insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only childhood emotional and physical (but not sexual) abuse histories were associated with greater sleep reactivity, which exerted an indirect effect on the relationships between these two abuse types and insomnia symptoms. These findings were robust to the effects of gender, age, and stress about the COVID-19 pandemic. This preliminary study suggests recurrent emotional and physical abuse in childhood might promote later insomnia through heightened sleep reactivity. Stress management interventions could be important to prevent insomnia for abuse survivors by bolstering resilience of the sleep system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35504109/"}

Our study is the first investigation to prove objective efficacy and tolerability of low doses of a sedating antidepressant in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled manner in patients with primary insomnia. Forty-seven drug-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for primary insomnia (mean +/- SD duration of complaints = 11.2+/-9.7 years) received either 25-50 mg of the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of placebo withdrawal. Sleep was measured by polysomnography at baseline and the first night of application, at 4 weeks of treatment and the first to third night of withdrawal, and after 2 weeks of withdrawal. In the doxepin-treated patients who completed the study (N = 20, 47.6+/-11.3), medication significantly increased sleep efficiency after acute (night 1, p < or = .001) and subchronic (night 28, p < or = .05) intake compared with the patients who received placebo (N = 20, 47.4+/-16.8 years of age). Latency to sleep onset was not affected since the patients had normal baseline sleep latencies. Investigators found doxepin to cause significantly (p < or = .05) better global improvement at the first day of treatment. Patients rated sleep quality (p < or = .001) and working ability (p < or = .005) to be significantly improved by doxepin during the whole treatment period. Overall rebound in sleep parameters was not observed, but patients with severe rebound insomnia were significantly more frequent in the doxepin group (night 29, p < .01, night 30, p < or = .01; night 31, p < or = .05). No significant group differences in side effects were found, but 2 doxepin-treated patients dropped out of the study due to specific side effects (increased liver enzymes, leukopenia, and thrombopenia). The results support the effectiveness of low doses of doxepin to improve sleep and working ability in chronic primary insomniacs, although subjective effects were light to moderate, and in some patients, rebound insomnia and specific side effects have to be considered.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465523/"}

In recent years, our laboratory has been involved in a large-scale project aimed at investigating the role of endogenous melatonin in sleep-wake regulation and the effects of nonpharmacological levels of melatonin on sleep. Based on our finding on the precise coupling between the endogenous nocturnal increase in melatonin secretion and the opening of the nocturnal sleep gate, we propose that the role of melatonin in the induction of sleep does not involve the active induction of sleep, but is rather mediated by an inhibition of a wakefulness-producing mechanism in the central nervous system. Our studies also suggest that exogenously administered melatonin may be beneficial in certain types of insomnia that are related to disturbances in the normal secretion of the hormone.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9556097/"}

Two thirds of participants had nightmares at least once per week and received the optional IRT module. At posttreatment, veterans who participated in CBT-I/IRT reported improved subjectively and objectively measured sleep, a reduction in PTSD symptom severity and PTSD-related nighttime symptoms, and a reduction in depression and distressed mood compared to the waitlist control group. The findings from this first controlled study with OEF/OIF veterans suggest that CBT-I combined with adjunctive IRT may hold promise for reducing both insomnia and PTSD symptoms.

The adequate supply of carbohydrates and omega-3 fatty acids is favorable, while excess fat and saturated fat are harmful. In relation to vitamins, it has been shown that an adequate supply of pyridoxine, vitamin B12, folates, niacin, vitamin D and antioxidants (vitamin C, beta-carotene) help prevent sleep disturbance.

For these PSG variables the values for good sleep in the older group were similar to the values for poor sleep in the young group. It was concluded that women perceive different levels of sleep duration, sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset relatively well, but that older women adjust their objective criteria for good sleep downwards. It was also concluded that age is an important factor in the relation between subjective and objective sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27122391/"}

Chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) mice models was established to investigate the effect of EA at acupoints of Yintang (EX-HN3), Shenmen (HT7), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) on CSD. With the methods of EEG/EMG recordings and chemogenetic manipulations, we explore the role of the dopaminergic projections from ventral tegmental area (VTA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the therapeutic effects of EA on CSD-induced insomnia. We found that EA significantly alleviated CSD-induced insomnia, as indicated by an increased total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the dark period, along with attenuating the CSD-caused hyperactivity of VTA dopamine neurons in mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of the dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc could restore the NREM sleep in CSD mice. Most importantly, the therapeutic effects of EA on CSD-induced insomnia was counteracted by activating the dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc of mice. These findings suggested that the therapeutic effects of EA at EX-HN3, HT7 and SP6 are achieved by targeting the dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc, which could be therapeutic approach for chronic insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40553719/"}

Participants were in one of three groups: insomnia (CUR, nÂ =Â 299), healthy sleeper (HS, nÂ =Â 122), or past insomnia (PAST, nÂ =Â 35). Daily diaries and validated measures were employed to capture six dimensions of sleep health. The CUR group received four 60-minute sessions of CBT-I every 2weeks, and sleep health indices were measured at baseline and post-treatment. The HS and PAST groups were measured only at baseline. Results of the pairwise t tests indicated improvements in sleep satisfaction, alertness (fatigue but not sleepiness), timing, efficiency, and duration (Cohen's d=0.22 to 1.55). ANCOVA models revealed significant differences in sleep health scores between treated insomnia patients and the other two sleep groups. Treated patients demonstrated less bedtime and risetime variability, in addition to lower napping duration. Overall, the study observed significant changes in various domains of sleep health after four sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia; however, differences remain when compared to the other groups in the study. There may be ongoing sleep vulnerability in patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia though future inclusion of a control group would increase internal validity.

Variables to measure efficacy, rebound and withdrawal were assessed daily from day 1 to day 28. Polysomnographic recordings together with sleep cycle analysis were performed on nights 7, 21 and 28. Patients treated with 10 mg zolpidem for 2 weeks had significantly improved sleep efficiency at the end of the randomised double-blind phase compared with the placebo group. Fractionated sleep-cycle analysis showed an increase in slow-wave sleep during the first 2-hour cycle after sleep onset. During the withdrawal placebo week, most of the main sleep variables remained relatively stable in the zolpidem group (nights 22-28), and deteriorated further in the placebo group. At the end of the withdrawal phase, there was a statistically significant difference between groups, in favour of the zolpidem treatment, in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, absolute and percentage of time awake, and percentage of REM sleep. REM sleep, which was normal in both groups at baseline, decreased significantly in the placebo group between nights 22 and 28 (during the withdrawal placebo week) compared with the zolpidem treatment group, and the number of periods of time awake increased. Minor subjective complaints were recorded under zolpidem and were comparable with those under placebo. Zolpidem seemed to improve some important sleep variables, when assessed both objectively and subjectively. The sleep cycle analysis suggested a possible shift of slow-wave sleep to an earlier period of the night, with a more physiological sleep structure. There was no evidence for withdrawal or rebound after stopping the 2 weeks of zolpidem treatment, but rather signs that the effect of zolpidem outlasted active treatment. The present pilot study justifies a prospective confirmatory comparison of zolpidem with benzodiazepines in an adequate number of patients and withdrawal after 6-8 weeks of treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8143886/"}

The present study examined whether a brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBTi) is efficacious for reducing sleep discrepancy in older adults. <b>Methods</b>: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of BBTi for community dwelling older adults with chronic insomnia (N = 62). Thirty-two participants received BBTi, delivered in four individual face-to-face sessions. Thirty received the self-monitoring control (SMC). They all completed daily sleep diaries and wore an actigraph from baseline to posttreatment, and for 2 weeks at 3-month follow-up. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). Mixed modeling was used to analyze data. SOL discrepancy decreased significantly in BBTi participants compared to SMC participants. The decreases in SOL discrepancy were explained by changes in diary-assessed SOL and subjective sleep quality but not changes in actigraphy-assessed SOL. Although WASO discrepancy and TST discrepancy decreased from baseline to posttreatment and follow-up, the Time by Group interaction effects were not significant indicating that BBTi participants did not experience greater reductions in WASO discrepancy and TST discrepancy than SMC participants.

Lower remission rates were noted for those: with a pain disorder, poor mental health perceptions, high MFI fatigue scores, and lower sleep times and efficiencies. Patients with a pain disorder responded best to the BT-to-Zol sequence, whereas patients with more mental impairment, severe fatigue, short sleep, and low sleep efficiency responded poorly to treatment starting with BT.

Subjective evaluation included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. IGHD subjects showed a reduction in sleep efficiency (<i>P</i>â=â0.007), total sleep time (<i>P</i>â=â0.028), duration of N2 and R in minutes (<i>P</i>â=â0.026 and <i>Pâ=â</i>0.046 respectively), but had increased duration and percentage of N1 stage (<i>P</i>â=â0.029 and <i>Pâ=â</i>0.022 respectively), wake (<i>P</i>â=â0.007) and wake-time after sleep onset (<i>P</i>â=â0.017). There was no difference in N3 or in sleep quality questionnaire scores. Patients with IGHD due to GHRH resistance exhibit objective reduction in the sleep quality, with changes in NREM and REM sleep, with no detectable subjective consequences. GHRH resistance seems to have a preponderant role over GHD in the sleep quality of these subjects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28432269/"}

A cross-sectional survey in 5 cities of Shandong, mainland China in 1997. Among 1,820 individuals aged 65 and older who were sampled, 1,679 (92.2%) were interviewed at home, including 770 men and 909 women. Asleep and demographic questionnaire that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used for interviews. Average bedtime of participants was 9:18 PM (SD = 2.2 hours), and morning rise time was 5:42 AM (SD = 1.0 hour). Reported night sleep duration was 7.1 hours (SD = 1.6) without age and sex differences. Regular napping was more common in men than in women (44.2% vs 28.0%). Of the sample, 32.9% reported frequent insomnia symptoms, and 8.9% had insomnia symptoms with daytime consequences. Multivariate analysis indicated that age 75 years and older (odds ratio = 2.0), female sex (odds ratio = 1.4), unmarried status (odds ratio = 1.7), frequent napping (odds ratio = 1.5), and poor perceived health (odds ratio, = 2.1) were associated with elevated risks for insomnia. Hypnotic use during the past month was reported by 6.5% of the sample; women were 2 times as likely as men to use hypnotics. Sleep patterns in Chinese elderly may be characterized by going to bed early and waking up early. Insomnia symptoms are as common among Chinese as among Western elderly. Further study is warranted to examine the association between insomnia and aging per se in Chinese elderly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16408418/"}

Although retrospective measures of insomnia and fatigue tend to correlate, other studies fail to demonstrate a link between objectively disturbed sleep and fatigue. The current study prospectively explored the relationship between sleep and fatigue among those with and without insomnia disorder. Participants meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for insomnia disorder (n = 33) or normal sleepers (n = 32) completed the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) and daily fatigue ratings for 2 weeks. Baseline questionnaires evaluated cognitive factors including unhelpful beliefs about sleep and rumination about fatigue. Hierarchical linear modeling tested the within- and between-participant relationships between sleep quality, total sleep time, and daily fatigue ratings. Mediation analyses tested if cognitive factors mediated the relationship between insomnia and fatigue. Self-reported nightly sleep quality significantly predicted subsequent daily fatigue ratings. Total sleep time was a significant predictor of fatigue within, but not between, participants. Unhelpful sleep beliefs and rumination about fatigue mediated the relationship between insomnia and fatigue reporting. The results suggest that perception of sleep plays an important role in predicting reports of daytime fatigue. These findings could be used in treatment to help shift the focus away from total sleep times, and instead, focus on challenging maladaptive sleep-related cognitions to change fatigue perception.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33245330/"}

Subjective measures: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective measures: Standard polysomnography measures. Multiple regressions determined whether gender moderated CTQ score on any objective or subjective sleep measures. If gender was not a moderator, we examined additive effects of gender and CTQ score. Models were adjusted for race and age. Gender and CTQ score interactions were non-significant for both subjective (p &gt; .675) and objective (p &gt; .110) sleep. Women demonstrated better subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, BÂ =Â -0.264, pÂ =Â .041) and more delta sleep than men (BÂ =Â 3.032, p =.005).

Methodological discrepancies and limitations in the literature create ambiguity about the nature and potential mechanisms underlying these relationships. Insomnia and circadian patterns in eating and sleeping have also been examined in relation to weight. Although these studies are not as extensive as those examining sleep duration, the extant literature suggests possible associations between obesity and both insomnia (particularly when combined with short sleep duration) and circadian eating behaviours. However, research has only just begun to examine the benefits of combining sleep interventions with obesity treatment. The goal of the current review is to summarize research examining behavioural sleep patterns and disorders in relation to obesity, to discuss methodological considerations, and to provide an overview of studies examining whether addressing sleep disturbances can augment weight loss treatment effects.

As a consequence, the S-allele is found to predispose individuals to a higher risk of sleep quality reduction and clinical insomnia. The present study investigated whether subchronic pre-sleep tryptophan administration could compensate for this predisposition by improving sleep in 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design a sample of homozygous 5-HTTLPR S-allele (<i>n</i> = 47) and L-allele (<i>n</i> = 51) carriers were assessed for subjective (sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) sleep during a treatment protocol consisting of 1 week of placebo (1000âmg/day) and 1 week of tryptophan administration (1000âmg/day). The results support the sleep-promoting effects of tryptophan. Tryptophan improved objective sleep efficiency and objective wake after sleep onset irrespective of allelic variation. There was a marginally significant improvement of subjective sleep quality in the 5-HTTLPR S-allele group but not in the L-allele group following tryptophan relative to placebo intake. In contrast, a significantly poorer sleep quality in the S-allele as opposed to the L-allele group in the placebo condition was not observed in the tryptophan condition. Tryptophan augmentation promises to be a valuable treatment strategy for sleep impairments related to genetic deficiencies in 5-HT functioning.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237183/"}

This cross-sectional design included community recruits meeting DSM-IV criteria for PI (n=20, 10 males, mean age 39.3+/-8.7) or good sleeper controls (n=15, 9 males, mean age 38.8+/-5.3).

The treatment program was accomplished in 6 sessions over 2 months. Follow-up evaluations were completed at 2, 6, and 12 months from the beginning of the treatment program. The outcome of the treatment program was evaluated in terms of the change in (1) self-reported specific sleep parameters, (2) self-ratings of sleep-related day-time state, (3) self-rating of quality of sleep, (4) the use of sleep medication, and (5) the therapist's global rating of improvement. There was a statistically significant change from the baseline in all self-reported specific sleep parameters after 2 months that was sustained after 6 and 12 months. Sleep-related characteristics of daytime state showed statistically significant changes after 2 and 6 months that were maintained after 12 months. Sleep quality had a statistically significant change after 2 months, continued to improve statistically after 6 months, and was maximum after 12 months. Over half the patients (52.7%; 20 of 38) either reduced their sleep medication by half or stopped it completely. The therapist's global rating showed an improvement in 29.2% (N = 14) of patients after 2 months, 56.2% (N = 27) after 6 months, and 68.7% (N = 33) after 12 months. The use of concomitant behavioral and pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in psychiatrically ill patients results in improving sleep and sleep-related state and reduces the risk of return of insomnia for 10 months after finishing active treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9921709/"}

Moreover, RNT is a longitudinal precursor of depression and anxiety, which are often co-present alongside insomnia. Whilst accumulating evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, the literature on the effects of CBT-I on RNT has never been systematically appraised. Importantly, preliminary evidence suggests that reduction of RNT following CBT-I may be associated with reduction of depression and anxiety. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of CBT-I on RNT. Seven databases were searched, and 15 randomised controlled trials were included. Results showed moderate-to-large effects of CBT-I on worry (Hedge's g range:Â -0.41 to gÂ =Â -0.71) but small and non-reliable effects on rumination (gÂ =Â -0.13). No clear evidence was found for an association between post-treatment reduction in RNT and post-treatment reduction in depression and anxiety.

However, this concept has been questioned by several studies that did not show the presence of sleep-related attentional bias in clinical insomnia or poor sleepers. Our goal in the present study was to test whether the mood state of individuals with insomnia affects the presence of sleep-related attentional bias. To this end, 31 individuals with insomnia and 34 good sleepers were randomly assigned to a negative mood-inducing condition or a control condition. They then completed a visual probe task with three types of pictorial stimuli (general threat, sleep-related negative pictures and sleep-related positive pictures). Vigilance, maintenance and the overall bias indexes were calculated based on the reaction time. We found individuals with insomnia only showed a greater overall bias compared with good sleepers following a negative mood induction, regardless of the pictures presented. In addition, we found that a negative mood state was significantly correlated with the overall attentional bias in good sleepers but not in individuals with insomnia. These findings suggest that sleep-related attentional bias in insomnia can be modulated by mood state. This effect may reflect the dysregulation of top-down attentional control in individuals with insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30136320/"}

The purpose of this study was to examine reactions to insomnia among veterans with serious mental illness and insomnia. An inductive phenomenological approach was used to collect data from 20 veterans with serious mental illness and insomnia using semi-structured interviews. Six themes were identified: Becoming Aware that Insomnia is a Problem; Response to and Dissatisfaction with Medications; Strategies to Get Better Sleep: Contrary to Usual Guidelines; Personal Responsibility for Getting Sleep; Resigned and Giving Up; and Acceptance and Persistence. These results provide insight into the process of identifying insomnia and the subsequent cognitive and behavioural responses that are used to manage sleep disturbances among veterans with serious mental illness, a group often excluded from gold-standard treatments for chronic insomnia.

To elucidate the mechanisms and identify useful diagnostic biomarkers for insomnia in the elderly, the current study investigated the associations of waking brain activity patterns with susceptibility to stress-induced insomnia (sleep reactivity) and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, major factors precipitating and maintaining insomnia, respectively. Forty-five participants aged 60Â years or older with insomnia completed self-reported measures assessing depression, anxiety, sleep quality, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep reactivity. Participants were then examined by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) during wakefulness, and spectral analysis was conducted to examine associations of regional frequency band power with these insomnia-precipitating and -maintaining factors. Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep were significantly correlated with higher beta/high-beta frequency band powers, while sleep reactivity was correlated with higher theta and delta frequency band powers. These findings suggest that sleep reactivity of older adults is associated with widespread cortical deactivation leading to poor stress coping, while their dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are associated with hyperactivation which is related to cognitive processes. These associations suggest that cognitive inflexibility and maladaptive stress-coping contribute to insomnia among the elderly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38844053/"}

Subsequent comparisons showed the insomnia subgroups differed in regard to their insomnia severity, use of prescribed medication for sleep, depression and anxiety symptoms, and daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, comparisons of treatment outcomes (i.e. analysis of change scores and normative comparisons) across clusters showed that the subgroups did not benefit equally from a standardized form of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia.

Acupuncture is a common traditional Chinese therapy. It has been used in the treatment of insomnia, depression, and anxiety in China. However, there are no high-quality studies focusing on acupuncture for insomnia, especially for depression and anxiety due to insomnia.

In particular, they often appear inadequate to support a diagnosis of insomnia or the effectiveness of a hypnotic compound. In the past years, attention has been focused on the microstructure of sleep, and especially on the periodic distribution of arousal-related phasic events known as Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP). This microstructural rhythm is not only a physiological component of normal NREM sleep, but it also appears highly sensitive in the detection of disturbing factors and drug manipulation. Regardless of the specific context, CAP always translates a condition of arousal instability during sleep. Accordingly, the higher the amount of CAP, the poorer the subjective quality of sleep. In young adults, the physiological amount of CAP Rate (percentage ratio of CAP time to NREM sleep time) ranges around 25%, while CAP Rate rises to 55% when sleep is perturbed by continuous white noise (situational insomnia). The analysis of CAP Rate within this framework of situational insomnia is recommended for evaluating the effects of hypnotic drugs under controlled experimental conditions. Therapeutical doses of zolpidem preserve the regular course of sleep both at the macro- and at the microstructural level, when sleep is recorded under basal conditions. In contrast, during acoustic perturbation, zolpidem reduces the pathological amounts of arousal instability by lowering the values of CAP Rate to 38%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7894540/"}

Similarly to the perception of heart rate variability, sleepiness is thought to be mainly evoked by homeostatic processes and is based on the awareness and recognition of internal body signals. However, the relationship between subjective excessive daytime sleepiness and interoceptive awareness has not been addressed. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between interoceptive awareness and multiple sleep variables including subjective excessive sleepiness in daytime workers. A web questionnaire survey was conducted targeting daytime workers in Japan, and data from 461 participants were used for analyses. Multiple regression analyses showed weak but significant relationships between subjective excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, nightmare distress, and dream frequency and the components of interoception awareness measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness. However, no components of interoceptive awareness were related to workday sleep loss or social jetlag of day workers. The results of this study suggest that subjective sleepiness, in addition to nightmare distress and sleep quality, is associated with interoceptive awareness.

Internight variability of sleep often accompanies insomnia. However, few studies have explored the relevance of this 'construct' in the context of diagnosis, clinical impact, treatment effects and/or whether having 'variable sleep' carries any prognostic significance. We explored these questions by conducting secondary analyses of data from a randomized clinical trial. The sample included primary (PI: n = 40) and comorbid insomnia (CMI: n = 41) sufferers receiving four biweekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) or sleep hygiene education. Using the within-subject standard deviations of diary- and actigraphy-derived measures collected for 2-week periods [sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE)], we found that CMI sufferers displayed more variable self-reported SOLs and SEs than PI sufferers. However, higher variability in diary and actigraphy-derived measures was related to poorer sleep quality only within the PI group, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Within both groups, the variability of diary-derived measures was reduced after CBT, but the variability of actigraphy-derived measures remained unchanged. Interestingly, the variability of actigraphy measures at baseline was correlated with PSQI scores at 6-month follow-up. Higher SOL variability was associated with worse treatment outcomes within the PI group, whereas higher WASO variability was correlated with better treatment outcomes within the CMI group. Sleep variability differences across insomnia diagnoses, along with their distinctive correlates, suggest that mechanisms underlying the sleep disruption/complaint and treatment response in both patient groups are distinct.

We aimed to investigate the clinical associates of fatigue in patients with insomnia. Patients visiting the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Among 6367 patients, 2024 were diagnosed with insomnia (age 43.06â¯Â±â¯15.19 years; 1110 women and 914 men) according to the ISI and the ISQ. Insomnia patients with severe fatigue (nâ¯=â¯1306) showed higher insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness, depression and longer habitual sleep duration than those without severe fatigue (nâ¯=â¯718). Higher insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms, and longer habitual sleep duration, independently predicted higher fatigue scores. Among insomnia patients with daytime sleepiness (ESSâ¥10), only habitual sleep duration and depression predicted fatigue scores. The interaction between insomnia severity and daytime sleepiness significantly predicted the severity of fatigue. Depression was a significant mediator between insomnia and fatigue. For 598 insomnia patients undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG), no significant correlations were found between fatigue and any PSG parameters. The current study suggests that managing insomnia or depression may reduce the fatigue of insomnia patients, whereas arbitrary efforts to prolong sleep duration may worsen their fatigue.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31272015/"}

In view of the health hazards of insomnia and the shortcomings of western medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) should be considered in the management of insomnia. The present overview reports the potential role of herbal medicine and non-pharmacological therapies in the treatment of insomnia and summarizes the scientific evidence reported from 2008 to 2018. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published from 2008 to 2018. 17 randomized controlled trials and 22 non-pharmacological therapies were included in this review, and the results showed that CAM had certain advantages in the treatment of insomnia. The safety of CAM for insomnia was acceptable. Meanwhile, based on pre-clinical trial, the possible mechanisms of CAM for insomnia were modulation of circadian rhythm, GABA receptor activation, antagonisms of 5-HT receptors, inhibition of glutamate-mediated pathways, and attenuation of inflammation. CAM for insomnia has made some progress, but high quality evidence-based medical evidence is still needed to provide guidance for clinical application.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31057109/"}

Objective polysomnogram indicators of sleep and arousal activity and self-reported sleep quality were measured. In Study 2 (Prospective), clinical outcomes were assessed after sequential cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and SDB therapy (CPAP, oral appliances, or bilateral turbinectomy) were provided to 17 chronic insomnia patients with SDB. Repeat measures included the Insomnia Severity Index, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and self-reported insomnia indices and CPAP use. In Study 1, seven objective measures of sleep and arousal demonstrated or approached significant improvement during one night of CPAP titration. Sixteen of 19 patients reported improvement in sleep quality. In Study 2, Insomnia Severity Index, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index improved markedly with CBT followed by SDB treatment and achieved an average outcome equivalent to curative status. Improvements were large for each treatment phase; however, of 17 patients, only 8 attained a nonclinical level of insomnia after CBT compared with 15 patients after SDB therapy was added. Self-reported insomnia indices also improved markedly, and self-reported SDB therapy compliance was high. In one small sample of chronic insomnia patients with SDB, objective measures of insomnia, arousal, and sleep improved during one night of CPAP titration. In a second small sample, validated measures of insomnia, sleep quality, and sleep impairment demonstrated clinical cures or near-cures after combined CBT and SDB therapies. These pilot results suggest a potential value in researching the pathophysiological relationships between SDB and chronic insomnia, which may be particularly relevant to patients with refractory insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15026935/"}

The DSM-IV-TR paradigm, however, has not been validated with objective sleep assessment technology, incorporated nosological constructs from the field of sleep disorders medicine, or adequately addressed the potential for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) sleep problems to manifest as primary, physical disorders, requiring independent medical assessments and therapies. This paradigm may limit understanding of sleep problems in PTSD by promulgating such terms as \"insomnia related to another mental disorder,\" a.k.a. \"psychiatric insomnia.\" Emerging evidence invites a broader comorbidity perspective, based on recent findings that post-traumatic sleep disturbance frequently manifests with the combination of insomnia and a higher-than-expected prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). In this model of complex sleep disturbance, the underlying sleep pathophysiology interacts with PTSD and related psychiatric distress; and this relationship appears very important as demonstrated by improvement in insomnia, nightmares, and post-traumatic stress with successful SDB treatment, independent of psychiatric interventions. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment in PTSD patients with SDB reduced electroencephalographic arousals and sleep fragmentation, which are usually attributed to central nervous system or psychophysiological processes. Related findings and clinical experience suggest that other types of chronic insomnia may also be related to SDB. We hypothesize that an arousal-based mechanism, perhaps initiated by post-traumatic stress and/or chronic insomnia, may promote the development of SDB in a trauma survivor and perhaps other patients with chronic insomnia. We discuss potential neurohormonal pathways and neuroanatomatical sites that may be involved in this proposed interaction between insomnia and SDB.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12524572/"}

Sleep (and vigilance) problems are often included in the descriptive definition or in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, if anxiety may cause sleep disturbances, it is also known that sleep deprivation may produce symptoms which fall within the symptom complex of anxiety. In this paper, some of the methodological issues encountered when studying sleep and anxiety are discussed. Polygraphic recordings of sleep in anxious patients have consistently shown an increased sleep latency and, quite often, also exhibited a reduced sleep time, a reduced total sleep time, less slow-wave sleep, a greater arousal index and an increased duration of wakefulness during sleep. From our own study, we also report anomalies of the first night cycle in anxious poor sleepers who are otherwise indistinguishable from normal controls (with regard to the 'classical' sleep parameters). We have also observed the large interindividual variability of numbers of sleep parameters in anxious people. The question of a potential heterogeneity of the studied groups with regard to their clinical presentation as well as their sleep profile has been raised through our research as well. It is apparent that strategies for exploring the source of the potential heterogeneity of anxiety disorders are still needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7799257/"}

In particular, the CF is found to be more useful tool than the MI for detection of insomnia when the power spectral density estimations of sleep stages are provided by the Burg Method.

Because fronto-striatal networks could well play a role in sleep, arousal regulation and executive functioning, the present series of studies used an executive task to evaluate fronto-striatal functioning in disturbed sleep. Patients with insomnia showed reduced recruitment of the head of the left caudate nucleus during executive functioning, which was not secondary to altered performance or baseline perfusion. Individual differences in caudate recruitment were associated with hyper-arousal severity. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis suggested that attenuated input from a projecting orbitofrontal area with reduced grey matter density contributes to altered caudate recruitment in patients with insomnia. Attenuated caudate recruitment persisted after successful treatment of insomnia, warranting evaluation as a potential vulnerability trait. A similar selective reduction in caudate recruitment could be elicited in participants without sleep complaints by slow-wave sleep fragmentation, providing a model to facilitate investigation of the causes and consequences of insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24285642/"}

Although insomnia disorder is defined in diagnostic systems as a subjective complaint about sleep, this understanding is not consistently applied in clinical settings. There remains a lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms underlying subjective sleep complaints and associated daytime impairments. This systematic umbrella review of meta-analyses aimed to compare subjective and objective health-related variables between patients with insomnia disorder and controls, characterizing insomnia comprehensively. After a systematic literature search, we included six meta-analyses comparing patients with insomnia disorder and controls in terms of subjective sleep (sleep diaries), objective sleep (polysomnography), peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cortisol, objective cognitive performance, blood pressure and EEG spectral power. The pattern of results suggests that differences between patients with insomnia disorder and healthy controls are largest and most consistent for subjective sleep. Objective between-group effect sizes were largest for unspecific stress markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cortisol. Variables expected to be abnormal in those with objective sleep deprivation, such as objective attention and alertness, showed minimal group differences. Also in terms of sleep, effect sizes for subjective variables were consistently larger than those for objective variables. Critical appraisal of the quality of the included meta-analyses using the AMSTAR 2 tool suggested moderate overall confidence in the results, whereby shortcomings in several critical domains such as pre-registration of the study protocol and justification for the inclusion of individual studies have been identified. Our findings highlight that insomnia disorder is characterized by large reductions in subjective sleep quality, in the absence of large objective alterations.

MLT production then commences, becomes circadian, and reaches its highest nocturnal blood levels between the ages of one to three years. During the remainder of childhood, nocturnal peak levels drop progressively by 80%. In adults, these levels show an additional drop of some 10%, mainly during senescence. The large drop in serum MLT during childhood is probably the result of the increase in size of the human body, despite a constant MLT production after infancy. The additional decline of MLT with higher age may be due to a yet unidentified physiological mechanism accompanying senescence. The biological significance of these MLT alterations remains unknown. Since the discovery of MLT, an immediate sedative action of this hormone has been known. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that MLT indeed exerts a sleep-promoting action by accelerating sleep initiation, improving sleep maintenance, and marginally altering sleep architecture. The potential of MLT in the treatment of insomnia is being explored, and the results are promising. Although in most of these studies pharmacological dosages of MLT have been used, preliminary data suggest that similar effects can also be achieved by physiological hormone concentrations. The latter observation raises the question of whether MLT might be involved in the physiological control of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9951620/"}

Nocturnal traffic noise with an intensity of 45-65 dB(A) induced sleep disturbances characterized by an increase in intermittent wakefulness and stage 1 and the number of nocturnal awakenings as well as by a decrease of spindle and REM sleep stages. Subjectively, a decrease of deep sleep and increase of light sleep and middle insomnia was reported. Upon awakening in the morning, mood was significantly deteriorated. The new benzodiazepine OX-373 attenuated the above-described traffic noise-induced changes and produced even oppositional alterations, such as a decrease in stage 1, number of awakenings and stage shifts while increasing stage 2. The drug alone decreased the number of awakenings and stage 1 and augmented stage 4 as compared with placebo, which was subjectively felt as an increase in deep sleep and as a decrease of light sleep, early and middle insomnia. In the morning, there were no signs of 'hangover', which was confirmed also by psychometry. Nor were there any clinically relevant alterations in blood pressure and pulse. Thus, our studies confirmed earlier pharmaco-EEG and psychometric investigations predicting OX-373 as well-tolerated anxiolytic sedative, and suggested further that traffic noise could eventually be utilized as an experimental provocative technique in order to induce a standardized sleep disturbance for early clinical drug evaluation of potentially hypnotic substances.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6118840/"}

Several questionnaires that measure sleep-related cognitions have been developed and there are indications of conceptual overlap between different cognitive constructs and the questions used to operationalize them. This study examines the convergent validity of three established questionnaires measuring cognitive processes in insomnia: the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-10), and the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS-C). Another objective was to explore how a briefer scale can be structured as well as to investigate this scale's ability to predict incident and persistent insomnia compared to the established scales. 2333 participants from the general population completed surveys on insomnia symptoms and cognitive processes at baseline and 18 months later. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the scales' conceptual overlap as well as distinctive factors. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to investigate the underlying factor structure of the items from the APSQ, the DBAS-10 and the PSAS-C. This analysis formed the basis of the creation of a new short scale: Sleep Worry 7. Binary logistic regressions were used to assess all scales' abilities to predict incident and persistent insomnia. The overlap between the three scales was neither large enough to conclude that they are measuring the same construct, nor could it be confirmed that they measure three distinct questionnaire-specific cognitive processes within insomnia. The brief scale created within this study was able to predict persistent insomnia at similar levels to the three established scales combined, indicating that it captures important cognitions involved in the maintenance of insomnia. Measuring sleep-related cognitions with fewer items might be beneficial in both clinical contexts and research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40451058/"}

Insomnia is associated with poorer disease outcomes, cognitive impairment and HIV-associated dementia. However there is limited data characterizing the type of sleep disturbances, and the cause. Previous studies report conflicting results, and observed changes in the distribution of REM and SWS were hypothesized to result from co-morbid mood disorders, although this is not established. We carried out this study to determine if there are differences in polysomnographic (PSG) sleep data in age-, sex- and Axis I diagnoses- matched HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients. Eighteen HIV-seropositive insomniacs were matched to HIV-seronegative insomniacs based on age, sex and Axis I diagnoses. Participants spent 2 consecutive nights in a sleep lab recording of PSG data. Multivariate analysis revealed an overall significant match-by-variable interaction (p=0.0126). Follow-up analysis show that compared to HIV-seronegative insomnia controls, HIV-seropositive insomniacs have significantly longer SOL, 8% decreased sleep efficiency, and 8-10% decreased time spent in REM sleep (p's<0.05). This study provides preliminary evidence that even after accounting for differences in age, sex and psychiatric diagnoses, HIV-seropositive patients with insomnia have significantly worse sleep than HIV-seronegative patients with insomnia. Unlike what previous authors have proposed, our results do not support the view that comorbid psychiatric disorders like depression are responsible for the observed differences in PSG findings and the greater incidence of insomnia, in HIV-seropositive patients when compared with other groups of insomnia patients. This suggests the presence of other etiologies including neuronal damage, psychosocial stressors, or comorbid medical conditions.

The ideal drug should induce sleep within 30 min and maintain a normal pattern of sleep for 6 to 8h, with little or no residual effects the next morning. Clinically, 4 types of insomnia can be distinguished: prolonged latency, 1 to 2 long periods of wakefulness, frequent short awakenings and early morning awakening. An ultra-short-acting drug (2 to 3h), such as triazolam, is useful for prolonged latency. Temazepam, lormetazepam and loprazolam provide more prolonged effects (8 to 10h). These benzodiazepines are not free of daytime adverse effects, particularly drowsiness, dependency potential, rebound insomnia and habituation to the drug effect. Zopiclone and zolpidem are new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics that are as effective as benzodiazepines but without the problems associated with the latter.

Primary outcome measures were the seven subscales of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), PSQI global score, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Secondary outcome measures were physical performance (single leg stand, timed chair rise, 50-foot speed walk) and 12-item short form (SF-12) physical and mental summary scores.

The efficacy of providing feedback related to the accuracy of participants' perception on later judgements of tiredness was further examined. Forty participants, 20 with DSM-5-defined insomnia disorder and 20 normal-sleepers, participated. The perception of one's own facial appearance of tiredness was assessed twice over two consecutive days using a visual task whereby participants indicated when a morphing image of their face represented their current level of tiredness. Visual and verbal feedback, related to participants' degree of misperception, was provided on completion of Day 1 testing. Overall, individuals with insomnia perceived their own face as significantly more tired than a baseline neutral photograph was, whereas normal-sleepers perceived themselves as appearing more alert. This pattern of results was only apparent on Day 1. Although no groupÂ ÃÂ day interaction was established, mean scores suggest an improvement in perception on Day 2 amongst individuals with insomnia only. These findings suggest that individuals with insomnia exhibit a misperception of their facial attributes of tiredness, interpreting them in a disorder-consistent manner.

A total of 1,136,583 adolescents aged 11-18 years answered a standardized questionnaire assessing frequency of insomnia symptoms, tiredness and school performance. A clear approximately twofold increasing trend in insomnia symptoms and tiredness was found from the mid-1990s to the end of the 2000s. The increase was evident in all participating age groups and in both genders. After 2008, the increase seems to have stopped.

This manuscript describes our perspective on some of these challenges. Based on the literature that maladaptive cognitions predict low adherence and that high levels of cognitive-emotional hyperarousal may be associated with poor outcomes, we propose added focus on cognitive therapy strategies in CBT-I. Specifically, we propose broadening the range of traditional cognitive therapy strategies, utilizing acceptance-based strategies, and fuller integration of the broadened range of cognitive strategies into CBT-I throughout the course of treatment. We also highlight a few other promising emerging approaches to enhance the impact of CBT-I. These include involving partners to promote adherence with CBT-I treatment recommendations, using culturally relevant treatment adaptations to increase retention of patients in treatment, and using strategies for timely identification of barriers to engagement. We propose broadening the public health impact of CBT-I by integrating support for reduction in long-term use of hypnotic sleep medications, which is in line with current medical guidelines. We advocate for a case conceptualization-based approach for implementing CBT-I in a patient-centered manner, flexibly, yet with fidelity, to enhance its impact by addressing the factors above. For increasing the reach of CBT-I, we discuss the need to train more clinicians and ways to combine therapist and digital deliveries of CBT-I, highlighting stepped care strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37903637/"}

Forty-seven adults with chronic widespread pain and insomnia (mean age = 46.00, standard deviation = 13.88, 89% women) completed 14 daily diaries measuring sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time (TST), as well as Holter monitor assessments of heart rate variability (measuring physiological arousal), and magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple regressions examined whether average SOL, wake time after sleep onset, or TST were independently or interactively (with arousal/heart rate variability) associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and left/right hippocampus gray matter volumes. Shorter TST was associated with lower right hippocampus volume. TST also interacted with arousal in its association with right hippocampal volume, Specifically, shorter TST was associated with lower volume at highest and average arousal levels. SOL interacted with arousal in its association with anterior cingulate cortex volume, such that, among individuals with lowest arousal, longer SOL was associated with lower volume. Preliminary findings highlight the interactive roles of physiological arousal and insomnia symptoms in associations with neural structure in chronic widespread pain and insomnia.

This multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluate the effectiveness of a moderate to high intensity physical activity program (45Â min, 3 times per week), lasting 12 weeks, in minimizing insomnia, sleep disturbances, anxiety/depression, fatigue, and pain, and in enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness. Patients with breast cancer be recruited from six hospitals in France and randomly allocated to either the \"training\" or the \"control\" group. Baseline assessments include questionnaires [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)], home polysomnography (PSG), and 7-day actigraphy coupled with completion of a sleep diary. Assessments are repeated at the end of training program and at six-month follow-up. This clinical trial will provide additional evidence regarding the effectiveness of physical exercise in minimizing insomnia during and after chemotherapy. If shown to be effective, exercise intervention programs will be welcome addition to the standard program of care offered to patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.

In particular, the review will examine the experiences related to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with depression have insomnia, which is associated with substantial personal and social costs. Despite these costs, insomnia is often underdiagnosed and viewed as a symptom that disappears when depression abates. However, research indicates that insomnia and depression are overlapping but distinct disorders. Thus, it is important to treat both disorders simultaneously, as improving sleep may, in turn, ease core symptoms of depression. Optimal care and treatment rely on patients' experiences of insomnia and their attitudes toward treatment options. Therefore, it is important to synthesize evidence of patients' experiences of living with insomnia, and the experiences of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions, to understand the consequences of insomnia and to optimize sleep interventions. This systematic review will synthesize qualitative studies exploring how adults with depression experience living with insomnia and how they experience pharmacological or non-pharmacological sleep interventions. Both inpatient and outpatient populations will be considered.

Male rats were randomly assigned in a crossover design to six treatment groups and electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes attached. Three groups were exposed to a cage inhabited by another male rat for a week and the other three groups received a clean cage. Prior to cage change, rats were given either no drug, vehicle control or Neurexan. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, REM sleep, and waking were assessed manually via EEG recordings. Group means were compared for sleep latency and for the 2Â h after cage change for: time in each state, state-specific episode duration/frequency, in addition to NREM delta, gamma and REM theta EEG spectral power. Rats administered Neurexan fell asleep faster than vehicle-treated rats and spent less time awake with shorter, albeit more waking episodes and increased NREM episodes after dirty cage exposure. Neurexan-treated rats given dirty cages were not statistically different on any outcomes from Neurexan-treated rats given clean cages, thereby mitigating the stressor. In the EEG power spectra analysed, changes between treatment groups were not detected.

Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by enrollment, retention, attendance, fidelity, survey ratings, and exit interviews. Insomnia severity (secondary outcome), sleep quality, sleep diaries, and fatigue were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up using linear mixed models. The SSP included targeted content and clinician-led, virtual delivery to enhance patient centeredness and access. Benchmarks were met for enrollment (56% enrolled/eligible), retention (SSP, 90%; EUC, 95%), attendance (100%), and fidelity (95%).

Although chronotype, emotional disturbance, and insomnia vulnerability are important factors for patients with insomnia in general, their effects on shift nurses are unknown. This study explores the relationships between the sleep quality of shift nurses and the variables of chronotype, emotional disturbance, and insomnia vulnerability. A survey was conducted with 398 shift nurses in a medical center. Chronotype, emotional disturbance, insomnia vulnerability, and sleep quality were evaluated using the Smith Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Rating Scale, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. On the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 70.1% of the participants scored higher than 5. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, together with night shift work (b [SE] = 1.05 [0.35], p = .003), higher levels of emotional disturbance (b [SE] = 0.30 [0.05], p < .001) and higher insomnia vulnerability (b [SE] = 0.18 [0.03], p < .001) were predictors of poor sleep quality and that chronotype was not a predictor of poor sleep quality. The multiple mediator model indicated that emotional disturbance significantly mediated an indirect effect of evening chronotype preference on poor subjective sleep quality (one subscale of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). In addition to shift patterns, emotional disturbance and high insomnia vulnerability are factors that may be used to identify shift nurses who face a higher risk of sleep disturbance.

We collected overnight sleep data via polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep data via a morning questionnaire (self-evaluated) and MSLT data via four 20-min naps over 8 h. Subjects included 122 PIPs and 48 GSCs. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time/objective sleep time Ã 100%. PIPs showed a significant difference (P < 0.001) between sleep time, as determined by PSG (387.8 Â± 100 min) and self-report (226.3 Â± 160 min), but no difference was obtained for GSCs (440.6 Â± 53 versus 435.4 Â± 65 min). The means for sleep perception were 56.4 Â± 38.8% for the PIPs and 99.3 Â± 13.6% for the GSCs (P < 0.001). In the PIPs group, weak but statistically significant negative correlations (r: -0.20 to -0.25) were found for MSLT versus sleep perception and versus self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time. Compared to PIPs with low scores on the MSLT, those with high scores had less sleep perception (%), less self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time and greater sleep misperception time. GSCs did not show significant correlations between MSLT and sleep measures or differences in comparisons between individuals with high and low scores on the MSLT.

The data are drawn from the youth@hordaland study, a large population-based study conducted in 2012, linked to the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) (nâ=â9077). Psychiatric disorders were based on clinical diagnoses from the NPR, while insomnia, delayed sleep-wake-phase disorder (DSWPD), and other sleep problems/patterns were assessed by self-report questionnaires from youth@hordaland. The prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among adolescents seeking mental health services was 0.6%, yielding an estimated prevalence of 0.07% of the population. However, questionnaire-based measurement of insomnia from the youth@hordaland study indicated that insomnia was highly prevalent across disorders in comparison to a reference group of adolescents who were not within mental health care. Insomnia ranged from 29% among adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (PRâ=â1.79; 95% CI 1.41-2.29) to 48% among adolescents diagnosed with depression (PRâ=â2.53, 95% CI 2.19-2.92).

In this study, we investigated the effect of electroacupuncture on sleep quality of chronic insomniacs and the safety of electroacupuncture therapy. Four courses of electroacupuncture treatment were applied to 47 patients. With pre-treatment and post-treatment self-control statistical method, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores were used for evaluating sleep quality. Polysomnogram was used for detecting insomniacs' changes in sleep architecture. The safety of electroacupuncture was evaluated by monitoring the self-designed adverse events and side effects during treatment and post-treatment. Electroacupuncture considerably improved insomniacs' sleep quality and social function during the daytime. Electroacupuncture had certain repairing effect on the disruption in sleep architecture. At the same time, electroacupuncture prolonged slow wave sleep (SWS) time and relatively rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) time. There was no hangover, addiction or decrements in vigilance during the daytime (incidence rate was 0). However, insomnia rebound rate was about 23% within one month. These results suggest that electroacupuncture has beneficial effect on sleep quality improvement in the patients with chronic insomnia, which may be associated with repairing sleep architecture, reconstructing sleep continuity, as well as prolonging SWS time and REM sleep time.

The current study aimed to test predictions, informed by the Integrated Motivational-Volitional (IMV) Model of Suicidal Behavior, concerning the role of feelings of defeat and entrapment within the sleep-suicide relationship. Volunteers aged 15 to 17 years (n = 1,045) from Scottish secondary schools completed an anonymous self-report survey assessing insomnia symptoms, nightmares, suicidal ideation, depressive symptomology, and feelings of defeat and entrapment. Both insomnia symptoms and nightmares were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation (independent of depression). Perceptions of both defeat and entrapment were elevated in young people who reported clinically salient insomnia and/or nightmares, relative to those who did not. The relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation was fully mediated by perceptions of defeat and entrapment, whereas nightmares were indirectly associated with suicidal ideation through perceptions of defeat and entrapment. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the psychological mechanisms linking sleep disturbance and suicidality by highlighting the role of defeat and entrapment.

Although previous studies have suggested that individuals who have high sleep reactivity may be resistant to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effects, there have been no studies that have investigated this empirically. This study explored differential treatment responses in CBT-I based on sleep reactivity levels. Participants for this study were nineteen insomnia patients who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder. All participants received four weekly sessions of structured cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Individuals completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Korean version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale-16 (DBAS-16), the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE) and a sleep diary. Participants were classified into two groups based on sleep reactivity level (high and low sleep reactivity). Following treatment, significant changes were found for ISI, K-CESD-R, DBAS-16 and FIRST scores, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, sleep quality and feeling refreshed upon awakening in both groups. Improvements in sleep efficiency was lower in the high sleep reactivity group compared to the low sleep reactivity group. No differences in ISI, K-CESD-R, DBAS-16 scores, and stress event frequency during the treatment duration were found between groups. These findings suggest that sleep reactivity level may be an important factor that affects treatment outcome of CBT-I. Furthermore, the results may suggest that individual response to stress events are more important than the stressor itself.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754367/"}

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study in which older adults with insomnia complaints (cases, n=100) were compared with older adults without insomnia complaints (controls, n=100) using dual-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography, study questionnaires and 7 days of at-home actigraphy and sleep diaries. Cases were noted to have reduced objective total sleep time compared with controls (25.8âÂ±â8.56âmin, P=0.003). This was largely due to increased wakefulness after sleep onset, and not increased sleep latency. When participants with sleep-related breathing disorder or periodic limb movement disorder were excluded, the polysomnography total sleep time difference became even larger.

However, the evidence for increasing sleep deprivation comes from surveys using habitual sleep questions. An alternative source of information regarding sleep behaviour is time-use studies. This paper investigates changes in sleep time in the UK using the two British time-use studies that allow measuring \"time in bed not asleep\" separately from \"actual sleep time\". Based upon the studies presented here, people in the UK sleep today 43Â min more than they did in the 1970s because they go to bed earlier (~30Â min) and they wake up later (~15Â min). The change in sleep duration is driven by night sleep and it is homogeneously distributed across the week. The former results apply to men and women alike, and to individuals of all ages and employment status, including employed individuals, the presumed major victims of the sleep deprivation epidemic and the 24/7 society. In fact, employed individuals have experienced a reduction in short sleeping of almost 4 percentage points, from 14.9% to 11.0%.

Twenty-two adults with interepisode BD type I and insomnia were drawn from a subset of a National Institute of Mental Health funded study. Participants were randomly allocated to CBTI-BP (n = 11) or psychoeducation (n = 11). Participants completed a sleep diary, rated self-report measures of mania and depression, and provided samples assayed for interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor soluble receptor 2 (sTNF-R2). IL-6 was associated with mania symptoms (rs = 0.44, p = .041) and total sleep time (rs = -0.49, p = .026). IL-6 was related to depression symptoms at the trend level (rs = 0.43, p = .052). sTNF-R2 was not significantly related to mood or sleep measures. From pretreatment to posttreatment, CBTI-BP compared with psychoeducation was associated with a nonsignificant, large effect size decrease in IL-6 (z = -1.61, p = .13, d = -0.78) and a nonsignificant, small-medium effect size decrease in sTNF-R2 (z = -0.79, p = .44, d = -0.38).

The participants, 383 university students, filled out a package of psychological tools, including the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Night Eating Questionnaire, and the Eating Attitude Test. One way analysis of variance was used to investigate the relationship of chronotypes with scale scores, and mediation regression analysis was used to investigate the indirect effects of night eating symptoms on disordered eating attitudes. Insomnia and night eating scores of the participants varied statistically according to chronotypes, and both insomnia and night eating scores were associated with the evening type. Findings show that night eating symptoms have a direct effect on the chronotype differences and insomnia and an indirect effect on disordered eating attitudes, by increasing insomnia scores.

Those with propensity to late meal patterns, heightened levels of cortisol in awakening response and low robustness of rest-activity rhythm at baseline had higher risks for later depression. Among insomnia subtypes, difficulty initiating sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep predicted future depression. Notably, persistent insomnia at baseline contributed to more than two-fold risk of incident depression compared to insomnia.

Data from 113 insomnia patients were included in the analysis of the present study, with the reduction rate of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) served as the overall clinical efficacy evaluation. First, the feature selection was performed using univariate logistic regression and Boruta algorithm, and the prediction accuracy of the three boosting algorithms - adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) - was compared for selecting the best algorithm. The grid search and ten-fold cross-validation were used to optimize the hyperparameters of the best algorithm. The optimal dataset partitioning method was selected using stratified random partitioning, and the best cut-off value was determined based on the Youden index. The predictive model for the therapeutic efficacy was constructed and its performance was evaluated. Finally, SHAP (shapley additive explanation) analysis was used to visually interpret the model. The features included in the model were the proportion of stage N1 to total sleep duration, the proportion of stage N2 to total sleep duration, R latency from lights out, stage N2 latency from lights out, the awake time after sleep onset, PSQI sleep efficiency score, and the presence of an old tongue (a tongue picture of a dry, rough texture and an old body).

Finally, we created receiver operating characteristic curves to test the accuracy of each identified criterion. Individuals with insomnia significantly differed from controls on all sleep indices (p < .001). Differentiation between individuals with insomnia from controls was optimal for terminal wakefulness (>15 minutes, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83), wake after sleep onset (cutoff >20 minutes, AUC = 0.81), total sleep time (<390 minutes, AUC = 0.80), and particularly sleep efficiency (<87.5%, AUC = 0.92, sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.90). Time in bed was the least differentiating variable (<500 minutes, AUC = 0.57). The quantitative criteria of the sleep diary in this study agree with the few available data in the literature. This confirms that the sleep diary could be a useful screening tool for assessing patients with primary insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25905662/"}

This study aimed to determine the potential discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep assessments, including the latter made by physicians, by analyzing a 421-participant dataset in Japan comprising multiple nights of in-home sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) data and questionnaire responses on sleep habits or subjective experiences. We employed logistic regression models to examine which subjective and objective sleep parameters physicians are paying attention to when assessing sleep insufficiency, insomnia, sleep quality, and sleep apnea. Questionnaire responses, including subjective sleep assessments, exhibited poor performance predicting physicians' assessments, whereas objective data demonstrated good predictive performance, indicating a discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep assessments. Although the in-home sleep EEG measurements had minimal first night effects, incorporating measurements over multiple nights can improve the detection of objective insomnia. Moreover, we found that participants with severe sleep insufficiency overestimated their sleep duration, whereas those with subjective insomnia but without objective insomnia underestimated it. Additionally, subjective sleep quality reflected sleep efficiency but not the frequency of short awakenings or objective sleep depth. In particular, the effects of apnea on objective sleep quality were not subjectively perceived. Collectively, our findings suggest that subjective sleep assessments alone are insufficient for evaluating sleep health and that health checkups and advice based on sleep EEG measurements may be useful in improving sleep habits and for early detection of sleep disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819218/"}

There is a strong association between trauma-related nightmares and insomnia with higher rates of physical illness, mental distress, and suicide among PTSD patients. Prazosin, an Î±1-adrenergic antagonist, has shown mixed results in treating these sleep disturbances. This study aims to evaluate the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on insomnia, nightmares, and global PTSD symptoms, and to examine variables that might influence this effect. We conducted a meta-analysis and a novel meta-regression analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing prazosin to placebo in samples of patients with PTSD. Data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and PTSD Pubs. Examined variables were age, gender, military/civilian status, prazosin dose, treatment duration, baseline symptom severity, use of antidepressants, use of benzodiazepines (BDZ), prevalence of depression, and alcohol use disorder. Ten RCTs with 648 patients were included. Analysis revealed prazosin significantly improved insomnia (SMDÂ =Â -0.654, pÂ =Â 0.043) and nightmares (SMDÂ =Â -0.641, pÂ =Â 0.025), but not overall PTSD symptoms (SMDÂ =Â -0.428, pÂ =Â 0.077). Unexpectedly, higher BDZ use was associated with greater improvement in insomnia (Î²Â =Â -0.046; pÂ =Â 0.01) and PTSD severity (Î²Â =Â -0.037; pÂ =Â 0.004). These findings suggest that prazosin effectively reduces insomnia and nightmares in PTSD patients. Benzodiazepine co-administration seems to enhance prazosin's efficacy, suggesting that the addition of prazosin might allow for a reduction of BDZ doses in these patients. Further research should empirically test the efficacy of prazosin alone versus prazosin combined with BDZ to confirm these findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39828080/"}

Recent proposals suggested that insomnia with objective short-sleep duration (TSTâ<â7Â h) is associated with impaired inhibitory function, leading to a dysregulation of cortical inhibition, which may underlie its prevalence. This study investigated the status of impaired response inhibition in these two phenotypes and examined the potential different effect of response inhibition training on these two phenotypes. Twenty-two healthy controls (HC) and eighty-one patients with ID were recruited, with IDs further categorized into ISSD and INSD (with TSTââ¥â7Â h). Clinical behavior measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), objective sleep characteristics assessed by all-night sleep electroencephalography, and the accuracy of NoGo trials in the Go/NoGo task were compared among the three groups. Subsequently, within each ID phenotype, participants were divided into training and blank control sub-groups. The two training sub-groups completed Adaptive Go/NoGo training task (Through adaptive difficulty adjustment, the task trains participants' inhibitory control) 15 times over 3Â weeks, and all IDs were assessed using sleep-related subjective and objective measures and Go/NoGo task before and after the intervention. ISSD patients exhibited significantly longer sleep latency (pâ=â0.003) compared to HC, while wakefulness duration (pâ=â0.004) and light sleep duration (pâ<â0.001) were shorter than INSD. No significant differences in objective sleep characteristics were observed between INSD and HC. Following adaptive training, the ISSD training sub-group showed decreased scores in PSQI (pâ=â0.039) and ISI (pâ=â0.053) compared to their blank control sub-group. In the INSD groups, both training and blank control sub-groups demonstrated reductions in PSQI (pâ<â0.001), ISI (pâ<â0.001), and the cognitive arousal sub-dimension of the PSAS scores (pâ=â0.003) in the post-session test. Impaired response inhibition is a characteristic of ISSD, potentially indicating dysfunctional cortical inhibition, whereas INSD pathogenesis may be related to cognitive-emotional arousal. Response inhibition training effectively alleviates sleep problems in ISSD. These findings provide new insights for developing precise intervention strategies in ID.

Ten English (PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL etc.) and five Chinese (CNKI, WANFANG etc.) databases were searched and the validity of the eligible studies was critically appraised. Thirty-two eligible randomized controlled trials of moderate to high quality which employed polysomnography, actigraphy, or self-assessment sleep quality tools were included. We conducted a meta-analysis using a random effects model with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) as the primary outcome measure (968 adult patients, 13 trials) for trials investigating the effects of traditional Chinese medicine acupressure compared with standard and sham treatments. We performed subgroup analyses to detect sources of heterogeneity, identify the use of acupoints in different populations and explore the contributions of PSQI domains to the total score change. Comparison with the sham group (7 trials with 385 patients) yielded low heterogeneity and an overall effect of 13%-19% improvement in the PSQI score (MDÂ =Â -3.41, 95% CIÂ -4.08,Â -2.75; I<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 12%).

This study examined how insomnia changes over time in a randomized control trial of two integrated PTSD and AUD treatments. Participants were 119 adult veterans (90 % male) seeking treatment for AUD and PTSD at a large urban VA. Participants were randomized to either COPE (integrated treatment using prolonged exposure) or Seeking Safety (integrated therapy using cognitive behavioral, interpersonal techniques and case management). Assessments were done at pre- and post-treatment and include: Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Timeline Follow-back calendar-assisted interview for AU, insomnia severity index (ISI), sleep diary and actigraphy for 7 days. ISI showed significant decreases, but a majority remained above the clinical cutoff at post-treatment. Wake after sleep onset decreased, but only by 8 min, remaining above clinical thresholds. Decreases in PTSD, but not in heavy drinking, predicted change in ISI. No significant changes were observed in other sleep variables measured. Findings suggested some statistical improvements in sleep quality, but sleep indices remained above clinical cut-offs.

A standardized scenario of acute sleep onset insomnia and a scoring system was used in each pharmacy. Main outcome measures included supply/non supply of an over the counter sleep aid to the simulated patient, and scores for pharmacists for skills in eliciting information prior to supply of medication (Pre Supply Score), counseling about medication (Supply Score), or about sleep (Sleep Score). Of the 100 pharmacies, upon simulated patient presentation, 96% supplied a product, the remaining 4% referred to a physician. Non-pharmacological advice was provided in 42%. Pharmacists scored highly on advice provided with supply of a medication (Supply scores/4, 3.1 Â± 0.9), but lower on skills in eliciting information prior to supply (Pre-supply score/8, 3.6 Â± 1.9) and sleep related counselling (Sleep Score/9, 2.1 Â± 1.7).

The study examines and explores opinion on the optimal contents and format for an occupational therapy intervention to improve poor sleep in this population. Views of clinical and academic topic experts (n = 56), were elicited, examined and explored in three rounds, views from previous rounds being presented back to participants in subsequent rounds. Participants with relevant personal experience (n = 26) then rated and commented on suggestions, with a focus on acceptability. Descriptive statistics and graphs of ratings were triangulated with qualitative content analysis of free-text. Participants emphasised the central importance of intervention personalisation, although the manner and extent of personalisation suggested varied. Many components and domains were acknowledged as important, with the challenge being how to keep such an intervention simple, brief, and feasible for end-users, for sustainable implementation. The strongest consensus was to address evening routine, daytime activity, and environmental interventions. Relaxation, mindfulness, thermoregulation, sensory factors, and cognitive or psychological approaches were rated as less important. There was disagreement on whether to include time in bed restriction, and how to address napping, as well as how far to address medication timing. Clinicians and researchers advocated some version of stimulus control, but participants with personal experience reported low levels of acceptability for this, describing entirely negative experiences using 'the 15-minute rule' (part of stimulus control).

The data supported our prediction that adolescents with high PA levels would have longer TST, fewer wakening at night (WASO), fewer symptoms of insomnia, and higher sleep quality. However, gender influenced this pattern of results in that significant findings were only found between high self-reported PA levels and shorter perceived sleep onset latency (SOL). Though self-reported PA levels were a better predictor of good sleep than objectively assessed PA levels, gender was associated with sleep complaints; females reported more sleep complaints.

It has severe consequences and is associated with increased rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Despite numerous therapeutic options, a great number of depressed patients do not achieve full remission. In addition, despite good short-term outcomes, long-term therapeutic results remain disappointing and associated with a poor prognosis, raising significant concern in terms of public health. Impaired sleep - especially insomnia - may be at least partly responsible for this problem. Very close relationships between major depressive disorder (MDD) and sleep disorders have been observed. In particular, residual symptoms of sleep disturbance in a remitted patient may predict a relapse of the disease. However, most currently available antidepressants do not always take into consideration the sleep disturbances of depressed patients; some agents long used in clinical practice even appear to worsen them by their sleep-inhibiting properties. But some other new medications were shown to relieve early sleep disturbance in addition to alleviating other depression-related symptoms. This positive impact should promote compliance with medication and psychological treatments, and increase daytime performance and overall functioning. Complete remission of MDD appears therefore to depend on the relief of sleep disturbances, a core symptom of MDD that should be taken into consideration and treated early in depressed patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19921968/"}

Strategies targeting individuals at elevated risk for MDD may guide effective preventive care. Insomnia is a reliable precursor to depression, preceding half of all incident and relapse cases. Thus, insomnia may serve as a useful entry point for preventing MDD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia, but widespread implementation is limited by a shortage of trained specialists. Innovative stepped-care approaches rooted in primary care can increase access to CBT-I and reduce rates of MDD. We propose a large-scale stepped-care clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with clinician-led CBT-I for insomnia and the prevention of MDD incidence and relapse. Specifically, our care model uses digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) as a first-line intervention to increase care access and reduce the need for specialist resources. Our proposal also adds clinician-led CBT-I for patients who do not remit with first-line intervention and need a more personalized approach from specialty care. We will evaluate negative repetitive thinking as a potential treatment mechanism by which dCBT-I and CBT-I benefit insomnia and depression outcomes. This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination and implementation to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression.

We sought to understand these mechanisms by comparing changes in areaal homogeneity (ReHo) before and after treatment in PI patients and healthy controls (HC). Between November 2019 and November 2021, we recruited 17 primary insomnia patients (PI group) and 20 matched healthy controls (HC group) as study subjects from Zhaoqing First People's Hospital. Before electroacupuncture treatment, all participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) assessments. Resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted before and after two sessions of electroacupuncture at Shenmen and Neiguan acupoints. Before treatment, primary insomnia patients showed higher PSQI (Ï2=1.964; P = .017), HAMA (Ï2=2.016; P = .027), and HAMD scores (Ï2=2.367; P = .013) compared to healthy controls, and increased ReHo values were observed in the left amygdala, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, and left posterior cingulate gyrus in PI patients, while decreased ReHo values were found in the left posterior cingulate gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right precuneus. After treatment, ReHo values increased in the left superior frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right cingulate gyrus, while they decreased in the left amygdala and right angular gyrus. Primary insomnia disrupts brain areas in the default network, salience network, and parts of the affective cognitive network. Electroacupuncture at Shenmen and Neiguan acupoints partially activated impaired brain areas in patients with primary insomnia, leading to improvements in mental status and sleep quality. This offers a novel perspective for the clinical treatment of primary insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38064617/"}

The objectives of this systematic review were to evaluate the use of consumer sleep technology (wearable and mobile) in behavioral sleep medicine interventions, identify gaps in the literature and potential future directions. We completed a scoping review of studies conducted in adult populations that used consumer sleep tracking technology to deliver sleep-related interventions. Our initial search returned 4,538 articles and 14 articles met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results demonstrated that wearable devices are being used for two main purposes: 1. To deliver treatment for insomnia and 2. Sleep monitoring as part of overall wellness programs. Half of the articles reviewed (nÂ =Â 7) used consumer sleep technology in a cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. The majority of the studies reviewed (nÂ =Â 10) were fully digital, without human intervention, and only two small studies evaluated interventions delivered with and without a sleep tracking device. These studies demonstrate opportunities to utilize consumer sleep trackers in insomnia treatment and wellness programs, but most new and innovative interventions are in the early, feasibility stages.

We wanted to investigate whether a small dose of melatonin given daily, administered in the afternoon, could advance the sleep timing in teenagers. Twenty-one students, aged 14-19 yrs, with sleep-onset difficulties during school weeks were recruited. The study was a randomized, double blind, placebo (PL)-controlled crossover trial, lasting 5 wks. During the first 6 d in wks 2 and 4, the students received either PL or melatonin (1 mg) capsules between 16:30 and 18:00 h. During the first 6 d of wk 5, all students received melatonin. Wks 1 and 3 were capsule-free. In the last evening of each week and the following morning, the students produced saliva samples at home for later melatonin analysis. The samples were produced the same time each week, as late as possible in the evening and as early as possible in the morning. Both the student and one parent received automatic mobile text messages 15 min before saliva sampling times and capsule intake at agreed times. Diaries with registration of presumed sleep, subjective sleepiness during the day (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) and times for capsule intake and saliva samplings were completed each day. Primary analysis over 5 wks gave significant results for melatonin, sleep and KSS. Post hoc analysis showed that reported sleep-onset times were advanced after melatonin school weeks compared with PL school weeks (p < .005) and that sleep length was longer (p < .05). After the last melatonin school week, the students fell asleep 68 min earlier and slept 62 min longer each night compared with the baseline week. Morning melatonin values in saliva diminished compared with PL (p < .001) and evening values increased (p < .001), indicating a possible sleep phase advance. Compared with PL school weeks, the students reported less wake up (p < .05), less school daytime sleepiness (p < .05) and increased evening sleepiness (p < .005) during melatonin weeks. We conclude that a small dose of melatonin given daily, administered in the afternoon, could advance the sleep timing and make the students more alert during school days even if they continued their often irregular sleep habits during weekends.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23005039/"}

After a 7-night placebo (baseline) period, 615 adult patients were randomly assigned to receive, in double-blind fashion, I of 5 treatments (zaleplon, 5, 10, or 20 mg; zolpidem, 10 mg; or placebo) for 28 nights, followed by placebo treatment for 3 nights. Sleep latency, sleep maintenance, and sleep quality were determined from sleep questionnaires that patients completed each morning. The occurrence of rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects on discontinuation of treatment was also assessed. All levels of significance were p < or = .05. Median sleep latency was significantly lower with zaleplon, 10 and 20 mg, than with placebo during all 4 weeks of treatment and with zaleplon, 5 mg, for the first 3 weeks. Zaleplon, 20 mg, also significantly increased sleep duration compared with placebo in all but week 3 of the study. There was no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of 4 weeks of zaleplon treatment. Zolpidem, 10 mg, significantly decreased sleep latency, increased sleep duration, and improved sleep quality at most timepoints compared with placebo; however, after discontinuation of zolpidem treatment, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms was significantly greater than that with placebo and there was an indication of significant rebound insomnia for some patients in the zolpidem group compared with those in the placebo group. The frequency of adverse events in the active treatment groups did not differ significantly from that in the placebo group. Zaleplon is effective in the treatment of insomnia. In addition, zaleplon appears to provide a favorable safety profile, as indicated by the absence of rebound insomnia and withdrawal symptoms once treatment was discontinued.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10485636/"}

Because none of these items showed an optimal screening capacity, we concluded that it would be best to add a specific 0-10 sleep item to the ESAS-r. This study assessed the capacity of this ESAS-r-sleep item to screen for clinical insomnia in patients with various cancer types.

Improvements in sleep disturbance were noted in all studies, but only some studies showed statistical significance. This scoping review identified a relatively small number of relevant studies, involving a relatively small number of participants. Moreover, the studies involved very different interventions, with very different methodologies (including type/time of assessments).

Parameters indicating sleep fragmentation, such as number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and percentage of NREM1 were extracted from the polsysomnogram, as well as spectral power, microarousals and sleep spindle index. The correlation between these parameters during the first sleep cycle and the amount of misperceived sleep was assessed in the insomnia group. Additionally, we made a model of the minimum duration that a sleep fragment at sleep onset should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we fitted this model to subjective SOLs of both subject groups. Misperception of SOL was associated with increased percentage of NREM1 and more WASO during sleep cycle 1. For insomnia subjects, the best fit of modelled SOL with subjective SOL was found when assuming that sleep fragments shorter than 30Â min at sleep onset were perceived as wake. The model indicated that healthy subjects are less sensitive to sleep interruptions and perceive fragments of 10Â min or longer as sleep. Our findings suggest that sleep onset misperception is related to sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night.

The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic sleep intervention for patients with sleep problems comorbid to bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, or attention deficit disorders. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention improves sleep quality compared with a control group. The secondary hypotheses are that the intervention increases subjective and objective sleep efficiency, reduces sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, and severity of insomnia; and that it improves well-being, personal recovery, work ability, and consumption of sleep medication compared with a control group. The study is a randomized controlled trial enrolling 88 outpatients with bipolar disorder, major depression, or attention deficit disorder with symptoms of various sleep problems (insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, or hypersomnia).

Six studies eligible for meta-analyses showed a moderate effect of sleep interventions in reducing sleep disturbance (SMDÂ =Â -0.548 [CI:Â -0.837,Â -0.258]) at post-treatment, alongside a small effect in improving anxiety (SMDÂ =Â -0.226 [CI:Â -0.421,Â -0.031]) and depression (SMDÂ =Â -0.295 [CI:Â -0.513,Â -0.077]). Meta-regression examining study and intervention characteristics identified subpopulation (experiencing insomnia or not) as a significant moderator for effects on sleep (pÂ =Â 0.0003) and depression (pÂ =Â 0.0063), with larger effects in studies with participants experiencing insomnia. Comparison group type (active or passive) was also a significant moderator (pÂ =Â 0.0474), with larger effects on sleep in studies using passive comparison groups. Study type, delivery format, and intervention duration were not identified as significant moderators. At follow-ups, small but significant effects were sustained for anxiety and depression.

The existing literature focuses on the means, while the nature and correlates of sleep/wake IIV are not well understood. A systematic search of records in five major databases from inception to November 2014 identified 53 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined correlates of sleep/wake IIV in adults. Overall, this literature appeared unsystematic and post hoc, with under-developed theoretical frameworks and inconsistent methodologies. Correlates most consistently associated with greater IIV in one or more aspects of sleep/wake patterns were: younger age, non-White race/ethnicity, living alone, physical health conditions, higher body mass index, weight gain, bipolar and unipolar depression symptomatology, stress, and evening chronotype; symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep were associated with higher sleep/wake IIV, which was reduced following sleep interventions. The effects of experimentally reduced sleep/wake IIV on daytime functioning were inconclusive. In extending current understanding of sleep/wake patterns beyond the mean values, IIV should be incorporated as an additional dimension when sleep is examined across multiple days. Theoretical and methodological shortcomings in the existing literature, and opportunities for future research are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26588182/"}

Six full-time working adult samples were collected from civilian and military populations. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Single-factor and two-factor models were performed to evaluate the dimensionality of sleep disturbance using the 8b short form. Sleep duration and subjective health were examined as correlates of the sleep disturbance dimensions. Across six working adult samples, single-factor models consistently demonstrated poor fit, whereas the two-factor models, with insomnia symptoms (ie, trouble sleeping) and dissatisfaction with sleep (ie, subjective quality of sleep) dimensions demonstrated sufficient fit that was significantly better than the single-factor models. Across each sample, dissatisfaction with sleep was more strongly correlated with sleep duration and subjective health than insomnia symptoms, providing additional evidence for distinguishability between the two sleep disturbance factors. In working adult populations, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System sleep disturbance 8b short form is best modeled as two distinguishable factors capturing insomnia symptoms and dissatisfaction with sleep, rather than as a unidimensional sleep disturbance construct.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37770251/"}

Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a multicomponent intervention recommended as the first-line treatment, but the mediators of change remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise and evaluate the evidence for potential mediators of CBT-I. Searches were performed for studies published until February 2021, reporting on mediation analyses with CBT-I. Seventeen unique samples of adults with insomnia (20 studies, NÂ =Â 3125) were included. Two-stage structural equation modelling was applied to the available data, where 7 studies examined the cognitive mediator, 'dysfunctional beliefs about sleep', 5 studies examined a hyperarousal mediator, and 3 studies examined the behavioural mediator, 'time in bed'. There was evidence in support of changes in dysfunctional beliefs as a cognitive mediator of insomnia symptom improvement following CBT-I. There was more limited evidence in support of changes in hyperarousal-related mediators, and no significant effect of time in bed as a mediator. Numerous studies recorded diary-based measures of potential behavioural mediators, but analyses of these variables were not typically conducted. The most serious limitation of the evidence base is that the temporal precedence of mediator changes cannot be established. Future studies should consider: i) using mid-treatment measurements of mediator changes; ii) reporting on mediator psychometric properties; and iii) explicitly stating analyses as pre-specified or exploratory.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33887655/"}

Their performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective daytime sleepiness were compared across different insomnia groups, and the results were compared between middle-aged adults and older adults. Analysis of covariance indicated that subjective daytime sleepiness was significantly different across the insomnia groups in middle-aged adults based on insomnia group (P=<.0001), but, did not affect objective vigilance performance. In contrast, older adults displayed significantly different PVT response time, but not daytime sleepiness, based on insomnia group (P=0.03). Insomnia impacts psychomotor performance and subjective sleepiness differently, based on age group. There may be underlying processes associated with the aging that amplifies the impact of insomnia on vigilance performance, yet lessens perceived sleepiness in older adults.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24290042/"}

The current systematic review assessed the available evidence base using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. A total of 14 preclinical studies and 12 clinical studies met inclusion criteria. Results indicated that there is insufficient evidence to support routine clinical use of cannabinoid therapies for the treatment of any sleep disorder given the lack of published research and the moderate-to-high risk of bias identified within the majority of preclinical and clinical studies completed to-date. Promising preliminary evidence provides the rationale for future randomised controlled trials of cannabinoid therapies in individuals with sleep apnea, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder-related nightmares, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and narcolepsy.

The presence of residual insomnia symptoms is common, especially among naturally remitted individuals. This study aims to examine the features of these residual symptoms and their potential association with future relapse. A population-based data set on the natural history of insomnia was used for this secondary analysis. Residual insomnia symptoms were investigated in those who had insomnia symptoms/syndrome at baseline and achieved full remission (according to predetermined diagnostic algorithm) within the following 1 year. Cox regressions were used to determine the hazard ratio (HR) of each residual symptom for predicting relapse in the next 4 years. The nature and severity of residual symptoms were examined with an extended version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which incorporates additional items on sleep quality and specific sleep-related daytime impairments (on daytime fatigue, cognitive functioning, mood, interpersonal relationship, and daily activities). In addition, the presence of depressive symptoms and medical conditions were controlled for in investigating risks of insomnia relapse. A total of 434 participants were included in this study (age ranges from 18 to 94; 65.9% female); 248 of them had relapsed within 4 years. The response rate ranged from 78% to 83%. The most frequently reported residual symptoms with at least moderate severity (ISI items â¥2 on 0-4 ISI item scale) were poor \"Quality of sleep\" (39.2 %), followed by \"difficulty maintaining sleep\" (DMS; 27%). The most common residual daytime impairments related to insomnia were fatigue (24.7 %), mood disturbances (23%) and cognitive disturbances (22.6%). After controlling for baseline insomnia and depression severity and concurrent physical diseases, impairments of cognition (HR = 1.46), poor quality of sleep (HR = 1.43), disturbed mood (HR = 1.39), being female (HR = 1.36), DMS (HR = 1.35), and fatigue (HR = 1.24) were significantly associated with insomnia relapse in the next 4 years. Moreover, residual poor sleep quality and daytime insomnia symptoms were independent of DMS in predicting relapse. Subgroup regressions according to sex showed that for male participants, residual cognition impairments (HR = 1.98) was the most significant predictors of future relapse, whereas residual DMS (HR = 1.46) significantly predicted relapse for women only. A wide range of residual symptoms exists in individuals with naturally remitted insomnia. Notably, residual DMS is the most common residual nighttime symptom and the only nighttime symptom associated with insomnia relapse. Additionally, perceived poor sleep quality and cognitive, mood, and somatic impairments attributed to sleep disturbances are also related to future relapse. Attention to these residual symptoms when initiating insomnia treatment is warranted to minimize future relapse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31192349/"}

These positive relationships were also apparent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some psychological interventions, such as Imagery Rehearsal Therapy, might be effective in alleviating both nightmares and insomnia symptoms. Regarding the relationships between insomnia and dreams, compared with controls, the dreams of individuals with insomnia are characterized by more negative contents and affects.

Spectral analyses were conducted using unpaired t-tests and topographical differences between groups were assessed using statistical non-parametric mapping. Five minute segments of deep NREM sleep were further analyzed using sLORETA cortical source imaging. The initial topographic analysis of all-night NREM sleep EEG revealed that insomnia subjects had more high-frequency EEG activity (> 16 Hz) compared to good sleeping controls and that the difference between groups was widespread across the scalp. In addition, the analysis also showed that there was a more circumscribed difference in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) power bands between groups. When deep NREM sleep (N3) was examined separately, the high-frequency difference between groups diminished, whereas the higher regional alpha activity in insomnia subjects persisted. Source imaging analysis demonstrated that sensory and sensorimotor cortical areas consistently exhibited elevated levels of alpha activity during deep NREM sleep in insomnia subjects relative to good sleeping controls.

A systematic search for eligible articles and dissertations was conducted in six online bibliographic databases. The 11 included studies, with the majority published between 1978 and 1998, were randomised controlled and experimental studies in adults, comparing stimulus control for insomnia with passive and active comparators and assessing insomnia symptoms as outcomes. A random effects model was used to determine the standardised mean difference Hedge's g at post-treatment and follow-up for three sleep diary measures: the number of awakenings, sleep onset latency, and total sleep time. A test for heterogeneity was conducted, forest plots were produced, the risk of publication bias was estimated, and the study quality was assessed. In the trials identified, stimulus control resulted in small to large improvements on sleep onset latency and total sleep time, relative to passive comparators (gâ=â0.38-0.85).

The SHPS-J was developed according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force for Translation and Cultural Adaption. For the analysis, participants were divided into three groups: insomnia syndrome, insomnia symptoms, and good sleep groups. The SHPS-J had good test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.55-0.76) and adequate internal consistency (Î±Â =Â 0.54-0.74), except with regard to eating/drinking behaviors. The factorial validity of the four-factor structure was confirmed through a confirmatory factor analysis; however, one item related to eating/drinking behaviors had no significant factor loading. The construct validity was confirmed through a correlation analysis between each domain of the SHPS-J and ISI-J (rÂ =Â 0.19-0.60, pÂ <Â 0.01).

This study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture at SP6 on resting electroencephalogram (EEG), meridian electrical activity (Ryodoraku), and stress in patients with confirmed insomnia. In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial subjects (N=70) from TCM treated outpatients were randomized to receive TCM based acupuncture with manual stimulation (experimental) or sham stimulation (control) treatment. Acupuncture was applied to SP6 for 20 minutes on the spleen meridian of the foot in experimental subjects and controls received sham intervention. Significant changes between pre- and post-intervention were found in all electrical conductance values for the 12 meridians (Ryodoraku scores) in either control or experimental groups (fold change from 1.15 to 2.03) (P values <0.00 1). Eight meridians showed significantly different changes in Ryodoraku scores between pre- and post-intervention in the experimental group compared to the control group (fold change from 1.16 to 1.36) (P<0.05). EEG wave signals did not change with intervention in either group (P values â¥0.209). In summary, acupuncture at the SP6 acupoint altered meridian electrical activity of the lung periecardium, har, small intestine, sanjiao, spleen, bladder, and stomach meridians (P values <0.05) in patients with insomnia.

Conventional pharmacotherapies for insomnia, initially comprising benzodiazepines and later the Z-drugs, often present significant adverse effects, including dependence and tolerance. Here we provide a brief review on cannabis therapy for insomnia and present a relevant case report. We first discuss the sleep stages and the main clinical aspects of insomnia. Next, we report the case of a 37 year-old patient who, after a grief situation, began to experience insomnia that was resistant to various conventional treatments, even with dosage adjustment. The insomnia diminished after replacing the conventional pharmacotherapies with full spectrum Cannabis sativa oil, rich in cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Finally, we note that medical societies from several major countries such as England, Australia and Brazil already recommend the use of Cannabis (plants rich in THC and/or CBD) to treat insomnia. These societies base their guidelines on studies that reported a mitigation of the symptoms of insomnia with the use of cannabinoids. However, recent meta-analyses highlight the heterogeneity of the participants, interventions, and results.

In contrast, NSD had bad performance only in brief visuospatial memory test and continuous performance tests, and relatively better than SSD group in the latter test. People with SSD insomnia but not NSD had decreased BDNF levels compared with HC, and neuropsychological performance was positively correlated with BDNF levels only in SSD group.

Arousal and valence of the sleep-related stimuli were assessed using a 5-point Likert type scale. Attention biases characterized by difficulty disengaging from and increased avoidance for daytime fatigue, and by difficulty disengaging from alarm clocks were observed in individuals with insomnia disorder compared to controls. On the whole sample, difficulty to disengage from diurnal and nocturnal sleep-related stimuli were related mostly to higher arousal rating of sleep-related stimuli and insomnia severity. Higher arousal rating for sleep-related stimuli mediates the relationship between difficulty disengaging and insomnia severity. The cross-sectional nature of the study. We provide first initial evidence for an attentional bias characterized by on one side, avoidance for diurnal sleep-related stimuli and on other side, disengagement for both diurnal and nocturnal sleep-related stimuli in patients with insomnia.

Existing behavioural interventions for nocturia or insomnia contain concordant and discordant components. An expert panel (including geriatricians with sleep or nocturia research expertise, sleep psychologists and a behavioural psychologist) was convened to combine and reconcile elements of behavioural treatment for each condition. Concordant treatment recommendations involve using situational self-management strategies such as urge suppression or techniques to influence homeostatic drive for sleep. Fluid modification such as avoiding alcohol and evening caffeine and regular self-monitoring through a daily diary is also appropriate for both conditions. The expert panel resolved discordant recommendations by eliminating overnight completion of voiding diaries (which can interfere with sleep) and discouraging routine overnight voiding (a stimulus control strategy).

The aim of the present study was to extract possible tinnitus specific factors that increase the risk of developing insomnia based on the analysis of a large patient cohort suffering from chronic tinnitus. 173 patients presenting at the multidisciplinary tinnitus center of a University Hospital completed a questionnaire measuring specific psychological symptoms of insomnia (RIS) and a tinnitus questionnaire (TQ). The scores of all ten RIS items were compared between tinnitus patients and 94 healthy individuals by separate ANOVAs in order to specify the extent of insomnia specific symptoms in the tinnitus group. In a second step a multiple linear regression analysis was performed in the tinnitus sample with subscales of the TQ (excluding the TQ sleep scale), age and duration of tinnitus as independent variables and the RIS score as the dependent variables. Tinnitus patients differed from healthy controls not only in impaired sleep quality but also in insomnia specific concerns and anxiety. Tinnitus related emotional and cognitive distress and somatic complaints correlated with severity of insomnia, whereas no association of age or duration of tinnitus with severity of insomnia was found. Our results suggest that chronic tinnitus patients have more sleeping difficulties and associated worries about sleep or negative emotions in contrast to healthy controls.

Parents of all children completed two questionnaires to assess their children's sleep habits and disturbances, and their EFs with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Preschool Version. Children with chronic insomnia were found to wake up earlier, sleep less during the night, have more nighttime awakenings, and higher nocturnal wakefulness, compared to the control group. The chronic insomnia group showed significant impairment in all the EFs domains. Nocturnal sleep duration, nighttime awakenings, and nocturnal wakefulness correlated with inhibit, plan/organize, working memory, inhibitory self-control, emergent metacognition, and the global executive composite scores in the chronic insomnia group. In the control group, the number of nighttime awakenings correlated with inhibition, inhibitory self-control, and the global executive composite. Regression analyses showed a predominant role of insomnia factor in the association with EFs in both clinical and control groups.

In a single-site, randomized controlled trial, 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 Â± 5.64 years) with chronic DSM-5 insomnia disorder related to menopause were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education (SHE), SRT, or CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep diaries served as primary outcomes. From baseline to posttreatment, ISI decreased 7.70 points in the CBTI group (p < .001), 6.56 points in the SRT group (p < .001), and 1.12 in the SHE group (p = .01). Although average sleep duration increased in all groups by 6 month follow-up, CBTI patients obtained 40-43 more minutes of nightly sleep than those who received SHE or SRT. Remission rates in the CBTI (54%-84%) and SRT (38%-57%) groups were higher than SHE patients (4%-33%) at posttreatment and 6 month follow-up. CBTI patients were generally more likely to remit than SRT patients. CBTI and SRT effectively treat menopause-related insomnia disorder and are superior to SHE. Response to CBTI and SRT is similar, but CBTI outperforms SRT in improving sleep maintenance, which may increase likelihood of remission.

Treatment nonresponders had a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity. Logistic regression analyses showed that the presence of psychiatric comorbidity was strongly predictive for negative treatment outcome (odds ratios: 20.6 and 10.3 for the 2 outcome definitions). Additionally, higher scores on the cognitive coping strategy called \"refocus on planning\" were associated with worse CBT-I outcome.

However, it cannot be assumed that improvements in subjective sleep reports correspond with objectively measured sleep improvements, because research has indicated a lack of agreement across these measures. The current study examined the effects of sleep-directed hypnosis plus cognitive processing therapy (hypCPT) on objective indices of sleep quality measured with actigraphy. <b><i>Method:</i></b> Forty-five women with PTSD were randomized to receive sleep-directed hypCPT or sleep and psychiatric symptom monitoring plus CPT (ssmCPT). Pre- and posttreatment, participants completed 1 week of daily actigraphy assessments of nocturnal sleep onset latency, waking after sleep onset, and total sleep time. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall improvement in objective sleep indices was not observed. Despite this, at posttreatment, treatment completers receiving hypCPT took significantly less time to fall asleep than did women receiving ssmCPT. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> More research is needed to understand and reduce the discrepancy between subjectively and objectively assessed sleep impairments in PTSD.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia after ischemic stroke. In this assessor-participant blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 144 ischemic stroke patients with insomnia meeting <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (fifth edition, <i>DSM</i>-5) criteria were assigned to verum or sham acupuncture treatment (n = 72 per group) for three sessions per week over 4 weeks. The outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), stroke-specific quality of life (SSQoL), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. Multiple objective sleep variables were recorded using actigraphy. Assessment was conducted at baseline, and thereafter once biweekly for the 4-week treatment and at 4 weeks of follow-up. The verum acupuncture group had significantly greater improvements than the sham acupuncture group in sleep quality from 2 weeks into treatment throughout the follow-up, indicated by ISI scores and actigraphic variable SE (sleep efficiency). This greater improvement was also observed in the PSQI after 4 weeks of treatment throughout follow-up, as well as actigraphic variable TST (total sleep time), SSQoL and HADS scores at the end of treatment, and SSQoL and depression scores at follow-up. There was no significant difference between groups in the actigraphic variable SA (sleep awakenings). Adverse events were mild in severity, and their incidence was not significantly different between the two groups.

Insomnia is also a common problem in daytime workers. The daytime functioning of insomniacs is a key point to understand the impact of insomnia on workers. Absenteeism is one major target in the evaluation of severe insomnia at the workplace. Most of the studies find a higher rate of work accidents in insomniacs.

This study examines how multiple longitudinal measures of sleep disturbances (sleep-initiation insomnia, sleep-maintenance insomnia, sleep-medication usage) are associated with dementia risk. Ten annual waves (2011-2020) of prospective cohort data from a nationally representative U.S. sample of adults aged â¥65 years were analyzed from the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Sleep disturbances were converted into a longitudinal score and measured as sleep-initiation insomnia (trouble falling asleep in 30 minutes), sleep-maintenance insomnia (trouble falling asleep after waking up early), and sleep-medication usage (taking medication to help sleep). Cox regression models analyzed time to dementia diagnosis for a sample of 6,284 respondents. In the unadjusted model, sleep-initiation insomnia was significantly associated with a 51% increased dementia risk (hazard ratio=1.51, 95% CI=1.19, 1.90). Adjusted for sociodemographics, sleep-medication usage was significantly associated with a 30% increased dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio=1.30, 95% CI=1.08-1.56). Adjusted for sociodemographics and health, sleep-maintenance insomnia was significantly associated with a 40% decreased dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio=0.60, 95% CI=0.46, 0.77). These findings suggest that sleep-initiation insomnia and sleep-medication usage may elevate dementia risk. On the basis of the current evidence, sleep disturbances should be considered when assessing the risk profile for dementia.

Recruitment was limited to one rural community and was in partnership with community healthcare providers. Results were integrated using a convergent, parallel mixed-methods design. Poor sleep health and high prevalence of insomnia symptoms in rural mothers were evident and associated with social support and maternal distress. Qualitative content from interviews indicated that well-established precipitating and perpetuating factors for insomnia may contribute to poor maternal sleep health. Results also revealed a gap in knowledge and language surrounding sleep health among rural mothers. Sleep health is challenged during the transition to motherhood and rural mothers have less access to specialized perinatal and behavioral health care than their urban counterparts. In this sample, poor sleep was attributable to distress in addition to nocturnal infant and child sleep patterns which has implications for psychoeducation and promotion of sleep health in mothers.

Unfortunately, previous research provides limited guidance as to what constitutes the best and most practical management approach for this comorbid patient group. Some preliminary studies show that when cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT-I) is combined with standard OSA therapies for these patients, outcomes are improved. However, the dearth of trained providers capable of delivering CBT-I has long served as a pragmatic barrier to the widespread use of this therapy in clinical practice. The emergence of sophisticated online CBT-I (OCBT-I) programs could improve access, showing promising reductions in insomnia severity. Given its putative scalability and apparent efficacy, some have argued OCBT-I should represent a 1st-stage intervention in a broader stepped care model that allocates more intensive and less assessable therapist-delivered CBT-I (TCBT-I) only to those who show an inadequate response to lower intensity OCBT-I. However, the efficacy of OCBT-I as a 1st-stage therapy within a broader stepped care management strategy for insomnia comorbid with OSA has yet to be tested with comorbid OSA/insomnia patients. This dual-site randomized clinical trial will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to test a stepped care model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1) augmentation of PAP therapy with OCBT-I improves short-term outcomes of comorbid OSA/insomnia and (2) providing a higher intensity 2nd-stage CBT-I to patients who show sub-optimal short-term outcomes with OCBT-I+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. After completing baseline assessment, the comorbid OSA/insomnia patients enrolled will be randomized to a 1st-stage therapy that includes usual care PAP + OCBT-I or UC (usual care PAP + sleep hygiene education). Insomnia will be reassessed after 8 weeks. OCBT-I recipients who meet \"remission\" criteria (defined as an Insomnia Severity Index score < 10) will continue PAP but will not be offered any additional insomnia intervention and will complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8Â weeks and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. OCBT-I recipients classified as \"unremitted\" after 8 weeks of treatment will be re-randomized to a 2nd-stage treatment consisting of continued, extended access to OCBT-I or a switch to TCBT-I.

A new clinical specialty has developed with the establishment of sleep disorder centers and a diagnostic classification of sleep and arousal disorders. This new nosological approach has evolved from an extensive base of new scientific information concerning descriptive polygraphic and analysis of clinical case series. Four major categories have been defined: (a) disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (insomnias), (b) disorders of excessive somnolence, (c) disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and (d) dysfunctions associated with sleep. Within this comprehensive classification certain major pathophysiological advances are described for the \"insomnias.\" These include polysomnographic identification of altered sleep stage patterns in the major effective illnesses, insomnias related to hypnotic drugs and alcohol, sleep disturbances associated with sleep-induced respiratory impairment, and sleep-related periodic movements during sleep (nocturnal myoclonus). Excessive daytime somnolence is primarily associated with the hypersomnia sleep-apnea syndrome and with narcolepsy. The relationship between biological rhythms (chronobiology) and disorders of the human sleep-wake schedules is very actively investigated. The recognition that sleep length, internal organization, and timing within neurophysiological circadian time-keeping systems has lead to better diagnosis of these sleep-wake disorders and new chronotherapeutic regimens.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) delivered in up to eight weekly telephone sessions (CBTI-Phone, n = 15) versus an information pamphlet control (IPC, n = 15). Sleep/wake diary, sleep-related questionnaires (Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 16-item Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep), and daytime symptom assessments (fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life) were completed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-wk follow-up. Linear mixed models indicated that sleep/wake diary sleep efficiency and total sleep time improved significantly at posttreatment in both groups and remained stable at 12-wk follow-up. More CBTI-Phone than IPC patients showed posttreatment improvements in unhelpful sleep-related cognitions (P < 0.001) and were classified as \"in remission\" from insomnia at follow-up (P < 0.05). Posttreatment effect sizes on most daytime symptoms were large (Cohen d = 0.8-2.5) for CBTI-Phone patients and small to moderate (Cohen d = -0.1-0.6) for IPC patients. All CBTI-Phone patients completed posttreatment and 12-wk follow-up assessments, but three IPC patients discontinued the study. The findings provide preliminary support for telephone-delivered CBTI in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Future larger-scale studies with more diverse samples are warranted.

Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the acute effects of the imidazopyridine zolpidem on objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality in the largest of the above-mentioned groups. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, 15 patients (9 females and 6 males aged 51.1 + 11. 3 years) diagnosed as having nonorganic insomnia (ICD-10: F 51.0) related to neurotic and stress-related disorders (F 1.1:12, F 41.2:2 and F 43.2:1) were included. Objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality measures were investigated in 3 subsequent nights in the sleep laboratory (adaptation, baseline/placebo and zolpidem 10 mg night), utilizing clinical, polysomnographic, psychometric and psychophysiological methods. The drug-free patients were matched according to age and sex with 15 normal healthy controls (age 51.2 + 11.8 years). Statistical analysis of polysomnographic variables demonstrated a significant lengthening of the total sleep period (TSP) and total sleep time (TST), an improvement in sleep efficiency and a shortening of sleep latencies after zolpidem as compared with placebo. These changes were opposite to the differences between patients and controls. Concerning sleep architecture, zolpidem increased the length of S4 and S3 + S4 as compared with placebo. Subjective sleep and awakening quality and the thymopsychic variables drive, mood, affectivity and wakefulness in the morning showed no significant changes, as a significant improvement had already occurred from the adaptation to the baseline/placebo night. Noopsychic variables (attention, concentration, attention variability, numerical memory, fine motor activity, reaction time measures) showed similar findings. Moreover, subjective sleep and awakening quality, thymopsychic and noopsychic measures during baseline/placebo recordings did not differ significantly from normative data (except for fine motor activity). Psychophysiological measures did not show any significant alterations either, except for a decrease in systolic blood pressure in the evening. As compared with placebo, zolpidem induced a significant improvement in objective sleep quality, mainly by increasing TSP, TST and sleep efficiency and shortening sleep latencies, thereby normalizing the disorder of initiating and maintaining sleep. Deep sleep stages S3 + S4 increased (although at baseline/placebo these stages did not differ from controls), while S1, S2 and SREM did not change significantly. Subjective sleep and awakening quality as well as thymopsychic and noopsychic performance in the morning mainly showed a placebo and 'first- night effect' phenomenon in these patients. Thus, the changes induced by zolpidem were somewhat different from those after classical benzodiazepines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10754428/"}

Yet, sleep is more than duration alone and can be described across multiple domains, such as timing, regularity, satisfaction, alertness, and efficiency. We reviewed observational population-based studies that examined differences in age, sex, and origin across multiple dimensions of sleep. Reviewed literature suggests an increasing prevalence of insomnia symptoms, shorter and less deep sleep in old age. Overall, women report poorer sleep quality than men despite objective measures revealing shorter and more fragmented sleep in men. Minorities generally have poorer quantity and quality of sleep, but multi-ethnic studies have reported mixed results regarding the subjective experience of sleep. In sum, effects of age, sex and origin differ across sleep dimensions, thereby suggesting that the multidimensionality of sleep and how these different aspects interact should be studied across individuals. Studies should include both self-reported measures and objective assessments in diverse population-based samples, as both aspects are important to understand sleep health in the general population. Data-driven descriptions could provide researchers and clinicians with insights into how well individuals are sleeping and offer concrete targets for promotion of sleep health across the population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35429087/"}

A total of 25,580 individuals (age range, 15-100 years) from the noninstitutionalized general population representative of 7 European countries (France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Finland) were interviewed by telephone using the Sleep-EVAL system. Nonrestorative sleep was analyzed in relationship to sociodemographic determinants, environmental factors, life habits, health, sleep-wake schedule, and psychological factors. The prevalence of NRS was 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 10.4%-11.2%) in the sample, was higher in women than in men (12.5% vs 9.0%; P<.001), and decreased with age. The United Kingdom (16.1%) and Germany (15.5%) had the highest prevalence of NRS and Spain (2.4%), the lowest. In multivariate analyses, several factors were positively associated with NRS. The most important were younger age, dissatisfaction with sleep, difficulty getting started in the morning, stressful life, presence of anxiety, bipolar or a depressive disorder, and having a physical disease. When compared with subjects who have difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (without NRS), subjects with NRS reported more frequently a variety of daytime impairment (irritability, physical, and mental fatigue) and consulted a physician twice as frequently for their sleeping difficulties than did other subjects with insomnia. Nonrestorative sleep is a frequent symptom in the general population, but its prevalence largely varies between countries. It is often associated with mental disorders and characteristics of sleep deprivation (such as extra sleep time on weekends). Nonrestorative sleep affected more frequently the active classes of the population and caused greater daytime impairment than difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15642872/"}

However, the extent to which the etiologic influences on insomnia and common psychopathology overlap is unclear. There are limited genetically informed studies of insomnia and internalizing disorders and few studies of overlap exist with externalizing disorders. We utilized twin data from the Virginia Adult Twin Studies of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (total n = 7,500). Insomnia, internalizing disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD], generalized anxiety disorder [GAD]), and alcohol abuse or dependence (AAD) were assessed at two time points, while antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) was assessed once. Cholesky decompositions were performed in OpenMx and longitudinal measurement models were run on available phenotypes to reduce measurement error. The latent additive genetic influences on insomnia overlapped significantly (56% for females, 74% for males) with MDD and were shared completely (100%) with GAD. There was significant overlap of latent unique environmental influences, with overlap ranging from 38 to 100% across disorders. In contrast, there was less genetic overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders, with 18% of insomnia's heritability shared with AAD and 23% with ASPD. Latent unique environmental overlap between insomnia and both externalizing disorders was negligible. The evidence for substantial genetic overlap between insomnia and stable aspects of both internalizing disorders suggests that there may be few insomnia-specific genes and investigation into unique environmental factors is important for understanding insomnia development. The modest overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders indicates that these disorders are genetically related, but largely etiologically distinct.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28092418/"}

In the proposed study, an optimal antisymmetric biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (ABWFB) has been used, which is designed to minimize the joint duration-bandwidth localization (JDBL) of the underlying filters. The L<sub>1</sub>-norm feature is computed from the various wavelet sub-bands coefficients of ECG signals. The L<sub>1</sub> norm features are fed to various supervised machine learning classifiers for the automated detection of insomnia. In this work, ECG recordings of seven insomnia patients and six normal subjects are used from the publicly available cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sleep database. We created ten different subsets of ECG signals based on annotations of sleep-stages, namely wake (W), S1, S2, S3, S4, rapid eye moment (REM), light sleep stage (LSS), slow-wave sleep (SWS), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and WÂ +Â S1+S2+S3+S4+REM for the automated identification of insomnia. Our proposed ECG-based system obtained the highest classification accuracy of 97.87%, F1-score of 97.39%, and Cohen's kappa value of 0.9559 for K-nearest neighbour (KNN) with the ten-fold cross-validation strategy using ECG signals corresponding to the REM sleep stage. The support vector machine (SVM) yielded the highest value of 0.99 for area under the curve with the ten fold cross-validation corresponding to REM sleep stage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33631498/"}

The associations of sleep quality (good/poor) in combination with mid-range (6-8 hours), short (<6) or long (>8) sleep duration with functioning, determined from the SF-36, were evaluated using logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic, relationships, health behaviors, obesity, pain, and mental and physical illness confounders. After adjusting for gender, and age, poor sleep quality in combination with short, mid-range and long sleep was associated with worse physical, emotional and social functioning. Pain and comorbid illness explained much of these associations, while attenuation from other covariates was minor. The associations of poor sleep quality with worse functioning remained after full adjustment regardless of sleep duration, while among people with good quality sleep, only those with long sleep duration reported poorer functioning. Poor sleep quality has robust associations with worse functioning regardless of total duration in the general population.

The aim of the present study was to test the effects of zaleplon (ZAL), a new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug, on the sleep quality of MHD patients with insomnia. The sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh questionnaire in 10 patients (6 males/4 females) with insomnia on MHD; these patients underwent a randomized double-blind crossover study versus placebo (PLA). The main exclusion criterion was the presence of any possible cause of insomnia related to other concurrent diseases. Treatment with ZAL significantly improved the total score of sleep quality (p < 0.03 vs. PLA). The analysis of the single components revealed that treatment with ZAL was associated with a higher subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01 vs. PLA) and a reduced sleep latency (p < 0.01 vs. PLA). The duration of sleep was not modified by ZAL, whereas a significant improvement was detected in habitual sleep efficacy (p < 0.05 vs. PLA). No peculiar side effect was recorded on ZAL. Blood parameters did not change, nor were differences recorded in the dialysis parameters (body weight gain, blood pressure) throughout the study. This study suggests that ZAL has a positive effect on the sleep quality in MHD patients. The absence of side effects and its pharmacodynamic properties make ZAL a useful drug in uremic patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12972720/"}

On the other hand, epidemiological evidences are indicating that chronic partial sleep loss may increase the risk of diabetes. Laboratory studies have shown that sleep restriction is associated with an increase in sympathetic nervous activity and a decrease in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensation in beta-cell function, resulting in an impact on glucose homeostasis and an elevated risk of diabetes. Sleep curtailment is also associated with a dysregulation of the neuroendocrine control of appetite, with a reduction of the satiety factor, leptin, and an increase in hunger-promoting hormone, ghrelin. The adverse impact of sleep deprivation on energy homeostasis is likely to be driven by increased activity of neuronal populations expressing in orexin system that promotes waking, feeding and energy-expenditure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19768935/"}

Melatonin promotes sleep processes and, administered as a drug, it is suitable to improve primary and secondary sleep disorders in humans. Recent magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that human plasma and saliva melatonin levels are partially determined by the pineal gland volume. This study compares the pineal volume in a group of patients with primary insomnia to a group of healthy people without sleep disturbance. Pineal gland volume (PGV) was measured on the basis of high-resolution 3 Tesla MRI (T1-magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo) in 23 patients and 27 controls, matched for age, gender and educational status. Volume measurements were performed conventionally by manual delineation of the pineal borders in multi-planar reconstructed images. Pineal gland volume was significantly smaller (PÂ <Â 0.001) in patients (48.9Â Â±Â 26.6Â mm(3) ) than in controls (79Â Â±Â 30.2Â mm(3) ). In patients PGV correlated negatively with age (rÂ =Â -0.532; PÂ =Â 0.026). Adjusting for the effect of age, PGV and rapid eye movement (REM) latency showed a significant positive correlation (rS Â =Â 0.711, PÂ <Â 0.001) in patients.

The sample comprised Nâ=â280 adolescents (172 girls) aged 14-16 yrs (meanâ=â15.19, SDâ=â.76). Circadian preference, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), sleep disturbances, sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions, and general perceived self-efficacy were assessed online. Morning-orientated adolescents reported significantly higher HRQoL and less insomnia symptoms compared with evening-oriented chronotypes. In the total sample, insomnia symptoms mediated the relationship of chronotype and HRQoL. The strongest predictor of HRQoL in evening types was the degree of sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions. HRQoL in morning types was most strongly predicted by general self-efficacy, i.e., the global confidence in coping abilities. The findings support a negative relationship of eveningness and HRQoL in adolescents. Insomnia symptoms were identified to be mediating factors in this relationship. The influence of the mediating factors on HRQoL differed between morning and evening types. The model provides implications of how to enhance HRQoL in adolescents according to their circadian preference.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131114/"}

This study aimed to synthesize relevant quantitative evidence and evaluate MBSR application and effectiveness for insomnia patients' sleep quality and mental health. A systematic search through eight databases from the earliest available dates until August 2019 was conducted. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of MBSR on sleep quality, anxiety, and depression as outcome measures among insomnia patients comprising patients aged above 18Â years were included in this meta-analysis. Each study's quality was assessed using the modified Jadad quality scale. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used to calculate the standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the data analyses. In total, data for 497 patients in seven randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The results revealed that compared to the control group, the MBSR group significantly improved in sleep quality (SMDÂ =Â -0.69, 95% CI: -1.12~Â -Â 0.26, ZÂ =Â 3.16, pÂ =Â .002), depression (SMDÂ =Â -1.83, 95% CI: -2.81-0.84, ZÂ =Â 3.63, pÂ <Â .001), and anxiety (SMDÂ =Â -1.74, 95% CI: -2.90-0.59, ZÂ =Â 2.96, pÂ =Â .003). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken. After carefully reviewing included trials, we can reasonably conclude that these heterogeneities did not impair the overall effect size of MBSR in the results.

For studying the sleep characteristics, common complications and widely recognized treatment options for COMISA, Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) and Odds Ratio (OR) were applied to assess the mean and risk differences between compared groups. Outcomes included sleep health parameters and secondary impairments in physical and mental well-being. COMISA showed worse sleep quality than OSA only by PSQI (WMD =â3.38 point) and heavier sleep fragmentation (WMDâ=â11.46âmin) than insomnia only. Besides, COMISA patients showed a higher risk for depression (OR [95%CI]â=â5.03[2.31, 10.93]) and PTSD (OR [95%CI]â=â3.96[1.85, 8.46]) in comparison with OSA alone.

Five themes were identified (1) <i>When knowledge contributes to an altered perception of sleep</i>, referring to the reduced misperception and increased motivation that followed sleep education, (2) <i>Overcoming habits and perceptions to accelerate sleep onset</i>, referring to barriers related to sleep behaviour and how stimulus control enabled them to find meaningful behaviour, (3) <i>The sleep window of challenges in learning how to sleep right</i> referring to that payoff from sleep restriction did not come easily or by magic, and commitment gave them confidence to continue, (4) <i>Relaxation becomes a behavioural habit and goes beyond sleep</i>, referring to a means to achieve a relaxed body and mind and how they thereby coped better with RA-related symptoms and (5) <i>Break the cycle and regain control</i> referring to how trust in one's own accomplishment was crucial to reducing worrying. The process towards eliminating insomnia was a bodily experience and involved a changed mindset that resulted in an alteration of behaviour and cognitions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596631/"}

Although the mechanisms linking insomnia with these comorbidities remain unclear, age-related changes in sleep and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation might represent a shared mechanistic pathway. In this study, we assessed the relationship between ANS activity with indices of objective and subjective sleep quality in older adults with insomnia. Forty-three adults with chronic insomnia and 16 age-matched healthy sleeper controls were studied. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), objective sleep quality by electroencephalogram spectral components derived from polysomnography, and ANS activity by measuring 24-h plasma cortisol and norepinephrine (NE). Sleep cycle analysis displayed lower slow oscillatory (SO: 0.5-1.25 Hz) activity in the first cycle in insomnia compared to controls. In insomnia, 24-h cortisol levels were higher and 24-h NE levels were lower than controls. In controls, but not in insomnia, there was a significant interaction between NE level during wake and SO activity levels across the sleep cycles, such that in controls but not in insomnia, NE level during wake was positively associated with the amount of SO activity in the first cycle. In insomnia, lower 24-h NE level and SO activity in the first sleep cycle were associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. Dysregulation of autonomic activity may be an underlying mechanism that links objective and subjective measures of sleep quality in older adults with insomnia, and potentially contribute to adverse health outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33295989/"}

We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, duration, and frequency, alcohol intake, diabetes status, race, and employment/shift work. Over 14 years of follow-up, 1,079 adults were diagnosed with PDAC.

Self-reported typical sleep characteristics and shift work were not associated with PDAC risk. Considering the role of light at night and shift work in circadian disruption and cancer risk, it is plausible that poor sleep health among a general population may be related to cancer risk through similar sleep and circadian disrupting processes. This work may suggest that typical sleep characteristics and shift work are not associated with PDAC, although additional work is needed to confirm these findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38387085/"}

Fifty-two middle-aged and older insomnia sufferers and 49 matched normal sleepers underwent multiple nights of laboratory and home polysomnography (PSG) and provided concurrent subjective estimates of their sleep. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and inferential tests were used to examine the nature of sleep time perceptions, identify subgroups with distinctive patterns such as perceptions, and explore factors that may contribute to these subgroups' distinctive sleep perceptions. Consistent with previous studies, the insomnia sufferers, as a group, showed a greater tendency to underestimate the time they slept than did the normal sleepers, but the accuracy of sleep time perceptions varied widely within each sample. Correlational analyses showed that study participants in each sample showed a moderate level of consistency in how accurately they estimated sleep time across nights. Subsequent cluster analyses conducted to identify subgroups with distinctive patterns of sleep time perceptions yielded four subgroups within the insomnia sample and three subgroups within the normal sleeper sample. Although the sleep setting significantly affected sleep perceptions for one insomnia subgroup, both laboratory and home objective-subjective sleep comparisons provided similar impressions regarding the relative accuracy of each subgroup's nocturnal sleep/wake perceptions. Finally, varying patterns of subgroup differences were noted across several common psychometric measures. The underestimation of sleep time is not a generic characteristic that separates all insomnia sufferers from normal sleepers.

Although the response shifts could reflect patients' cognitive changes toward their disorders as the interventions aim to achieve, failing to differentiate them from the true change during data analyses could bias the research conclusions. Considering this issue is seldom discussed in sleep studies, this study thus examined the impacts of response-shift items in an intervention study of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) via empirical-data based simulations. We used longitudinal measurement invariance tests to identify the items in an abbreviated version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale that are non-invariant (response shifted) against CBT-I based on data from 114 insomnia patients. The partial invariance model built accordingly was then used as a population model for simulations to examine the impacts of the response-shift items on follow-up paired t-tests. Invariance tests indicate CBT-I would lift the intercept of one item in DBAS-10 and cause non-uniform calibrations in three items. The following up simulations showed that failing to exclude the intercept-lifted item from the calculations of the subscale scores would lower the probability of using paired t-test to correctly detect the treatment effect by up to 53%. We recommend sleep researchers to consider the issues of response-shift when assessing sleep-related constructs in interventional studies for insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32841853/"}

The aim of this study was to perform a Classical Test Theory (CTT) based psychometric evaluation of the SCI in a sample of Swedish university students, by taking the ordinal nature of item level data into account. The SCI was translated into Swedish and distributed online to undergraduate students at three Swedish universities, within programs of health, psychology, science or economy. Of 3673 invited students, 634 (mean age 26.9 years; SD = 7.4) completed the questionnaire that, in addition to the SCI, comprised other scales on sleep, stress, lifestyle and students' study environment. Data were analyzed according to CTT investigating data completeness, item homogeneity and unidimensionality. Polychoric based explorative factor analysis suggested unidimensionality of the SCI, and internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha, 0.91; ordinal alpha, 0.94). SCI scores correlated with the Insomnia Severity Index (-0.88) as well as with sleep quality (-0.85) and perceived stress (-0.50), supporting external construct validity.

Among patients reporting insomnia symptoms, sleep misperception occurs when self-reported sleep duration under-estimates objective measures. Misperception represents a clinical challenge since insomnia management is based entirely on patient self-report. We tested the hypothesis that misperception occurring in sleep apnea patients would improve with subsequent treatment. We compared subjective sleep-wake reports with objective sleep in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (n=405) in two nights of polysomnography (diagnostic and treatment) within a median interval of 92 days. Sleep latency was generally over-estimated, while wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings were under-estimated. None of these estimations differed between diagnostic and treatment polysomnograms. We observed a large spectrum of total sleep time misperception values during the diagnostic polysomnogram, with one third of the cohort under-estimating their total sleep time by at least 60 min. Of those with >60 minute misperception, we observed improved total sleep time perception during treatment polysomnography. Improved perception correlated with improvements in self-reported sleep quality and response confidence. We found no polysomnogram or demographic predictors of total sleep time misperception for the diagnostic polysomnogram, nor did we find objective correlates of improved perception during titration. Our results suggest that misperception may improve with treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients who also exhibit misperception. Within subject changes in misperception are consistent with misperception being, at least to some extent, a state characteristic, which has implications for management of patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24745776/"}

Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain. In the case of subjective-objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more 'sleep-like' EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset-related mesograde amnesia.

A meta-analysis including nine primary studies measuring the Insomnia Severity Index indicated that CBTi is associated with a large improvement in insomnia severity (Hedges' gÂ =Â -0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.35, -0.43). Subgroup meta-analyses indicated that CBTi is effective in samples with untreated obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (five studies, Hedges' gÂ =Â -1.19, 95% CI -1.77, -0.61) and treated OSA (four studies, Hedges' gÂ =Â -0.55, 95% CI -0.75, -0.35). Publication bias was evaluated by examining the Funnel plot (Egger's regression pÂ =Â 0.78). Implementation programmes are required to embed COMISA management pathways in sleep clinics worldwide that currently specialise in the management of OSA alone. Future research should investigate and refine CBTi interventions in people with COMISA, including identifying the most effective CBTi components, adaptations, and developing personalised management approaches for this highly prevalent and debilitating condition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36872072/"}

{"id": "36169994", "title": "The Indirect Effects of a Mindfulness Mobile App on Productivity Through Changes in Sleep Among Retail Employees: Secondary Analysis.", "text": "Chronic sleep disturbance is prevalent among United States employees and associated with costly productivity impairment. Mindfulness interventions improve sleep (ie, insomnia and daytime sleepiness) and productivity outcomes, and mobile apps provide scalable means of intervention delivery. However, few studies have examined the effects of mindfulness mobile apps on employees, and no research to date has tested the role of sleep improvement as a potential mechanism of action for productivity outcomes. This study examined the effects of Calm, a consumer-based mindfulness app, and sleep coaching, on productivity impairment among retail employees through the indirect effects of changes in insomnia and daytime sleepiness. This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial (N=1029) comparing the use of Calm (n=585, 56.9%) to a waitlist control (n=444, 43.2%) for 8 weeks among employees of a large retail employer in the United States. A subset of individuals with elevated insomnia symptoms also had access to brief sleep coaching with Calm (n=101, 9.8%). Insomnia symptom severity, daytime sleepiness, and productivity impairment (ie, absenteeism, presenteeism, overall productivity impairment, and non-work activity impairment) were assessed at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. Indirect effects were evaluated with latent growth curve modeling to test whether the Calm intervention (Calm group vs waitlist control) was effective in reducing work productivity impairment through changes in sleep disturbance. No significant main effects of Calm intervention on productivity impairment were detected for any outcome at Î± level of .05, with the exception of non-work activity impairment models, in which Calm intervention reduced non-work activity impairment over time (P=.01 and P=.02 for insomnia and sleepiness models, respectively). Significant indirect effects of insomnia were detected for presenteeism (P=.002), overall work productivity (P=.01), and non-work activity impairment (P=.002); Calm intervention produced significantly greater reductions in insomnia symptoms (relative to waitlist control), and decreases in insomnia were associated with decreases in work productivity impairment. There was no significant indirect effect of change in insomnia on changes in absenteeism (P=.20). Furthermore, we detected no significant indirect effects of daytime sleepiness on productivity impairment. We found that Calm (plus sleep coaching for a small subset of individuals) had beneficial effects on employee sleep, and these benefits on sleep were related to indirect effects on productivity impairment (ie, presenteeism, overall work productivity impairment, and non-work activity impairment). There were no overall main effects of Calm intervention on productivity impairment; however, insomnia appears to be a mechanism associated with benefits for employee productivity. This is one of the first studies to suggest that sleep benefits of a mindfulness mobile app may also indirectly relate to benefits for workplace productivity.

This study utilizes network analysis to explore the complex associations between insomnia symptoms and hyperarousal and to identify key symptoms. A total of 1209 participants with non-clinical sleep disorders were included in the study. Hyperarousal was assessed by the Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS) and the Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), which encompasses two forms of state arousal (pre-sleep cognitive/somatic arousal). Insomnia symptoms were assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Gaussian graph networks and directed acyclic graphs (DAG) were applied to examine associations between variables and identify key variables. Pre-sleep cognitive arousal is the most important variable in the Gaussian network, acting as a \"bridge\" between the insomnia symptoms and hyperarousal domains, and serving as the gateway that activates most of the insomnia symptoms and hyperarousal in the DAG. Subjective sleep duration is another key driver in the DAG, marking the starting point for insomnia symptoms, while the use of sleep medication represents the endpoint of the pathway. All forms of hyperarousal are positively associated with insomnia symptoms, and pre-sleep cognitive arousal plays the most important role in the maintenance and activation of the insomnia symptoms-hyperarousal network.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40527108/"}

However, the hypnotic and thermoregulatory effects of melatonin remain to be simultaneously investigated for aged good and poor sleepers. The aim of this study was to explore the short-term effects of exogenous oral daytime melatonin on core body temperature, sleep latency, and subjective vigor and affect in aged women. Twelve sleep maintenance insomniacs and 10 good sleeping postmenopausal female subjects [mean (SD) age = 65.2 (7.4) years] participated in a double-blind, crossover study in which they received a capsule containing either melatonin (5 mg) or a placebo at 1400 hours. Continuous core body temperature and hourly multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) were collected from 1100-2030 hours. Self-reported estimates of global vigor (sleepiness) and affect were collected prior to each MSLT using visual analog scales. Comparison of good and poor sleepers failed to reveal any significant differences in core body temperature, sleep latency, or subjective vigor and affect. However, for both groups combined, melatonin administration [absolute postadministration mean (SEM) = 36.9 (0.05) degrees C] significantly lowered core body temperature compared with placebo [37.1 (0.05) degrees C]. Similarly, melatonin administration significantly reduced latency to stage 1 (SOL1) and stage 2 (SOL2) [absolute postadministration mean SOL1 = 20.1 (1.7) and SOL2 = 20.7 (1.6) minutes] compared with placebo [SOL1 = 24.3 (1.2) and SOL2 = 25.2 (1.1) minutes]. Treatment had no significant effect on either vigor or affect.

During the period of intervention, the prescribed music group and preferred music group listened to their assigned type of music at home every day at bedtime. Global PSQI scores after the intervention were significantly lower in the prescribed music group and preferred music group, but there was no significant reduction in the no-music group. Between the designated sedative music group and the each subject's preferred music group, both the PSQI score showed significant differences in several items, but variations were found in the results. This study confirms that listening to music improves sleep quality, even among university students in Japan. Sleep quality was improved in both prescribed and preferred music groups, although the groups gave different responses to specific PSQI components, which suggests that sleep is potentially affected by music type.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33300592/"}

This interrupted time series study occurred between May 2016 and January 2019. Control data for 1 year prior to implementation and intervention data for at least 16 months were collected. The study occurred on 7 inpatient wards (general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery wards) across 5 teaching hospitals in Toronto, Canada. Participating wards implemented a sedative-hypnotic reduction bundle (i.e., order set changes, audit-feedback, pharmacist-enabled medication reviews, sleep hygiene, daily sleep huddles, and staff/patient/family education) aimed to reduce in-hospital sedative-hypnotic initiation for insomnia in patients who were previously naÃ¯ve to sedative-hypnotics. Each inpatient ward adapted the bundle prior to sustaining the intervention for a minimum of 16 months. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of sedative-hypnotic-naÃ¯ve inpatients newly prescribed a sedative-hypnotic for sleep in hospital. Secondary measures include prescribing rates of other sedating medications, fall rates, length of stay, and mortality.

DRS had greater impacts on daytime functioning than any other kind of NA or other insomnia symptoms with odds ratios five to seven times higher than individuals waking up once or twice within the same night. Individuals with painful physical condition or with a psychiatric disorder were more than four times more likely to have DRS. Other significant factors associated with NA were hypertension, cardio-vascular disease, upper airway disease, diabetes, and heavy caffeine consumption. Nocturnal awakenings are highly prevalent in the general population and strongly associated with various physical diseases and psychiatric disorders.

Rats were raised in a strong-light (10,000 LUX) and -noise (>80 db) environment (12 h/d) for 16 weeks to induce insomnia, and from week 10 to week 16, MT and DOE were correspondingly administered to rats. The behavior tests including sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep experiment, sucrose preference test, and autonomous activity test were used to evaluate changes in sleep and emotions of rats. The metabolic-related indicators such as blood pressure, blood viscosity, blood glucose, and uric acid in rats were measured. The pathological changes in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of rat brain were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. Additionally, the sleep-related factors gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (GA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, we screened potential sleep-improving receptors of DOE using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array and validated the results with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. DOE significantly improved rats' sleep and mood, increased the sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep time and sucrose preference index, and reduced autonomic activity times (P<0.05 or P<0.01). DOE also had a good effect on metabolic abnormalities, significantly reducing triglyceride, blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood viscosity indicators (P<0.05 or P<0.01). DOE significantly increased the GABA content in hippocampus and reduced the GA/GABA ratio and IL-6 level (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

The normal distribution of the Number of Cycles and Mean Cycle Duration was confirmed. Q-Q plots were very close to linearity. This distribution allows the use of these variables in parametric comparisons. The Number of Cycles per night and the Mean Cycle Duration showed predominant links with REM sleep-related variables, such as the REM Latency, REM sleep duration, the REM/NREM sleep ratio. None of these variables was associated with the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, nor the intensity of Depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (short version).

Despite the negative impact of poor sleep on mind and body, most people do not seek treatment. This study aimed to examine the strategies used to improve sleep in the general population with a particular focus on music. A survey was distributed via Facebook advertisements to Danish adults aged â¥18âyears. Among 3667 responders, a representative subsample of 1195 participants was randomly selected based on age and sex. Data analysis involved chi-square tests and logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, education, and insomnia status. The results showed that nearly all participants utilised strategies to aid their sleep, with the most common strategies being 'following a routine' (73%), 'reducing caffeine in the afternoon/evening' (65%) and 'lowering the temperature in the bedroom' (62%). Individuals with insomnia utilised significantly more strategies (average 8.4 strategies) compared to those without insomnia (average 6.6 strategies). Among all participants, 20% reported using music for sleep at least 1-2âtimes/month, whereas 11% used music for sleep weekly, and 4.5% used music almost daily. Music users tended to be younger, and they were also more likely to have insomnia. By evaluating 24 different sleep strategies, this study shows that people do several things to promote sleep in their daily lives. These findings enhance our understanding of sleep behaviour, providing an important fundament for targeting future public health interventions to reduce the use of sleep disruptive strategies and promote strategies known to improve sleep health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39972405/"}

Like many neurologic disorders, a detailed history and physical examination are critical in the evaluation of patients with sleepiness or sleeplessness. Patients who have neurologic disorders are more likely to have poor-quality sleep. Questions about the patient's sleep schedule or screening patients for common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are useful to add to a typical neurologic evaluation to better recognize sleep disorders in this population.

However, it is yet to be determined whether this link is mediated by known cardiovascular risk factors. The current study aimed at investigating the association between primary insomnia, defined as subjectively reported sleep disturbance in the absence of any other pathology or substance intake, and alterations in polysomnographically determined nocturnal heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). A total of 4,581 nocturnal short-term electrocardiographic recordings (5 min each) from 104 participants (58 with primary insomnia, 46 healthy controls) were evaluated for HR as well as for time and frequency domain measures of HRV. In the primary insomnia group, we found a lower wake-to-sleep HR reduction and a lower standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) compared to healthy controls. However, between-group differences in resting HR were not found, and previous results of an increase in sympathovagal balance and a decrease in parasympathetic nocturnal activity in objectively determined insomnia could not be confirmed in our sample of self-report insomnia patients. When restricting our analyses to insomnia patients with objectively determined short sleep duration, we found reduced parasympathetic activity as indicated by decreased high frequency power of HRV, as well as decreased root mean square of successive RRI differences (RMSSD) and percentage of successive RRIs that differ by more than 50 ms (pNN50) values. A lower wake-to-sleep HR reduction and alterations in HRV variables might, at least partially, mediate the increased rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in insomnia patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20626615/"}

It is commonly delivered as part of multicomponent cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT-I) but has also been linked to beneficial effects as a standalone intervention. In order to quantify the efficacy of SRT we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SRT to minimally active or non-active control groups. Primary outcomes were self-reported insomnia severity and sleep diary metrics at post-treatment. Weighted effect sizes were calculated with Hedges' g and risk of bias was assessed by two independent raters with the Cochrane tool. Our search yielded eight RCTs meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Random effects models revealed large treatment effects in favour of SRT versus control for insomnia severity measured with the insomnia severity index (gÂ =Â -0.93; 95% CIÂ =Â -1.15,Â -0.71), sleep efficiency (gÂ =Â 0.91; 95% CIÂ =Â 0.52, 1.31), sleep onset latency (gÂ =Â -0.62; 95% CIÂ =Â -0.84,Â -0.40), and wake-time after sleep onset (gÂ =Â -0.83; 95% CIÂ =Â -1.11,Â -0.55). No effects were found for total sleep time (gÂ =Â 0.02; 95% CIÂ =Â -0.29, 0.34). Results should be interpreted in the context of the small number of comparisons (â¤6 per outcome), high risk of bias (6 out of 8 studies met criteria for high risk), and heterogeneity in study design and SRT administration. Only a small number of studies provided outcomes at follow-up (nÂ â¤Â 3), hindering assessment of long-term effects. Sleep restriction therapy effectively improves insomnia severity and sleep continuity in the short term; more studies are needed to assess if effects are sustained at long-term follow-up (>3Â m). Post-treatment effect sizes appear as large as multicomponent CBT-I. To reduce risk of bias, future studies should consider testing the effects of SRT against control groups that are matched for non-specific treatment effects. Large-scale pragmatic trials are also needed to test if SRT is effective in clinical practise and to quantify effects on daytime functioning and quality of life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"}

Randomised controlled trial of patients in urban general practice settings in Auckland, New Zealand. Adults with persistent primary insomnia and no mental health or significant comorbidity were eligible. Intervention patients received SSR instructions and sleep hygiene advice. Control patients received sleep hygiene advice alone. Primary outcomes included change in sleep quality at 6 months measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and sleep efficiency (SE%). The proportion of participants reaching a predefined 'insomnia remission' treatment response was calculated. Ninety-seven patients were randomised and 94 (97%) completed the study.

Outcome measures included a diagnostic interview for assessment of insomnia disorder, 3-day actigraphy and sleep diary, and serial salivary cortisol measurement. Adults with insomnia had a significantly greater cortisol awakening response (CAR) reference to increase (CARi) but a comparable CAR reference to ground and a comparable cortisol level during afternoon and evening when compared with noninsomniac adults. The association between insomnia disorder and larger CARi was also found in adolescents at late/post puberty but not in pre/early pubertal adolescents. There was an interaction effect between sex and insomnia disorder on CARi level with adult females having larger CARi than adult males. Among subjects with insomnia disorder, those with lower subjective sleep efficiency had higher cortisol levels in the late evening (10:00 pm) in both adults and adolescents. Our study suggests that a series of insomniac indices at both syndromal and symptomatic levels including clinical diagnosis and poor sleep quality are associated with dysfunction of the HPA axis.

However, the effect of alcohol on sleep in P or alcohol non-preferring (NP) rats is unknown. Since alcohol consumption has tremendous impact on sleep, the present study compared the effects of binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness in P and NP rats. Using standard surgical procedures, the P and NP rats were bilaterally implanted with sleep recording electrodes. Following post-operative recovery and habituation, pre-ethanol (baseline) sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 48 h. Subsequently, ethanol was administered beginning with a priming dose of 5 g/Kg followed by two doses of 2 g/Kg every 8 h on the first day and three doses of 3 g/Kg/8 h on the second day. On the following day (post-ethanol), undisturbed sleep-wakefulness was electrographically recorded for 24 h. Our initial results suggest that, during baseline conditions, the time spent in each of the three behavioral states: wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, was comparable between P and NP rats. However, the P rats were more susceptible to changes in sleep-wakefulness following 2 days of binge ethanol treatment. As compared to NP rats, the P rats displayed insomnia like symptoms including a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in NREM sleep coupled with a significant increase in wakefulness on post-ethanol day. Subsequent analysis revealed that binge ethanol induced increased wakefulness and reduced NREM sleep in P rats occurred mainly in the dark period. This is the first study that: (1) demonstrates spontaneous sleep-wake profile in P and NP rats, and (2) compares the effects of binge ethanol treatment on sleep in P and NP rats.

It is unknown whether this subjective-objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture 'wake-like' brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro- and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought-like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37678561/"}

As one falls asleep, neurotransmitters from sleep-wake regulating neurones work in synergy to control the switching of different sleep states throughout the night. As sleep disorders or underlying neuropathology can manifest as irregular switching, analysing these patterns is crucial in sleep medicine and neuroscience. While hypnograms represent the switching of sleep states well, current analyses of hypnograms often rely on oversimplified temporal descriptive statistics (TDS, e.g., total time spent in a sleep state), which miss the opportunity to study the sleep state switching by overlooking the complex structures of hypnograms. In this paper, we propose analysing sleep hypnograms using a seven-state continuous-time Markov model (CTMM). This proposed model leverages the CTMM to depict the time-varying sleep-state transitions, and probes three types of insomnia by distinguishing three types of wake states. Fitting the proposed model to data from 2056 ageing adults in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study, we profiled sleep architectures in this population and identified the various associations between the sleep state transitions and demographic factors and subjective sleep questions. Ageing, sex, and race all show distinctive patterns of sleep state transitions. Furthermore, we also found that the perception of insomnia and restless sleep are significantly associated with critical transitions in the sleep architecture. By incorporating three wake states in a continuous-time Markov model, our proposed method reveals interesting insights into the relationships between objective hypnogram data and subjective sleep quality assessments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39289841/"}

A comprehensive set of sleep architecture features previously associated with hyperarousal were retrospectively analysed focusing on sleep-wake transition probabilities, electroencephalographic spectra and sleep spindles, and enriched with a novel machine learning algorithm called the Wake Electroencephalographic Similarity Index. This analysis included 1710 individuals with insomnia and 1455 individuals without insomnia. Results indicate that individuals with insomnia had a higher likelihood of waking from all sleep stages, and showed increased relative alpha during Wake and N1 sleep and increased theta power during Wake when compared with individuals without insomnia. Relative delta power was decreased and Wake Electroencephalographic Similarity Index scores were elevated across all sleep stages except N3, suggesting more wake-like activity during these stages in individuals with insomnia. Additionally, sleep spindle density was decreased, and spindle dispersion was increased in individuals with insomnia.

By follow-up, however, TST increases by almost 1 hour on average. A secondary analysis was undertaken to assess what percentage of participants meet or appreciably exceed baseline TST after cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial assessing acute and maintenance therapies for chronic insomnia (n = 80). The present analyses assessed the percentage of participants that 1) reached (â¥ 0 minute increase) and 2) appreciably exceeded (â¥ 30 minutes increase) baseline TST as assessed via daily sleep diaries at posttreatment and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following treatment. By the end of acute treatment, 45% of participants reached or exceeded baseline TST. By 24 months follow-up, this percentage had increased to 86%. Only 17% of participants achieved a 30-minute increase in TST by the end of acute treatment, and this proportion only increased to 58% over time. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in its current form does not appreciably increase self-reported TST in a significant proportion of patients with insomnia. Whether participants would benefit from further increases in TST warrants investigation. The further titration of sleep opportunity may be useful to accelerate increases in TST, to extend the effect to a larger subset of patients, and/or to increase the magnitude of the TST gain.

However, individualized administration is costly and often results in substantial variability in treatment response across individual patients, particularly so for older adults. Group-based administration has demonstrated impressive potential for a brief and inexpensive answer to the effective treatment of insomnia in the older population. It is important to identify potential predictors of response to such a treatment format to guide clinicians when selecting the most suitable treatment for their patients. The aim of our study was to identify factors that predict subjective sleep quality of older adults following group-based administration of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Eighty-six adults (41 men; mean age, 64.10 y; standard deviation [SD], 6.80) with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening insomnia were selected from a community-based sample to participate in a 4-week group-based treatment program of CBT-I. Participants were required to complete 7-day sleep diaries and a comprehensive battery of questionnaires related to sleep quality and daytime functioning. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to identify factors predicting subjective sleep quality immediately following treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Sleep diaries reported average nightly sleep efficiency (SE), which was used as the outcome measure of sleep quality. Participants with the greatest SE following treatment while controlling for pretreatment SE were relatively younger and had more confidence in their ability to sleep at pretreatment.

This study compared the effects of a trauma-focused and a non-trauma-focused psychotherapy on sleep, to investigate whether 1) sleep improves with psychotherapy for PTSD; 2) the degree of sleep improvement depends on whether the intervention is trauma or nontrauma-focused; 3) the memory-updating procedure in cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) is associated with sleep improvements; 4) initial sleep duration affects PTSD treatment outcome; and 5) which symptom changes are associated with sleep duration improvements. Self-reported sleep was assessed during a randomized controlled trial (Ehlers etÂ al., 2014) comparing CT-PTSD (delivered weekly or intensively over 7-days) with emotion-focused supportive therapy, and a waitlist. Sleep duration was reported daily in sleep diaries during intensive CT-PTSD. CT-PTSD led to greater increases in sleep duration (55.2Â min) and reductions in insomnia symptoms and nightmares than supportive therapy and the waitlist. In intensive CT-PTSD, sleep duration improved within 7 days, and sleep diaries indicated a 40-min sleep duration increase after updating trauma memories. Initial sleep duration was not related to CT-PTSD treatment outcome when initial PTSD symptom severity was controlled. The results suggest that trauma-focused psychotherapy for PTSD is more effective than nontrauma-focused therapy in improving self-reported sleep, and that CT-PTSD can still be effective in the presence of reduced sleep duration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28732289/"}

We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence sleep prediction model and to find factors associated with good sleep using a wrist-worn actigraphy device. We enrolled 109 participants who reported having no sleep disturbances. We developed a sleep prediction model using 733 days of actigraphy data of physical activity and light exposure. Twenty-four sleep prediction models were developed based on different data sources (actigraphy alone, sleep diary alone, or combined data), different durations of data (1 or 2 days), and different analysis methods (extreme gradient boosting, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, logistic regression analysis). The outcome measure of \"good sleep\" was defined as â¥ 90% sleep efficiency. Actigraphy model performance was comparable to sleep diary model performance. Two-day models generally performed better than 1-day models. Among all models, the 2-day, combined (actigraphy and sleep diary), extreme gradient boosting model had the best performance for predicting good sleep (accuracy = 0.69, area under the curve = 0.70). The findings suggested that it is possible to develop automated sleep models with good predictive performance. Further research including patients with insomnia is needed for clinical application.

In this article, we provide a narrative review of the literature on sleep disturbance and CM, highlighting recent advances in sleep research and insights into mechanisms that could mediate a role of sleep disturbances in migraine chronification. We discuss the potential for cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (CBTi) as an intervention for CM with comorbid insomnia. Finally, we propose a model of the mechanisms underlying the interactions among sleep physiology, maladaptive migraine-coping behaviors, and coexisting factors which contribute to sleep disturbances in CM based on conceptual models used in sleep research. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint among patients with CM. CM patients experience more frequent and severe insomnia symptoms than patients with episodic migraine (EM). It has been suggested that sleep disturbances may predispose individuals to migraine attacks, which may affect the pain-processing trigeminovascular system and thus play a role in migraine progression. Encouraging but limited evidence suggests that management of insomnia via behavioral sleep therapy may reverse CM to EM and possibly prevent migraine chronification. Migraine has a complex relationship with sleep. The use of objective sleep study such as polysomnographic microstructural sleep analysis and actigraphy could help connect sleep disturbances and processes related to CM. Future longitudinal studies should examine whether effective behavioral treatments such as CBTi can reverse migraine chronification.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28785964/"}

Although subjective complaints are severe, polysomnography (PSG) parameters show only modest differences between groups. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as the most aroused sleep state may be especially vulnerable to be perceived as wake. To directly assess possible differences, we determined auditory waking thresholds and sleep perception in patients with ID and healthy control participants (good sleeper controls [GSC]) in N2 and REM sleep. In case-control study, 27 patients with ID and 27 age- and gender-matched controls were included. Four consecutive nights were assessed in the sleep laboratory, with nights 3 and 4 each containing three awakenings either from stable N2 or REM sleep. Awakening thresholds in patients with ID did not differ from GSC, but decreased over the course of the night. Patients with ID indicated significantly more frequently than GSC having been awake when woken from REM sleep but not from N2 and were less sure when indicating they had been asleep. Additionally, participants with ID rated their REM sleep mentation as more emotionally negative compared with GSC. This study presents direct evidence that the subjective experience of insomnia might be specifically coupled to the REM sleep state. Assuming chronic hyperarousal as a central pathophysiologically relevant pathway for insomnia, this might become especially evident during REM sleep, thus reflecting a hybrid sleep state in insomnia being coupled with altered sleep perception.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29432570/"}

Longitudinal studies that recruited 100 or more pregnant or postpartum women with at least three sleep assessments during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum, and modeled independent sleep health trajectories using trajectory analysis methods were included. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the pooled prevalence of nonoptimal sleep health trajectories. The prevalence was compared across geographical regions by subgroup meta-analysis. Group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was used to reidentify clusters of sleep health trajectories if available. Five studies modeled a single trajectory, and the other 12 studies identified two to four distinct trajectories. The pooled prevalence of nonoptimal sleep quality and duration trajectories was 36% and 22%, respectively. The mean prevalence of the nonoptimal sleep efficiency trajectory was 15%, while the prevalence of delayed bedtime, late wake-up time, and clinical insomnia trajectories was reported as 51%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. Nonoptimal sleep trajectories were associated with higher risks of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Low socioeconomic status, high pre-pregnancy body mass index, poor baseline sleep quality and self-reported health, and high initial levels of fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were key factors associated with these trajectories.
