This review highlights sleep's instrumental biological functions, various sleep problems, and sleep hygiene and lifestyle interventions that can help improve sleep quality. Quality sleep allows for improved cardiovascular health, mental health, cognition, memory consolidation, immunity, reproductive health, and hormone regulation. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders, or disrupted sleep from lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, or other medical issues can lead to significant morbidity and can contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The best treatment for long-term sleep improvement is proper sleep hygiene through behavior and sleep habit modification. Recommendations to improve sleep include achieving 7 to 9 h of sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep/wake schedule, a regular bedtime routine, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting a contemplative practice. In addition, avoiding many substances late in the day can help improve sleep. Caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and light exposure later in the day are associated with fragmented poor-quality sleep. These sleep hygiene practices can promote better quality and duration of sleep, with corresponding health benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36841492/"}

In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of \"sleep and memory\" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23589831/"}

Neuroimaging studies that deprived sleep after learning have provided some of the most compelling evidence for sleep's role in the long-term reorganization of memories in the brain (systems consolidation). However, the behavioral consequences of losing sleep after learning-shown by increased forgetting-appear to recover over time and are unaffected by more common forms of partial sleep restriction across several nights. The capacity to encode new memories is the most vulnerable to sleep loss, since long-term deficits have been observed after total and partial sleep deprivation, while retrieval mechanisms are relatively unaffected. The negative impact of sleep loss on memory has been explored extensively after a night of total sleep deprivation, but further research is needed on the consequences of partial sleep loss over many days so that impairments may be generalized to more common forms of sleep loss.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31072562/"}

To enhance the quality of sleep, reduce the consumption of caffeine in the afternoon and evening, refrain from drinking caffeine before going to bed, and choose decaffeinated drinks instead. Variables such as personal reactions, ability to handle caffeine, and engagement with other compounds also influence the impact of coffee on sleep. Keeping track of how much caffeine you consume and your sleeping habits can assist in recognizing any disturbances and making needed changes.

Since sleep, unlike other physiological functions, cannot be attributed to a specific organ, there was no distinct method available to study sleep until then. With the development of physiology and psychology, and a rapidly increasing knowledge of the structure and functioning of the nervous system, certain aspects of sleep became accessible to objective study. A first step was to measure responsiveness to external stimuli systematically, during sleep, allowing a first representation of the course of sleep (Schlaftiefe = sleep depth). A second method was to register continuously the motor activity across the sleep-wake cycle, which allowed the documentation in detail of rest-activity patterns of monophasic and polyphasic sleep-wake rhythms, or between day or night active animals. The central measurement for sleep research, however, became the electroencephalogram in the 1930s, which allowed observation of the sleeping brain with high temporal resolution. Beside the development of instruments to measure sleep, prolonged sleep deprivation was applied to study physiological and psychological effects of sleep loss. Another input came from clinical and neuropathological observations of patients with pronounced disorders of the sleep-wake cycle, which for the first time allowed localisation of brain areas that are essentially involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Experimental brain stimulation and lesion studies were carried out with the same aim at this time. Many of these activities came to a halt on the eve of World War II. It was only in the early 1950s, when periods with rapid eye movements during sleep were recognised, that sleep became a research topic of itself. Jouvet and his team explored the brain mechanisms and transmitters of paradoxical sleep, and experimental sleep research became established in all European countries. Sleep medicine evolving simultaneously in different countries, with early centres in Italy and France. In the late 1960s sleep research and chronobiology began to merge. In recent decades, sleep research, dream research, and sleep medicine have benefited greatly from new methods in genetic research and brain imaging techniques. Genes were identified that are involved in the regulation of sleep, circadian rhythms, or sleep disorders. Functional imaging enabled a high spatial resolution of the activity of the sleeping brain, complementing the high temporal resolution of the electroencephalogram.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35522132/"}

Sleep promotes both the consolidation of memory and the regulation of emotion. Sleep can influence consolidation and modification of memories associated with both fear and its extinction. After brief overviews of the behavior and neural circuitry associated with fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction memory in the rodent and human, interactions of sleep with these processes will be examined. Animal and human studies suggest that sleep can serve to consolidate both fear and extinction memory. In humans, sleep also promotes generalization of extinction memory. Time-of-day effects on extinction learning and generalization are also seen. Rapid eye movement (REM) may be a sleep stage of particular importance for the consolidation of both fear and extinction memory as evidenced by selective REM deprivation experiments. REM sleep is accompanied by selective activation of the same limbic structures implicated in the learning and memory of fear and extinction. Preliminary evidence also suggests extinction learning can take place during slow wave sleep. Study of low-level processes such as conditioning, extinction, and habituation may allow sleep effects on emotional memory to be identified and inform study of sleep's effects on more complex, emotionally salient declarative memories. Anxiety disorders are marked by impairments of both sleep and extinction memory. Improving sleep quality may ameliorate anxiety disorders by strengthening naturally acquired extinction. Strategically timed sleep may be used to enhance treatment of anxiety by strengthening therapeutic extinction learned via exposure therapy.

MAs are hence part of healthy sleep dynamics, raising questions about their biological roles. We propose that MAs bolster NREM sleep's benefits associated with NA fluctuations, according to an inverted U-shaped curve. Weakened noradrenergic fluctuations, as may occur in neurodegenerative diseases or with sleep aids, reduce MAs, whereas exacerbated fluctuations caused by stress fragment NREM sleep and collapse NA signaling.

However, the function of sleep still remains elusive. The difficulty with unraveling sleep's function may arise from the lack of understanding of how the multitude of processes associated with waking and sleep-from gene expression and single neuron activity to the whole brain dynamics and behavior-functionally and mechanistically relate to each other. Therefore, novel conceptual frameworks, which integrate and take into account the variety of phenomena occurring during waking and sleep at different levels, will likely lead to advances in our understanding of the function of sleep, above and beyond what merely descriptive or correlative approaches can provide. One such framework, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, focuses on wake- and sleep-dependent changes in synaptic strength. The core claim of this hypothesis is that learning and experience during wakefulness are associated with a net increase in synaptic strength. In turn, the proposed function of sleep is to provide synaptic renormalization, which has important implications with respect to energy needs, intracranial space, metabolic supplies, and, importantly, enables further plastic changes. In this article we review the empirical evidence for this hypothesis, which was obtained at several levels-from gene expression and cellular excitability to structural synaptic modifications and behavioral outcomes.

The review included primary research measuring sleep and hypoglycaemia symptom perception in adults (age ≥ 18 years) with type-1 diabetes in English. Studies that exclusively addressed children, type-2 diabetes or outcomes unrelated to sleep and hypoglycaemia symptom perception were excluded. Screening focused on title and abstract review (n = 624). Studies not excluded after screening (n = 35) underwent full-text review.

All studies included in the review (n = 7) were critically appraised with JBI Critical Appraisal tools, and then data were extracted with systematic evaluation. Quantitative synthesis found sleep reduces the magnitude of detectable symptoms and one's capacity to detect them.

In some skill domains, performance has been shown to improve by 20% or more following sleep, suggesting that sleep enhances learning. However, recent work suggests that those performance gains may be driven by several factors that are unrelated to sleep consolidation, inviting a reconsideration of sleep's theoretical role in the consolidation of procedural memories. Here we report the first comprehensive investigation of that possibility for the case of motor sequence learning. Quantitative meta-analyses involving 34 articles, 88 experimental groups and 1,296 subjects confirmed the empirical pattern of a large performance gain following sleep and a significantly smaller gain following wakefulness. However, the results also confirm strong moderating effects of 4 previously hypothesized variables: averaging in the calculation of prepost gain scores, build-up of reactive inhibition over training, time of testing, and training duration, along with 1 supplemental variable, elderly status. With those variables accounted for, there was no evidence that sleep enhances learning. Thus, the literature speaks against, rather than for, the enhancement hypothesis. Overall there was relatively better performance after sleep than after wakefulness, suggesting that sleep may stabilize memory. That effect, however, was not consistent across different experimental designs. We conclude that sleep does not enhance motor learning and that the role of sleep in the stabilization of memory cannot be conclusively determined based on the literature to date. We discuss challenges and opportunities for the field, make recommendations for improved experimental design, and suggest approaches to data analysis that eliminate confounds due to averaging over online learning.

With mild cognitive impairment (MCI) there are further reductions of sleep quality, SWS, spindles, and percent REM, all of which further diminish, along with a profound disruption of circadian rhythmicity, with the conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep disorders may represent risk factors for dementias (e.g., REM Behavior Disorder presages Parkinson's disease) and sleep disorders are themselves extremely prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases. Working memory , formation of new episodic memories, and processing speed all decline with healthy aging whereas semantic, recognition, and emotional declarative memory are spared. In MCI, episodic and working memory further decline along with declines in semantic memory. In young adults, sleep-dependent memory consolidation (SDC) is widely observed for both declarative and procedural memory tasks. However, with healthy aging, although SDC for declarative memory is preserved, certain procedural tasks, such as motor-sequence learning, do not show SDC. In younger adults, fragmentation of sleep can reduce SDC, and a normative increase in sleep fragmentation may account for reduced SDC with healthy aging. Whereas sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and narcolepsy can impair SDC in the absence of neurodegenerative changes, the incidence of sleep disorders increases both with normal aging and, further, with neurodegenerative disease. Specific features of sleep architecture, such as sleep spindles and SWS are strongly linked to SDC. Diminution of these features with healthy aging and their further decline with MCI may account for concomitant declines in SDC. Notably these same sleep features further markedly decline, in concert with declining cognitive function, with the progression to AD. Therefore, progressive changes in sleep quality, architecture, and neural regulation may constitute a contributing factor to cognitive decline that is seen both with healthy aging and, to a much greater extent, with neurodegenerative disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24652608/"}
{"id": "33827411", "title": "Sleep, Narcolepsy, and Sodium Oxybate.", "text": "Sodium oxybate (SO) has been in use for many decades to treat narcolepsy with cataplexy. It functions as a weak GABAB agonist but also as an energy source for the brain as a result of its metabolism to succinate and as a powerful antioxidant because of its capacity to induce the formation of NADPH. Its actions at thalamic GABAB receptors can induce slow-wave activity, while its actions at GABAB receptors on monoaminergic neurons can induce or delay REM sleep. By altering the balance between monoaminergic and cholinergic neuronal activity, SO uniquely can induce and prevent cataplexy. The formation of NADPH may enhance sleep's restorative process by accelerating the removal of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulate during wakefulness. SO improves alertness in normal subjects and in patients with narcolepsy. SO may allay severe psychological stress - an inflammatory state triggered by increased levels of ROS and characterized by cholinergic supersensitivity and monoaminergic deficiency. SO may be able to eliminate the inflammatory state and correct the cholinergic/ monoaminergic imbalance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33827411/"}

High CI (a ratio of skull width to skull length > 60) is characterized by a short muzzle and flat face and is referred to as brachycephaly. Brachycephalic dogs display some potentially harmful changes in neuroanatomy, and there are implications for differences in behavior, as well. The path from anatomy to cognition, however, has not been charted in its entirety. Here, we report that sleep-physiological markers of white-matter loss (high delta power, low frontal spindle frequency, i.e., spindle waves/s), along with a spectral profile for REM (low beta, high delta) associated with low intelligence in humans, are each linked to higher CI values in the dog. Additionally, brachycephalic subjects spent more time sleeping, suggesting that the sleep apnea these breeds usually suffer from increases daytime sleepiness. Within sleep, more time was spent in the REM sleep stage than in non-REM, while REM duration was correlated positively with the number of REM episodes across dogs. It is currently not clear if the patterns of sleep and sleep-stage duration are mainly caused by sleep-impairing troubles in breathing and thermoregulation, present a juvenile-like sleeping profile, or are caused by neuro-psychological conditions secondary to the effects of brachycephaly, e.g., frequent REM episodes are known to appear in human patients with depression. While future studies should more directly address the interplay of anatomy, physiology, and behavior within a single experiment, this represents the first description of how the dynamics of the canine brain covary with CI, as measured in resting companion dogs using a non-invasive sleep EEG methodology. The observations suggest that the neuroanatomical changes accompanying brachycephaly alter neural systems in a way that can be captured in the sleep EEG, thus supporting the utility of the latter in the study of canine brain health and function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37742302/"}

The complexity of sleep architecture varies between species but all share features which are comparable. In addition, sleep architecture is sensitive to changes in brain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, so cross-species sleep measurement can be combined with pharmacological manipulation to investigate the receptor mechanisms controlling sleep-wake regulation and sleep architecture in response to known and novel agents.

Associations of reduced sleep with poorer school performance beg the question of how prelearning and posttraining sleep affect the learning process. Thus, insufficient sleep can impair acquisition and retrieval when sleep reduction results in sleepiness, irritability, distractibility, inattention, and lack of motivation.

We summarize some basic questions that have arisen from recent approaches in the quest for the functions of sleep. Whereas traditionally sleep was viewed to be regulated through top-down control mechanisms, recent approaches have emphasized that sleep is emerging locally and regulated in a use-dependent (homeostatic) manner. Traditional markers of sleep homeostasis, such as the electroencephalogram slow-wave activity, have been linked to changes in connectivity and plasticity in local neuronal networks. Thus waking experience-induced local network changes may be sensed by the sleep homeostatic process and used to mediate sleep-dependent events, benefiting network stabilization and memory consolidation. Although many questions remain unanswered, the available data suggest that sleep function will best be understood by an analysis which integrates sleep's many functional levels with its local homeostatic regulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473236/"}

Memory weakening is evolutionary beneficial and makes an integral contribution to cognition. We sought evidence on whether sleep-based memory reactivation can facilitate memory suppression. Participants learned pairs of associable words (e.g., DIET-CREAM) and were then exposed to hint words (e.g., DIET) and instructed to either recall (\"think\") or suppress (\"no-think\") the corresponding target words (e.g., CREAM). As expected, suppression impaired retention when tested immediately after a 90-min nap. To test if reactivation could selectively enhance memory suppression during sleep, we unobtrusively presented one of two sounds conveying suppression instructions during sleep, followed by hint words. Results showed that targeted memory reactivation did not enhance suppression-induced forgetting. Although not predicted, post-hoc analyses revealed that sleep cues strengthened memory, but only for suppressed pairs that were weakly encoded before sleep. The results leave open the question of whether memory suppression can be augmented during sleep, but suggest strategies for future studies manipulating memory suppression during sleep. Additionally, our findings support the notion that sleep reactivation is particularly beneficial for weakly encoded information, which may be prioritized for consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33446812/"}

One important aspect of sleep concerns its homeostatic regulation, which ensures that levels of sleep need are kept within a range still allowing optimal functioning during wakefulness. Uncovering the genetic pathways underlying the homeostatic aspect of sleep is of particular importance because it could lead to insights concerning sleep's still elusive function and is therefore a main focus of current sleep research. In this chapter, we first give a definition of sleep homeostasis and describe the molecular genetics techniques that are used to examine it.

Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories, redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them to decontextualized schema-like representations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations regulate the underlying communication: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples coalescing with thalamic spindles mediate the bottom-up transfer of reactivated memory information to extrahippocampal regions. Neocortical slow oscillations exert a supraordinate top-down control to synchronize hippocampal reactivations of specific memories to their excitable up-phase, thus allowing plastic changes in extrahippocampal regions.

Here, we investigated in healthy participants whether a 90-min nap compared to wake supports the adaptive reconsolidation of autobiographical memories. Forty-four university students received a single 50-min imagery rescripting session. Thereafter, half of the participants took a 90-min nap, whereas the other half stayed awake.

Central sleep spindle density during the nap was correlated with the reduction in HR in response to the negative memory script from pre to post 1.

In general, women have shorter respiratory events compared to men as it appears that women have a more reactive upper airway contributing to the occurrence of short events. In addition, the increased amount of adipose tissue in the upper airways should make the reopening of the upper airways more difficult, leading to long respiratory events. Nevertheless, an increase in body mass index decreases the median duration of apneas, hypopneas, and desaturations in all OSA severity categories. Also, respiratory events are longer in older adults compared to younger ones, and the most likely mechanism explaining this phenomenon appears to be the increased circulatory delay associated with aging. Several studies have also shown that apnea events are longer in rapid eye movement sleep compared to non-rapid eye movement sleep. The main mechanism behind these differences appears to be the greater pharyngeal muscle relaxation during rapid eye movement sleep. Finally, sleeping position affects the duration of respiratory events; apneas and hypopneas are longer in the supine compared to lateral postures regardless of the severity of OSA.

This modulation may enhance survival by optimizing stress responses while fulfilling physiological needs in animals. Insights into REM sleep's role in animals may shed light on human sleep in the context of modern stressors and sleep disruptions. This review also explores the complex interplay between stress, immunity, sleep disruptions-particularly involving REM sleep-and their evolutionary underpinnings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40273975/"}

It is less clear whether sleep plays a role in other aspects of experience-dependent neuroplasticity, which underlie important human capabilities such as spoken language processing. Theories of sensory learning differ in their predictions; some imply rapid learning at early sensory levels, while other propose a slow, progressive timecourse such that higher-level categorical representations guide immediate, novice learning, while lower-level sensory changes do not emerge until later stages. In this study, we investigated the role of sleep across both behavioural and physiological indices of auditory neuroplasticity. Forty healthy young human adults (23 female) who did not speak a tonal language participated in the study. They learned to categorize non-native Mandarin lexical tones using a sound-to-category training paradigm, and were then randomly assigned to a Nap or Wake condition. Polysomnographic data were recorded to quantify sleep during a 3 h afternoon nap opportunity, or equivalent period of quiet wakeful activity. Measures of behavioural performance accuracy revealed a significant improvement in learning the sound-to-category training paradigm between Nap and Wake groups. Conversely, a neural index of fine sound encoding fidelity of speech sounds known as the frequency-following response (FFR) suggested no change due to sleep, and a null model was supported, using Bayesian statistics. Together, these results support theories that propose a slow, progressive and hierarchical timecourse for sensory learning. Sleep's effect may play the biggest role in the higher-level learning, although contributions to more protracted processes of plasticity that exceed the study duration cannot be ruled out.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732089/"}

An artificial neural network classifier was used to integrate the results of ten binary support vector machine classifiers and realise sleep-stage classification. Leave-one-subject-out validation was applied to evaluate our proposed model. Thirty-one subjects were enrolled in the study, in which 21 subjects were with high sleep quality (sleep efficiencies ⩾85%). Our model achieved accuracies of 57% (κ = 0.39), 62% (κ = 0.41), and 78% (κ = 0.54) for the classification of five sleep stages (wake, N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleeps), four sleep stages (wake, light, deep, and REM sleeps) and three sleep stages (wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM), and REM sleeps), respectively. For the remaining ten subjects with poor sleep quality, the results came to 55% (κ = 0.39), 62% (κ = 0.43), and 75% (κ = 0.52).

Sleep deprivation accelerates skin aging and reduces collagen production. Good sleep may be a potential adjuvant to the efficacy of oral supplementation with collagenic peptides for the skin. To summarize clinical benefits to the skin of collagen intake, and consider the role of sleep in its effectiveness. Studies in the PubMed database that reported the effects of oral administration of collagen peptides were searched; and studies presenting the association of collagen metabolism with sleep. A total of 1117 articles were initially identified; 66 were reviewed in full. Most involved women at third or fourth decade of life. Daily collagen doses ranged from 1 to 10 g, with intervention periods lasting from 4 to 8 weeks. Consistent improvements in skin elasticity, hydration, and wrinkle reduction were observed, with increase in dermal density and structural proteins. Collagen combined with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants provided additional benefits, including improved skin radiance and reduced pore size. Studies on sleep and skin indicated that poor sleep can impair skin hydration, increase transepidermic water loss, and reduce elasticity, highlighting the potential role of sleep in maximizing the benefits of collagen supplementation. Hydrolyzed collagen supplementation, particularly at 2.5 g/day, has shown benefits for skin after 4 weeks of use. Sleep quality may enhance these effects by supporting immune function and reducing oxidative stress.

Here, we propose that an animal's social status impacts their access to sleep opportunities, as social status may predict when an animal sleeps, where they sleep, who they sleep with, and how well they sleep. Our review of terrestrial mammals examines how sleep architecture and intensity may be impacted by (1) sleeping conditions and (2) the social experience during wakefulness. Sleeping positions vary in thermoregulatory properties, protection from predators, and exposure to parasites. Thus, if dominant individuals have priority of access to sleeping positions, they may benefit from higher quality sleeping conditions and, in turn, better sleep. With respect to waking experiences, we discuss the impacts of stress on sleep, as it has been established that specific social statuses can be characterized by stress-related physiological profiles. While much research has focused on how dominance hierarchies impact access to resources like food and mating opportunities, differential access to sleep opportunities among mammals has been largely ignored despite its potential fitness consequences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35594742/"}

Recent studies have emphasized the complex relationship between sleep and cell death mechanisms. Ferroptosis is a form of iron-dependent cell death, which is related to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Sleep plays an important role in regulating brain metabolism, immune function and overall intracellular homeostasis. New evidence suggests that there is a two-way interaction between sleep and ferroptosis. Sleep interruption may enhance the ferroptosis pathway, which in turn may change the quality of sleep. Understanding this interaction is essential to reveal the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration and to develop potential therapeutic interventions. This review combines the results of current studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ferroptosis and the extensive role of sleep in brain health. Special attention is paid to the effects of sleep deprivation on iron metabolism and oxidative stress, which play an important role in ferroptosis. The review also explores the role of sleep in regulating iron homeostasis and how sleep disorders promote iron accumulation in the brain, which may accelerate the process of ferroptosis. Sleep disorders, especially chronic sleep deprivation, may create a favorable environment for ferroptosis by affecting iron metabolism and oxidative stress levels in the brain. Conversely, cell death associated with siderosis disrupts normal sleep patterns, forming a circulatory relationship that exacerbates neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the complex mechanisms of sleep and ferroptosis will provide valuable insights into aging and age-related diseases. In addition, the pathways involved in sleep regulation and ferroptosis can provide new methods for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and other ferroptosis-related pathology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40451543/"}

Overall, our results do not support this hypothesis. When only studies with a sleep group/wake group comparison were included in the analysis (k = 22), the retention advantage for emotional (negative/positive) over neutral material was not significantly different between sleep and wake groups.

Exploratory analyses suggest that sleep might initiate an enhancement of the neural representation of emotional compared to neutral memories (as reflected in the late positive potential of the electroencephalogram) that becomes pronounced after one week. These long-term effects are in contrast to sleep's immediate influence on the emotional response (i.e., 10 h after encoding), where heart rate deceleration was preserved and the late positive potential decreased when compared to the changes seen over a day of wake.

{"id": "15737792", "title": "Evolutionary approaches to understanding sleep.", "text": "A major controversy over REM sleep's role in memory processing may owe to inadequate allowances for the highly conservative nature of evolutionary adaptations. The controversy hinges on whether NREM sleep, alone, retains primitive memory processing capabilities. The selective pressure for primitive sleep, is thought to have been the need to obviate conflicts between enormous neural processing requirements of complex visual analysis and split-second control of movements, on the one hand, and memory processing, on the other. The most efficient memory processing during mammalian and avian sleep appears to be a two-step process: synapses in individual component circuits of events are reinforced primarily by slow brain waves during NREM sleep, with the reinforced components temporally bound by fast waves, and manifested as dreams, during REM sleep. This dual action could account for partitioning of sleep periods into multiple NREM-REM cycles. It is proposed that in the absence of REM sleep, all needed memory processing can be accomplished by NREM sleep, alone, though less efficiently. Many symptoms of fatal familial insomnia are attributed to subnormal nightly reinforcement of brain circuitry because of almost total loss of sleep, and compensatory responses thereto during waking. During this disorder, sensory circuitry seemingly is spared by virtue of its supernormal reinforcement during almost continuous waking. Contrariwise, sparing of an adult's 'higher faculties' in encephalitis lethargica appears to owe to supernormal circuit reinforcement during almost continuous sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15737792/"}

Clear trends were evident despite methodological differences making comparison between studies difficult. The most marked changes were across the first 4 months, particularly ages 1 and 2 months. Minimal changes followed through to 9 months and a small increase in all but the longest sustained sleep period, until age 12 months.

However, recent studies failed to replicate sleep's superiority over wake in strengthening memory against interference (Cordi & Rasch, 2021). The goal of the current study is to investigate whether sleep protects newly formed memory from unspecific interference induced by daytime experiences over 24 h, as well as to elucidate the sleep features that are involved. 56 healthy adults were randomly assigned to either the Sleep First or Wake First group. The Sleep First group encoded word pairs at night before sleep, while the Wake First group encoded word pairs in the morning before a day of wakefulness. Memory was tested 30 min, 12 h, and 24 h after encoding for both groups. The Sleep First group performed significantly better 12 h after encoding, replicating prior findings that memory is better after a period of sleep compared to wake. However, after 24 h, the two groups performed similarly. The Wake First group showed a positive correlation between overnight memory improvement and the theta and delta band power during slow wave sleep, an effect not found in the Sleep First group. These correlations suggest the possibility that after a day of waking interference, the brain recruits extra sleep resources to rescue memories from further forgetting. Our results are not consistent with prior studies showing a significant role for sleep in stabilizing memory from future interference, but they may suggest that sleep rescues memories after interference has occurred.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35439637/"}

The sleep following sleep deprivation is longer and deeper, with an increased power of delta (0.5-4 Hz) oscillations, a phenomenon termed sleep homeostasis [1-4]. Although widely expressed genes regulate sleep homeostasis [1, 4-10] and the process is tracked by somnogens and phosphorylation [1, 3, 7, 11-14], at the circuit level sleep homeostasis has remained mysterious. Previously, we found that sedation induced with α2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine) and sleep homeostasis both depend on the preoptic (PO) hypothalamus [15, 16]. Dexmedetomidine, increasingly used for long-term sedation in intensive care units [17], induces a non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM)-like sleep but with undesirable hypothermia [18, 19]. Within the PO, various neuronal subtypes (e.g., GABA/galanin and glutamate/NOS1) induce NREM sleep [20-22] and concomitant body cooling [21, 22]. This could be because NREM sleep's restorative effects depend on lower body temperature [23, 24]. Here, we show that mice with lesioned PO galanin neurons have reduced sleep homeostasis: in the recovery sleep following sleep deprivation there is a diminished increase in delta power, and the mice catch up little on lost sleep. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine cannot induce high-power delta oscillations or sustained hypothermia. Some hours after dexmedetomidine administration to wild-type mice there is a rebound in delta power when they enter normal NREM sleep, reminiscent of emergence from torpor. This delta rebound is reduced in mice lacking PO galanin neurons. Thus, sleep homeostasis and dexmedetomidine-induced sedation require PO galanin neurons and likely share common mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31543455/"}

Naps can reduce sleepiness and improve cognitive performance. The benefits of brief (5-15 min) naps are almost immediate after the nap and last a limited period (1-3h). Longer naps (> 30 min) can produce impairment from sleep inertia for a short period after waking but then produce improved cognitive performance for a longer period (up to many hours). Other factors that affect the benefits from the nap are the circadian timing of the nap with early afternoon being the most favourable time. Longer periods of prior wakefulness favour longer naps over brief naps. Those who regularly nap seem to show greater benefits than those who rarely nap. These conclusions, however, need to be accepted cautiously until more comprehensive research programmes are conducted in which all these parameters are varied. Research is also needed to test the benefits of brief naps taken more naturalistically at the time when sleepiness becomes intrusive. The significant benefits of a brief nap, containing virtually no slow wave EEG activity, are not predicted by the present theory of homeostatic sleep drive (Process S). A new biological process (Process O) suggests that sleep onset followed by only 7-10 min of sleep can result in a substantial increase of alertness because it allows the rapid dissipation of inhibition in the 'wake-active' cells associated with the 'sleep-switch' mechanism rather than the dissipation of Process S.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21075238/"}

Therefore, this research examined the day-to-day associations of sleep quality, duration, and efficiency with next-day expectations for stress(ors) and positive experiences, as well as whether these expectations were related to end-of-day reports of physical symptoms. In Study 1, U.S. adults ( n = 354; ages 19 to 74) completed twice-daily diaries for 10 weekdays about sleep, expectations for encountering daily stressors and positive events, and physical symptoms. In Study 2, adults in Canada ( n = 246; ages 25 to 87) wore a sleep watch for 14 consecutive days and completed mobile surveys 5×/day about sleep, stressfulness and pleasantness expectations, and physical symptoms. Multilevel models indicated that self-reported sleep quality and duration, but not efficiency, were associated with lower next-day expectations for stressors (Study 1) and stressfulness (Study 2). Self-reported sleep quality (Study 1) and all sleep indices (Study 2) predicted greater next-day expectations for positive events and pleasantness, respectively. For actigraphy-assessed sleep (Study 2), only longer-than-usual actigraphic sleep duration was associated with lower stressfulness expectations, whereas both sleep duration and efficiency were positively linked with daily pleasantness expectations. Only pleasantness expectations (Study 2)-but not daily stressfulness and event expectations (Study 1)-predicted end-of-day physical symptoms. Findings suggest the importance of sleep on expectations of next-day stress and positive experiences, of which may have implications for daily physical health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38513143/"}

These are high amounts of non-REM sleep time, safe sleep conditions and immaturity at birth. While these variables explain approximately 30% of the variance in REM sleep time across these orders, these relations are violated when animals other than placentals are included. Birds are small, many have safe sleeping situations and are certainly immature at birth, yet they have less REM sleep than the vast majority of mammals. The echidna is immature at birth, has high amounts of non-REM sleep and safe sleeping conditions, yet has been reported to have no REM sleep. Our recent studies in the echidna indicate that REM and non-REM sleep did not evolve sequentially, but rather evolved as a differentiation of a primitive state which held the seeds of both sleep states. The echidna sleeps with an activated brainstem and EEG synchronized forebrain. Future studies of sleep phylogeny need to compare the behavior of key neuronal groups across the sleep cycle, since these results indicate that EEG variables and sleep state durations may given an inadequate picture of the nature of brain activity during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7546315/"}

We developed the Minecraft Memory and Navigation (MMN) task for the purpose of disentangling how spatial memory accuracy and navigation change over time, and to study sleep's independent contributions to each. In the MMN task, participants learned the locations of objects through free exploration of an open field computerized environment. At test, they were teleported to random positions around the environment and required to navigate to the remembered location of each object. In study 1, we developed and validated four unique MMN environments with the goal of equating baseline learning and immediate test performance. A total of 86 participants were administered the training phases and immediate test. Participants' baseline performance was equivalent across all four environments, supporting the use of the MMN task. In study 2, 29 participants were trained, tested immediately, and again 12 h later after a period of sleep or wake. We found that the metric accuracy of object locations, i.e., spatial memory, was maintained over a night of sleep, while after wake, metric accuracy declined. In contrast, spatial navigation improved over both sleep and wake delays.

{"id": "12667495", "title": "REM and NREM sleep as natural accompaniments of the evolution of warm-bloodedness.", "text": "Divergence of primitive sleep into REM and NREM states is thought to have occurred in the nocturnal Triassic ancestors of mammals as a natural accompaniment of the evolution of warm-bloodedness. As ambient temperatures during twilight portions of primitive sleep traversed these evolving ancestors' core temperature, mechanisms of thermoregulatory control that employ muscle contractions became superfluous. The resulting loss of need for such contractions during twilight sleep led to muscle atonia. With muscle tone absent, selection favored the persistence of the fast waves of nocturnal activity during twilight sleep. Stimulations by these waves reinforce motor circuits at the increasing temperatures of evolving warm-bloodedness without leading to sleep-disturbing muscle contractions. By these and related interlinked adaptations, twilight sleep evolved into REM sleep. The daytime period of sleep became NREM sleep. The evolution of NREM and REM sleep following this scenario has implications for sleep's maintenance processes for long-term memories. During NREM sleep, there is an unsynchronized, uncoordinated stimulation and reinforcement of individual distributed component circuits of consolidated memories by slow wave potentials, a process termed 'uncoordinated reinforcement'. The corresponding process during REM sleep is the coordinated stimulation and reinforcement of these circuits by fast wave potentials. This action temporally binds the individual component circuit outputs into fully formed memories, a process termed 'coordinated reinforcement'. Sequential uncoordinated and coordinated reinforcement, that is, NREM followed by REM sleep, emerges as the most effective mechanism of long-term memory maintenance in vertebrates. With the evolution of this two-stage mechanism of long-term memory maintenance, it became adaptive to partition sleep into several NREM-REM cycles, thereby achieving a more lengthy application of the cooperative sequential actions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12667495/"}

For instance, various acclaimed scientists have attributed some of their greatest insights to sleep-related mentation. To date, this phenomenon has not been systematically investigated. The current study explored the occurrence and characteristics of Sleep-Related Insights (SRIs) in a large population sample, using a questionnaire approach. We found that a large majority of participants (~80%) experienced SRIs at some point in their lives and about 40% obtained SRIs regularly. Most of these subjects could link SRIs to remembered sleep mentation. SRIs were reported to occur in both sleep and half-sleep states, and at any point of the sleep period. Furthermore, SRIs regarded emotional preoccupations about twice as often as theoretical problems. Finally, SRIs were not robustly related to subjective sleep-quality, but small positive correlations with insomnia and narcolepsy-like symptoms were observed. In conclusion, SRIs are much more common than might have been expected, manifest in several forms and appear to be part of normal, healthy sleep. Importantly, the strong link of SRIs with sleep mentation suggests they result from some form of higher-order information processing during sleep, rather than being (fully) secondary to general restorative effects of sleep. Finally, our findings show that a large portion of the sampled population is aware of sleep's benefits for real life problem solving and experiences such benefits on a regular basis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30324605/"}

Contents of 38 articles were interpreted using critical discourse analysis. Discursive constructions described an inevitable decline of sleep with aging, including impacts of both physiological decline and life stage transitions; sleep's role as both a remedy and risk for ill health and disease; and the simplification of solutions for self-managing sleep juxtaposed alongside recognition of its complexity. The audience of these complex messages is left in the invidious position of both pursuing sleep practices to prevent age-related decline, whilst also being told that sleep degradation is inevitable. This research demonstrates the complexity of media messaging and the fraught options it offers: good sleep as both a reasonable achievement to strive for and as impossibly idealistic. Findings mirror two predominant health identities available to older people, as responsible for resisting aging or as falling into inevitable decline. This reveals additional expectations around appropriate time use and behaviors with aging. More nuanced messaging that goes beyond sleep as a resource for health and waking productivity is recommended.

Native Finnish participants (<i>N</i> = 29; age, <i>M</i> = 25.8 years) were allocated to REMS or SWS suppression conditions. We measured physiological (skin conductance response, SCR) and subjective stress response and declarative memory retrieval thrice: before laboratory night, the next morning, and after 3 d.

Greater overnight increase in SCR toward the stressor emerged after suppressed SWS (intact REMS) relative to suppressed REMS (20.1% vs 6.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.016). The overnight SCR increase was positively associated with accumulated REMS theta energy irrespective of the condition (<i>r</i> = 0.601; <i>p</i> = 0.002).

However, the analysis was based on 4-5 mice/group and a single section/cell. Here, we applied serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to identify signatures of sleep and sleep loss in the Drosophila brain. Stacks of images were acquired and used to obtain full 3D reconstructions of the cytoplasm and nucleus of 263 Kenyon cells from adult flies collected after a night of sleep (S) or after 11 h (SD11) or 35 h (SD35) of sleep deprivation (9 flies/group). Relative to S flies, SD35 flies showed increased density of dark clusters of chromatin and Golgi apparata and a trend increase in the percent of cell volume occupied by mitochondria, consistent with increased need for energy and protein supply during extended wake. Logistic regression models could assign each neuron to the correct experimental group with good accuracy, but in each cell, nuclear and cytoplasmic changes were poorly correlated, and within-fly variance was substantial in all experimental groups.

A confidential survey assessed child sleep problems, maternal sleep duration, parental self-efficacy and depressive symptoms in 477 Australian mothers of children aged 3 months to 5 years. We found no relationship between child age and maternal depression, supporting our decision to look beyond postpartum depression. Robust bootstrapped mediation modelling tested the hypothesis that both maternal sleep duration and parental self-efficacy would mediate child sleep problems as predictors of maternal depression. After controlling for child age, results showed a significant parallel mediation effect, demonstrating that maternal sleep duration and parental self-efficacy both mediate the relationship between child sleep problems on maternal depression. While the total effect of child sleep problems on maternal depression was statistically significant, after partialling out the effects of other variables, child sleep problems no longer predicted maternal depression.

In awake animals, a few alternating light/dark epochs matching natural REM<sub>P</sub> and SW durations entrain a sleep-like brain rhythm, suggesting the transient activation of an ultradian rhythm generator. In sleeping animals, a light pulse delivered to a single eye causes an immediate ultradian rhythm reset, but only of the contralateral hemisphere; both sides resynchronize spontaneously, indicating that sleep is controlled by paired rhythm-generating circuits linked by functional excitation.

In the 60-h post-encoding test, negative and neutral memories declined significantly in the sleep group, with attenuated emotional responses to negative memories over time. Furthermore, two groups showed spatial-temporally distinguishable ERPs at the delayed test: while both groups showed the old-new frontal negativity (300-500 ms, FN400), sleep-deprived participants additionally showed an old-new parietal, Late Positive Component effect (600-1000 ms, LPC). Multivariate whole-brain ERPs analyses further suggested that sleep prioritized neural representation of emotion over memory processing, while they were less distinguishable in the sleep deprivation group. These data suggested that sleep's impact on emotional memory and affective responses is time-dependent: sleep preserved memories and affective tones in the short term, while ameliorating affective tones in the long term. Univariate and multivariate EEG analyses revealed different neurocognitive processing of remote, emotional memories between sleep and sleep deprivation groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34153105/"}

{"id": "11118608", "title": "Behavioral, neurophysiological and evolutionary perspectives on unihemispheric sleep.", "text": "Several animals mitigate the fundamental conflict between sleep and wakefulness by engaging in unihemispheric sleep, a unique state during which one cerebral hemisphere sleeps while the other remains awake. Among mammals, unihemispheric sleep is restricted to aquatic species (Cetaceans, eared seals and manatees). In contrast to mammals, unihemispheric sleep is widespread in birds, and may even occur in reptiles. Unihemispheric sleep allows surfacing to breathe in aquatic mammals and predator detection in birds. Despite the apparent utility in being able to sleep unihemispherically, very few mammals sleep in this manner. This is particularly interesting since the reptilian ancestors to mammals may have slept unihemispherically. The relative absence of unihemispheric sleep in mammals suggests that a trade off exists between unihemispheric sleep and other adaptive brain functions occurring during sleep or wakefulness. Presumably, the benefits of sleeping unihemispherically only outweigh the costs under extreme circumstances such as sleeping at sea. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the reasons for little unihemispheric sleep in mammals promises to provide insight into the functions of sleep, in general.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11118608/"}

While responses are comparable across wakefulness and sleep in auditory cortex (AC), neuronal activity in downstream regions remains unknown. Here we recorded spiking activity in 435 neuronal clusters evoked by acoustic stimuli in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and in AC of freely behaving male rats across wakefulness and sleep. Neuronal responses in AC showed modest (∼10%) differences in response gain across vigilance states, replicating previous studies. By contrast, PRC neuronal responses were robustly attenuated by 47% and 36% during NREM sleep and REM sleep, respectively. Beyond the separation according to cortical region, response latency in each neuronal cluster was correlated with the degree of NREM sleep attenuation, such that late (>40 ms) responses in all monitored regions diminished during NREM sleep. The robust attenuation of late responses prevalent in PRC represents a novel neural correlate of sensory disconnection during sleep, opening new avenues for investigating the mediating mechanisms.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reduced behavioral responsiveness to sensory stimulation is at the core of sleep's definition, but it is still unclear how the sleeping brain responds differently to sensory stimuli. In the current study, we recorded neuronal spiking responses to sounds along the cortical processing hierarchy of rats during wakefulness and natural sleep. Responses in auditory cortex only showed modest changes during sleep, whereas sleep robustly attenuated the responses of neurons in high-level perirhinal cortex. We also found that, during NREM sleep, the response latency predicts the degree of sleep attenuation in individual neurons above and beyond their anatomical location. These results provide anatomical and temporal signatures of sensory disconnection during sleep and pave the way to understanding the underlying mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32071140/"}

Six electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of Science) were searched from their inception dates to June 2023. Data were extracted and meta-summarised using Sandelowski and Barroso's approach and synthesised using Thomas and Harden's thematic analysis framework. Meta-synthesis from 11 peer-reviewed published studies identified four main themes: (1) Awareness and understanding of sleep's significance, (2) The shadows and radiance of slumber, (3) Traversing the sleepscape: trouble bubbles and (4) Illuminating the path: Guiding lights to enhanced sleep. Our review findings suggest a lack of awareness and guidance regarding the significance of sleep and the cultivation of good sleep habits among adolescents. Identified barriers to adequate sleep encompass various factors, including overthinking, poor habits, family/environmental influences, extensive technology use, peer pressure, the fear of missing out, academic demands and involvement in extracurricular activities. Strategies to improve adolescents' sleep health involve multiple sleep strategies, including sleep education, workshops/seminars, parental involvement, incorporating digital well-being practices, the promotion of relaxation techniques and the provision of essential resources. Prioritising sleep health and implementing targeted interventions are key steps to empower adolescents, create supportive environments and shape a healthier future generation. Future research endeavours should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and exploring the influence of cultural factors.

However, this result alone does not clarify whether sleep merely slows the forgetting that would otherwise occur as a result of information processing during wakefulness, or whether sleep actually consolidates memories, protecting them from subsequent retroactive interference. Two influential studies suggested that sleep protects memories against the subsequent retroactive interference that occurs when participants learn new yet overlapping information (interference learning). In these studies, interference learning was much less detrimental to memory following a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness, an indication that sleep supports this important aspect of memory consolidation. In the current replication study, we repeated the protocol of and, additionally, we examined the impact of intrinsic motivation on performance in sleep and wake participants. We were unable to replicate the finding that sleep protects memories against retroactive interference, with the detrimental effects of interference learning being essentially the same in wake and sleep participants. We also found that while intrinsic motivation benefitted task acquisition it was not a modulator of sleep-wake differences in memory processing. Although we cannot accept the null hypothesis that sleep has no role to play in reducing the negative impact of interference, the findings draw into question prior evidence for sleep's role in protecting memories against interference. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of replicating key findings in the study of sleep's impact on memory processing before drawing strong conclusions that set the direction of future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053586/"}

This study revealed a correlation between over-sleeping and three cardiovascular conditions (valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) with significant negative correlations (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was found with the remaining nine cardiovascular conditions (P > 0.05). Furthermore, we found that under-sleeping had a correlation with four cardiovascular conditions (non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation) with significant positive correlations (P < 0.05) butnot with the remaining eight cardiovascular conditions (P > 0.05).

To determine the impact of COVID-19 on changes in sleep behavior, data were analyzed from an online survey of adults recruited via social media that included questions asking whether the respondent slept less or more after the onset of the pandemic as well as self-reported sociodemographic and occupational information; beliefs about COVID-19; and responses pertaining to loneliness, anxiety, and depression. There were 5,175 respondents; 53.9% had a change in sleep duration.17.1% slept less and 36.7% slept more. Sleeping more was related to greater education, being single/divorced/separated, unemployed or a student. Being retired, divorced/separated or a homemaker, and living in the Mountain or Central time zones were associated with less sleep. Beliefs that COVID-19 would result in personal adverse consequences was associated with both more and less sleep.

In the evening, we presented 57 participants with puzzles, each arbitrarily associated with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they had not solved were surreptitiously presented. The next morning, participants solved 31.7% of cued puzzles, compared with 20.5% of uncued puzzles (a 55% improvement). Moreover, cued-puzzle solving correlated with cued-puzzle memory.

Continuous 72-h recordings of EEG, EMG, and tri-axial accelerometry, along with EEG spectral analyses, were performed on wild-caught Australian magpies housed in indoor aviaries.

Australian magpies recovered from lost NREM sleep by sleeping more, with increased NREM sleep consolidation, and increased SWA during recovery sleep. Following 12-h of night-time sleep loss, magpies also showed reduced SWA the following night after napping more during the recovery day. Surprisingly, the magpies did not recover any lost REM sleep.

Analysis of the time course of homeostatic sleep drive in habitual short and long sleepers has not identified differences between these groups, leading to the hypothesis that habitual short sleep results from increased tolerance to high levels of homeostatic sleep drive. Using a physiologically-based mathematical model of the sleep-wake regulatory network, we investigate responses to acute sleep deprivation in simulated populations of habitual long, regular and short sleepers that differ in daily levels of homeostatic sleep drive. The model predicts timing and durations of wake, rapid eye movement (REM), and non-REM (NREM) sleep episodes as modulated by the homeostatic sleep drive and the circadian rhythm, which is entrained to an external light cycle. Model parameters are fit to experimental measures of baseline sleep durations to construct simulated populations of individuals of each sleeper type. The simulated populations are validated against data for responses to specific acute sleep deprivation protocols. We use the model to predict responses to a wide range of sleep deprivation durations for each sleeper type. Model results predict that all sleeper types exhibit shorter sleep durations during recovery sleep that occurs in the morning, but, for recovery sleep times occurring later in the day, long and regular sleepers show longer and more variable sleep durations, and can suffer longer lasting disruption of daily sleep patterns compared to short sleepers. Additionally, short sleepers showed more resilience to sleep deprivation with longer durations of waking episodes following recovery sleep.

This processing is not fully compatible with the brain's spontaneous oscillatory activity that maintains (refreshes) infrequently used circuits that store inherited and experiential information (memories). Great reduction in sensory input and processing during sleep permits the refreshment of memory circuits to occur unimpededly. Accordingly, sleep may have evolved as ever augmenting needs for processing visual information during waking behavior by brains of great complexity conflicted increasingly with needs to refresh memory circuits. The lack of a need for sleep by genetically blind fishes that live in caves, and sighted fishes that swim continuously, is consistent with this thesis, as their needs for processing of sensory information, predominantly visual, are either greatly reduced or nil. Reduced requirements for processing sensory information by continuously swimming fishes owe to the following aspects of their behavior and ecology: (1) visual input is greatly reduced or absent during lengthy periods of nocturnal activity; (2) schooling greatly reduces needs for sensory information, particularly visual; (3) being maintained through frequent use, circuitry for most inherited memories needs no refreshment; and (4) inasmuch as they lead a comparatively routine existence in essentially featureless, open waters, pelagic species acquire, and have need to refresh, relatively few experiential memories.

{"id": "1592708", "title": "Load compensation and respiratory muscle function during sleep.", "text": "The sleeping state places unique demands on the ventilatory control system. The sleep-induced increase in airway resistance, the loss of consciousness, and the need to maintain the sleeping state without frequent arousals require the presence of complex compensatory mechanisms. The increase in upper airway resistance during sleep represents the major effect of sleep on ventilatory control. This occurs because of a loss of muscle activity, which narrows the airway and also makes it more susceptible to collapse in response to the intraluminal pressure generated by other inspiratory muscles. The magnitude and timing of the drive to upper airway vs. other inspiratory pump muscles determine the level of resistance and can lead to inspiratory flow limitation and complete upper airway occlusion. The fall in ventilation with this mechanical load is not prevented, as it is in the awake state, because of the absence of immediate compensatory responses during sleep. However, during sleep, compensatory mechanisms are activated that tend to return ventilation toward control levels if the load is maintained. Upper airway protective reflexes, intrinsic properties of the chest wall, muscle length-compensating reflexes, and most importantly chemoresponsiveness of both upper airway and inspiratory pump muscles are all present during sleep to minimize the adverse effect of loading on ventilation. In non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, the high mechanical impedance combined with incomplete load compensation causes an increase in arterial PCO2 and augmented respiratory muscle activity. Phasic rapid-eye-movement sleep, however, interferes further with effective load compensation, primarily by its selective inhibitory effects on the phasic activation of postural muscles of the chest wall. The level and pattern of ventilation during sleep in health and disease states represent a compromise toward the ideal goal, which is to achieve maximum load compensation and meet the demand for chemical homeostasis while maintaining sleep state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1592708/"}

The electrical activity of the brain (the EEG) can be employed to distinguish waking (conscious) from sleeping (unconscious) states. It is also possible to quantify the EEG prior to and following a detection (or a failure of a detection) of a stimulus. Such measures can thus be used to predict conscious awareness. A second measure that frequently has been employed is the brain's response to an external stimulus (the evoked potential). Different components of the evoked potential can be used to trace the extent of information processing during the different states of consciousness.

Current practitioners must recognize that sleep health is multidisciplinary, and existing interventions can help clients achieve good sleep health throughout their lifespan.

{"id": "27720856", "title": "Sleep's role in the reconsolidation of declarative memories.", "text": "Sleep is known to support the consolidation of newly encoded and initially labile memories. Once consolidated, remote memories can return to a labile state upon reactivation and need to become reconsolidated in order to persist. Here we asked whether sleep also benefits the reconsolidation of remote memories after their reactivation and how reconsolidation during sleep compares to sleep-dependent consolidation processes. In three groups, participants were trained on a visuo-spatial learning task in the presence of a contextual odor. Participants in the 'reconsolidation' group learned the task on day 1. On day 2, they were subjected to a reactivation procedure by presenting the odor cue and a mock recall test in the learning context before a 40-min sleep or wake period. Participants in the 'remote consolidation' group followed the same procedure but did not receive reactivation on day 2. Participants in the 'recent consolidation' group skipped the procedure on day 1 and learned the task immediately before the sleep or wake period. After the sleep or wake interval, memory stability was tested in all subjects. The results show that this short 40-min sleep period significantly facilitated the reconsolidation of reactivated memories, whereas the consolidation of non-reactivated remote memories was less affected and recently encoded memories did not benefit at all. These findings tentatively suggest that sleep has a beneficial effect on the reconsolidation of remote memories, acting at a faster rate than sleep-associated consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27720856/"}

The current study examined how early childhood sleep, measured actigraphically, was developmentally associated with child functioning at 54 months. Emphasis was on functioning at preschool, a crucial setting for the emergence of psychopathology. Participants included 119 children assessed longitudinally at 30, 36, 42, and 54 months. We examined correlations between child sleep and adjustment across three domains: behavioral adjustment (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems), socioemotional skills, and academic/cognitive abilities. We further probed consistent associations with growth curve modeling. Internalizing problems were associated with sleep variability, and cognitive and academic abilities were associated with sleep timing. Growth curve analysis suggested that children with more variable sleep at 30 months had higher teacher-reported internalizing problems in preschool and that children with later sleep timing at 30 months had poorer cognitive and academic skills at 54 months. However, changes in sleep from 30 to 54 months were not associated with any of the domains of adjustment. Findings indicate that objectively measured sleep variability and late sleep timing in toddlerhood are associated with higher levels of internalizing problems and poorer academic/cognitive abilities in preschool.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32173864/"}

After successful treatment, many of these signs disappear; however, changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may persist and even predict recurrence of depression. High-risk studies have established these alterations to be not only biological scars but true endophenotypes for depression. REM sleep changes are mediated by the noradrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic systems and are under strong genetic control. REM sleep has a crucial role for brain maturation and is inhibited during ontogeny. Lack of this inhibition may predispose an individual to depression. Findings regarding the CREB gene support REM sleep's role in depression. The combination of psychopathology and neurobiological measures, such as REM sleep parameters, will help to improve genetic studies and therefore increase the knowledge of relevant pathways for depression.

Its defining property is the presence of slow oscillations (<2 Hz) in the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). Slow oscillations are generated by a synchronous back and forth between highly active UP-states and silent DOWN-states in neocortical neurons. Growing evidence suggests that closed-loop sensory stimulation targeted at UP-states of EEG-defined slow oscillations can enhance the slow oscillatory activity, increase sleep depth, and boost sleep's recuperative functions. However, several studies failed to replicate such findings. Failed replications might be due to the use of conventional closed-loop stimulation algorithms that analyze the signal from one single electrode and thereby neglect the fact that slow oscillations vary with respect to their origins, distributions, and trajectories on the scalp. In particular, conventional algorithms nonspecifically target functionally heterogeneous UP-states of distinct origins. After all, slow oscillations at distinct sites of the scalp have been associated with distinct functions. Here we present a novel EEG-based closed-loop stimulation algorithm that allows targeting UP- and DOWN-states of distinct cerebral origins based on topographic analyses of the EEG: the topographic targeting of slow oscillations (TOPOSO) algorithm. We present evidence that the TOPOSO algorithm can detect and target local slow oscillations with specific, predefined voltage maps on the scalp in real-time. When compared to a more conventional, single-channel-based approach, TOPOSO leads to fewer but locally more specific stimulations in a simulation study. In a validation study with napping participants, TOPOSO targets auditory stimulation reliably at local UP-states over frontal, sensorimotor, and centro-parietal regions. Importantly, auditory stimulation temporarily enhanced the targeted local state. However, stimulation then elicited a standard frontal slow oscillation rather than local slow oscillations. The TOPOSO algorithm is suitable for the modulation and the study of the functions of local slow oscillations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36240988/"}

Although false memories are proposed to develop via associative processes, the nature of their neural representations, and the effect of sleep on false memory processing is currently unclear. The present research employed the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm and a daytime nap to determine whether semantic false memories and true memories could be differentiated using event-related potentials (ERPs). We also sought to illuminate the role of sleep in memory formation and learning. Healthy participants (N = 34, 28F, mean age = 23.23, range = 18-33) completed the learning phase of the DRM task followed by an immediate and a delayed recognition phase. The two recognition phases were separated by either a 2hr daytime nap or an equivalent wake period. Linear mixed modelling of effects at delayed recognition revealed larger LPC amplitudes for true memories in contrast to false memories for those in the wake group, and larger P300 amplitudes for false compared to true memories across sleep and wake groups. Larger LPC amplitudes for true memories were associated with enhanced true memory recognition following sleep, whilst larger P300 amplitudes were associated with similar true and false memory recognition rates. These findings are argued to reflect sleep's ability to promote memory generalisation associated with pattern completion, whilst also enhancing true memory recognition when memory traces have a strong episodic basis (linked to pattern separation). The present research suggests that true and false memories have differing neural profiles and are reflective of adaptive memory processes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34763072/"}

The last portion of this paper proposes a structural model of cellular interaction that produces the REM sleep cycle, and constitutes a further revision of the reciprocal interaction model This paper proposes seven criteria to define a causal role in REM sleep control for putative neuro-transmitters/modulators. The principal criteria are measurements during behavioral state changes of the extracellular concentrations of the putative substances, and electrophysiological recording of their neuronal source. A cautionary note is that, while pharmacological manipulations are suggestive, they alone do not provide definitive causal evidence. The extensive body of in vivo and in vitro evidence supporting cholinergic promotion of REM sleep via LDT/PPT neuronal activity is surveyed. An interesting question raised by some studies is whether cholinergic influences in rat are less puissant than in cat. At least some of the apparent lesser REM-inducing effect of carbachol in the rat may be due to incomplete control of circadian influences; almost all experiments have been run only in the daytime, inactive period, when REM sleep is more prominent, rather than in the REM-sparse nighttime inactive period. Monoaminergic inhibition of cholinergic neurons, once thought to be the most shaky proposal of the reciprocal interaction model, now enjoys considerable support from both in vivo and in vitro data. However, the observed time course of monoaminergic neurons, their \"turning off\" discharge activity as REM sleep is approached and entered would seem to be difficult to produce from feedback inhibition, as originally postulated by the reciprocal interaction model. New data suggest the possibility that GABAergic inhibition of Locus Coeruleus and Dorsal Raphe monoaminergic neurons may account for the \"REM-off\" neurons turning off. However, the source(s) of GABAergic influences suggested by anatomical studies has yet to be definitively identified by electrophysiological recordings of GABAergic neurons that show the requisite inverse time course of activity relative to monoaminergic neurons. New and still preliminary microdialysis data suggest that reticular formation neurons, the effector neurons for REM sleep phenomena, might be disinhibited during REM sleep by decreased GABAergic influence, perhaps stemming from REM-on cholinergic neuronal inhibition of reticular formation GABAergic neurons. Whether the postulated cholinergic inhibition of GABAergic neurons is present is testable with in vitro recordings and double labeling. Taking into account the observed data on neuro-modulators/transmitters, a structural model incorporating interaction of REM-on and REM-off neurons and GABAergic influences is proposed. Finally, with respect to orexin and REM sleep, it is hypothesized that orexinergic activity may be a principal factor controlling REM sleep's absence from the active period in strongly circadian animals such as rat and man.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15493547/"}
{"id": "12445946", "title": "Animal models for information processing during sleep.", "text": "Information provided by external stimuli does reach the brain during sleep, although the amount of information is reduced during sleep compared to wakefulness. The process controlling this reduction is called 'sensory' gating and evidence exists that the underlying neurophysiological processes take place in the thalamus. Furthermore, it is clear that stimuli given during sleep can alter the functional state of the brain. Two factors have been shown to play a crucial role in causing changes in the sleeping brain: the intensity and the relevance of the stimulus. Intensive stimuli arouse the brain, as well as stimuli having a high informational impact on the sleeping person. The arousal threshold for important stimuli is quite low compared to neutral stimuli. A central question in sleep research is whether associative learning, or in other words the formation of new associations between stimuli, can take place in a sleeping brain. It has been shown that simple forms of learning are still possible during sleep. In sleeping rats, it is proven that habituation, an active, simple form of learning not to respond to irrelevant stimuli, can occur. Moreover, there is evidence for the view that more complex associations can be modulated and newly formed during sleep. This is shown by two experimental approaches: an extinction paradigm and a latent inhibition (pre-exposure) paradigm. The presentation of non-reinforced stimuli during sleep causes slower extinction compared to the same presentation of these stimuli during wakefulness. Consistently, the suppressive capacity of a stimulus in the latent inhibition paradigm is less when previously pre-exposed during sleep, as compared to pre-exposure during wakefulness. Thus, while associative learning is not completely blocked during sleep, aspects of association formation are clearly altered. However, animal studies also clearly indicate that complex forms of learning are not possible during sleep. It is hypothesised that this restriction in information processing during sleep is due to the considerable reduction of incoming information by the sleeping brain. This reduction may serve to protect the sleep process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12445946/"}

In this narrative review, we outline a putative vicious cycle of reciprocal exacerbation of disturbed sleep and emotion dysregulation in BPD, that sheds light on BPD pathophysiology and opens up new avenues for sleep-based treatments. We discuss emotional dysregulation as the base of BPD as well as the observed sleep disturbances in BPD. Based on existing theories of sleep's role in emotion regulation and memory, we then propose several behavioral and neurobiological pathways by which inherent sleep disturbances in BPD may hamper adaptive overnight emotional processing. This likely results in sustained emotional states and associated sleep-disruptive behavior, which in turn negatively impact sleep. We end by proposing a sleep-based research agenda for BPD to further detail the causative role of disturbed sleep in BPD and test the effectiveness of novel sleep-based treatment strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258322/"}

The causality of these important relationships and their dependency on circadian phase and/or time awake has not been studied in depth. To disentangle possible circadian and homeostatic interactions, we employed a forced desynchrony protocol under dim light (6 lux) and under bright light (1300 lux) during wakefulness. Our protocol consisted of a fast cycling sleep-wake schedule (13 h wakefulness-5 h sleep; 4 cycles), followed by 3 h recovery sleep in a within-subject cross-over design. Individuals (8 men) were equipped with 10 polysomnography electrodes. Subjective sleep quality was measured immediately after wakening with a questionnaire. Results indicated that circadian variation in delta power was only detected under dim light. Circadian variation in time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness were uninfluenced by light. Prior light exposure increased accumulation of delta power and time in NREM sleep, while it decreased wakefulness, especially during the circadian wake phase (biological day). Subjective sleep quality scores showed that participants rated their sleep quality better after bright light exposure while sleeping when the circadian system promoted wakefulness. These results suggest that high environmental light intensity either increases sleep pressure buildup during wakefulness or prevents the occurrence of micro-sleep, leading to improved quality of subsequent sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35730553/"}

The studies, executed by the Strassbourg, Budapest and Parma schools, paved the way of exploring the participation of micro-arousals in the sleep regulation. It was shown that micro-arousals, not leading to instant arousal but influencing the later course of sleep are weaved into the network of sleep. A certain class of micro-arousals differs from the traditional desyncronisation-type and in a paradox way result a rebound like mobilisation of sleep-like activity with deltas and K-complexes. The desynchronisation- and synchronisation-type micro-arousals show different distribution along the sleep cyclicity and may play different role in sleep regulation. On the basis of the studies dealing with micro-arousals we can assume that beside the traditional long time constant, brain stem driven tonic chemical regulation, an other phasic regulation, with shorter time constant, associated with the micro-arousals, also exists. This kind of phasic regulation makes sleep flexible and possible to adapt the actual sleep course to the inner and outer demands.

We found that the α-diversity and β-diversity were quite similar between s-HTN and ins-HTN. Similarities were also observed in the enterotype distribution between s-HTN and ins-HTN subjects. In addition, the enrichment of gut bacteria was evident, such as Fusobacterium mortiferum and Roseburia inulinivorans in ins-HTN subjects. Several functional modules that were distinct between s-HTN and ins-HTN subjects were identified, which were unique to hypertensive patients with insufficient sleep duration. Overall, the data demonstrated that the gut microbial features were largely maintained in hypertensive participants with insufficient sleep duration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33785906/"}

Here, we followed this idea adopting the 'directed forgetting' approach of experimental psychology. The voluntary suppression of unwanted memories results in impaired later retrieval. Because sleep is known to benefit consolidation of newly learned materials, including cognitive skills, we hypothesized that memory suppression would be enhanced by sleep, and perhaps particularly by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is associated more often with dream reports. Subjects (n=42) learned a list of word-pairs and, subsequently, the first (cue) words of the pairs were presented again; for half these words subjects had to recall respective second words (response pairs) and for the other half they had to keep respective second words out of mind (suppression pairs). Retrieval of both response and suppression pairs was tested after 8h of sleep or wakefulness (main experiment) or after 3-h periods of early slow wave sleep (SWS)-rich or late REM-rich sleep (supplementary experiment). Response pairs were generally recalled better after sleep than wakefulness (P<0.05). Recall of suppression pairs was, as expected, worse than of response pairs. Contrary to our hypothesis, memory for suppression pairs was not affected differentially by sleep. In the supplementary experiment, compared to SWS-rich sleep, REM-rich sleep even improved recall of suppression pairs (P<0.05). Thus, sleep does not benefit the forgetting of unwanted memories but, on the contrary, REM sleep might even counteract the voluntary suppression of memories making them more accessible for retrieval.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20723021/"}

Determining which genes underlie this phenotype could shed light on the mechanisms and functions of sleep. To do so, we performed mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, because flies also sleep for many hours and, when sleep deprived, show sleep rebound and performance impairments. By screening 9,000 mutant lines, we found minisleep (mns), a line that sleeps for one-third of the wild-type amount. We show that mns flies perform normally in a number of tasks, have preserved sleep homeostasis, but are not impaired by sleep deprivation. We then show that mns flies carry a point mutation in a conserved domain of the Shaker gene. Moreover, after crossing out genetic modifiers accumulated over many generations, other Shaker alleles also become short sleepers and fail to complement the mns phenotype. Finally, we show that short-sleeping Shaker flies have a reduced lifespan. Shaker, which encodes a voltage-dependent potassium channel controlling membrane repolarization and transmitter release, may thus regulate sleep need or efficiency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15858564/"}

It was hypothesized that lower sleeping hours and players' thought of inadequate sleeping quantity and quality during off-season and soccer season would associate with the occurrence of soccer injuries. One-hundred and fifty-two professional soccer players (premier league and division I teams, age: 21.82±4.44, BMI: 22.21±2.74, sex: men [N.=91], women [N.=61]) answered questions related to their sleeping duration and whether that amount of sleep was enough prior to (off-season) and during soccer season.

Sleeping time, time in bed, total sleep time, sleep latency (SL), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset, and wake bouts were recorded with an actigraphic device during the 4-week sleep hygiene strategy (baseline) and during 4 weeks after the last intervention (postintervention). At baseline, the overall group reported poor sleep quantity (total sleep time = 6:27 [0:30] min), but sleep quality was considered acceptable (SL = 0:18 [0:08] min and SE = 77.8% [5.8%]). Postintervention, the overall group showed a small improvement in SL (d = -0.23 [-0.42 to -0.04], P = .003) and SE (d = 0.30 [0.03 to 0.57], P = .0004).

Chronic stress is a common waking experience; however, which specific aspect of sleep is most responsive, and how sleep changes relate to behavioral disturbances and molecular correlates remain unknown. We quantified sleep, physical, endocrine, and behavioral variables, as well as the brain and blood transcriptome in mice exposed to 9 weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Comparing 46 phenotypic variables revealed that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), corticosterone regulation, and coat state were most responsive to UCMS. REMS theta oscillations were enhanced, whereas delta oscillations in non-REMS were unaffected. Transcripts affected by UCMS in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and blood were associated with inflammatory and immune responses. A machine-learning approach controlling for unspecific UCMS effects identified transcriptomic predictor sets for REMS parameters that were enriched in 193 pathways, including some involved in stem cells, immune response, and apoptosis and survival. Only three pathways were enriched in predictor sets for non-REMS. Transcriptomic predictor sets for variation in REMS continuity and theta activity shared many pathways with corticosterone regulation, in particular pathways implicated in apoptosis and survival, including mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. Predictor sets for REMS and anhedonia shared pathways involved in oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.

We addressed these questions by combining structural and diffusion weighted MRI and high-density EEG in 16 subjects studied during the physiological sleep/wake cycle, after 12 h and 24 h of intense practice in two different tasks, and after post-training sleep. Compared to baseline wake, 12 h of training led to a decline in cortical mean diffusivity. The decrease became even more significant after 24 h of task practice combined with sleep deprivation. Prolonged practice also resulted in decreased ventricular volume and increased GM and WM subcortical volumes. All changes reverted after recovery sleep. Moreover, these structural alterations predicted cognitive performance at the individual level, suggesting that sleep's ability to counteract performance deficits is linked to its effects on the brain microstructure. The cellular mechanisms that account for the structural effects of sleep are unknown, but they may be linked to its role in promoting the production of cerebrospinal fluid and the decrease in synapse size and strength, as well as to its recently discovered ability to enhance the extracellular space and the clearance of brain metabolites.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26812659/"}

An evolutionary analysis of sleep encounters no mystery; nor does life's earliest sleep, recently discovered in jellyfish.", "text": "Biotelemetry has revealed daily 15-h behavioral sleep periods in a cubomedusan jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri. Its sleep is expected to be phylogenetically most primitive, since jellyfish possess only two germ layers. They belong to the phylum Cnidaria, the 'simplest' multicellular organisms with an organized nervous system. Cubomedusae have a complex visual system with 24 eyes of four different types, each type specialized for a different task. Input to these eyes during visually guided fast-swimming predation requires enormous amounts of neural processing, possibly nearly saturating the capacity of their comparatively simple nervous system. These heavy neural demands may account for the need for fifteen hours of sleep. C. fleckeri is the only animal known for which sleep may be either present or absent, dependent on lifestyle. Limited knowledge of behavior of some other cubomedusae suggests that they also possess this faculty. The finding of sleep in C. fleckeri supports current proposals of sleep's origin and basic function. Evolutionary analyses link sleep to a conflict produced by excessive processing demands on multifunctional neural circuitry for detailed focal vision by complex lensed eyes. The conflict arises between the enormous demands of complex visual analysis and needs for split-second control of actions, on the one hand, and non-urgent processing of memories of ongoing and stored events, on the other. Conflict is resolved by deferring the non-urgent processing to periods of sleep. Without sleep, selection would favor the evolution of circuitry 'dedicated' to single or but few tasks, with corresponding lesser efficiency. Had complex lensed eyes of medusae originated as a consequence of selection for increased mating success of males pursuing females, it could have occurred before the evolution of fast-swimming bilateral (three-germ-layered) prey. But if it was a consequence of selection for increased prey-hunting success, the origin of such eyes probably awaited the coexistence of bilateral prey.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16213664/"}

Concerning the former, the one considered more reliable is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) while the PERcent of eye CLOSure over a defined period of time (PERCLOS) seems to be the most informative behavioral measure. In the present study, using a within-subject design, we assessed the effect of a single night of partial sleep deprivation (PSD, less than 5 h sleeping time) compared to a control condition (full night of sleep, 8 h sleeping time) on SDLP and PERCLOS, in young adults driving in a dynamic car simulator. Results show that time-on-task and PSD affect both subjective and objective sleepiness measures. Moreover, our data confirm that both objective and subjective sleepiness increase through a monotonous driving scenario. Considering that SDLP and PERCLOS were often used separately in studies on driver sleepiness and fatigue detection, the present results have potential implications for fitness-to-drive assessment in that they provide useful information allowing to combine the advantages of the two measures for drowsiness detection while driving.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36901015/"}

Although we did not detect statistically significant effects and our sample size was limited, preliminary trends suggest that male bats may sleep longer than females, and individuals sleeping in groups may sleep longer than individuals sleeping alone. We also found a high correspondence between total sleep time quantified visually and quantified using actigraphy (with a 2-min immobility threshold) and identified physiological correlates of behaviorally-defined REM.

Both approaches implicitly assume that HRV within sleep epoch types is consistent throughout the night. Given the robust literature indicating the existence of an endogenous cardiovascular circadian rhythm as well as the potential for effects for cumulative time asleep, we hypothesized that HRV would vary across distinct sleep epochs. Participants underwent at least one night of home polysomnography that included electroencephalogram, electromyogram, and electrocardiogram (N = 73). All rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM stage 2 (N2) sleep epochs with a duration greater than or equal to 5 min were identified for HRV analysis. Time and frequency domain indices of HRV were calculated for each sleep stage epoch. Linear mixed models were used to examine main effects of time on HRV indices for N2 and REM sleeps epochs respectively. Main effects of time were observed for all models. Patterns emerged for both the N2 and REM epochs, suggesting HRV indices are non-stationary (ie variable) across distinct sleep epochs through the course of the night.

Lack of awareness of the importance of sleep, and inadequate information related to sleep, combined with misinformation about sleep, disseminated through social media, nonexpert advice, commercial interests, and other sources, can distort individuals' understanding of healthy sleep practices. Such misinformation can lead to the adoption of unhealthy sleep behaviors, reducing sleep quality and exacerbating sleep disorders. Simultaneously, poor sleep itself impairs critical cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These impairments can heighten individuals' vulnerability to misinformation, creating a vicious cycle that further entrenches poor sleep habits and unhealthy behaviors. Sleep deprivation is known to reduce the ability to critically evaluate information, increase suggestibility, and enhance emotional reactivity, making individuals more prone to accepting persuasive but inaccurate information. This cycle of misinformation and poor sleep creates a clinical public health issue that goes beyond individual well-being, influencing occupational performance, societal productivity, and even broader clinical public health decision-making. The effects are felt across various sectors, from health care systems burdened by sleep-related issues to workplaces impacted by decreased productivity due to sleep deficiencies. The need for comprehensive clinical public health initiatives to combat this cycle is critical. These efforts must promote sleep literacy, increase awareness of sleep's role in cognitive resilience, and correct widespread sleep myths. Digital tools and technologies, such as sleep-tracking devices and artificial intelligence-powered apps, can play a role in educating the public and enhancing the accessibility of accurate, evidence-based sleep information. However, these tools must be carefully designed to avoid the spread of misinformation through algorithmic biases. Furthermore, research into the cognitive impacts of sleep deprivation should be leveraged to develop strategies that enhance societal resilience against misinformation. Sleep infodemiology and infoveillance, which involve tracking and analyzing the distribution of sleep-related information across digital platforms, offer valuable methodologies for identifying and addressing the spread of misinformation in real time. Addressing this issue requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between sleep scientists, health care providers, educators, policy makers, and digital platform regulators. By promoting healthy sleep practices and debunking myths, it is possible to disrupt the feedback loop between poor sleep and misinformation, leading to improved individual health, better decision-making, and stronger societal outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39475424/"}

Thus, it would be beneficial to assess the contribution of individual circuits in sleep's putative functions. The intricacy of the mammalian brain makes this task extremely difficult. However, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, with its simpler brain organization, available connectomics, and unparalleled genetics, offers the opportunity to interrogate individual sleep-regulating centers. In Drosophila, neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) have been proposed to be key regulators of sleep, particularly sleep homeostasis. We recently demonstrated that the most widely used genetic tool to manipulate dFB neurons, the 23E10-GAL4 driver, expresses in 2 sleep-regulating neurons (VNC-SP neurons) located in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), the fly analog of the vertebrate spinal cord. Since most data supporting a role for the dFB in sleep regulation have been obtained using 23E10-GAL4, it is unclear whether the sleep phenotypes reported in these studies are caused by dFB neurons or VNC-SP cells. A recent publication replicated our finding that 23E10-GAL4 contains sleep-promoting neurons in the VNC. However, it also proposed that the dFB is not involved in sleep regulation at all, but this suggestion was made using genetic tools that are not dFB-specific and a very mild sleep deprivation protocol. In this study, using a newly created dFB-specific genetic driver line, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of the majority of 23E10-GAL4 dFB neurons promotes sleep and that these neurons are involved in sleep homeostasis. We also show that dFB neurons require stronger stimulation than VNC-SP cells to promote sleep. In addition, we demonstrate that dFB-induced sleep can consolidate short-term memory (STM) into long-term memory (LTM), suggesting that the benefit of sleep on memory is not circuit-specific. Finally, we show that dFB neurons are neurochemically heterogeneous and can be divided in 3 populations. Most dFB neurons express both glutamate and acetylcholine, while a minority of cells expresses only one of these 2 neurotransmitters. Importantly, dFB neurons do not express GABA, as previously suggested. Using neurotransmitter-specific dFB tools, our data also points at cholinergic dFB neurons as particularly potent at regulating sleep and sleep homeostasis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40138668/"}

PAH is an abrupt shift to slower frequencies in arousal-related responses, appearing as slow-wave clusters. In contrast, the prevalence of PAH in healthy young adults is still unknown. Here, we examined the prevalence and characteristics of PAH in healthy young participants. Thirty healthy young participants underwent 1 night of polysomnography (13 females, 22.8 ± 2.0 years [mean ± standard deviation]). We examined the prevalence of PAH as a function of sleep stage, sleep cycle, and time course (the first or the second half). The correlation between PAH and sleep variables was examined. The percent of total sleep time in the N3 stage (%N3) was compared for each sleep cycle and time course. Twenty-eight out of 30 participants exhibited PAH (4.6 ± 4.8 times per night). PAH increased significantly during the first sleep cycle and the first half-sleep period. It was observed only in nonrapid eye movement and not in rapid eye movement sleep. The number of PAHs correlated with the number of arousals and arousal indices. The %N3 increased in the first half-sleep and the first sleep cycle. PAH was relatively common in healthy young participants. Since PAH occurred in a state with a high prevalence of %N3, the first sleep cycle, or the first half-sleep, we suggest that PAH may be affected by the sleep homeostasis process. Since PAH occurred only in non-rapid eye movement sleep and correlated with arousal increment, it may have the function of suppressing non-rapid eye movement sleep's cortical arousal.

With the growing availability of affordable brain monitoring devices, the volume of collected brain data has increased significantly. However, analyzing these data, particularly when using the gold standard multi-lead electroencephalogram (EEG), remains resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, automated brain monitoring has emerged as a crucial solution for cost-effective and efficient EEG data analysis. A critical component of sleep analysis is detecting transitions between wakefulness and sleep states. These transitions offer valuable insights into sleep quality and quantity, essential for diagnosing sleep disorders, designing effective interventions, enhancing overall health and well-being, and studying sleep's effects on cognitive function, mood, and physical performance. This study presents a novel EEG feature extraction pipeline for the accurate classification of various wake and sleep stages. We propose a noise-robust model-based Kalman filtering (KF) approach to track changes in a time-varying auto-regressive model (TVAR) applied to EEG data during different wake and sleep stages. Our approach involves extracting features, including instantaneous frequency and instantaneous power from EEG, and implementing a two-step classifier for sleep staging. The first step classifies data into wake, REM, and non-REM categories, while the second step further classifies non-REM data into N1, N2, and N3 stages. Evaluation on the extended Sleep-EDF dataset (Sleep-EDFx), with 153 EEG recordings from 78 subjects, demonstrated compelling results with classifiers including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The best performance was achieved with the LGBM and XGBoost classifiers, yielding an overall accuracy of over 77%, a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.69, and a Cohen's kappa of 0.68, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed method with a remarkably compact and interpretable feature set.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39771620/"}

In 549 patients with epileptic seizures spike wave (sw) paroxysms were seen in 13.3%. Following a 24-hour period of sleep deprivation sw paroxysms were present in 24.2% cases which represents an increase of 82.0%. The number of cases with focal discharges increased in this group from 21.3% initially to 27.5% after sleep deprivation, representing an increase of only 29.1%. The percentage increase in sw paroxysms and focal discharges following sleep deprivation was approximately as marked also in patients without epileptic seizures, so that sleep deprivation was found to be equally useful in patients with non-epileptic cerebral disorders. The rate of activation is higher in children and juveniles than in adults. Similarly, it is higher in patients with awaking epilepsy than in patients with sleep epilepsy. The influence of sleep deprivation and that of sleep, respectively, upon the provocation of EEG changes was not sharply differentiated. By counting sw paroxysms in the EEG before sleep deprivation, in the waking EEG following sleep deprivation, as well as in the subsequent sleeping EEG further evidence was obtained, however, supporting the suggestion that special significance may be attributed to sleep deprivation as a provocation method. If the activation of sw paroxysms and focal changes is related to sleep and sleep stages it can be shown that their frequency decreases from stage 1 to stage 4. In particular, the short fluctuations in vigilance, the waking reactions frequently occurring under routine laboratory conditions and the transitions between sleep stages were seen to assume trigger functions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6820222/"}

Prior experimental research however shows contradictory findings on how emotional reactivity changes after a period of sleep, likely explained by methodological variations. By addressing these inconsistencies, we investigated the mitigating effect of overnight sleep on emotional reactivity triggered by memory reactivation. Using a karaoke paradigm, we recorded participants' singing of two songs, followed by exposing them to one of the recordings (rec1) to induce an embarrassing episode. After a 12-hr period of either day-time wakefulness (N = 20) or including nighttime sleep (N = 20), we assessed emotional reactivity to the previously exposed recording (rec1) and the newly exposed recording (rec2). Emotional reactivity was assessed with a physiological measure of facial blushing as the main outcome and subjective ratings of embarrassment and valence. Sleep and wake were monitored with diaries and actigraphy. The embarrassing episode was successfully induced as indicated by objective and subjective measures. After controlling for an order effect in stimulus presentation, we found a reduction in blushing response to the reactivated recording (rec1) from pre- to post-sleep compared to wakefulness. However, emotional reactivity to the reactivated recording (rec1) and the new recording (rec2) did not differ after sleep and wakefulness. This study shows that facial blushing was reduced following overnight sleep, while subjective ratings were unaffected. Whether the beneficial effect of sleep is due to changes in memory representation or rather emotion regulation remains elusive.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36130113/"}

The purpose of this study was to formulate an algorithm for discriminating S/W in school-aged children using FS-760 and to evaluate its validity. We further tested the generalizability of existing algorithm for adults by applying it to the children's activity data and then examined factors associated with adult algorithm agreement rates by multiple regression analysis using combined adult and children data. Sixty-five, healthy, school-aged children (aged 6 to 15 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: A (n = 33) and B (n = 32). They underwent 8-h polysomnography (PSG) and wore FS-760 simultaneously to obtain activity data. To determine the central epoch of the sleep/wake states (𝑥), a five-order linear discriminant analysis was conducted using the activity intensity of group A for five epochs (𝑥<sub>-2</sub>, 𝑥<sub>-1</sub>, 𝑥, 𝑥<sub>+1</sub>, 𝑥<sub>+2</sub>; 10 min) and evaluate its accuracy with the activity of group B. To reveal the factors associated with adult algorithm agreement rate, we integrated the activity, age, sleep efficiency of 15 adults (aged 20 to 39 years) and those of 65 children for multiple regression analysis. The mean agreement rate of the developed algorithm was 91.0%, with a mean sensitivity (true sleep detection rate) of 93.0% and a mean specificity (true wakefulness detection rate) of 63.9%. The agreement rate of the adult algorithm applied to children's activity was significantly lower (81.8%) than that of the children algorithm. Multiple regression analysis showed that the agreement rates calculated by the adult algorithm were significantly related to mean activity of the 𝑥 epoch in NREM and REM sleep as well as age and sleep efficiency. The S/W states in school-aged children can be reliably assessed using the developed algorithm for waist-worn actigraph FS-760.

The sleep group experienced fewer and less distressing intrusive trauma memories compared to the wake group. These effects were particularly evident toward the end of the week.

Considering sleep's well-known beneficial role in consolidating newly encoded memory content, we hypothesized that pregnant women would display detrimental changes in objective sleep measures and associated memory deficits. We compared the consolidation of declarative as well as procedural memory across sleep in 21 healthy, third-trimester pregnant women versus 20 matched non-pregnant controls. Subjects encoded and were tested on visuospatial and procedural memory tasks before and after, respectively, a night of sleep spent at home. The emergence of gist-based memories was tested with the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was polysomnographically recorded and subjective sleep quality was assessed with questionnaires. Although pregnant in comparison to non-pregnant women reported markedly impaired subjective sleep quality and efficiency, quantitative changes were limited to increases in wakefulness after sleep onset and reductions in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Retention of newly learned memory contents, which is believed to reflect sleep-associated memory consolidation, was comparable between groups, as was the formation of gist-based memories. The findings indicate that subjective deteriorations in sleep quality experienced by pregnant women are not necessarily linked to objective impairments. They raise the possibility that sufficient slow wave sleep towards the end of pregnancy allows for normal sleep-related memory consolidation. Although these results were obtained in a small number of pregnant women in very good health and should be corroborated in larger samples, they challenge the assumption of poor sleep and impaired memory as hallmarks of the \"pregnancy brain\".", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32985760/"}

They kept daily sleep diaries and wore wrist monitors for continuous recording of activity. Sleep parameters were derived from activity using the manufacturer's software and analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using SAS 8.2. Sequential urine samples were collected for 48 h weekly for 6-sulphatoxymelatonin measurement as an index of circadian rhythm timing. Individuals working watches of 1200-1600/2400-0400 h and 1600-2000/0400-0800 h had 2 sleeps daily, analyzed separately as main sleep (longest) and 2nd sleep. Main sleep duration was shorter in watch keepers than in day workers (p < 0.0001). Objective sleep quality was significantly compromised in rotaters compared to both day workers and fixed watch keepers, the most striking comparisons being sleep efficiency (percentage desired sleep time spent sleeping) main sleep (p < 0.0001) and sleep fragmentation (an index of restlessness) main sleep (p < 0.0001). The 2nd sleep was substantially less efficient than was the main sleep (p < 0.0001) for all watch keepers. There were few significant differences in sleep between the different watches in rotating watch keepers. Circadian timing remained constant in day workers.

Alternatively, individuals might sacrifice sleep in order to gain an advantage over mate competitors. Here, we perform a theoretical analysis of the social evolutionary pressures that drive investment into sleep versus wakefulness. Specifically, we: investigate how relatedness between social partners may modulate sleeping strategies, depending upon whether sleep sacrifice is selfish or altruistic; determine the conditions under which the sexes are favoured to adopt different sleeping strategies; identify the potential for intragenomic conflict between maternal-origin versus paternal-origin genes regarding an individual's sleeping behaviour; translate this conflict into novel and readily testable predictions concerning patterns of gene expression; and explore the concomitant effects of different kinds of mutations, epimutations, and uniparental disomies in relation to sleep disorders and other clinical pathologies.

In addition, cognitive performance at follow-up and clinical characteristics (i.e., severity of disorder-related symptoms and number of hospitalizations between baseline and follow-up) are assessed. Multiple regression analysis results in a model with slow-wave sleep (SWS) and number of hospitalizations as significant predictors accounting for 50% (R2 = 0.507; p <0.001) of the variance in social functioning. SWS remains a significant predictor of long-term social functioning throughout a series of refining analyses which also identify baseline functioning as an additional significant predictor, whereas diagnosis is non-significant. Also, the effect of SWS on social functioning is not mediated by number of hospitalizations as assessed by a bootstrapped mediation analysis. We thus conclude that duration of slow-wave sleep is a powerful predictor of long-term social outcome in psychiatric disorders.

In this study, we examined population-based data on the associations between sleep duration and several symptoms of sleep-related disease, reported snoring and daytime sleepiness. Results from 1877 independently living individuals between the ages of 50 and 65 years suggested that long, but not short, sleep durations were related to greater reported snoring. Higher levels of reported snoring and daytime sleepiness, but not habitual sleep duration, were related to measures of disease and lower psychosocial function. We suggest that future epidemiologic studies use such additional items as potential indicators of sleep-related disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8283193/"}

A belief that bedsharing with infants negatively impacts the quality of adult sleep also appears wide-spread. This has not been substantiated, however, because the few studies that have measured the impact of bedsharing on adult sleep examined only bedsharing with another adult. In the present study, laboratory polysomnography was performed in 20 routinely bedsharing and 15 routinely solitary-sleeping, breastfeeding, Latino mother-infant pairs comparing the mothers' sleep when bedsharing to solitary-sleeping nights. Infants were 11-15 weeks old at the time. Irrespective of routine sleeping arrangement, mothers' total sleep time was not decreased on the bedsharing night compared to the solitary night. Across the two groups, percent Stage 3-4 sleep (of total sleep time) was significantly reduced on the bedsharing night but only by 3.9%, while Stage 1-2 sleep was increased 3.7%. Episodes of both Stages 3-4 and 1-2 were significantly shorter. The amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was unaffected. Overall, arousal frequency was significantly increased by 3.6 hour-1. As the increase in arousal frequency was stage specific, it could account for the pattern of stage changes. Nocturnal wakefulness was not increased, however, because awakenings were of shorter duration. these effects of bedsharing did not habituate with routine bedsharing because they were not diminished in the routinely bedsharing mothers compared to the routinely solitary-sleeping mothers. We find that the impact of bedsharing on maternal sleep is modest and somewhat different from the reported impact of sleeping with another adult. From the infant's standpoint, the effects on maternal sleep are adaptive to the extent that opportunities to monitor the infant's status are enhanced. The mother's caregiver role is likely germane to differential effects on sleep of bedsharing with an infant versus another adult.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9143074/"}

Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) promote sleep by selectively inhibiting wake-promoting neuropeptide signaling, unlike global inhibition of central nervous system excitation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor (GABAaR) modulators. We evaluated the effect of DORA versus GABAaR modulators on underlying sleep architecture, ability to waken to emotionally relevant stimuli versus neutral auditory cues, and performance on a sleepiness-sensitive cognitive task upon awakening. DORA-22 and GABAaR modulators (eszopiclone, diazepam) were evaluated in adult male rhesus monkeys (n = 34) with continuous polysomnography recordings in crossover studies of sleep architecture, arousability to a classically conditioned salient versus neutral acoustical stimulus, and psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance if awakened. All compounds decreased wakefulness, but only DORA-22 sleep resembled unmedicated sleep in terms of underlying sleep architecture, preserved ability to awaken to salient-conditioned acoustic stimuli while maintaining sleep during neutral acoustic stimuli, and no congnitive impairment in PVT performance. Although GABAaR modulators induced lighter sleep, monkeys rarely woke to salient stimuli and PVT performance was impaired if monkeys were awakened. In nonhuman primates, DORAs' targeted mechanism for promoting sleep protects the ability to selectively arouse to salient stimuli and perform attentional tasks unimpaired, suggesting meaningful differentiation between a hypnotic agent that works through antagonizing orexin wake signaling versus the sedative hypnotic effects of the GABAaR modulator mechanism of action.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943466/"}

The focus of most research in this area has been on the use of travel time for different use cases. Sleeping is one of the most time-consuming activities in everyone's life; therefore, this has been described as one of the most desired use cases for fully automated vehicles. In order to identify the best conditions to allow sleep and improve sleep quality while travelling in such vehicles, two studies were performed: a sleep study and a pressure distribution study, the results of which are included in this document. The focus of both studies was on two seat positions: reclined (60° backrest recline) and flat (87° backrest recline). In the sleep study, forty participants had the opportunity to sleep during a 90-min drive in order to evaluate long-term comfort and subjective sleep quantity and quality. Although both positions resulted in generally similar results in terms of sleep and comfort, some significant differences were identified. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale results showed that sleepiness increased in the reclined position, whereas it decreased in the flat position. Moreover, the self-reported parameter Wake After Sleep Onset was higher in the reclined position. In the pressure distribution study, it was possible to identify specific seat prototype limitations indicating inadequate support, which was related to discomfort detected during the sleep study. As a conclusion, the comparison between the reclined and flat positions showed indications that, in moving fully automated vehicles, the flat seat position is the most comfortable and effective for sleeping.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35803165/"}

However, in-depth analysis of AB related to sleep characteristics is lacking. Based on previous studies addressing the arousal index, we hypothesized that the AB would peak in the supine sleeping position and during non-rapid eye movement stage 1 and show high variability between scorers. Nine expert scorers analyzed polysomnography recordings of 50 participants, the majority with an increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. AB was calculated in different sleeping positions and sleep stages. A generalized estimating equation was used to test the association between AB and sleeping positions, sleep stages, and scorers. The correlation between AB and arousal index was tested with Spearman's rank-order correlation. AB significantly differed between sleeping positions (<i>P</i> < .001). The median AB in the supine sleeping position was 47-62% higher than in the left and right positions. The AB significantly differed between the sleep stages (<i>P</i> < .001); the median AB was more than 200% higher during non-rapid eye movement stage 1 than during other sleep stages. In addition, the AB differed significantly between scorers (<i>P</i> < .001) and correlated strongly with arousal index (<i>r =</i> .935, <i>P</i> < .001). AB depends on the sleeping position, sleep stage, and scorer, as hypothesized. AB behaved similarly to the arousal index, but the high variability in the ABs between scorers indicates a potential limitation caused by subjective manual scoring.

Their electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, chin electromyogram, electrocardiogram, respiration, oxygen saturation, and wrist skin temperature were measured continuously during sleep. Saliva samples were collected, and blood pressure was measured both before and after sleep. The results showed that at the temperature of 30°C, the total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and duration of REM sleep of the elderly decreased by 26.3 min, 5.5%, and 5.3 min, respectively, and time awake increased by 27.0 min, in comparison with 27°C, indicating that the sleep quality of the elderly is very vulnerable to heat exposure. Even a small heat load led to an overactive sympathetic nervous system and increased wrist skin temperature, which reduced sleep quality. Improving the ventilation increased the duration of deep sleep and REM sleep by 10.3 min and 3.7 min, respectively. Higher pollutant concentrations affected the respiration and autonomous nervous systems to reduce sleep quality. The benefits of improved thermal environment and ventilation on sleep quality were found to be additive.

Despite sleep disruption's well-recognized negative influence on cognition, and its prevalence with age, surprisingly few studies have tested sleep's relationship to cognitive aging. We measured sleep stages in young adult and aged F344 rats during inactive (enhanced sleep) and active (enhanced wake) periods. Animals were behaviorally characterized on the Morris water maze and gene expression profiles of their parietal cortices were taken. Water maze performance was impaired, and inactive period deep sleep was decreased with age. However, increased deep sleep during the active period was most strongly correlated to maze performance. Transcriptional profiles were strongly associated with behavior and age, and were validated against prior studies. Bioinformatic analysis revealed increased translation and decreased myelin/neuronal pathways. The F344 rat appears to serve as a reasonable model for some common sleep architecture and cognitive changes seen with age in humans, including the cognitively disrupting influence of active period deep sleep. Microarray analysis suggests that the processes engaged by this sleep are consistent with its function. Thus, active period deep sleep appears temporally misaligned but mechanistically intact, leading to the following: first, aged brain tissue appears capable of generating the slow waves necessary for deep sleep, albeit at a weaker intensity than in young. Second, this activity, presented during the active period, seems disruptive rather than beneficial to cognition. Third, this active period deep sleep may be a cognitively pathologic attempt to recover age-related loss of inactive period deep sleep. Finally, therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing active period deep sleep (e.g., by promoting active period wakefulness and/or inactive period deep sleep) may be highly relevant to cognitive function in the aging community.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21483696/"}

The 3 inclusion criteria were 1) age≥55 years, 2) absence of facial nerve palsy, and 3) absence of eyelid trauma or surgery. Immediately before the ocular plastic surgeon assessed the patient, each patient was questioned in a separate consulting room by the attending orthoptist as to his or her customary side of sleeping. After detailed explanation, the \"history-masked\" ocular plastic surgeon then assessed the patient's upper eyelid laxity, the main outcome measurement. This was performed by asking the seated patient to look down and then gently grasping the upper eyelids close to the eyelid margin, just medial to the lateral commissure. The ocular plastic surgeon, with thumbs pronated, simultaneously distracted both upper eyelids superiorly, laterally, and anteriorly. The measured separation of the upper eyelid from the globe conjunctiva was obtained using calipers. Eyelid laxity grading was designated as grade 1: 0 to 1.9 mm; grade 2: 2.0 to 3.9 mm; grade 3: 4 to 9 mm; and grade 4: floppy. Two hundred sixty-two patients (58% females) who consecutively satisfied the selection criteria were evaluated, of which 70.22% (183/262) patients had significantly greater laxity of the upper eyelid that corresponded to the side on which they customarily slept.

In the human adult, differences in thermoregulatory efficiency during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) are less pronounced compared to other mammals: although thermoregulatory processes persist in REM sleep, they are less efficient than during SWS. Cold and warm loads disturb the efficiency and structure of sleep. The duration of REM sleep and (to a lesser extent) of SWS decreases. In contrast, pre-sleep warm loads enhance SWS and improve sleep continuity. This procedure may promote and maintain sleep in depressed patients, whose sleep and body temperature rhythms are modified. In contrast to adults, homeothermic processes in neonates are maintained or even enhanced during active sleep (AS) when compared to quiet sleep (QS). Sleeping in a cool environment increases the duration of AS at the expense of QS. As a result, the thermoregulatory function overcomes the need to conserve energy that would otherwise lead to increased QS. An interaction between sleep, respiration, and thermoregulation may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: an alteration in the thermal balance may perhaps induce respiration instability, especially during AS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12505480/"}

Themes of sleep duration included striking a balance between 'achieving the hours' whilst also sacrificing sleep to manage responsibilities. Themes of sleep efficiency included symptoms of insomnia ('losing sleep over the situation') and 'sleeping on guard' in case night-time support was required. Timing of sleep was themed as either restricted to 'when the one I care for sleeps' or salvaged as a luxury 'quiet time'. Levels of alertness were represented within themes of being 'tired all of the time' whilst also in a state of 'high alert'.

Each row control unit can detect and adjust the pressure and height of each air bag in the row. When the bed body is turned on, it automatically initializes, adjusts the state of each air bag to the same height and pressure, and enters a slow scanning state. When perceived objects or people are lying on the bed, the bed automatically perceives the human body structure and body pressure matrix, increases the scanning speed for more timely and accurate measurements of the digital matrix and forming pressure by matrix-normalized processing, and then uses local pressure variance detection to automatically adjust to the sleeping position of the human body and thus achieve a uniform force distribution and a comfortable state. Finally, pressure matrix binarization was used to match sleeping position templates to identify the best template for automatic recognition of the sleeping position. The experimental results show that the sleeping position recognition method has high accuracy, recall, and precision. Our mattress is designed with interfaces for external devices.

We investigated the effect of intranasal insulin on sleep-associated neurophysiological and neuroendocrine parameters and memory consolidation in 16 men and 16 women (aged 18-30 years), who learned a declarative word-pair task and a procedural finger sequence tapping task in the evening before intranasal insulin (160 IU) or placebo administration and 8 h of nocturnal sleep.

Insulin treatment impaired the acquisition of new contents in both the declarative and procedural memory systems on the next day, whereas retrieval of original memories was unchanged. Results indicate that sleep-associated memory consolidation is not a primary mediator of insulin's acute memory-improving effect, but that the peptide acts on mechanisms that diminish the subsequent encoding of novel information.

These findings suggest that CX3CR1 deficiency leads to different cerebral behaviors and responses to SD. The inflammation-attenuating activity and the related modification of synaptic pruning are possible mechanism candidates, which indicate CX3CR1 as a candidate therapeutic target for the prevention of the sleep loss-induced cognitive impairments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34732662/"}

However, as prior studies have focused on memory for negative stimuli, it is unclear whether positive memories benefit from time and sleep as well. To investigate the consolidation of positive memories, the current study examined differences in memory for humorous and non-humorous cartoons. While prior evidence demonstrates that humorous information is preferentially remembered relative to non-humorous information over brief delays, it is unknown whether this benefit lasts across longer delay intervals or whether sleep is important for lasting humor memories to form. Thus, we tested memory for 27 cartoons across 12-h delay periods containing either sleep or wakefulness. Results indicate that humor's enhancing effect on recall memory is robust across a 12-h delay and that a period of sleep facilitates this effect over wakefulness when cartoons are novel to participants and ranked based on subjective emotional ratings. Further, in accordance with previous studies that reveal diminished emotional reactivity to stimuli following sleep, in a supplemental experiment, we found that sleep reduced subjective ratings of humor, arousal, and positivity of humorous cartoons. These findings provide preliminary evidence that sleep's impact on negative emotional memory consolidation and emotional reactivity can be extended to positive stimuli as well.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24337230/"}

Here, we combine behavioral analysis with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to demonstrate that this shift reflects the emergence of limb twitches during QS. Twitches during QS are not only unaccompanied by REMs, but they also occur synchronously with sleep spindles, a hallmark of QS. As QS-related twitching increases with age, sleep spindle rate also increases along the sensorimotor strip. The emerging synchrony between subcortically generated twitches and cortical oscillations suggests the development of functional connectivity among distant sensorimotor structures, with potential implications for detecting and explaining atypical developmental trajectories.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34139191/"}

SWs decline during sleep and this is thought to be related to a reduction of synaptic strength in cortical networks and to be central to sleep's role in maintaining brain function. A central assumption in current concepts of sleep function is that SWs during sleep, and associated recovery processes, are independent of circadian rhythmicity. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying all SWs from 12 EEG derivations in 34 participants in whom 231 sleep periods were scheduled across the circadian cycle in a 10-day forced-desynchrony protocol which allowed estimation of the separate circadian and sleep-dependent modulation of SWs. Circadian rhythmicity significantly modulated the incidence, amplitude, frequency and the slope of the SWs such that the peaks of the circadian rhythms in these slow-wave parameters were located during the biological day. Topographical analyses demonstrated that the sleep-dependent modulation of SW characteristics was most prominent in frontal brain areas whereas the circadian effect was similar to or greater than the sleep-dependent modulation over the central and posterior brain regions. The data demonstrate that circadian rhythmicity directly modulates characteristics of SWs thought to be related to synaptic plasticity and that this modulation depends on topography. These findings have implications for the understanding of local sleep regulation and conditions such as ageing, depression, and neurodegeneration which are associated with changes in SWs, neural plasticity and circadian rhythmicity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25979664/"}

Youth (M age = 9.51; 53.1% male) wore an ActiGraph and completed a sleep diary for 2 consecutive weeks. For youth who owned a pet dog, the dog wore an ActiGraph for the same 2 weeks. Youth were separated into 3 groups: those who slept with a pet on the bed, those with a pet in the room but not on the bed, and those with no pet in the bedroom. Results suggest that youth with a pet on the bed have a shorter sleep duration, lower efficiency, and longer sleep onset latency than youth without a pet in the bedroom. A pet on the bed explained unique variance in sleep efficiency, duration, and latency when accounting for factors previously shown to impact youth sleep. Awakenings and self-reported sleep problems did not differ between groups. In dyadic analyses (n = 43), dog movement 1 min prior predicted child movement at night.

In addition, the associations between child and parent sleep regarding parent fatigue have not been explicitly explored, which could be relevant for parents of autistic children with increased sleep disturbance likelihood. The current study used two weeks of objective sleep (actigraphy) and subjective fatigue data from 81 parents and their children to explore associations among child sleep IIV, parent sleep IIV, and parent average daily fatigue, including evaluating evidence for mediation. Sleep IIV was estimated using a validated Bayesian model. Linear regression analyses indicated that greater parent total sleep time IIV predicted significantly higher fatigue levels. Child sleep IIV was unrelated to parent sleep IIV and fatigue, unsupportive of hypothesized mediation. Similarly, post hoc analyses examining child sleep averages, parent total sleep time IIV, and average parent fatigue were insignificant. Findings cautiously support the uniqueness of total sleep time IIV within parental sleep's relationship with fatigue, independent of child sleep. Objective sleep IIV should continue to be examined in addition to average levels.Lay abstractFatigue is associated with numerous harmful physical and mental health outcomes. Despite research indicating a relationship between fatigue and sleep, there has been a limited focus on how the variability of a person's sleep may be associated with fatigue. In addition, previous studies have not explicitly explored relationships among child sleep, parent sleep, and parent fatigue. Increasing knowledge about this area of research could be particularly relevant for families with autistic children with an increased likelihood of sleep disturbances. The current study used two weeks of objective sleep (actigraphy) data and subjective ratings of parent fatigue from 81 parents and their autistic children to examine associations among child and parent within-person sleep variability regarding average parent fatigue levels. Evidence was assessed for the role of parent sleep variability in hypothesized connections between child sleep variability and parent fatigue. We found that only greater variability in parents' total sleep time was associated with higher levels of parents' average daily fatigue rating over the two weeks. Child sleep variability was not significantly associated with parent sleep variability or average daily fatigue. In addition, average levels of child sleep were unrelated to parent total sleep time variability and fatigue. Although cautious interpretation is required, findings support the idea that variability in total sleep time may be a unique aspect of parental sleep's association with fatigue, independent of child sleep.

CLAS of slow oscillation up-states in sleep is becoming a popular tool to study and enhance sleep's functions, as it increases slow oscillations, evokes sleep spindles and enhances memory consolidation of certain tasks. However, few studies have examined the specific neurophysiological mechanisms involved in CLAS, in part because of practical limitations to available tools. To evaluate evidence for possible models of how sound stimulation during brain up-states alters brain activity, we simultaneously recorded electro- and magnetoencephalography in human participants who received auditory stimulation across sleep stages. We conducted a series of analyses that test different models of pathways through which CLAS of slow oscillations may affect widespread neural activity that have been suggested in literature, using spatial information, timing and phase relationships in the source-localized magnetoencephalography data. The results suggest that auditory information reaches ventral frontal lobe areas via non-lemniscal pathways. From there, a slow oscillation is created and propagated. We demonstrate that while the state of excitability of tissue in auditory cortex and frontal ventral regions shows some synchrony with the electroencephalography (EEG)-recorded up-states that are commonly used for CLAS, it is the state of ventral frontal regions that is most critical for slow oscillation generation. Our findings advance models of how CLAS leads to enhancement of slow oscillations, sleep spindles and associated cognitive benefits and offer insight into how the effectiveness of brain stimulation techniques can be improved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37675803/"}

As a result, remembering is subject not only to memory failure, but to inaccuracies and distortions as well. Although such distortions are often retained or even enhanced over time, sleep's contribution to the development of false memories is unknown. Here, we report that a night of sleep increases both veridical and false recall in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, compared to an equivalent period of daytime wakefulness. But while veridical memory deteriorates across both wake and sleep, false memories are preferentially preserved by sleep, actually showing a non-significant improvement. The same selectivity of false over veridical memories was observed in a follow-up nap study. Unlike previous studies implicating deep, slow-wave sleep (SWS) in declarative memory consolidation, here veridical recall correlated with decreased SWS, a finding that was observed in both the overnight and nap studies. These findings lead to two counterintuitive conclusions - that under certain circumstances sleep can promote false memories over veridical ones, and SWS can be associated with impairment rather than facilitation of declarative memory consolidation. While these effects produce memories that are less accurate after sleep, these memories may, in the end, be more useful.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19348959/"}

Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore daily fluctuations in subjective measures of psychological wellness and physiologic stress (soreness, rating of perceived exertion [RPE]) across a competitive soccer season, and the extent to which sleep duration and quality modify daily measures of wellness. Twenty female collegiate soccer players underwent daily measures of psychological well-being (mental stress, mental fatigue, anxiety, and depression), physical stress (active time, total distance, GPS load, soreness, and RPE), and sleep (duration and quality) across a 120-day competitive season. Generalized linear mixed-effects models with a zero-inflation component were used to examine the effects of sleep duration and quality on measures of physiologic and psychological stress. Sleep duration was a predictor of RPE and anxiety, and there was an interaction between sleep duration and the day of the soccer season affecting RPE, anxiety, and soreness ( p < 0.05). Sleep quality was a predictor of anxiety, mental stress, and RPE ( p < 0.05). Significant interactions were observed between sleep quality and the day of the soccer season affecting soreness, anxiety, mental fatigue, and mental stress (all p < 0.05).

A control-panel assembly, mounted in the sleep compartment, tested electrodes, preserved analog signals, and automatically analyzed data in real time (providing a telementered indication of sleep stage). One subject was studied during each manned mission and, while there was considerable variation among individuals, several characteristics were common to all three: stage 3 sleep increased during the flight and decreased in the postflight period; stage 4 was consistently decreased postflight, although this stage was variable during the flight; stage REM (rapid eye movement) was elevated, and REM latency decreased in the late postflight period (after day 3 postrecovery); and the number of awakenings during sleep either showed no change or decreased during the flight. In only the 28-d mission (Skylab 2) was there a significant decrease in total sleep time; in that case it was a result of voluntarily reduced rest time and was not due to difficulty in sleeping nor frequent awakening. The subject on the 84-d mission (Skylab 4) experienced more difficulty in the first half of the flight, showing a decreased total sleep time and increased sleep latency, but this resolved itself with time. Sleep latency presented no problem in the other flights. While many of the findings are statistically significant, in no case would they be expected to produce a noticeable decrement of performance capability. These findings suggest that men are able to obtain adequate sleep in regularly scheduled 8-h rest periods during extended space flights. It seems likely, based upon these results, that the problems encountered in earlier space flights did not arise from the zero-g environment per se but possibly were a result of more restricted living and working areas in the pre-Skylab spacecraft.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/179518/"}

Existing findings have been inconsistent and unable to address cause-effect relationships. This study piloted an experimental protocol to induce sleep variability and explore its impact on daytime sleepiness in adolescents. Healthy adolescents aged 14-17 participated in a 3-week, at-home protocol. Sleep was monitored by sleep diaries and actigraphy. Following a run-in period to stabilize wake times (set at 6:30am throughout the protocol), participants were randomly counterbalanced across two 5-night experimental conditions. Bedtimes were consistent at 11:00pm during the stable sleep condition (7.5-hour sleep period each night) but changed on alternating nights during the variable sleep condition (ranging from 9:30pm to 12:30am) so that sleep duration averaged 7.5 hours across the condition with a standard deviation of 1.37 hours. Difficulty waking was assessed each morning and daytime sleepiness was assessed by end-of-condition parent- and adolescent-reports. Of the 20 participants who completed the study, 16 met the predetermined adherence definition. For those who were adherent, there were no differences in overall sleep duration between the stable and variable sleep conditions (p>.05) but adolescents had 58.6 minutes greater night-to-night variation in sleep duration in the variable condition (p < .001). Across all nights, youth reported greater difficulty waking following nights of shorter assigned sleep (p = .004) and greater overall sleepiness during the variable condition (p = .03).

The REM sleep episode interval, defined as the average interval between the start of successive REM sleep episodes, was significantly shorter for real-time sustained sleep than the cycle lengths as determined by the autocorrelation technique.

A total of 181 (65%) parents reported having practiced co-sleeping with their children. The latent class analysis identified a two-class solution with two different sleep patterns.

In some special cases we found subjects well adapted to the workaday world who could live with briefer sleeping periods. Because of experimental problems, the second question--how does stress affect sleep?--is more difficult to answer. Anxiety is one of the most important factors deteriorating sleep under conditions of stress. This reduced sleep is in turn stressful for waking behavior.

Sleep-wake time and light stimulation were measured in infants for 4 consecutive days using actigraphy. The infants' mothers were asked to complete a sleep events diary and a questionnaire about childcare, including \"co-sleeping\", defined as when the infant and mother slept on the same surface throughout the night. The data were analyzed with a focus on daytime and nighttime sleep parameters. Daytime light stimulation reduced daytime \"active sleep\", tended to reduce daytime sleep, and increased daytime waking. Nighttime light stimulation reduced nighttime \"quiet sleep\" and nighttime sleep and increased nighttime waking. Co-sleeping reduced nighttime waking, and, as a result, nighttime sleep time and sleep efficiency increased. Co-sleeping reduced daytime sleep and tended to increase daytime waking. Consequently, co-sleeping tended to increase the ratio of nighttime sleep to daytime sleep.

On the other hand, co-sleeping may promote sleep consolidation into nighttime. Therefore, further methods for safe co-sleeping need to be established while avoiding risk factors for sudden unexpected death in infancy/sudden infant death syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38218083/"}

However, there is a scarcity of research investigating the impact of forest environments on sleep. This study primarily investigated the physiological and psychological effects of sleep in a forest environment. It included a sample of 50 Chinese young adult students. A comparative analysis was conducted to examine the impact of sleeping in a forest environment as opposed to a controlled room setting (control). The researchers collected data on blood pressure, electroencephalography (EEG), and psychological markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure after the participants slept in a forest environment compared to when they slept in a room (control). Moreover, a notable increase in alpha- and beta-wave frequencies was detected in the forest environment. A more pronounced reduction in anxiety scores was observed in those exposed to a forest environment compared to those in the control group. The physiological and psychological data presented in this study demonstrate that engaging in forest leisure positively affects both physical and mental relaxation in young adults.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37989638/"}

A baseline nocturnal sleep period was followed by one night's total sleep deprivation, then sleep at 180 degrees phase shift, and then return to a normal nocturnal sleep episode (SP-3). Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured every 20 min (obtained by an indwelling venous catheter), rectal temperature was measured every minute, and sleep was polygraphically defined. During the first 4 h of sustained sleep, cortisol secretion was decreased even when sleep occurred during a time when the subject was usually awake; conversely, it was elevated if awake at the usual daily time of sleeping. This was not the case for the last 4 h of sleep. Body temperature was also decreased but during each entire 7- to 8-h sleep period. Meals produced only a small brief rise of cortisol and produced no change in body temperature. Stage 4 sleep was increased during the 180 degrees inverted sleep episode and decreased during SP-3, REM sleep however was increased during SP-3. A reciprocal relationship was found between REM and stages 3 and 4 for the second, third, and fourth, and sixth h of sleep for SP-3. These results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the behavioral complex of sleeping on cortisol secretion superimposed on its endogenous circadian and ultradian rhythm. These neurophysiological events may be used to entrain and time the period and phase of biological rhythms in relation to shift work, sleep deprivation, and transmeridian jet travel.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6822642/"}

Based on questions from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and adapted to a school context, the questionnaire focussed on estimating sleep onset time, wake-up time and sleep duration on both weekdays and weekends. This subjective survey was compared with accelerometry data while also considering the influence of sociocultural factors (sex, place of living, ethnic community and socio-economic status). Adolescents aged 10.5-16 years (n = 182) in New Caledonia completed the survey and wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Accelerometry was used to determine sleep onset and wake-up time using validated algorithms. Based on response comparison, Bland-Altman plots provided agreement between subjective answers and objective measures. We categorized participants' answers to the survey into underestimated, aligned and overestimated categories based on time discrepancies with accelerometry data. Multinomial regressions highlighted the sociocultural factors associated with discrepancies. Concordance between the accelerometer and self-reported assessments was low particularly during weekends (18%, 26% and 19% aligned for onset sleep time, wake-up time and sleep duration respectively) compared with weekdays (36%, 53% and 31% aligned, respectively). This means that the overall concordance was less than 30%. When considering the sociocultural factors, only place of living was associated with discrepancies in onset sleep time and wake-up time primarily on weekdays. Rural adolescents were more likely to overestimate both onset sleep time (B = -1.97, p < 0.001) and wake-up time (B = -1.69, p = 0.003). The study found low concordance between self-assessment and accelerometry outputs for sleep components. This was particularly low for weekend days and for participants living in rural areas. While the adapted four-item questionnaire was useful and easy to complete, caution should be taken when making conclusions about sleep habits based solely on this measurement.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38706418/"}

In fact, current clinical perspectives on infant sleep, which are based exclusively on studies of solitary sleeping infants, may partly reflect culturally induced rather than species-typical infant sleep patterns which can only be gleaned, we contend here, from infants sleeping with their parents--the context within which, and for well over 4 million years, the hominid infant's sleep, breathing, and arousal patterns evolved. Our physiological study of five co-sleeping mother-infant pairs in a sleep lab is the first study of its kind to document the unfolding sleep patterns of mothers and infants sleeping in physical contact. Our data show that co-sleeping mothers and infants exhibit synchronous arousals, which, because of the suspected relationship between arousal and breathing stability in infants, have important implications for how we study environmental factors possibly related to some forms of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). While our data show that co-sleeping mothers and infants also experience many moments of physiological independence from each other, it is clear that the temporal unfolding of particular sleep stages and awake periods of the mother and infant become entwined and that on a minute-to-minute basis, throughout the night, much sensory communication is occurring between them. Our research acknowledges the human infant's evolutionary past and considers the implications that nocturnal separation (a historically novel and alien experience for them) has for maternal and infant well-being in general and SIDS research strategies in particular.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2252080/"}

We analysed the sleeping and eating behaviour of 1098 women aged 47-55 years and represented different menopausal statuses with regression analyses. Over 20% of them reported fairly poor or poor perceived sleep quality. A higher number of postmenopausal women reported experiencing at least fairly poor sleep quality compared with the other menopausal groups. However, in regression models controlled for several confounding factors menopausal status was not associated with measures of sleep. Women who reported more snacking-type eating behaviour were more likely to report shorter sleep duration, and more daytime tiredness. Externally cued eating was associated with shorter sleep duration and emotional eating was associated with experiencing daytime tiredness. However, after adjusting for multiple testing, it appears that eating behaviour is associated only with daytime tiredness.

We have used evolutionary and developmental data to challenge this view. We suggest that co-sleeping provides a sensory-rich environment which is the more appropriate environment in which to study infant sleep. In addition, two preliminary, in-laboratory, polygraphic investigations of mother-infant co-sleeping are reported in normal infants, within the peak age range for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Five mother-infant pairs co-slept one night in the first study; in the second, three additional pairs slept separately for two nights and co-slept the third consecutive night. The results suggest that co-sleeping is associated with enhanced infant arousals and striking temporal overlap (synchronicity) in infant and maternal arousals, and that, possibly as a result, co-sleeping mothers and infants spend more time in the same sleep stage or awake condition.

Only a few patients need a thorough expert examination in a special sleep laboratory. Thanks to EEG, which makes available a continuous record of uninterrupted sleep cycles, knowledge of the physiology of sleep now includes important information about the normal circadian rhythm of waking and sleeping, the alternation of REM and non-REM periods, and the depth of the individual sleep cycles. EEG results are also an important basis for checking the effect of sleeping drugs. Analysis of sleep disturbances is based on the formal distinction between hypersomnia, and hyposomnia and parasomnia. Etiologically, a distinction must be made between exogenic and endogenic sleep disturbances and attention given to the fact that disturbances of night sleep also affect vigilance on the following day. These considerations are also important for the use of sleeping drugs, whose half-life and biological effect allow a useful differentiation between substances giving impulses to sleep, sleep-inducing drugs, and those enabling uninterrupted sleep during night-time. Sleep disturbances combined with certain other symptoms belong to particular syndromes in which it may be necessary to use sleeping drugs, but these should only be used in combination with other drugs, in order to reduce the risk of side effects, tolerance changes, dependence and addiction with long-term treatment. When a combination of different drugs is given, interference through interaction with lipid or protein binding, and induction or enzyme breakdown in the liver should be taken into account.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3758121/"}

Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness' persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/waking) and ultradian (90-120) min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7142420/"}

Insomnia is a disorder in which the sufferer has difficulty in falling or staying asleep. There are multifactorial causes involved in the aetiology of childhood insomnia. In order to understand and diagnose insomnia in childhood it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the genesis of sleeping and waking. We must also take the possible existence of other types of disorders into consideration. Insomnia appears as an imbalance between the systems that maintain the waking state and those that are in charge of activating sleep generating systems. In children, this imbalance depends on the state of functional immaturity peculiar to each age. Rather than a shortage of sleep, childhood insomnia takes the form of a lack of matching between the child s own rhythm or need to sleep and his or her family or social environment. Insomnia is most frequently caused by environmental, behavioural and psychological factors. A correct diagnosis of childhood insomnia has to be based on determining a procedure to differentiate it from parasomnias or motor disorders affecting waking and sleep. Identifying the causes of childhood insomnia, differentiating it from real insomnia and other sleep disorders, and resolving it are no simple matter because of the influence exerted by the environment and the child s behaviour on how he or she sleeps.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12599139/"}

This study analysed these responses during the daytime and night-time sleep of shiftworkers doing a three shift system, to determine the influence of the inversion of the sleep-wake cycle on the sensitivity to noise. A group of 14 shiftworkers [aged 37 (SD 5) years] underwent an habituation daytime sleep, two experimental daytime sleeps and a night-time sleep. Traffic noises were presented during sleep [truck, 71 dB(A); motorbike, 67 dB(A); and car, 64 dB(A)] at a rate of nine each hour. The EEG measurements of sleep, electrocardiogram and finger pulse amplitude were recorded continuously. The results were expressed by computing the percentage of observed cardiac response (%HRR) and vasoconstrictive response (%FPR), magnitude of heart rate variation (heart rate response; HRR), percentage of reduction of the digital blood flow (finger pulse response, FPR), cardiac cost (CC = % HRR x HRR) and vasomotor cost (VC = % FPR x FPR). The results showed that, compared to night-time sleep, there was change in the structure of daytime sleep, that is an increase in slow wave sleep (SWS), especially stage 4 sleep decrease of stage 2 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latencies, and an earlier SWS and REM sleep barycentric point. During daytime sleep the % FPR was significantly smaller in SWS than in stage 2 or REM sleep. Large differences were observed in % HRR, HRR and CC between daytime sleep stages (SWS less than stage 2 less than REM sleep).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8425516/"}

Odorants used in the experiment were clove, jasmine, lavender, lemon, peppermint, pine, rose, sandalwood, valerian, and ylang-ylang. Valerian and rose inhalation significantly prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, whereas lemon inhalation significantly shortened it. The effect of valerian inhalation was markedly noticeable. In the anosmic rats, a significant effect of odorants on the pentobarbital sleep time was not seen. Electroencephalographic studies on natural sleep revealed that rose inhalation did not exert any significant effect on sleep, but a significant shortening in sleep latency and a significant prolonging in total sleep time were observed with valerian inhalation, whereas a significant prolonging in sleep latency was observed with lemon inhalation. Such effects of valerian and lemon inhalation were not admitted in anosmic rats. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase assay indicates that valerian inhalation decreases the activity of the enzyme and enhances GABA activity. Although valerian has been reported to exert a good effect for sleep as a medicine for internal use, the present study is the first medical report suggesting that the inhalation of valerian may enhance the sleep. On the other hand, the present results may suggest the possibility that lemon inhalation may cause a worsening of insomnia symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16857858/"}

Participants listened to semantically related word lists lacking a critical lure representing each list's \"gist.\" Free recall was tested after 12 hours containing sleep or wake. The Sleep group recalled more studied words than the Wake group but only for emotionally neutral lists. False memories of both negative and neutral critical lures were greater following sleep relative to wake.

We also assessed whether subject intelligence is associated with heightened task acquisition and, more importantly, whether greater intelligence translates to greater over-sleep declarative and procedural memory enhancement. Across both tasks, we demonstrate that postsleep performance gains are nearly equivalent, regardless of whether subjects obtain a half night or a full night of sleep. Remarkably, the over-sleep memory changes observed on both tasks are very similar to findings from studies examining performance following a daytime nap. Consistent with previous research, we also observed a strong positive correlation between amount of Stage 2 sleep and motor skill performance in the full-night sleep group. This finding contrasts with a highly significant correlation between spectral power in the spindle frequency band (12-15 Hz) and motor skill enhancement only in the half-night group, suggesting that sigma power and amount of Stage 2 sleep are both important for optimal motor memory processing. While subject intelligence correlated positively with acquisition and retest performance on both tasks, it did not correlate with over-sleep changes in performance on either task, suggesting that intelligence may not be a powerful modulator of sleep's effect on memory performance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19702788/"}

Although this view was confirmed in numerous studies in adults, it is not known whether it can be generalized to sleep during development. Here, we examined effects of sleep on implicit memory formation considered of particular relevance in children, because brain structures underlying implicit learning develop earlier in ontogeny than structures supporting explicit learning. Subjects were 7- to 11-year-old children (n = 14) and 20- to 30-year-old adults (n = 12) tested on a serial reaction time task before (learning) and after (retest) equal length retention periods of overnight sleep and daytime wakefulness. At learning, after eight training blocks, all subjects had acquired implicit knowledge of the probabilistic rules underlying the sequential stimulus materials, as indicated by a substantial difference in response time to grammatical versus nongrammatical trials in two test blocks that followed the training blocks. At learning, this response time difference was greater in children (48.49 +/- 6.08 msec) than adults (28.02 +/- 3.65 msec, p < .01), but did not differ between sleep and wake retention conditions in either age group. Consistent with previous studies, retesting in the adults revealed that the reaction time differences between grammatical and nongrammatical trials increased by 9.78 +/- 4.82 msec after sleep, but decreased by -12.76 +/- 5.49 msec after the wake retention period (p < .01). Contrary to this finding in adults, sleep in children did not lead to an increase, but to a decrease in the reaction time difference averaging -26.68 +/- 12.25 msec (p < .05), whereas across the wake retention interval the reaction time difference remained nearly unchanged. The sleep-dependent deterioration in measures of implicit sequence knowledge in children was in striking contrast to the gain of such knowledge in the adults during sleep (p < .01). Our findings indicate that the functional role of sleep in implicit memory consolidation depends on age. We speculate that the overnight decrease of implicit knowledge in children reflects a preferential effect of sleep toward the enhancement of explicit aspects of task performance that interferes with implicit performance gains.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17280511/"}

Sleep quality was assessed subjectively by a single question score, and objectively by ActiGraph for one night before and 3 sleeps after exercise with a heart rate variability monitor. After the intervention, MICE resulted in a significant improvement in subjective sleep quality (P = 0.035), earlier bedtime (P < 0.001), and more total sleep time (P = 0.028) compared with the control trial (CTL). Compared with MICE, the HIIE had a greater reduction in sleep efficiency by 7.39% (P = 0.010) and had a greater increase in wake after sleep onset percentage (increase 10%, P = 0.049), sleep fragmentation index (increase 2%, P = 0.001), and a modest increase in mean activity during TIB (increase 35.49, P = 0.035).

However, it is unclear whether all aspects of mammalian sleep are present in birds. We examined whether birds suppress REM sleep in response to changes in sleeping conditions that presumably evoke an increase in perceived predation risk, as observed previously in rodents. Although pigeons sometimes sleep on the ground, they prefer to sleep on elevated perches at night, probably to avoid nocturnal mammalian ground predators. Few studies to date have investigated how roosting sites affect sleep architecture. We compared sleep in captive pigeons on days with and without access to high perches. On the first (baseline) day, low and high perches were available; on the second day, the high perches were removed; and on the third (recovery) day, the high perches were returned. The total time spent sleeping did not vary significantly between conditions; however, the time spent in REM sleep declined on the low-perch night and increased above baseline when the pigeons slept on the high perch during the recovery night. Although the amount of SWS did not vary significantly between conditions, SWS intensity was lower on the low-perch night, particularly early in the night. The similarity of these responses between birds and mammals suggests that REM sleep is influenced by at least some ecological factors in a similar manner in both groups of animals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30287589/"}

The upside-down jellyfish <i>Cassiopea xamachana</i> sleeps, and this behavior is controlled by radially spaced marginal ganglia. After defining a sleep-wake threshold, we compared gene expression profiles of ganglia from animals deprived of sleep and found differential expression in many sleep-related genes including GABAergic, melatonergic, and cholinergic receptors. In particular, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit-like (Chrnal-E) was strongly differentially expressed in sleep deprived animals. Animals deprived of sleep under both mechanical and light perturbations suggested <i>chrnal-E</i> as a key gene regulating sleep. We found that chemical cholinergic neuromodulators regulate pacemaker activity. Visualization of <i>chrnal-E</i> mRNA revealed it is expressed primarily within the ganglia, and that the area of expression expands after sleep deprivation. In order to confirm the functional role of <i>chrnal-E</i>, we developed RNAi for use in <i>Cassiopea</i> and determined that Chrnal-E promotes wakefulness. Finally, we field-sampled control and sleep deprived animals and found <i>chrnal-E</i> has lowest expression late at night in controls, while in sleep deprived animals, <i>chrnal-E</i> peaks at this time, supporting a link to wakefulness.

Sleep was assessed using polysomnography. Participants in the split and consolidated conditions obtained 4.0h of sleep per 14h and 7.6h of sleep per 28h, respectively. Some differences between the groups indicated that sleep quality was lower in the split condition than the consolidated condition: the split sleeps had longer sleep onset latency (9.7 vs. 4.3min), more arousals (7.4 vs. 5.7 per hour in bed), and a greater percentage of stage 1 sleep (4.1% vs. 3.1%), than the consolidated sleeps.

With similar protocols, another set of studies indicated that sleep has a role in creativity and problem-solving. Here we hypothesised that sleep can increase the likelihood of solving problems. After struggling to solve a video game problem, subjects who took a nap (n = 14) were almost twice as likely to solve it when compared to the wake control group (n = 15). It is interesting to note that, in the nap group 9 out 14 subjects engaged in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and all solved the problem. Surprisingly, we did not find a significant involvement of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep in this task. Slow-wave sleep is believed to be crucial for the transfer of memory-related information to the neocortex and implement intentions. Sleep can benefit problem-solving through the generalisation of newly encoded information and abstraction of the gist.

Patients were evaluated by their physiotherapists and occupational therapists the next day regarding how well rested they seemed according to three parameters: alertness, fatigue, and level of participation in therapy. Thirty-three percent of the patients received sleeping pills on the study night. Sleeping pill use did not predict patient perception of getting a good night of sleep or the somewhat more objective sleep rating by the night nurse. Whether a sleeping pill was taken was also found not to be predictive of restful sleep as estimated by the physical and occupational therapists. Variables significantly associated with therapists' ratings of apparently restful sleep included number of comorbidities, the nurses' rating of how well the patient had slept, the patients' self-assessment of sleep, and whether the patient felt well rested the morning after sleep. However, the patients' own assessment of sleep quality was negatively related to their performance in rehabilitation therapy. This suggests that patient self-report of sleeping difficulty may not be the best or only guideline to follow when considering intervention such as prescribing sleeping pills, particularly because sleeping pill use seems not to influence either patient perception of sleep or how well rested they seem in therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10574171/"}

In the Australian rail industry the emphasis is primarily on the impact of working time on sleep. The extent to which factors other than working time might affect the sleep behaviour of employees in the large and diverse Australian rail industry is largely unknown. The present study used sleep, work and fatigue diaries completed for two weeks, in conjunction with actigraphy, to understand the contribution of demographic and health factors to sleep behaviour in 40 rail safety workers. Both shift type and having dependents were significant predictors of sleep duration (P<.05). Sleep duration was greatest prior to night shifts, followed by afternoon shifts and morning shifts. Participants with dependents got significantly less sleep than participants without dependents. Both timing of sleep and smoking were significant predictors of sleep quality (P<.05). Day sleeps were associated with lower subjective sleep quality than night sleeps and smokers reported poorer sleep quality than non-smokers. These findings indicate that factors other than working time have the potential to influence both the sleep duration and subjective sleep quality of rail safety workers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22239928/"}

Bearing in mind that food intake produces many metabolic signals that can influence memory processing in humans (e.g., insulin), the present study addressed the question as to whether the enhancing effect of sleep on memory consolidation is affected by the amount of energy consumed during the preceding daytime. Compared to sleep, nocturnal wakefulness has been shown to impair memory consolidation in humans. Thus, a second question was to examine whether the impaired memory consolidation associated with sleep deprivation (SD) could be compensated by increased daytime energy consumption. To these aims, 14 healthy normal-weight men learned a finger tapping sequence (procedural memory) and a list of semantically associated word pairs (declarative memory). After the learning period, standardized meals were administered, equaling either ∼50% or ∼150% of the estimated daily energy expenditure. In the morning, after sleep or wakefulness, memory consolidation was tested. Plasma glucose was measured both before learning and retrieval. Polysomnographic sleep recordings were performed by electroencephalography (EEG). Independent of energy intake, subjects recalled significantly more word pairs after sleep than they did after SD. When subjects stayed awake and received an energy oversupply, the number of correctly recalled finger sequences was equal to those seen after sleep. Plasma glucose did not differ among conditions, and sleep time in the sleep conditions was not influenced by the energy intake interventions. These data indicate that the daytime energy intake level affects neither sleep's capacity to boost the consolidation of declarative and procedural memories, nor sleep's quality. However, high energy intake was followed by an improved procedural but not declarative memory consolidation under conditions of SD. This suggests that the formation of procedural memory is not only triggered by sleep but is also sensitive to the fluctuations in the energy state of the body.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22768272/"}

Napping was common (93%), especially on-board and before the return. Sleep efficiency dropped below 90% during layover, being felt to be too short and disturbed by awakenings, and gradually returned to normal across four recovery days. Recovery sleep was characterized by difficulties waking up and feelings of not being refreshed from sleep. Sleepiness symptoms increased during layover and gradually decreased across recovery days, still being elevated on day 4. In the present study we found that westward flights are associated with extended wake spans during layover, increased sleepiness, and slow recovery on return home.

Sleep is unstable with numerous awakenings. Longer periods of stage 1 and 2 sleep are observed and slow wave sleeps as well as REM sleep time is reduced.

{"id": "24952130", "title": "Psychophysiological arousal at encoding leads to reduced reactivity but enhanced emotional memory following sleep.", "text": "While sleep's role in emotional memory processing is gaining increasing support, its effect on emotion regulation remains equivocal. Moreover, little is known about the link between emotional reactivity at the time of encoding and subsequent sleep-based emotional memory consolidation. This study examined whether sleep would potentiate, protect, or depotentiate measures of heart rate and skin conductance in response to scenes containing emotional and neutral objects, and assessed how these measures of reactivity would predict subsequent memory for the objects across delays of sleep and wake. Heart rate deceleration (HRD) and skin conductance response (SCR) data were collected at encoding and recognition. Although HRD and SCR reactivity to objects were depotentiated after a sleep-filled delay, they remained unchanged after a delay containing wakefulness. Moreover, increased arousal responses to negative scenes at encoding as measured by HRD and SCR responses were positively correlated with subsequent memory for the negative objects of scenes, but only in the sleep group. This suggests that larger reactions to negative images at the time of encoding set the stage for the preferential consolidation of these images during a night of sleep. Although arousal responses are often thought to account for emotional enhancement in long-term memory, these findings suggest that both an arousal response at encoding and a subsequent period of sleep are needed to optimize selective emotional memory consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24952130/"}

A convenience sample of 595 Iranian adult social media users (M<sub>age</sub> = 27.45, SD<sub>age</sub> = 11.42) reported on social media-related nightmare, social media use integration, anxiety, peace of mind, sleep quality, and nightmare distress. The Social Media-Related Nightmare Scale (SMNS) demonstrated a unidimensional structure with sound psychometric properties. The most common nightmares involved the inability to log in to social media and the disruption of relationships with other users. Social media use intensity predicted frequency of social media-related nightmares. These nightmares were correlated with increased anxiety, lower peace of mind, poor sleep quality, and nightmare distress. Importantly, social media-related nightmares mediated the relationship between social media use intensity and low affective well-being (i.e., anxiety and peace of mind), poor sleeping, and nightmare distress.

After a 6-h SD, these mice and their controls were killed by microwave irradiation, and glycogen and glucose were quantified in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and cerebellum. After SD, both measures significantly increased by approximately 40% in the cortex of B6 mice, while glycogen significantly decreased by 20-38% in brain stem and cerebellum of AK and D2 mice. In contrast, after SD, glucose content increased in all three structures in AK mice and did not change in D2 mice.

In this study, we examined the impact of sleep, wake, and time-of-day influences on the processing of declarative information with strong semantic links (semantically related word pairs) and information requiring the formation of novel associations (unrelated word pairs). Participants encoded a set of related or unrelated word pairs at either 9 am or 9 pm, and were then tested after an interval of 30 min, 12 hr, or 24 hr. The time of day at which subjects were trained had no effect on training performance or initial memory of either word pair type. At 12 hr retest, memory overall was superior following a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness. However, this performance difference was a result of a pronounced deterioration in memory for unrelated word pairs across wake; there was no sleep-wake difference for related word pairs. At 24 hr retest, with all subjects having received both a full night of sleep and a full day of wakefulness, we found that memory was superior when sleep occurred shortly after learning rather than following a full day of wakefulness. Lastly, we present evidence that the rate of deterioration across wakefulness was significantly diminished when a night of sleep preceded the wake period compared to when no sleep preceded wake, suggesting that sleep served to stabilize the memories against the deleterious effects of subsequent wakefulness. Overall, our results demonstrate that 1) the impact of 12 hr of waking interference on memory retention is strongly determined by word-pair type, 2) sleep is most beneficial to memory 24 hr later if it occurs shortly after learning, and 3) sleep does in fact stabilize declarative memories, diminishing the negative impact of subsequent wakefulness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22457736/"}

Here we calculated the effect of insufficient sleep on economic loss in Argentina, according to an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model that considers average sleeping length in terms of the recommended minimum and its effect on productivity and health outcomes. We considered different scenarios in which the population sleeps from six to nine hours every night.

In the pentobarbital-induced sleep model, mice underwent a two-week oral administration of LVE, followed by intraperitoneal pentobarbital injections. The results demonstrated that LVE significantly shortened sleep latency and prolonged sleep duration compared to the control group. Notably, adenosine A1 receptor expression, both at the mRNA and protein levels, was markedly upregulated in the brains of LVE-treated mice. Furthermore, LVE's administration led to a significant increase in the mRNA expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor subunits (α2 and β2) in brain tissue. In the electroencephalography (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG)-based sleep model, mice underwent surgical implantation of EEG and EMG electrodes, followed by one week of LVE administration. Quantitative EEG analysis revealed that LVE treatment reduced wakefulness while significantly enhancing REM and NREM sleep's duration, indicating its potential sleep-promoting effects. These findings suggest that LVE may serve as a promising natural sleep aid, improving both the quality and duration of sleep through the modulation of adenosine and GABAergic signaling pathways.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40565187/"}

We assessed whether normal infant development in the first 3 months involves increasing sleep-period length or the ability to resettle autonomously after waking in the night. One hundred one infants were assessed at 5 weeks and 3 months of age using nighttime infrared video recordings and parental questionnaires. The clearest development was in sleep length; 45% of infants slept continuously for ≥5 hours at night at 3 months compared with 10% at 5 weeks. In addition, around a quarter of infants woke and resettled themselves back to sleep in the night at each age. Autonomous resettling at 5 weeks predicted prolonged sleeping at 3 months suggesting it may be a developmental precursor. Infants reported by parents to sleep for a period of 5 hours or more included infants who resettled themselves and those with long sleeps. Three-month olds fed solely breast milk were as likely to self-resettle or have long sleep bouts as infants fed formula or mixed breast and formula milk. Infants are capable of resettling themselves back to sleep in the first 3 months of age; both autonomous resettling and prolonged sleeping are involved in \"sleeping through the night\" at an early age. Findings indicate the need for physiological studies of how arousal, waking, and resettling develop into sustained sleeping and of how environmental factors support these endogenous and behavioral processes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26035139/"}

The objective of this study was to compare subjective perceptions of meals and the levels of anxiety in the same subjects after working night shifts and after taking a nocturnal sleep, and to investigate associations between the responses to meals and the levels of anxiety under these two conditions. The study evaluated 34 male permanent night-shift workers who worked a 12-h shift followed by a 36-h rest period. Evaluations included: sleep pattern (on three days after working night shifts and after sleeping at night); hunger, enjoyment of eating foods and satiety after a meal (evaluated by visual analogue scales on three non-consecutive days after working night shifts and after nocturnal sleeps); and state of anxiety (on a day after working a night shift and a day after a nocturnal sleep). In the days following a night shift, workers had higher mean hunger scores before lunch and higher anxiety scores than when they had slept at night (p = 0.007 and 0.001, respectively). Linear regression indicated that, after a night shift, anxiety scores were negatively associated with hunger before breakfast (p = 0.04) and lunch (p = 0.03), the enjoyment of eating foods (p = 0.03) and the number of meals eaten during the course of the 24 h (p = 0.03). It is concluded that night shifts increase mean hunger and anxiety scores. Anxiety levels seem to interfere with the responses associated with food consumption.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27721011/"}

In the 21st century, studies in the field have focused on 3 main topics: functional networks that underlie dreaming, neural correlates of dream contents, and signal propagation. We review neuroscientific studies about dreaming processes, focusing on their cortical correlations. The involvement of frontoparietal regions in the dream-retrieval process allows us to discuss it in light of the Global Workspace theory of consciousness. However, dreaming in distinct sleep stages maintains relevant differences, suggesting that multiple generators are implicated. Then, given the strong influence of light perception on sleep regulation and the mostly visual content of dreams, we investigate the effect of blindness on the organization of dreams. Blind individuals represent a worthwhile population to clarify the role of perceptual systems in dream generation, and to make inferences about their top-down and/or bottom-up origin. Indeed, congenitally blind people maintain the ability to produce visual dreams, suggesting that bottom-up mechanisms could be associated with innate body schemes or multisensory integration processes. Finally, we propose the new dream-engineering technique as a tool to clarify the mechanisms of multisensory integration during sleep and related mental activity, presenting possible implications for rehabilitation in sensory-impaired individuals. The Theory of Proto-consciousness suggests that the interaction of brain states underlying waking and dreaming ensures the optimal functioning of both. Therefore, understanding the origin of dreams and capabilities of our brain during a dreamlike state, we could introduce it as a rehabilitative tool.

{"id": "36628812", "title": "Is word learning capacity restored after a daytime nap?", "text": "Sleep is thought to be involved in the consolidation of new memories encoded during the day, as proposed by complementary learning systems accounts of memory. Other theories suggest that sleep's role in memory is not restricted to consolidation. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that new learning is implemented in the brain through strengthening synaptic connections, a biologically costly process that gradually saturates encoding capacity during wake. During slow-wave sleep, synaptic strength is renormalized, thus restoring memory encoding ability. While the role of sleep in memory consolidation has been extensively documented, few human studies have explored the impact of sleep in restoring encoding ability, and none have looked at learning beyond episodic memory. In this registered report we test the predictions made by the complementary learning systems accounts and the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis regarding adult participants' ability to learn new words, and to integrate these words with existing knowledge. Participants took a polysomnographically-monitored daytime nap or remained awake prior to learning a set of new spoken words. Shortly after learning, and again on the following day, we measured participants' episodic memory for new words. We also assessed the degree to which newly learned words engage in competition with existing words. We predicted that sleep before encoding would result in better episodic memory for the words, and facilitate the overnight integration of new words with existing words. Based on existing literature and theory we further predicted that this restorative function is associated with slow-wave and sleep spindle activity. Our pre-registered analyses did not find a significant benefit of napping prior to encoding on word learning or integration. Exploratory analyses using a more sensitive measure of recall accuracy demonstrated significantly better performance in the nap condition compared to the no-nap condition in the immediate test. At the delayed test there was no longer a significant benefit of the nap. Of note, we found no significant effect of slow-wave activity prior to encoding on episodic memory or integration of newly learned words into the mental lexicon. However, we found that greater levels of Stage 2 sleep spindles were significantly associated with greater improvements in lexical competition from the immediate to the delayed test. Therefore, our results demonstrate some support for theories that implicate sleep spindles in restoring encoding capacity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36628812/"}

Each of these four manipulations was followed by a day-time sleep beginning at 1100 hr. No significant changes in the duration of the first sleep cycle appeared. As the prior sleep loss increased both SWE (slow-wave energy; accumulated EEG delta power density) and SWA (slow-wave activity; EEG delta power per minute) increased during the 1100-hr sleeps. This was observed for the entire cycles, the nonrapid eye movement (NREM) periods, and the SWS periods, respectively. SWS latency decreased and SWS duration increased, respectively, markedly with prior waking. Also, for the progressively postponed sleeps (started at 2300 hr, 0300 hr, 0500 hr and 1100 hr) there were changes, but not as clear. After 28 hr of continuous waking there was a marked increase of SWA during SWS. Also, at this level there was a spill over of SWA to the second cycle. It is suggested that there might be a limit to the amount and intensity of SWS that can be accommodated in the first sleep cycle and that this limit is reached before the appearance of REM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1866528/"}

Because sleep deprivation increases the frequency of slow wave sleep (SWS) arousals in sleepwalkers, it may also affect the expression of the homeostatic process to a greater extent than shown previously. We thus investigated SWA power as well as slow wave oscillation (SWO) density in 10 sleepwalkers and nine controls at baseline and following 38 h of sleep deprivation. There was a significant increase in SWA during participants' recovery sleep, especially during their second non-rapid eye movement (NREM) period. SWO density was similarly increased during recovery sleep's first two NREM periods. A fronto-central gradient in SWA and SWO was also present on both nights. However, no group differences were noted on any of the 2 nights on SWA or SWO. This unexpected result may be related to the heterogeneity of sleepwalkers as a population, as well as our small sample size.

Twenty-four neurons were activated synaptically at short latencies from the midbrain reticular formation (MRF) after anterograde degeneration of passing fibers. Sixty-five neurons were identified antidromically as projecting to motor or parietal association cortical areas; of them, 23 also could be excited synaptically from the MRF. These neurons were regarded as possibly being involved in the transfer toward the neocortex of the tonic excitation from the MRF during EEG-desynchronized behavioral states. Rates of spontaneous discharge in CL-Pc neurons doubled from synchronized sleep (S) to either wakefulness (W) or desynchronized sleep (D). First order measures of discharge patterns indicated that interval modes in both W and D states (greater than 10 msec) are significantly different from those in S (2.5 msec). During S, the intervals found in the less than 5-msec class indicated the intraburst frequencies; a later minor mode (200 to 350 msec) reflected the interburst silent periods. All neurons tested for antidromic activation from cortical areas had enhanced responsiveness in both W and D states as compared to S sleep. In some cases, the enhanced antidromic excitability was observed in conjunction with a transformation from initial segment spikes during S to full spikes in EEG-desynchronized states. During both W and D states, compared to S sleep, the probability of monosynaptically elicited single discharges to MRF stimulation was increased, and the latency and duration of high frequency bursts evoked by MRF volleys were shortened. We conclude that the features of cortically projecting intralaminar neurons that relay MRF activity fit in well with their hypothesized role in the tonic activation processes that characterize both W and D states. Several lines of evidence suggest that sustained hyperpolarization prevails in intralaminar neurons during S sleep. This is the basic prerequisite for thalamic bursting.

A better understanding could lend support in one direction or another as to the much-debated role of sleep, be it passive, permissive, or active, in memory processing. The present study employed a napping paradigm and compared performance on a bimodal paired-associates task of those who obtained a 10-min nap, containing only Stages 1 and 2 sleep, to those whose nap contained slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (60-min nap), as well as to subjects who remained awake. Measurements were obtained for baseline performance at training, after a sleep/no sleep interval for short-term retention, after a subsequent stimulus-related interference task, and again after a weeklong retention period. While all groups learned the information similarly, both nap groups performed better than the Wake group when examining short-term retention, approximately 1.5h after training (10-min p=.052, 60-min p=.002). However, performance benefits seen in the 10-min nap group proved to be temporary. Performance after a stimulus-related interference task revealed significantly better memory retention in the 60-min nap group, with interference disrupting the memory trace far less than both the Wake and 10-min nap groups (p<.001, p=.006, respectively). After a weeklong retention period, sleep's benefit to memory persisted in the 60-min nap group, with performance significantly greater than both the Wake and 10-min nap groups (p<.001, p=.004, respectively). It is our conclusion that SWS, obtained only by those in the 60-min nap group, served to actively facilitate the consolidation of learned bimodal paired-associates, supported by theories such as the Standard Theory of Consolidation as well as the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22732649/"}

One approach to revealing sleep's purpose is to identify traits that explain why some species sleep more than others. Recent comparative studies of sleep have identified relationships between various physiological, neuroanatomical and ecological traits, and the time mammals spend in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. However, owing to technological constraints, these studies were based exclusively on animals in captivity. Consequently, it is unclear to what extent the unnatural laboratory environment affected time spent sleeping, and thereby the identification and interpretation of informative clues to the functions of sleep. We performed the first electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of sleep on unrestricted animals in the wild using a recently developed miniaturized EEG recorder, and found that brown-throated three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus) inhabiting the canopy of a tropical rainforest only sleep 9.63 h d(-1), over 6 h less than previously reported in captivity. Although the influence of factors such as the age of the animals studied cannot be ruled out, our results suggest that sleep in the wild may be markedly different from that in captivity. Additional studies of various species are thus needed to determine whether the relationships between sleep duration and various traits identified in captivity are fundamentally different in the wild. Our initial study of sloths demonstrates the feasibility of this endeavour, and thereby opens the door to comparative studies of sleep occurring within the ecological context within which it evolved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18482903/"}

To analyze brain electrical activity, we developed a wavelet based method and correlated the results with body position. Among results are: (a) during sleep signals in the frequency range 30-45 Hz show a large decrease in power; (b) sleep slow waves are generated 1-2 min after the animal lies on one side and are maintained throughout the whole period in such position.

A distinctive state-dependent discharge pattern was the presence of stereotyped bursts of 2-7 spikes that occurred in 63% of the units. These bursts were most frequent in S, much less frequent in D, and rarely occurred in W. Lack of association with discharge rate changes between states showed the bursting to be a true state-dependent phenomenon. A burst consisted of 2-7 spikes, with each successive interspike interval being longer than the preceding one; in the 200 ms prior to burst occurrence, discharge probability decreased markedly. This structure of burst organization suggested a model of generation wherein each burst was caused by a unitary event of varying intensity, perhaps a rebound following a hyperpolarization. Spectral and autocorrelational analyses showed bursts occurred rhythmically in three cells at a frequency of 3-4 Hz and in two cells at a frequency of 10-12 Hz, indicating a possible linkage with slow-wave generators. While the number of bursts in the various behavioral states was a state-dependent phenomena, other aspects of discharge pattern were shown to be rate dependent. To evaluate discharge pattern apart from the occurrence of bursts, a \"primary event spike train\" was formed; this consisted of individual spikes and the first spike of each burst. This analysis showed that, within S, the probability of burst occurrence was highest when the primary spike rate was low. Quantitative analyses showed that first-order pattern measures (the form of the interspike interval histogram, IH) were dependent on the mean interspike interval (ISI, the inverse of mean rate). This association explained 83-89% of the variance in a power series approximation of IH form. Joint interval histograms (JIH) were used to evaluate the signature of bursts and of the form of the primary spike train. As with interval histograms, the main features of the form of the primary spike JIH were dependent on the primary spike rate. Thus, we concluded that first- and second-order discharge patterns of primary events were rate dependent and not state dependent. Our data are compatible with a model where in the absence of retinal input, the frequency of LGN primary spikes over behavioral state changes is largely determined by brain stem reticular formation input.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6631464/"}

The three sleeps were preceded by 4, 8, and 12 h of PRW, respectively. ANOVA showed that TST and subjective sleepiness increased with PRW and with closeness to the trough of the circadian rhythm of rectal temperature, whereas sleep latency showed the opposite pattern, and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) latency strongly decreased with PRW and with closeness to the trough. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) increased with PRW, whereas SWS latency and final time awake decreased. REM sleep increased with closeness to the circadian trough, and time awake decreased. Multiple-regression analysis showed that REM latency was closely related to increased SWS in the first sleep cycle, reduced SWS latency, and increased PRW [a short PRW before sleep at noon yielded an extremely short (14 min) REM latency]. Sleep latency and final time awake showed almost exactly the same relationship to TOD and PRW. It is concluded that both homeostatic and circadian influences simultaneously affect sleep, that REM latency is very sensitive to the need for SWS, and that the circadian acrophase strongly interferes with sleep.

Frontal sleep transients were seen until 3 weeks post term in all subjects, but in none beyond 7 weeks. Active sleep decreased from just over 50% of total sleep time at birth to about 20% beyond 8 weeks. Percent-time quiet sleep increased proportionately. Indeterminate sleep remained relatively constant at 5-10 percent-time. A tendency for percent-time indeterminate sleep to be elevated in the presences of minor illnesses was observed. The usefulness of these, and other, EEG data in defining mature and immature EEGs in the neonatal period and the clinical significance of EEG immaturity are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6159152/"}

Yet, how sleep-a central behavioral and neurophysiological process-is modulated by social interactions is poorly understood. Here, we characterized sleep behavior and neurophysiology in freely moving and co-living mice under different social conditions. We utilized wireless neurophysiological devices to simultaneously record multiple individuals within a group for 24 h, alongside video acquisition. We first demonstrated that mice seek physical contact before sleep initiation and sleep while in close proximity to each other (hereafter, \"huddling\"). To determine whether huddling during sleep is a motivated behavior, we devised a novel behavioral apparatus allowing mice to choose whether to sleep in close proximity to a conspecific or in solitude, under different environmental conditions. We also applied a deep-learning-based approach to classify huddling behavior. We demonstrate that mice are willing to forgo their preferred sleep location, even under thermoneutral conditions, to gain access to social contact during sleep. This strongly suggests that the motivation for prolonged physical contact-which we term somatolonging-drives huddling behavior. We then characterized sleep architecture under different social conditions and uncovered a social-dependent modulation of sleep. We also revealed coordination in multiple neurophysiological features among co-sleeping individuals, including in the timing of falling asleep and waking up and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) intensity. Notably, the timing of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was synchronized among co-sleeping male siblings but not co-sleeping female or unfamiliar mice. Our findings provide novel insights into the motivation for physical contact and the extent of social-dependent plasticity in sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38141615/"}

Partial airway occlusion (PAO) was induced by reducing the diameter of a tracheostomy tube by an average of 58% (i.e. to a final airway diameter of ca 3mm). This had the effect, during sleep, of significantly decreasing the respiratory rate by 21%, decreasing the minute volume by 31% and increasing PACO2 by 5 Torr (0.67 kPa) as compared to sleep in which respiration was unimpeded. There appeared to be no difference between REM sleep and Non-REM sleep in terms of the respiratory responses to the imposed stress. In the case of the waking state, the PAO did not elicit any statistically significant alteration of the respiratory parameters although there was a suggestion that the direction of change for each parameter was the same as in sleep. While respiration during sleep was unquestionably affected when the dogs were required to breathe through a plug with a very narrow opening, the gross sleep pattern remained unchanged.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7244428/"}

This paper examines the extent of chemoreceptive control of breathing within the normal physiological range in awake and sleeping humans and explores the consequences upon breathing of absent chemoreceptive function. Recent studies of subjects with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) demonstrate the extent of behavioral and arousal-related influences on breathing in the absence of arterial blood gas homeostasis. CCHS subjects lack chemoreceptor control of breathing and seriously hypoventilate during NREM sleep, requiring mechanical ventilation. Many CCHS subjects breathe adequately during many waking behaviors associated with arousal, cognitive activity or exercise--presumably reflecting input to the brainstem respiratory complex from the reticular activating system, the forebrain or mechanoreceptor afferents. In most situations, and despite changes in metabolism, the non-chemoreceptive inputs to breathing result in surprisingly well controlled arterial blood gases in CCHS patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9407612/"}
{"id": "10392656", "title": "Adaptations and pathologies linked to dynamic stabilization of neural circuitry.", "text": "Brain circuits for infrequently employed memories are reinforced largely during sleep by self-induced, electrical slow-waves, a process referred to as \"dynamic stabilization\" (DS). The essence of waking brain function in the absence of volitional activity is sensory input processing, an enormous amount of which is visual. These two functions: circuit reinforcement by DS and sensory information processing come into conflict when both occur at a high level, a conflict that may have been the selective pressure for sleep's origin. As brain waves are absent at the low temperatures of deep torpor, essential circuitry of hibernating small mammals would lose its competence if the animals did not warm up periodically to temperatures allowing sleep and circuit reinforcement. Blind, cave-dwelling vertebrates require no sleep because their sensory processing does not interfere with DS. Nor does such interference arise in continuously-swimming fishes, whose need to process visual information is reduced greatly by life in visually relatively featureless, pelagic habitats, and by schooling. Dreams are believed to have their origin in DS of memory circuits. They are thought to have illusory content when the circuits are partially degraded (incompetent), with synaptic efficacies weakened through infrequent use. Partially degraded circuits arise normally in the course of synaptic efficacy decay, or pathologically through abnormal regimens of DS. Organic delirium may result from breakdown of normal regimens of DS of circuitry during sleep, leaving many circuits incompetent. Activation of incompetent circuits during wakefulness apparently produces delirium and hallucinations. Some epileptic seizures may be induced by abnormal regimens of DS of motor circuitry. Regimens of remedial DS during seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) apparently produce temporary remission of delirium by restoring functional or 'dedicated' synaptic efficacies in incompetent circuitry. Sparing of sensory circuitry in fatal familial insomnia seemingly owes to supernormal circuit use in the virtual absence of sleep. ECT shocks and cardioverter defibrillation may have analogous remedial influences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10392656/"}

Esophageal (Tes) and mean skin (Tsk) temperatures, chest sweat rate (msw,1), and concomitant electroencephalographic data were recorded. Throughout the night, msw,1 was measured under a local thermal clamp of 38 degrees C. Results showed that the thermal environment exerted a strong influence on both the levels and the time patterns of body temperatures. Moreover, local sweating rate correlated positively with Tes, and this relationship varied according to sleep stages. For a given Tes level, there was a sleep stage-related gradation in msw,1 that was higher in slow-wave sleep (SWS) than in stage 1-2 and the lowest in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. This is explained by a change in the excitability or the sensitivity of the thermoregulatory system. The msw,1 differences between stage 1-2 and SWS are accounted for by a decrease in the Tes threshold (Tset) for sweating while the slope of the msw,1-Tes relation remains unchanged. The lower msw,1 in REM sleep is explained by a lesser slope for the msw,1-Tes relation without any Tset change from stage 1-2.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3826411/"}

In the second part the authors' own investigations are discussed. The data come from three series of experiments: 1) from five sleeps of eight subjects (s) observed under different experimental conditions: 2) from twenty-one nights spent without stimulation and fourteen nights at acoustic stimulation of the same s; 3) from the analysis of the K complexes appearing in stimulated and non-stimulated periods alternating every five minutes of stages 2 in the first cycles of 6 sleeps of another s. In five sleeps of an identical s the K complexes were examined also by means of averaging. The frequency of the K complexes was greater in the stages 2 ascending type than in those of descending type. Sensory stimulation increased the formation of K complexes in the ascending slopes of the cycles to a higher degree than in the descending ones. Repression of the K complexes appearing on the effect of stimulation in the ascending slope was more marked than in the descending one. These findings indicate a close connection of the formation of K complexes and phasic sensory activation. At the same time a connection between K-complex formation and the measure of sleep synchronization was observed. From evening to morning the frequency of K complexes decreased from cycle to cycle, parallel with the decrease in the depth of sleep. Similarly, the frequency of the K complexes measured in stages 2 showed a relationship with the depth of the cycles: the deeper the sleep in the given cycle, the more the K complexes found in unit time in stages 2 belonging to the cycle anchoring the measured stage 2. The EEG responses that could be identified with K complexes elicited by means of acoustic stimuli could be demonstrated by averaging in the whole slow-wave sleep. It is assumed that the EEG phenomena of K complex-type of spontaneous sleep arise under the effect of continuous sensory activation, hence they correspond with nonspecific evoked potential elements, and therefore the K complex can be regarded as a building stone of slow-wave sleep. At the same time K complexes were interpreted as conflict products of sensory activation and sleep-protecting influences and considered important indicators of the dynamics of the sleep-waking system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3993393/"}

Thus, states reflect the infant's CNS status and they are related in a complex, dynamic way to the developmental course of that status. A taxonomy of infants' behavioral states is described, composed of ten Primary States: Alert, Nonalert Waking, Fuss, Cry, Drowse, Daze, Sleep-Wake Transition, Active Sleep, Active-Quiet Transition, and Quiet Sleep. Using combinations of these states, a set of six Derived States is also defined. Results of naturalistic studies of infants' states are described to demonstrate for each of these states: reliability of measurement, evidence for concurrent and predictive validity, and unique intraperson correlation patterns. The findings support the usefulness of this state taxonomy for describing infants and for investigating the functions of state.

Automatic human alertness monitoring has recently become an important research topic with important applications in many areas such as the detection of drivers' fatigue, monitoring of monotonous tasks that require a high level of alertness such as traffic control and nuclear power plant monitoring, and sleep staging. In this study, we propose that balanced dynamics of Electroencephalography (EEG) (so called EEG temporal complexity) is a potentially useful feature for identifying human alertness states. Recently, a new signal entropy measure, called range entropy (RangeEn), was proposed to overcome some limitations of two of the most widely used entropy measures, namely approximate entropy (ApEn) and Sample Entropy (SampEn), and showed its relevance for the study of time domain EEG complexity. In this paper, we investigated whether the RangeEn holds discriminating information associated with human alertness states, namely awake, drowsy, and sleep and compare its performance against those of SampEn and ApEn.<i>Approach</i>. We used EEG data from 60 healthy subjects of both sexes and different ages acquired during whole night sleeps. Using a 30 s sliding window, we computed the three entropy measures of EEG and performed statistical analyses to evaluate the ability of these entropy measures to discriminate among the different human alertness states.<i>Main results</i>. Although the three entropy measures contained useful information about human alertness, RangeEn showed a higher discriminative capability compared to ApEn and SampEn especially when using EEG within the beta frequency band.<i>Significance</i>.

All stimuli were disyllabic, equiprobable and presented in random order. During wakefulness, a parietal positive 'P3' component, peaking at about 500 ms, probably equivalent to the endogenous P300 wave, was enhanced in response to the subject's own name, even in the passive condition. During SII, K-complexes (KCs) were evoked by all first names and were formed by two biphasic consecutive waveforms. While the amplitude of the late complex (N3/P4) was identical for both types of stimuli, the early portion of the KC (N2/P3), and notably the positive wave 'SII-P3' at about 600 ms, was selectively enhanced after the subject's own name. This supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct neuronal systems are activated in parallel in response to auditory stimuli during SII, one reflecting the detection of stimulus' salience and the other the processing of its intrinsic relevance. During PS, the AEP morphology was comparable to that observed in wakefulness. Notably, a posterior 'PS-P3' wave appeared exclusively in response to own names at about 550 ms, and was considered as an equivalent of the waking P300. These results suggest that the sleeping brain, during SII and PS, elicits a differential cognitive response to the presentation of the subject's own name, comparable to that occurring during wakefulness, and therefore that the sleeping brain is able to detect and categorize some particular aspects of stimulus significance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10616121/"}

Of the 2077 OSA patients, 1118 (53.8%) were positional and 959 (46.2%) were non-positional. No age differences were found between these two groups of patients. However, NPP were heavier and thus had a higher BMI than PP. PP had fewer and Less severe breathing abnormalities during sleep compared to NPP and thus, they enjoyed better sleep quality expressed by higher percentages of stage 2, 4 and 3+4 as well as a lower amount of short arousals than NPP. Also, PP patients are less sleepy during daytime hours than NPP. During the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), NPP fall asleep faster in every nap than PP patients. No differences between these two patient groups were found for any parameter of Periodic Limb Movement Disorders. AHI and BMI are independently but inversely related to positional dependency. As AHI and BMI increase, the Likelihood to be a positional patient decreases. NPP have breathing abnormalities in the supine and lateral postures, thus, for them without question, CPAP is the treatment of choice.

Physiological identification of receiver and/or projection MRF neurons was achieved through orthodromically elicited discharges. Discharge rates of MRF neurons were more than double in waking (W) and active sleep (D) without phasic motor events, as compared to synchronized sleep (S). During behavioral states associated with EEG activation, the increased firing was essentially due to cells exhibiting high discharge rates, located at relatively ventral levels of the midbrain core. MRF neurons with identified rostrally projecting axons were more active during W and D states; their discharge rates were significantly higher than those of caudally projecting cells. The discharge patterns of MRF neurons increasing their firing rates from S to W and D were of the tonic type. First-order analyses showed a negligible proportion of both very short and long interspike intervals in all states, large interval density around the mode especially in W and D, and the smallest variation coefficients in W. Rhythmic firing with a period near the modal interval was detected during W by autocorrelations. The increase in firing rate of MRF neurons from S to W or D took place before overt EEG desynchronization and behavioral manifestations that define stable W or D states. In our sample a statistically significant increase in discharge rate was found about 15 s before the end of S sleep epochs that developed into awakening. The differences between discharge features of MRF neurons during waking and sleep states and those of neurons in other brainstem reticular fields are emphasized. Taken together, these data support, at a cellular level, Moruzzi and Magoun's concept of a rostral reticular substrate that gives rise to impulses leading to tonic activation of the thalamocortical systems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7067790/"}

Continuous polygraph recordings were performed for 15-17 days in four adult male cats. During the first 5 control days cats received injections of 0.9% saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice per day (b.i.d.). Over the next 5-7 days cats received injections of 0.9% saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice per day (b.i.d.). Over the next 5-7 days cats received eltoprazine i.p. (1-2 mg/kg, b.i.d.). For the final 5 recovery days cats received saline alone. During the saline control period, the mean REM sleep percent was 13.8 +/- 0.91%. When eltoprazine was administered for the subsequent 5-7 days, the mean REM percent was reduced to 1.5 +/- 0.59%. During the 5-day recovery period, REM percent increased significantly (p less than 0.0001) above both control and drug injection values to a mean of 24.5 +/- 1.3% with a maximum on recovery day 1 of 28.4 +/- 2.6% (n = 4). In addition to REM suppression, eltoprazine produced other electroencephalographic changes: an increase in slow-wave sleep (S) percent without any change in overall wake (W) percent; an increase in electromyogram (EMG) amplitude; and a decrease in ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) wave activity. PGO wave frequency and REM% increased significantly during the recovery period.

A population of neurons was encountered with the unusual property of progressively decreasing discharge rate as the cats passed from waking (W) through synchronized sleep (S) to desynchronized sleep (D). In many cases there was a complete cessation of firing in desynchronized sleep, suggesting the designation D-off cell for this neuronal subtype. The D-off cell population was distributed in a bandlike zone across the brain stem at the pontomesencephalic junction with dense concentration of cells in aminergic nuclei: the serotonergic dorsal raphe and raphe linearis centralis and noradrenergic locus ceruleus and peribrachial regions. Aside from a sparse distribution in the central tegmental field, there were no D-off cells in pontine reticular nuclei where cells of the D-on type abound. The proportion of cells showing the D-off property and the magnitude of the state-related change were correlated across nuclear groups as follows: raphe and peribrachial (highest), locus ceruleus (intermediate), and reticular (lowest) for both values. The firing rates of D-off cells tended to be low in waking with very regular interspike intervals. This characteristic firing pattern and the anatomical distribution suggests that D-off cells may be tentatively identified as aminergic. The marked contrasts in aminergic neuronal activity between waking and desynchronized sleep are interpreted as possibly playing a role in state generation through progressive distribution of cholinergic neurons postsynaptic to the D-off cell population. Predictable results would not only be a change in the excitability of the postsynaptic population but also a change in response mode related to a shift in neurotransmitter throughout the brain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6631462/"}

Since cognitive fatigue shares many symptoms with chronic sleep deprivation (best described as cumulative excess wakefulness), it was hypothesized that cognitive fatigue is caused by cumulative excess wakefulness because of an impaired sleep efficacy. Recent results about the nature of sleep advocate that sleep aims primarily to replenish the efficiency of cortical inhibitory synapses. We extensively researched in the TBI and MS literature on cognitive fatigue facts that sustained, or invalidate, our hypothesis. We primary focused on TBI, but cognitive fatigue has received much more interest from the MS research community. We therefore used results from the MS literature to consolidate our TBI findings. There are objective reasons related to TBI and MS disease to suppose that NonREM sleep's efficacy is impaired (despite a normal duration of sleep).

A brief survey and discussion.", "text": "This paper first briefly describes rhythmic bioelectric oscillations that can be recorded from the neocortex (particularly in cats). This descriptive section is followed by a review of the mechanisms whereby these rhythms are generated, and a section in which we try to go beyond the purely correlative aspect and discuss the possible functional role of synchronized oscillations in thalamo-neocortical channels. Based on the literature data, it seems that two distinct and opposite roles can be attributed to these oscillations: either to lower the level of awareness, such as in slow wave sleep, when these oscillations are widespread on the neocortex; or to contribute to perceptual processing, when these rhythms are more localized and possibly of a higher frequency. Electrocortical (ECoG) rhythmical activities have been known and described since the early days of electrophysiological explorations of the human and animal brain. Surprisingly though, little importance has generally been attached to these oscillatory activities, except as indicators of sleep stages in animals and humans and, in the case of the alpha rhythms (the first rhythm to be discovered in the thirties by Hans Berger), of a certain state of 'relaxation' in humans. Despite the well-accepted fact that the human alpha rhythm evidently occurs during waking (even if it is in a 'relaxed' state), the idea has curiously prevailed that the waking ('aroused') state in general is mostly characterized by low voltage fast ('desynchronized') activity. It is only more recently that some studies have suggested a functional importance of a variety of regular oscillatory activities that can be recorded from the neocortex and/or from a variety of thalamic nuclei not only in the sleeping but also on the waking, behaving animal. This review considers possible reasons indicating that these rhythmical activities are more than just epiphenomena.

During sleeping, the situation was used without motor response. The contingent negative variation was clearly observed during waking and paradoxical sleep as the evoked potential whose morphology during deep slow sleep was similar to K complexes. The emitted potential was obtained in four subjects out of seven during paradoxical sleep. These results suggest that during wakefulness, the discrimination of an unconditional stimulus involves a conditioning establishment revealed by the CNV and the emitted potential. The fact that the emitted potential and CNV were unavailable during stage IV is an argument in favor of the hypothesis that the conditioning effects disappear during deep slow sleep. The occurrence of CNV and emitted potential during the paradoxical stage of sleep, suggests that a conditioning established during waking can appear during this stage of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3704249/"}

Yet, the predominance of research on NSS has relied on subjective reports of functionality. The present study examined subjective and objective sleepiness among actigraphy-verified NSS in comparison with recommended (7-9 h/day) length sleepers (RLS) who reported similarly minimal daytime dysfunction. The study tested the hypothesis that under conditions of low environmental stimulation, NSS have increased risk of drowsiness and sleep onset, regardless of perceived alertness. The NSS and RLS groups were identified via screening and verified with a 14 day assessment with actigraphy, sleep diaries, and morning ratings of sleep restoration. In-laboratory resting electroencephalography (EEG) data were analysed using a computerised EEG-based algorithm (Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig; VIGALL) to classify second-by-second changes in objective sleepiness ranging from cognitively active alertness to sleep onset. Results demonstrated that NSS exhibited significantly higher drowsiness and sleep onset ('microsleeps') across 15 min of resting EEG despite perceptions of lower subjective sleepiness compared to RLS. Findings suggest that irrespective of perceived sleep restoration and alertness, NSS appear to be at high risk of objective sleepiness that is rapidly unmasked under conditions of low environmental stimulation.

Participants learned 45 low-frequency English words and, at subsequent recall, attempted to recall the words when given the corresponding definitions. Participants either learned in the morning with recall in the evening (wake group), or learned in the evening with recall the following morning (sleep group). Performance change across the delay was significantly better in the sleep than the wake group. Additionally, the Levenshtein distance, a measure of correctness of the typed word compared with the target word, became significantly worse following wake, whereas sleep protected correctness of recall. Polysomnographic data from a subsample of participants suggested that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may be particularly important for this benefit.

The electrodes and the cable-telemetry unit are applied to the patient in the afternoon and the system is checked. The patient is then instructed to plug the system into a wall box upon retiring and to disconnect it when he wakes up in the morning. The EEG samples are automatically written out during the night on one of the EEG machines located in the EEG laboratory to which the system is connected via spectral intra-hospital wiring. The duration of the samples and of the intervals separating them can be varied according to the circumstances. We have found this method to be very helpful in the investigation of epileptic patients, especially those considered for surgical treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/73456/"}

To assess the changes that occur in ventilation on a breath-to-breath basis, we 1) examined the variations of each of tidal volume (VT), respiratory cycle time (Ttot), expiratory time (TE), and inspiratory time (TI) and 2) studied their interrelationships. We found that the variations of VT, Ttot, and TE but not of TI were significantly greater in rapid-eye-movement (REM) than in quiet sleep. In addition, on a breath-to-breath basis, VT had a positive linear relationship and strong correlation with TI; however, the correlation between VT and TE was weak in both sleep states. VT/Ttot was found to be moderately and negatively correlated with Ttot in both REM and quiet sleep. VT was weakly correlated with Ttot in REM sleep and was, on the average, more correlated with Ttot in quiet sleep. We suggest that in infants 1) on a breath-to-breath basis, VT/Ttot is likely to drop if respiratory frequency is decreased and 2) VT is nonlinearly related to Ttot during sleep; this lack of linearity depends on the lack of constancy of VT/Ttot, which is in turn closely related to the variability of the \"on-switching\" of inspiratory activity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7091389/"}

Habitually sleeping less than 6 h per night has been shown to increase susceptibility to common cold in otherwise healthy, adult civilians. However, no investigations have examined the importance of sleep duration on upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and loss of training days in military recruits. The purpose of this study was to describe self-reported sleep duration in a large cohort of military recruits and to assess the relationship between reported sleep duration and incidence of URTI's. We hypothesized that recruits who reported sleeping less than the recommended 7-9 h per night during training suffered a greater incidence of URTI and, as a consequence, lost more training days compared with recruits who met sleep recommendations. Participants included 651 British Army recruits aged 22 ± 3 yr who completed 13 wk of basic military training (67% males, 33% females). Participants were members of 21 platoons (11 male, 10 female) who commenced training across four seasons (19% winter, 20% spring, 29% summer, and 32% autumn). At the start and completion of training, participants completed a questionnaire asking the typical time they went to sleep and awoke. Incidence of physician-diagnosed URTI and lost training days due to URTI were retrieved from medical records. Self-reported sleep duration decreased from before to during training (8.5 ± 1.6 vs. 7.0 ± 0.8 h; p < 0.01). Prior to training, 13% of participants reported sleeping less than the recommended 7 h sleep per night; however, this increased to 38% during training (X2 = 3.8; p = 0.05). Overall, 49 participants (8%) were diagnosed by a physician with at least one URTI and 3 participants (<1%) were diagnosed with two URTI's. After controlling for sex, body mass index, season of recruitment, smoking, and alcohol, participants who reported sleeping less than 6 h per night during training were four times more likely to be diagnosed with URTI compared with participants who slept 7-9 h per night in a logistic regression model (OR 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5-12.9, p < 0.01). On average, each URTI resulted in 2.9 ± 1.5 lost training days. Participants who were diagnosed with URTI had more overall lost training days for any illness compared with participants who did not report a URTI during basic military training (3.3 ± 1.9 vs. 0.4 ± 1.3; p < 0.01). In a large population of British Army recruits, these findings show that more than one third of participants failed to meet sleep duration recommendations during training. Furthermore, those who reported sleeping less than 6 h per night were four times more likely to be diagnosed with an URTI and lost more training days due to URTI. Since sleep restriction is considered a necessary element of military training, future studies should examine interventions to reduce any negative effects on immunity and host defense.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746692/"}

FNE reflects the adaptive increase of alertness and perhaps the stress resulting from an unfamiliar sleeping environment. This effect is usually absent in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine), the hormone secreted by the pineal gland at night, has been found to improve sleep in elderly patients with insomnia and recently in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The authors used FNE as a marker to explore the neurobehavioral responses of patients with chronic schizophrenia to melatonin treatment. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 14 patients with chronic schizophrenia were administered melatonin (2 mg in a controlled-release formulation) or placebo for 3 weeks with a 1-week washout between treatment periods. Polysomnography was performed during the last two consecutive nights of each treatment period. The following significant FNEs were observed with melatonin treatment: (1) rapid eye movement sleep latency was longer; (2) sleep efficiency was lower; and (3) the duration of wakefulness during sleep was lower on the first night than on the second night. These effects were not found when the patients received a placebo. The FNE was manifested regardless of whether melatonin was administered before or after the placebo treatment period. For the first time, these results show that melatonin treatment exaggerates FNE in patients with chronic schizophrenia, thereby suggesting an improved ability of these patients to mobilize alertness in unfamiliar surroundings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11106143/"}

It is well-known that events and memories from waking life can be incorporated into dreams. These incorporations can be a literal replication of what occurred in waking life, or, more often, they can be partial or indirect. Two types of temporal relationship have been found to characterize the time of occurrence of a daytime event and the reappearance or incorporation of its features in a dream. These temporal relationships are referred to as the day-residue or immediate incorporation effect, where there is the reappearance of features from events occurring on the immediately preceding day, and the dream-lag effect, where there is the reappearance of features from events occurring 5-7 days prior to the dream. Previous work on the dream-lag effect has used spontaneous home recalled dream reports, which can be from Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM) and from non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREM). This study addresses whether the dream-lag effect occurs only for REM sleep dreams, or for both REM and NREM stage 2 (N2) dreams. 20 participants kept a daily diary for over a week before sleeping in the sleep laboratory for 2 nights. REM and N2 dreams collected in the laboratory were transcribed and each participant rated the level of correspondence between every dream report and every diary record. The dream-lag effect was found for REM but not N2 dreams. Further analysis indicated that this result was not due to N2 dream reports being shorter, in terms of number of words, than the REM dream reports. These results provide evidence for a 7-day sleep-dependent non-linear memory consolidation process that is specific to REM sleep, and accord with proposals for the importance of REM sleep to emotional memory consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22046336/"}

Inspection of the activity of ensembles of hippocampal CA1 complex-spike cells along with the EEG reveals the presence of a third physiological state within SWS. We characterize the hippocampal EEG and population activity of this third state relative to theta activity and LIA, its incidence relative to REM and LIA, and the functional correlates of its population activity. This state occurs repeatedly within stretches of SWS, occupying approximately 33% of SWS and approximately 20% of total sleep, and it follows nearly every REM episode; however, it never occurs just before a REM episode. The EEG during this state becomes low in amplitude for a few seconds, probably corresponding to \"small-amplitude irregular activity\" (SIA) described in the literature; we will call its manifestation during sleep \"S-SIA.\" During S-SIA, a small subset of cells becomes active, whereas the rest remain nearly silent, with the same subset of cells active across long sequences of S-SIA episodes. These cells are physiologically indistinguishable from ordinary complex-spike cells; thus, the question arises as to whether they have any special functional correlates. Indeed, many of these cells are found to have place fields encompassing the location where the rat sleeps, raising the possibility that S-SIA is a state of increased alertness in which the animal's location in the environment is represented in the brain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11850464/"}

To test this hypothesis at the cellular level, we have recorded a sample of 226 spontaneously discharging units of the C-PBL during natural sleep-waking cycles in unanesthetized head-restrained cats and have correlated the action-potential data with the PGO waves. 3. Of these 226 cells, 67.26% (n = 152) were called PGO state-on units because they increased or began firing 15-5 s before the first PGO wave of SP and maintained their high firing rate throughout SP (31.30 +/- 6.0 Hz, mean +/- SD) and REM sleep (39.46 +/- 6.70 Hz); their firing rates in W (0.45 +/- 0.85) and S (0.70 +/- 1.26) were much lower. Among these PGO state-on neurons, 28.94% (n = 44) discharged high-frequency (> 500 Hz) spike bursts on the background of tonically increased firing rates during the PGO-related states. Contrastingly, 14.16% (n = 32) of the cells (called PGO state-off units) fired tonically during W (11.54 +/- 4.15) and S (9.43 +/- 3.87) but stopped or decreased firing 25-15 s before the first PGO wave of SP; their activity remained suppressed throughout SP (0.19 +/- 0.44) and REM sleep (0.03 +/- 0.17). The remaining 18.58% (n = 42) cells fired (9-10 Hz) tonically but were unrelated to the wake-sleeping cycle. 4. During SP and REM sleep, primary PGO waves were found to appear with equal frequency in each lateral geniculate body (LGB). During REM sleep these primary waves were ipsilateral to the direction of phasic rapid eye movements as previously reported by Nelson et al. (1983). 5. During SP and REM sleep PGO state-on burst cells fired high-frequency bursts on a background of tonic activity in association with each ipsilateral primary LGB PGO wave. The first spike of a burst preceded the beginning of the negative component of the ipsilateral LGB PGO waves by 25 +/- 7.5 ms.

As well as classical EEG developmental data, some new or rarely described in the literature data are pointed out. The onset of sleep is frequently difficult to define precisely. EEG slowing sometimes begin the eye open. Up to 12 weeks, the mode of onset of sleep (defined by the sole criterion of rapide eye movements) is variable: some babies fall asleep in active (AS), the other in quiet sleep (QS). After 12 weeks of age, all children fall asleep in quiet sleep. The early appearance on the median line of the fiqures characteristic of stages of maturity is striking. Vertex sharp waves and spindles appear in QS from 3 weeks with marked interindividual variation. The rhythmic vertex-occipital sharp figures (\"saw-tooth\" waves) of AS appear after 5 weeks and become well defined from 11 weeks. Several weeks later these characteristic figures spread to the central and posterior areas of the two hemispheres. Quiet sleep and active sleep in babies before 6 months of age are not similar to the slow wave and paradoxical sleep of the adult.

Before and after the two consecutive night shifts, both the nap and no-nap groups greatly extended their night sleeps, but the daytime sleep taken by the no-nap group during this period was significantly longer than that of the nap group on both the first and second days. No significant difference was found when comparing the length of the day sleep of the no-nap group with the total sleeping time (night-time nap plus subsequent day sleep) of the nap group. Therefore a night-time nap enables part of the essential sleep to be taken in advance of the day sleep following night work. During night work, both the nap and no-nap groups exhibited an increase in the sleepiness scores and also in the subjective feelings of fatigue concerning the complaints related to drowsiness, dullness and difficulty in concentration. However, it was found that for the no-nap group these effects continued for a large part of the recovery period following night work.

The correlation coefficient range was 0.49 to 0.92 in quiet sleep and 0.50 to 0.93 in REM sleep. Regression analyses supported a linear approximation of the delta RR to RR relation over the RR range investigated (400 to 520 msec). The median slope was 0.124 in REM and 0.117 in quiet sleep. The slopes of these linear functions were similar in both sleep states and at all ages. If beat-to-beat variability is to be used as an index of the integrity of the autonomic nervous system, these results suggest that delta RR be corrected for RR. A model is presented which relates the demonstrated positive correlation of delta RR to RR with the physiology of cardiac output control.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7383743/"}

How and when this coordination is achieved during development is not known. We used embryos and newborns of a precocial bird species (chickens) to assess developmental activation in different neurochemical systems using cFos expression, which has been extensively employed to examine cellular activation during S and W in adult mammals. Similarly to adult mammals, newborn awake chicks showed significantly higher cFos expression in W-active hypocretin/orexin (H/O), serotonergic Dorsal Raphe, noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus and cholinergic Laterodorsal and Pedunculopontine Tegmental (Ch-LDT/PT) neurons when compared to sleeping chicks. cFos expression was significantly correlated both between these systems, and with the amount of W. S-active melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons showed very low cFos expression with no difference between sleeping and awake chicks, possibly due to the very short duration of S episodes. In embryonic chicks, cFos expression was low or absent across all five systems at embryonic day (E) 12. Unexpectedly, a strong activation was seen at E16 in H/O neurons. The highest activation of Ch-LDT/PT (also S-active) and MCH neurons was seen at E20. These data suggest that maturation of arousal systems is achieved soon after hatching, while S-control networks are active in late chick embryos.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27717810/"}

However, little information is available on these variables in healthy client-owned cats or cats with subclinical heart disease (SHD). Therefore, we examined and characterized the sleeping respiratory rate (SRR) and resting respiratory rate (RRR) in 59 echocardiographically normal (EN) and 28 apparently healthy (AH) cats, and 54 SHD cats acquired by the cat owners in the home environment on eight to 10 separate occasions. The within-cat mean sleeping respiratory rate (SRRmean) in EN cats, AH cats and SHD cats with mild or moderate left atrial (LA) enlargement (as defined by quantiles of the ratio of the LA to the aorta [LA:AO]) was consistently <30 breaths/min; median SRRmean approximated 21 breaths/min. The SRRmean of SHD cats with severe LA enlargement sometimes exceeded 30 breaths/min, and was higher than SRRmean of other SHD cats (P <0.05). The within-cat mean resting respiratory rate was consistently higher than SRRmean (P <0.05). Age and geographic location, but not bodyweight, affected SRRmean in EN and AH cats. Within-cat SRR and within-cat RRR did not vary markedly from day-to-day, as evidenced by a low within-cat coefficient of variation. Data acquisition was considered easy or non-problematic by most participants. Our data provide useful guidelines for SRR and RRR, obtained in the home environment, in healthy cats and cats with SHD, and might prove useful in managing cats with clinical heart disease. Cats with SRRmean >30 breaths/min and cats with multiple SRR measurements >30 breaths/min likely warrant additional evaluation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24170428/"}

We calculated Cohen's κ coefficient between accelerometer and video measurements and 91.5% of the κ-values were >0.80. Intra- and inter-observer coefficient of variance showed that specific acceleration waveform patterns of sleeping posture could be easily and accurately detected by independent observers. There were no significant differences in the frequency of sleeping posture occurrences between accelerometer and video measurements. We compared averaged sleeping posture bout, and the total sleeping posture time between accelerometer and video measurements using regression. In each trait, the slope was close to 1 and the intercept was not different from 0, which showed a strong agreement between accelerometer and video measurements. This shows that an accelerometer could accurately detect sleeping postures of cattle.

This study shows that sleep may begin without complete eye closure, with half closed eyes or with brief, alternating opening and closing of the eyes. The modifications of the various polygraphic and behavioural parameters depend on the stage of sleep which is the outcome. The changes which most often condition the passage to a given stage of sleep are the following: (a) inhibition of the tonic chin EMG in the transition towards active sleep (AS); (b) modifications of the EEG in the transition towards quiet sleep (QS); (c) stopping of crying and of agitation in the transition towards indeterminate sleep (IS). The comparison of results obtained using the two methods of analysis shows that the simple observation of behavioural parameters overestimates the number of sleep inductions in AS. This method does not take into account discordances between polygraphic parameters. This study confirms the reduction with age of sleep onsets in AS, with a concomitant increase in sleep onsets in QS.

In most infected animals, on the other hand, Fos-ir neurones were detected in the SCN during W, but not during the S period, with a significant difference between control and infected S rats. Thus, these data indicate that the basal c-fos expression in the SCN during the L-D and S-W cycles is considerably altered in experimental trypanosomiasis. This is the first observation of a selective change in the SCN in trypanosome-infected rat brains.

In eight lambs fitted with obstructable rubber face masks, we recorded electrocortical, electroocular, and electromyographic activities to identify sleep-wake states; intrapleural pressure, heart rate, and percentage O2 saturation (Sao2) were also recorded. In each lamb, arousal and respiratory responses were measured after tidal airflow was obstructed during rapid eye movement (REM) and nonREM sleep. Each lamb was studied, on different days, when unsedated and after being mildly sedated with either promethazine or diazepam. Seven of the lambs were studied while sleeping after being sedated with promethazine (1.6 +/- 0.07 mg/kg, orally with milk) and six were studied after sedation with diazepam (0.31 +/- 0.03 mg/kg, intramuscularly). In unsedated lambs, airflow obstruction led to augmentation of respiratory efforts, bradycardia, hypoxemia, and arousal; in REM sleep, arousal was delayed and occurred at lower Sao2 (16 +/- 3 s; 75.3 +/- 3%) compared with nonREM sleep (8 +/- 1 s; 90 +/- 1%). Sedation increased the arousal latency in both REM and nonREM sleep and caused arousal to occur at lower Sao2; in some sedated lambs Sao2 fell to less than 30% before arousal. The augmentation of inspiratory and expiratory efforts immediately before arousal was increased after sedation. We conclude that promethazine and diazepam depress arousal responses in sleeping lambs leading to profound hypoxia, and that this may be due to impaired sensitivity to augmented respiratory efforts and other physiologic changes during airflow obstruction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8888284/"}

Our data suggest that infant-parent co-sleeping alters the infant's sleep experience as, for example, the characteristics of arousals, the frequency and duration of nursing, infant sleep position and the number of maternal inspections. For example, while sleeping in the same bed, mothers nurse their infants three times more frequently than they do while their infants sleep in an adjacent room. These preliminary data demonstrate significant differences between routine co-sleeping and solitary sleeping environments. This work underscores the importance of studying infant sleep as it unfolds in the co-sleeping environment, the environment within which it evolved over at least 5 million years of human evolution.

Initial recordings without labeling revealed that recorded neurons in the m-PFTG had a tonic, sustained membrane depolarization in REM sleep as compared with more polarized MP levels in slow-wave sleep (S) and phasic depolarizations in wakefulness (W) on a more polarized MP level. In neurobiotin-labeled neurons, there was a strong correlation between the soma size of m-PFTG neurons and the 'lead time', the time of onset relative to the beginning of REM, of a sustained increase in membrane depolarization. Thirty-nine m-PFTG neurons with soma cross-sectional areas ranging from 2098 microm(2) to 5958 microm(2) (mean value 3833.8 microm(2)) were analyzed. A majority of these m-PFTG neurons showed an increase in membrane depolarization associated with depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and spike generation that occurred before electrographic signs of REM sleep onset, while the rest of the neurons depolarized at the beginning of or just after REM sleep onset. Our previous work had suggested that many of these m-PFTG neurons were output neurons to the spinal cord. Analysis of the onset time of sustained membrane depolarization (Leadtime(MP)) revealed that larger cells had a longer lead time, while analysis of the lead times for onset of sustained PSPs and action potentials (Leadtime(AP)) showed this measure not to be dependent on soma size, but to be rather uniform, occurring just before the onset of REM sleep. Hence recruitment time, defined as the difference between Leadtime(AP) and Leadtime(MP), was dependent on cell soma size, implying that larger neurons may take longer to depolarize to an MP level critical for generating sustained action potentials, while smaller neurons may require less time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12207952/"}

Regardless of habitat, all sleeping sites were located in areas of steep terrain of ≥60°. In undisturbed habitat, sleeping sites were located only in evergreen broadleaf forest with rock caves and crevices surrounded mainly by a vegetation layer of shrub + rock. In disturbed habitat, sleeping sites were also located in mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest and in grassland, including rock caves, crevices, and pits, surrounded mainly by arbor + shrub and shrub + rock. Wild food availability was higher in undisturbed habitat than disturbed habitat, but food abundance around sleeping sites was lower. Water sources included river and seasonal gully or pond. There was strong positive correlation between use of sleeping sites away from the river valley and occurrence of seasonal water sources. The number of sleeping sites varied across groups, numbering 6, 7, and 10 for three specific groups. Few sleeping sites were used all year round. Six consecutive nights was the longest recorded run. Francois's langurs' sleeping habits differed between two habitats. In undisturbed habitat, minimizing predation risk appeared to predominate, expressed by choosing steep terrain, open visual field, and inconspicuous presleeping behavior. In disturbed habitat, along with predation avoidance, food resources may strongly influence sleeping site selection, as demonstrated by the richer food abundance and greater foraging activity around the site.

The arousal response was quantified as the time from initiation of CO2 administration to arousal. EMG activity of the costal diaphragm on IPS was decreased to approximately 70% (P < 0.01) of that during SB trials for both NREM and REM, whereas EMG activity of the transversus abdominis muscles did not differ between SB and IPS for either sleep state.

This response is affected the state of arousal of the subject. An effect of sleep on the amplitude of this response has been observed by a number of previous investigators. Since young children must usually be sedated to carry out evoked potential testing, the effects of sleep on this response are a crucial factor limiting clinical applicability. The basic characteristics of SSR elicited by a 500 Hz SAM tone were studied in 21 adults with normal hearing during sleep. The responses while sleeping were compared with the responses in the awake state. The responses to 2048 stimuli were averaged with the analysis time set at 102.4 ms, and responses were judged by passing the waveforms through a 20-100 Hz digital filter. The same technique was performed in 25 infants (2 months-2 years 9 months) evaluated as having normal hearing. The results obtained are summarized as follows: The amplitude of the response while sleeping was approximately half the amplitude in the awake state. Responses with a modulation frequency of 70Hz, however, showed a persistent decrease in 71.0%, suggesting a trend different from that seen at a modulation frequency of less than 70Hz. The effect of modulation frequency on response amplitude was almost the same for the sleeping state and the awake state. Even during sleep, the response amplitude was maximal at modulation frequencies of 20, 30 and 40Hz, and there was no significant difference between the values at 20Hz -40Hz. The latency of the response was measured by the Diamond method, and the results showed that latency is significantly prolonged while sleeping (p < 0.01). The response threshold at the 500Hz SAM tone (modulation rate 40Hz, modulation depth 90%) was 8.5dBnHL when awake and 13.9dBnHL during sleep. The rise in threshold as a result of sleep was no more than about 5dB. In infants, the response amplitude at a modulation frequency of 20Hz was maximal, and amplitude at the 40Hz was significantly smaller (p < 0.01). Latency measured by the Diamond method in infants was 12.8ms. Thus, a difference from the response in adults was confirmed.

The incidence of SIDS in Sweden is much lower than that in Adelaide. Several factors known to be significant in SIDS are less common in Sweden: teenage mothers, low birthweight and the failure to immunize infants. The most striking difference is the absence of the winter peak in Sweden. In Sweden almost every infant sleeps in a heated environment in winter, whereas in Adelaide most do not. This report discusses ways in which the Adelaide winter peak may be avoided. There is a lower incidence of SIDS in communities that invariably use the supine sleeping position for infants than in those who do not. Abandoning prone sleeping for infants in Adelaide should reduce the incidence of SIDS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3789996/"}

Atrial (N = 45) and/or ventricular (N = 54) thresholds were assessed at each visit; during Visit 2, myopotential tests were performed at two sensitivity settings. Autosensing was activated following Visit 1, then programmed on randomly at Visit 2 or Visit 3. From Visit 2-Visit 4, patients were monitored during daily activities (D), exercise (E), and sleep (S) with 24-hour Holter. With Autosensing on, atrial undersensing episodes were D = 33 (P > 0.2), and S = 28 (p < 0.05); ventricular undersensing episodes were D = 6 (p > 0.5). Ventricular oversensing episodes were S = 2; atrial oversensing episodes were S = 34 (p > 0.5), D = 2, and E = 3.

The entire surface of the tongue was mapped for initiation of swallowing in the awake and sleeping animal. Swallowing never occurred during non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep. Infusion of a solution either did not cause any reaction, resulting in dribbling of the test fluid through the opening between the jaws, or caused arousal that was occasionally followed by a swallow.

Elastic loads were applied at the end expiration for 1-6 breaths by having the dogs breathe from a rigid container (partial load) or against an occluded airway (infinite load). \"Effective\" elastance (EE) was determined from the tidal volume (VT)-tracheal pressure relationships of the unloaded, partially loaded, and infinitely loaded breaths. Passive thoracic elastance during W and S averaged 16.7 cmH2O/1. EE averaged 55.8 cmH2O/1 during W, 54.7 during S, and 59.5 during A. Vagal blockade (VB) induced large changes in VT but no change in EE in W or S; during A, EE decreased 37.5%. With sustained loading (partial) there was a progressive increase in VT but a corresponding increase in chemical (primarily hypoxic) respiratory drive, so that EE remained constant during five loaded breaths. VB augmented the progressive increase in VT during W or S but virtually abolished the increase in A. Thus the responses to elastic loads in W and S are similar and independent of conscious reactions or vagal influence; responses during A differ considerably. \"Progressive load compensation\" is a reflection of increasing of increasing chemical drive and not of progressive changes in EE.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/931928/"}

In July and August 2012, tree characteristics were recorded for 60 L. ruficaudatus sleeping sites. Intact and alive trees, particularly Strychnos madagascariensis, were preferred by L. ruficaudatus. Sleeping holes were generally located in taller trees (median hole height = 4 m) and in trees with large girths (median = 20.5 cm). Greater protection from predators and thermal shifts may be provided by intact trees and concealed tree holes.

However, concerns have been raised because of expected negative effects on sleep quality, thereby potentially hampering exercise recovery and next-day exercise performance. We recently showed that ketone ester (KE) ingestion beneficially impacted sleep after strenuous, late evening exercise in normoxia, and alleviated hypoxemia. Therefore, we hypothesized that KE ingestion may be an effective strategy to attenuate hypox(em)ia-induced sleep dysregulations. Eleven healthy male participants completed three experimental sessions including normoxic training and subsequent sleep in normoxia or at a simulated altitude of 3000 m while receiving either KE or placebo postexercise and presleep. Sleep was evaluated using polysomnography, whereas next-day exercise performance was assessed through a 30-min all-out time trial (TT 30' ). Physiological measurements included oxygen status, heart rate variability, ventilatory parameters, blood acid-base balance, and capillary blood gases. Hypoxia caused a ~3% drop in sleep efficiency, established through a doubled wakefulness after sleep onset and a ~22% reduction in slow wave sleep. KE ingestion alleviated the gradual drop in SpO 2 throughout the first part of the night, but did not alter hypoxia-induced sleep dysregulations. Neither KE nor nocturnal hypoxia affected TT 30' performance, but nocturnal hypoxia hampered heart rate recovery after TT 30' . We observed that sleeping at a 3000 m altitude impairs sleep efficiency. Although this hypoxia-induced sleep disruption was too subtle to limit exercise performance, we for the first time indicate that sleeping at altitude might impair next-day exercise recovery. KE alleviated nocturnal hypoxemia only when SpO 2 values dropped below ~85%, but this did not translate into improved sleep or next-day exercise performance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39809236/"}

Ten well-trained cyclists with good sleep quality participated in a randomized crossover design consisting of two experimental sessions each involving a morning endurance training and an evening high-intensity interval training ending 1 h before sleep, after which polysomnography was performed overnight. Postexercise and 30 min before sleeping time, subjects received either 25 g of KE (EX KE ) or a placebo drink (EX CON ). A third session without exercise but with placebo supplements (R CON ) was added to evaluate the effect of exercise per se on sleep. Blood d -β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations transiently increased to ~3 mM postexercise and during the first part of the night in EX KE but not in EX CON or R CON . Exercise significantly reduced rapid eye movement sleep by 26% ( P = 0.001 vs R CON ) and increased wakefulness after sleep onset by 95% ( P = 0.004 vs R CON ). Interestingly, KE improved sleep efficiency by 3% ( P = 0.040 vs EX CON ) and counteracted the exercise-induced decrease in rapid eye movement sleep ( P = 0.011 vs EX CON ) and the increase in wakefulness after sleep onset ( P = 0.009 vs EX CON ). This was accompanied by a KE-induced increase in dopamine excretion ( P = 0.033 vs EX CON ), which plays a pivotal role in sleep regulation. In addition, exercise increased sleep spindle density by 36% ( P = 0.005 vs R CON ), suggesting an effect on neural plasticity processes during sleep.

This paper focuses on associations between injuries and sleep quality/duration among military personnel and strategies to optimize sleep and mitigate effects of sleep loss. Investigations among military personnel generally used convenience samples who self-reported their injury and sleep quality/quantity. Despite these limitations, data suggest that lower sleep quality or duration is associated with higher risk of musculoskeletal injury (MSI). Possible mechanisms whereby poor sleep quality/duration may influence MSI include hormonal changes increasing muscle catabolism, increases in inflammatory processes affecting post-exercise muscle damage, and effects on new bone formation. Sleep can be optimized by a slightly cool sleeping environment, bedding that maintains a stable thermal microclimate around the body, not using media devices near bedtime or in the sleeping environment, minimizing noise, and having regular bed and awaking times. Sleep loss mitigation strategies include napping (<30 to 90 minutes), sleep banking (extended time in bed), and judicious use of caffeine or modafinil.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36525022/"}

The objective was to investigate the relation between sleep stages and energy expenditure, with sleep stage and overnight energy expenditure patterns taken into account. Thirteen subjects aged (mean ± SD) 24.3 ± 2.5 y with a BMI (in kg/m(2)) of 23.6 ± 1.7 slept in a respiration chamber while sleep was polysomnographically recorded to determine wake after sleep onset (WASO), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Energy expenditure was calculated during each sleep stage for the whole night and separately for sleeping metabolic rate (SMR; ie, 3-h period during the night with the lowest mean energy expenditure) and non-SMR. Energy expenditure and sleep stages showed characteristic patterns during the night, independently of each other. Sleep stages exerted no effect on energy expenditure during the whole night, except for WASO compared with SWS (P < 0.05) and WASO compared with REM sleep (P < 0.05). During the SMR and non-SMR periods of the night, no overall effect of sleep stage on energy expenditure, except for WASO compared with SWS (P < 0.05) and WASO compared with REM sleep (P < 0.01) during the non-SMR period of the night, was found. Energy expenditure and activity counts during the night were positively correlated (r = 0.927, P < 0.001). Energy expenditure does not vary according to sleep stage overnight, except for higher energy expenditure during wake episodes than during SWS and REM sleep. Coincidence of the sleep stage pattern and the overnight energy expenditure pattern may have caused accidental relations in previous observations.

Sleep is a state of consciousness that is different to that of arousal. Mammals devote an important part of their lives to sleeping; for example, as humans, we sleep for a third of our lives, but why do we spend so much time in a state where we lose contact with our surroundings? What would happen if we didn't sleep? Total sleep deprivation alters cognitive processes such as memory or attention, and if this deprivation is prolonged, the individual deteriorates and dies. It has been suggested that sleep provides the organism with time to recover from the wear and tear that occurs during the waking state and, given that the first effects of the absence of sleep are seen to affect processes that are directly dependent on the brain, it has been claimed that its main purpose is to allow neuronal recovery. In this work we analyse some of the studies on the effects of total sleep deprivation in humans and rats, as well as the relationship between sleep and the neurotrophin system, which promotes neuronal survival and recovery. Finally, the latest theories about the function of sleep are discussed. Neuron recovery is not the ultimate purpose of sleep; rather it is to allow for maintenance and reorganisation of neuronal circuits, including new synapse formation, which enables existing neuronal networks to be modified by the effect of experience, and all this makes it possible for the brain to work properly and to adapt itself to the environment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17006860/"}

It is proposed that 'rapid eye movement (REM) sleep' be regarded as a special case of a distinct but much broader category of behavior, 'rapid body movement (RBM) sleep', defined by intrinsically-generated and apparently non-purposive movements. Such a classification completes a 2 × 2 matrix defined by the axes sleep versus waking and active versus quiet. Although 'paradoxical' arousal of forebrain electrical activity is restricted to warm-blooded vertebrates, we urge that juvenile or even infantile stages of development be investigated in cold-blooded animals, in view of the many reports of REM-like spontaneous motility (RBMs) in a wide range of species during sleep. The neurophysiological bases for motorically active sleep at the brainstem level and for slow-wave sleep in the forebrain appear to be remarkably similar, and to be subserved in both cases by a primitive diffuse mode of neuronal organization. Thus, the spontaneous synchronous burst discharges which are characteristics of the sleeping brain can be readily simulated even by highly unstructured neural network models. Neuromotor discharges during active sleep appear to reflect a hierarchy of simple relaxation oscillation mechanisms, spanning a wide range of spike-dependent relaxation times, whereas the periodic alternation of active and quiet sleep states more likely results from the entrainment of intrinsic cellular rhythms and/or from activity-dependent homeostatic changes in network excitability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22233887/"}

Adults who slept 7-8 hours or reported a regular daytime work schedule were considered the reference group. Multivariate logistic regressions, incorporating sampling weights, were computed adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics. Analyses revealed in fully adjusted models that compared to 7- 8 hours sleepers, those sleeping 5 or fewer hours were 44% more likely to report a cold (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.61) while those sleeping 9 or more hours were 20% more likely (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36).

{"id": "7546301", "title": "EEG slow waves and sleep spindles: windows on the sleeping brain.", "text": "Slow waves and sleep spindles are prominent features of the EEG in non-REM sleep and some of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their genesis have been elucidated. In humans, slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep increases and EEG activity in the frequency range of sleep spindles decreases when wakefulness prior to sleep is varied from 2 to 40 h. The opposite changes are observed in the course of sleep, even when sleep is scheduled out of phase with the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. Within non-REM sleep episodes the association between slow waves and sleep spindles is bi-phasic: both activities are correlated positively at the beginning and end of non-REM sleep episodes whereas in the middle part of non-REM sleep episodes high values of slow-wave activity coincide with low levels of spindle activity. An extension of wakefulness enhances the rise rate of slow-wave and spindle activity at the onset of sleep. Since macroscopic slow waves and sleep spindles both are dependent on hyperpolarization and synchronization of neurons in thalamo-cortical and cortical circuits, the sleep deprivation induced changes in these EEG activities may be related to reduced activating input to thalamo-cortical and cortical neurons, local facilitation of their hyperpolarization or facilitation of their synchronization. The precise regulation of slow-wave and spindle activity as a function of the duration and intensity of prior sleep and wakefulness demonstrates that these EEG oscillations are accurate indicators of non-REM-sleep homeostasis and suggests that they are fundamental to the sleeping brain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7546301/"}

In mature adults, alcohol decreases sleep onset latency (SOL) and sleep efficiency (SE) and increases wake after sleep onset (WASO). It also increases slow wave sleep (SWS) and decreases rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the first half of the night, with the inverse occurring in the second half. Alcohol's effect on sleep during late adolescence is of interest given that this age group shows both dramatic increases in alcohol consumption and significant developmental changes in the central nervous system. This study examined the effect of alcohol on sleep architecture in women and men aged 18 to 21 years and whether previously reported sleep architecture effects may have been as an artificial result of changes to sleep cycle length. Twenty-four (12 women) healthy 18- to 21-year-old light social drinkers (19.1 ± 1.0 years) underwent 2 conditions: presleep alcohol (target breath alcohol concentration [BAC] 0.10%) and placebo-administered under controlled conditions, followed by standard polysomnography. In the alcohol condition, mean BAC at lights out was 0.084 ± 0.016%. Time in bed, total sleep time, and SOL (all p > 0.05) did not differ between conditions. However, there was less REM (p = 0.011) and more stage-2 sleep (p = 0.035) in the alcohol condition. Further, alcohol increased SWS (p = 0.02) and decreased REM sleep (p < 0.001) in the first half of the night and disrupted sleep in the second half, with increased WASO (interaction: p = 0.034), and decreased SE (p = 0.04) and SWS (p = 0.01) and no REM sleep rebound in the second half of the night (p = 0.262). Additionally, alcohol had no effect on sleep cycle length (p = 0.598). The results were broadly consistent with the adult literature with the novel extension that half night sleep architecture effects could not be attributed to changes in sleep cycle length. However, alcohol did not reduce SOL, or result in a REM rebound following reduced REM in the first half of the night. The results suggest that the effects of alcohol on sleep are modified by sleep's prevailing developmental stage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800287/"}

In the demonstration conditions, infants observed an experimenter perform an irrelevant action followed by a relevant action to achieve a desirable outcome on four different toys. Infant imitation of irrelevant and relevant actions was coded at a test session that occurred after a 24-hr delay. The demonstration and test sessions were scheduled around infants' naturally occurring sleeping patterns. When order of actions was not taken into account, infants in both demonstration conditions exhibited retention of the relevant and irrelevant target actions. Contrary to expectations, infants in the nap condition did not perform the relevant action only more often than infants in the no-nap condition. As expected, only infants in the no-nap condition faithfully reproduced the two actions in the demonstrated order: irrelevant action first, followed by the relevant action.

To examine the influence of sleep on upper airway collapsibility, inspiratory UAR (epiglottis to nares) and genioglossus electromyogram (EMG) were measured in six healthy men before and during inspiratory resistive loading. UAR increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from wakefulness to non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep [3.1 +/- 0.4 to 11.7 +/- 3.5 (SE) cmH2O.1-1.s]. Resistive load application during wakefulness produced small increments in UAR. However, during NREM sleep, UAR increased dramatically with loading in four subjects although two subjects demonstrated little change. This increment in UAR from wakefulness to sleep correlated closely with the rise in UAR during loading while asleep (e.g., load 12: r = 0.90, P less than 0.05), indicating consistent upper airway behavior during sleep. On the other hand, no measurement of upper airway behavior during wakefulness was predictive of events during sleep. Although the influence of sleep on the EMG was difficult to assess, peak inspiratory genioglossus EMG clearly increased (P less than 0.05) after load application during NREM sleep. Finally, minute ventilation fell significantly from wakefulness values during NREM sleep, with the largest decrement in sleeping minute ventilation occurring in those subjects having the greatest awake-to-sleep increment in UAR (r = -0.88, P less than 0.05).

We investigated (1) differences in sleep architecture, specifically slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, between ASD and typically developing controls (TD); and (2) if any observed differences in sleep were associated with core ASD symptoms. We used ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) in 53 participants with ASD (ages 4-18) and 66 age-matched TD in their home sleeping environment. The primary outcome measures were SWS and REM sleep. Core behavioral ASD symptoms were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Spectral power bands during sleep, and additional behavioral measures, were examined in exploratory analyses. Compared to TD, participants with ASD exhibited a higher SWS ratio and lower REM sleep ratio. Within the ASD group, higher SWS was associated with more severe symptoms on the Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Behaviors subscale of the ADI-R. No association was observed between REM sleep ratio and any ASD symptom. Increased SWS and reduced REM sleep ratio differentiated ASD from TD. However, only increased SWS was associated with more severe core ASD symptoms. Increased SWS may reflect neuronal immaturity specific to ASD in this age group. These findings may inform the underlying mechanisms of clinical symptoms observed in children and adolescents with ASD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36385326/"}

The risk of stillbirth following supine sleep has been suspected to occur as a result of aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus. A number of studies conducted during wakefulness have reported compromised cardiovascular function during supine rest, as demonstrated by reductions in cardiac output, blood pressure and utero-placental blood flow. It remains unclear whether similar effects are also present during sleep, due to the presence of key sleep-specific changes in cardiovascular function. To investigate the changes in maternal cardiovascular function between the supine and left-lateral positions during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in late pregnancy. Twenty-nine women with a singleton pregnancy between 24.7 and 36.7 weeks' gestation participated in a single overnight sleep study. Physiological measures (blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability - HRV, and pulse arrival time - PAT) were measured and recorded throughout the night using standard polysomnography equipment and the Portapres Model-2 device. As the present study evaluated cardiovascular changes during natural rest and sleep in pregnancy, participants were not given explicit instructions on which position to adopt. Body position was continuously recorded using a position monitor and verified with video recording. No changes in systolic, diastolic or mean arterial blood pressure were observed between the left-lateral and supine positions during wakefulness or sleep. However, heart rate was significantly higher in the supine position compared to the left during wakefulness (<i>p=</i> .03), with a similar trend present during sleep (<i>p</i>= .11). A significantly shorter PAT was measured in the supine position (compared to the left) during wakefulness (<i>p=</i> .01) and sleep (<i>p=</i> .01). No change in HRV measures was observed between the left and supine positions in either state. Blood pressure did not appear to differ significantly between the left-lateral and supine positions during wakefulness and sleep. The lack of blood pressure differences may reflect elevated sympathetic activity during rest and sleep in the supine position (compared to the left), suggesting that some degree of compensation for aortocaval compression may still be possible during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669005/"}

Stopover duration has a key role for a successful migration and may have an important impact on fitness. Thus, migrants need to optimize their energy consumption at this stage to reduce their permanence at the site. A recent study has shown that lean individuals reduce their metabolic rate when tucking the head in the feathers during sleep. The underlying mechanism is very likely a reduction in conductance, but the thermoregulatory benefit of the increased insulation has never been quantified yet. Here, we compared heat loss in individual migratory birds while sleeping in different postures. Using a thermal camera and a within-individual approach, we estimated that Garden Warblers can reduce their rate of heat loss by 54% by sleeping with the head tucked in the feathers. This energy saving has a relevant impact on the individual's energy balance because it can account for up to 8.69% of daily energy expenditure during stopover. Our study provides novel and important information to understand the fundamental role of thermoregulatory strategies on bird's energy management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293004/"}

The current study assessed the effects of the direction of shift rotation within 8 hour systems, upon a range of measures including sleep, on shift alertness, physical health, and psychological wellbeing. An abridged version of the standard shiftwork index which included retrospective alertness ratings was completed by four groups of industrial shiftworkers on relatively rapidly rotating 8 hour systems (n=611). Two groups worked continuous systems that were either advancing or delaying; the other two groups worked discontinuous systems that were either advancing or delaying. Few effects were found of direction of rotation on chronic measures of health and wellbeing, even when the systems incorporated \"quick returns\" (a break of only 8 hours when changing from one shift to another). This was despite the use of measures previously shown to be sensitive to the effects of a broad range of features of shift systems. However, advancing continuous systems seemed to be associated with marginally steeper declines in alertness across the shift (F (3,1080)=2.87, p<0.05). They were also associated with shorter sleeps between morning shifts (F (1,404)=4.01, p<0.05), but longer sleeps between afternoons (F (1,424)=4.16, p<0.05). The absence of negative effects of advancing shifts upon the chronic outcome measures accorded with previous evidence that advancing shifts may not be as harmful as early research indicated. However, this interpretation is tempered by the possibility that difficult shift systems self select those workers most able to cope with their deleterious effects. The presence of quick returns in advancing continuous systems seemed to impact upon some of the acute measures such as duration of sleep, although the associated effects on alertness seemed to be marginal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10984340/"}

The existing evidence surrounding firefighters' sleep during such operations is exclusively anecdotal. The aims of the study were to describe firefighters' sleep during planned burn operations and evaluate the impact of the key operational factors (shift start time, shift length and sleeping location) that may contribute to inadequate sleep. Thirty-three salaried firefighters were recruited from Australia's fire agencies and sleep was measured objectively using wrist actigraphy for four weeks. All variables were examined in two conditions: (1) burn days, and (2) non-burn days. Time in bed, total sleep time, sleep latency and sleep efficiency were evaluated objectively. Subjective reports of pre- and post-sleep fatigue, sleep location, sleep quality, sleep quantity, number of times woken and sleep timing were also recorded. Analyses revealed no differences in measures of sleep quantity and quality when comparing non-burn and burn days. Total sleep time was less when planned burn shifts were >12 h. However, on burn days, work shift start time as well as sleeping location did not impact firefighters' sleep quantity. Self-reported levels of pre- and post-sleep fatigue were greater on burn days compared to non-burn days.

Both neurophysiological models with animals and neuroimaging evidence from human subjects in the wakefulness stage suggest that the localization of auditory objects is mainly located in the posterior auditory cortex. However, whether this cognitive process is preserved during sleep remains unclear. To fill this research gap, we investigated the sleeping brain's capacity to identify sound locations by recording simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in human subjects. Using the frequency-tagging paradigm, the subjects were presented with a basic syllable sequence at 5 Hz and a location change that occurred every three syllables, resulting in a sound localization shift at 1.67 Hz. The EEG and MEG signals were used for sleep scoring and neural tracking analyses, respectively. Neural tracking responses at 5 Hz reflecting basic auditory processing were observed during both wakefulness and NREM sleep, although the responses during sleep were weaker than those during wakefulness. Cortical responses at 1.67 Hz, which correspond to the sound location change, were observed during wakefulness regardless of attention to the stimuli but vanished during NREM sleep. These results for the first time indicate that sleep preserves basic auditory processing but disrupts the higher-order brain function of sound localization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35853543/"}

Staff and patients completed the Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and focus groups were held to gather qualitative data. Patient-reported sleep measures were collected for additional assessment. Responses were dichotomized for comparison. Regression models were used to assess associations between disruptors and patient-reported sleep measures. Qualitative thematic analyses were performed. Forty-nine inpatient staff and 247 patients completed sleep surveys. Top primary patient diagnoses included stroke, epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and psychogenic nonepileptic attacks. Medical interventions, environmental factors, patient-related factors, and unit workflows emerged as key themes related to sleep disruptions. Patient-reported sleep efficiency was significantly reduced when pain, anxiety, stress, temperature, and medication administration disrupted sleep. Staff perspectives highlighted medical interventions as most disruptive to sleep, while patients did not find them as disruptive as expected. Differing perspectives on sleep disruption exist between staff and patients in the inpatient neurology setting.

In fact, the content of dream experience may reflect the process of memory reactivation and consolidation in the sleeping brain.

A total of 164 healthy men and women (age range, 18 to 55 y) volunteered for this study. Wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries assessed sleep duration and sleep continuity over 7 consecutive days. Participants were then quarantined and administered nasal drops containing the rhinovirus, and monitored over 5 days for the development of a clinical cold (defined by infection in the presence of objective signs of illness). Logistic regression analysis revealed that actigraphy- assessed shorter sleep duration was associated with an increased likelihood of development of a clinical cold. Specifically, those sleeping < 5 h (odds ratio [OR] = 4.50, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-18.69) or sleeping between 5 to 6 h (OR = 4.24, 95% CI, 1.08-16.71) were at greater risk of developing the cold compared to those sleeping > 7 h per night; those sleeping 6.01 to 7 h were at no greater risk (OR = 1.66; 95% CI 0.40-6.95). This association was independent of prechallenge antibody levels, demographics, season of the year, body mass index, psychological variables, and health practices. Sleep fragmentation was unrelated to cold susceptibility. Other sleep variables obtained using diary and actigraphy were not strong predictors of cold susceptibility.

Although recent studies have shown that catch-up sleep insufficiently neutralizes the negative effects of sleep debt, the mechanisms that control prolonged effects of sleep disruption are not understood. Here, we show that sleep interruption restructures the epigenome of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and increases their proliferation, thus reducing hematopoietic clonal diversity through accelerated genetic drift. Sleep fragmentation exerts a lasting influence on the HSPC epigenome, skewing commitment toward a myeloid fate and priming cells for exaggerated inflammatory bursts. Combining hematopoietic clonal tracking with mathematical modeling, we infer that sleep preserves clonal diversity by limiting neutral drift. In humans, sleep restriction alters the HSPC epigenome and activates hematopoiesis. These findings show that sleep slows decay of the hematopoietic system by calibrating the hematopoietic epigenome, constraining inflammatory output, and maintaining clonal diversity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36129517/"}

A two-way analysis of variance clarified that the shift combination influenced the daily activities. The most distinct result was that nurses spent significantly more time on free-time activities on the day when they worked the night shift followed by the evening shift than they did on the day when they worked any other shift combination. Nurses offset sleep deprivation either by sleeping during the day before and after working the night shift (82-100%) or by sleeping 2 to 4 h later in the morning after working the evening shift and on days off. There was a strong positive correlation between total sleep time (including day sleep) and the length of the interval between two consecutive shifts (r = 0.95, p < 0.001).

This prediction was recently confirmed in mouse cerebral cortex using serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM). However, whether these findings extend to other brain regions is unknown. Moreover, sleep deprivation by gentle handling was reported to produce hippocampal spine loss, raising the question of whether synapse size and number are differentially affected by sleep and waking. Here we applied SBEM to measure axon-spine interface (ASI), the contact area between pre-synapse and post-synapse, and synapse density in CA1 stratum radiatum. Adolescent YFP-H mice were studied after 6-8 h of sleep (S = 6), spontaneous wake at night (W = 4) or wake enforced during the day by novelty exposure (EW = 4; males/females balanced). In each animal ≥425 ASIs were measured and synaptic vesicles were counted in ~100 synapses/mouse. Reconstructed dendrites included many small, nonperforated synapses and fewer large, perforated synapses. Relative to S, ASI sizes in perforated synapses shifted toward higher values after W and more so after EW. ASI sizes in nonperforated synapses grew after EW relative to S and W, and so did their density. ASI size correlated with presynaptic vesicle number but the proportion of readily available vesicles decreased after EW, suggesting presynaptic fatigue. Thus, CA1 synapses undergo changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization and their number increases after extended wake.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep benefits learning, memory consolidation, and the integration of new with old memories, but the underlying mechanisms remain highly debated. One hypothesis suggests that sleep's cognitive benefits stem from its ability to renormalize total synaptic strength, after ongoing learning during wake leads to net synaptic potentiation. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis mainly comes from the cerebral cortex, including the observation that cortical synapses are larger after wake and smaller after sleep. Using serial electron microscopy, we find here that sleep/wake synaptic changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization also occur in the CA1 region. Thus, the role of sleep in maintaining synaptic homeostasis may extend to the hippocampus, a key area for learning and synaptic plasticity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31263066/"}

In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother-infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum. The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants' sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months. Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498228/"}

We demonstrate the socio-ecologial impact of sleep health with findings on gender and couples' relationships as exemplars. Robust gender differences in sleep duration and insomnia are due to biological and socio-ecological factors. Gender differences in insufficient sleep vary by country of origin and age whereas gender differences in insomnia reflect minoritized identities (e.g., sexual, gender). Co-sleeping with a partner is associated with longer sleep and more awakenings. Gender differences and couples' sleep were affected by intersecting social and societal influences, which supports a socio-ecological approach to sleep. Recent and seminal contributions to sleep health highlight the importance of observing individual sleep outcomes in a socio-ecological context.

The findings highlight the cross-cultural contexts within which people sleep and the role of varied sleeping arrangements in influencing sleep behavior and perspectives. Furthermore, the contexts in which sleep occurs, coupled with the influence of the family, and the positive aspects of sleep helped illustrate why cultural aspects of sleep are vital for a broader understanding of sleep. The authors conclude by highlighting the need to integrate studies on the biological, sociological, and political aspects of sleep.

However, what it is about the human sleeping brain that regulates blood sugar remains unknown. In an examination of over 600 humans, we demonstrate that the coupling of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep spindles and slow oscillations the night before is associated with improved next-day peripheral glucose control. We further show that this sleep-associated glucose pathway may influence glycemic status through altered insulin sensitivity, rather than through altered pancreatic beta cell function. Moreover, we replicate these associations in an independent dataset of over 1,900 adults. Of therapeutic significance, the coupling between slow oscillations and spindles was the most significant sleep predictor of next-day fasting glucose, even more so than traditional sleep markers, relevant to the possibility of an electroencephalogram (EEG) index of hyperglycemia.

The nocturnal and diurnal mean plasmatic norepinephrine values increase. The rhythm of cortisol secretion is advanced. The GH and melatonin peaks of secretion are decreased. The acrophase of melatonin rhythm is occurring later in the elderly.

Based on our previous observation of periodic breathing in athletes sleeping at SMA, we hypothesised that athletes' sleep quality would also suffer with hypoxia. Using two typical protocols of nocturnal SMA (2650 m), we examined the effect on the sleep physiology of 14 male endurance-trained athletes. The selected protocols were Consecutive (15 successive exposure nights) and Intermittent (3x 5 successive exposure nights, interspersed with 2 normoxic nights) and athletes were randomly assigned to follow either one. We monitored sleep for two successive nights under baseline conditions (B; normoxia, 600 m) and then at weekly intervals (nights 1, 8 and 15 (N1, N8 and N15, respectively)) of the protocols. Since there was no significant difference in response between the protocols being followed (based on n=7, for each group) we are unable to support a preference for either one, although the likelihood of a Type II error must be acknowledged. For all athletes (n=14), respiratory disturbance and arousal responses between B and N1, although large in magnitude, were highly individual and not statistically significant. However, SpO2 decreased at N1 versus B (p<0.001) and remained lower on N8 (p<0.001) and N15 (p<0.001), not returning to baseline level. Compared to B, arousals were more frequent on N8 (p=0.02) and N15 (p=0.01). The percent of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) increased from N1 to N8 (p=0.03) and N15 (p=0.01).

Children in the residential care settled to sleep significantly earlier and slept longer than those children living in a kibbutz or at home. The longest period of uninterrupted sleep was more extended for children sleeping at home, compared to those sleeping in communal dormitories. Correlation analysis between various assessments of sleep and waking behaviors revealed a different pattern for kibbutz and residential care children. For the kibbutz children, there were significant correlations between difficulties falling asleep and various attributes of daytime tiredness. Conversely, in the residential care, difficulties falling asleep were significantly and positively correlated with parameters associated with daytime alertness. This pattern of correlations and the actigraphic data indicate that difficulties in falling asleep for children in residential care are probably a consequence of being put to bed too early and according to a rigid schedule, and not the result of emotional factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8378683/"}

However, the reliability and validity of available detection methods remain lacking, employ varying approaches, and have yet to be directly compared and rigorously validated. This study aimed to: (1) compare phase amplitude coupling (PAC)-based methods (PACTools and YASA) with the \"temporal co-occurrence\", Fixed Time Window approach for detecting SW-SP coupling, and, (2) introduce a refined adaptive SW-SP coupling method to improve precision and accuracy, by precisely aligning spindle detection with slow wave half-wave durations. A novel SW-SP coupling detection method was developed, incorporating dynamic time windows based on slow wave half-wave durations. This method adjusts to the morphology of individual slow waves offering precise alignment of spindle events with slow wave peaks and troughs. PAC-based methods showed high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in excessive false positives. Across PAC indices (MVLMI, KLMI, PLV, GLMMI), the average F1-score was ∼0.45 ± 0.01. YASA, which detects coupling events based on sigma-band oscillations, exhibited moderate accuracy (0.46 ± 0.007), with an F1-score of 0.446 ± 0.011, reflecting its tendency to over-detect events due to reliance on sigma power fluctuations rather than discrete spindles. The Fixed Time Window method demonstrated higher specificity, identifying 533 ± 28 coupled spindles per participant, but relied on static temporal boundaries, leading to an average lag of 1.04 ± 0.01 s relative to slow wave peaks. The Adaptive Half-Wave method improved upon this by dynamically adjusting detection windows to slow wave morphology, reducing the average lag to 0.15 ± 0.007 s while maintaining high specificity (accuracy = 0.83 ± 0.01, precision = 0.96 ± 0.01). The adaptive method provides a significant improvement in temporal precision and specificity by dynamically aligning detection windows with slow wave morphology. Fully integrated into the Counting Sheep PSG EEG toolbox, it streamlines workflows for spindle detection, slow wave characterization, and coupling analysis within an easy to use, EEGLAB-compatible environment. As SW-SP coupling gains recognition as an important measure of sleep's role in cognition, the need for a standardized detection method has become clear. The adaptive method provides a robust, open-source solution, addressing the need for standardized SW-SP coupling detection.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40602436/"}

We used a combination of electrophysiological recording and neurobehavioral testing to characterize seasonal changes in sleep and cognition in captive white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) across nonmigratory and migratory seasons. Compared to sparrows in a nonmigratory state, migratory sparrows spent approximately two-thirds less time sleeping. Despite reducing sleep during migration, accuracy and responding on a repeated-acquisition task remained at a high level in sparrows in a migratory state. This resistance to sleep loss during the prolonged migratory season is in direct contrast to the decline in accuracy and responding observed following as little as one night of experimenter-induced sleep restriction in the same birds during the nonmigratory season. Our results suggest that despite being adversely affected by sleep loss during the nonmigratory season, songbirds exhibit an unprecedented capacity to reduce sleep during migration for long periods of time without associated deficits in cognitive function.

To assess subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep duration in a national sample of university students and investigate differences in these components with selected variables. A cross-sectional analysis and multi-stage sampling were conducted to select a sample of 1308 students from three major areas in Jordan. Sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep duration were measured by an Arabic version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were analyzed using measures of frequency and central tendency and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Two-thirds of university students described their sleep quality as fairly bad and very bad and 20 reported sleep latency of more than 30 min during the past month. There was a significant difference in subjective sleep quality according to the student's place of residence. Sleep latency differed according to students' income, physical activity, use of media devices before sleep, smoking status, and academic achievement. Significant differences were also found in sleep duration with students' academic achievement, academic level, and body mass index. University students suffer from poor sleep quality, delayed sleep phase, and sleep deprivation. Lower-income, smoking, physical inactivity, and using media devices before sleep contributed to students' sleeping problems.

Adolescents with poor sleep quality and sleepiness, using smartphones apps and internet browser, without chronic diseases, and obesity, and without mental problems were included in the study. Primary outcomes were sleep quality, sleepiness, sleep hygiene, and sleep parameters at week 5 as measured by subjective report scales and actigraphy. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Poor sleep quality = PSQI > 5), sleepiness by the Cleveland Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire (CASQ > 16), and sleep hygiene developed by the researchers in the literature of Adolescent Sleep Habits Form. A total of 55 participants (mean [SD] age, 15.64 [1.22] years) participated. PSQI and CASQ scores of adolescents in sleep education that were not supported by social media reminders decreased compared to the baseline (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). Adolescent PSQI score in sleep education supported by social media reminders decreased from baseline, their sleep hygiene score increased (p = 0.02). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of sleep parameters (total sleep duration, deep and light sleep levels, nighttime sleeping, and morning wake-up times) (p > 0.05).

No significant gender effects were found in the waking EEG. Independent of age and gender, spectral profiles in the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands of a subject's waking EEG were found to be highly correlated with their sleep EEG. In addition, subjects with high voltage alpha profiles during waking were found to sleep significantly longer and deeper than those with low voltage records.

Several cognitive tests were used including the telephone interview for cognitive status (TICS). Cognitive impairment was defined as <31 points on the TICS (13.0%) and as below this percentile on the other tests. Based on individual tests, a verbal memory score and a total score were constructed. Multivariable prevalence ratios (PRs) of cognitive impairment and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were computed using Poisson regression. Analyses were restricted to those free of depression in 2002/2003 (n = 695). Sleeping <or=6 or 8 h per night (versus 7 h) were unrelated to cognitive impairment. Sleeping >or=9 h was positively, although imprecisely, associated with impairment of verbal memory (PR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.0), and less pronounced with the other cognitive measures. An increase in sleep duration from 7-8 h in 1992-1995 to >or=9 h 8.5 years later (versus sleeping 7-8 h at both time points) was associated with an increased prevalence of cognitive impairment according to the TICS (PR = 2.1, 95% = 1.0, 4.5) and the verbal memory score (PR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.8).

Here, we tested the effect of a brief nap opportunity (30- or 60-min) during a period of sleep deprivation on two cognitive processes with broad scope, placekeeping and vigilant attention. In the evening, participants (N = 280) completed a placekeeping task (UNRAVEL) and a vigilant attention task (Psychomotor Vigilance Task [PVT]) and were randomly assigned to either stay awake overnight or sleep at home. Sleep-deprived participants were randomly assigned to receive either no nap opportunity, a 30-min opportunity, or a 60-min opportunity. Participants who napped were set up with polysomnography. The next morning, sleep participants returned, and all participants completed UNRAVEL and the PVT. Sleep deprivation impaired performance on both tasks, but nap opportunity did not reduce the impairment, suggesting that naps longer than those tested may be necessary to cause group differences.

Although sleep periods were distributed at any time of the nychthemeral cycle, they showed the tendency to concentrate between 0800 and 2000 hours. The volcano mouse may be considered as a \"good\" sleeper, because it shows a relatively high percentage of sleep from the total recording time (TRT). Slow-wave sleep occupied 64.54 +/- 8.84% (mean +/- SD) of the total recording time, while 7.56 +/- 1.31% corresponded to rapid-eye movement sleep. The average duration of the rapid-eye movement sleep phase was 126.48 +/- 17.79 s, exhibiting an average recurrence of 49 +/- 9.28 phases throughout the nychthemeral cycle.

The model combines SMR (SMR stands for Principle of Spearman Maximal Relevance) with horizontal and vertical division based on the barometric pressure signals in the human body's backbone region to reconstruct the raw pressure data into strongly correlated non-image features of the sleep postures in different parts and directions and construct the feature set. Finally, the recognit-ion of the two sleep postures is accomplished using the AdaBoost-SVM integrated classifier. SPR-DE is compared with the base and integrated classifiers to verify its performance. The experimental results show that the amount of significant features helps the algorithm to classify different sleeping patterns more accurately, and the f1 score of the SPR-DE model determined by the comparison experiments is 0.998, and the accuracy can reach 99.9%. Compared with other models, the accuracy is improved by 2.9% ~ 7.7%, and the f1-score is improved by 0.029 ~ 0.076. Therefore, it is concluded that the SMR feature extraction strategy in the SPR-DE model and the AdaBoost-SVM can achieve high accuracy and strong robustness in the task of sleep posture recognition in a small area, low-density air-pressure mattress, taking into account the comfort of the mattress structural design and the sleep posture recognition, integrated with the mattress adaptive adjustment system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38744916/"}

At the site mainly three vegetation types were present in an elevation-ascending order: deciduous broad leaf forest, mixed coniferous and broad leaf forest, and dark coniferous forest. In addition, bamboo forest presented in areas burned in 1958. Sleeping sites (n =10) were located in the coniferous forest, where trees were the tallest, bottommost branches were the highest, the diameter of crowns was the second largest, and the gradient of the ground was the steepest. Monkeys usually kept quiet during entering and staying at a sleeping site. The site choice and the quietness may be tactics to avoid potential predators. In the coniferous forest, however, monkeys did not sleep in the valley bottom where trees were the largest, but frequently slept in the middle of the slope towards the east/southeast, in the shadow of ridges in three other directions, to avoid strong wind and to access sunshine; in winter-spring, they ranged in a more southern and lower area than in summer-autumn. These may be behavioral strategies to minimize energy stress in the cold habitat. Monkeys often slept in the same sleeping site on consecutive nights, which reflected a reduced pressure of predation probably due to either the effectiveness of anti-predation through sleeping site selection, or the population decline of predators with increasing human activities in the habitat. The group's behavioral responses to interactive and sometimes conflicting traits of the habitat are site-specific and conform to expectations for a temperate zone primate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15278833/"}

Systematic reviews have indicated that the success of sleep education programs has thus far been inconsistent, due to the lack of a tailored approach that allows for evaluation of individual differences in behavior patterns. One way to resolve this problem is to assess the individual sleep behaviors of adolescents by using a checklist containing the recommended behaviors for promoting sleep health. Such self-help education programs have already been implemented for elementary school children, school nurses and the elderly. The present study aimed to verify the effects of a sleep education program with supplementary self-help treatment, based on a checklist of sleep-promoting behaviors, in addition to evaluation of changes in sleeping patterns, sleep-promoting behaviors and daytime sleepiness in adolescents. A cluster randomized controlled trial involving 5 Japanese junior high schools was conducted, and 243 students (sleep education: n = 122; waiting list: n = 121; 50.6% female; 7th grade) were included in the final analysis. The sleep education group was provided with information on proper sleep health and sleep-promoting behaviors. The students in this group were asked to practice one sleep-promoting behavior as a goal for 2 weeks and to monitor their practice using sleep diaries. Both pre- and post-treatment questionnaires were administered to students in order to assess knowledge of sleep-promoting behaviors, sleeping patterns and daytime functioning. Students in the sleep education group showed significant improvement in their knowledge of sleep health (F1,121 = 648.05, p < 0.001) and in their sleep-promoting behaviors (F1,121 = 55.66, p < 0.001). Bedtime on both school nights (F1,121 = 50.86, p < 0.001) and weekends (F1,121 = 15.03, p < 0.001), sleep-onset latency (F1,121 = 10.26, p = 0.002), total sleep time on school nights (F1,121 = 12.45, p = 0.001), subjective experience of insufficient sleep (McNemar χ(2)(1) = 4.03, p = 0.045) and daytime sleepiness (McNemar χ(2)(1) = 4.23, p = 0.040) were also improved in the sleep education group. In contrast, no significant improvement in these variables was observed for students in the waiting-list group.

To date, most studies have examined the association between sleep duration/quality and health in adolescence. An emerging line of research suggests that regularity in the timing of sleep may also play an important role in well-being. To address this aspect of sleep, the present study investigated daily variability of sleep, quantified using the sleep regularity index (SRI), in 46 adolescents (M = 12.78 ± 1.07 years) and its association with depressive symptoms/mental health. Sleep was measured during a 6 month period (M = 133.11 ± 36.42 nights) using actigraphs to quantify SRI values calculated for school days, weekends and holidays. Depressive symptoms and general psychopathology were assessed at the beginning (baseline) and end (follow-up) of the actigraphy measurements. Sleep was most regular during school days and associated with a longer total sleep time, shorter sleep onset latency, and higher sleep efficiency. Moreover, a higher SRI on school days was associated with fewer depressive symptoms at follow-up, whereas higher SRI on weekends was associated with less overall psychopathology at follow-up. Furthermore, the change in overall psychopathology, but not depressive symptoms across the two assessments was correlated with sleep regularity index. Our results suggest that regular timing of sleep is associated with sleep that is of longer duration and higher quality and may be protective of adolescent mental health. Therefore, adolescents should be encouraged not only to get enough sleep, but also to retain regular sleeping patterns to promote well-being and mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36852716/"}

Coach crash studies are done based on standard postures. Occupants travelling long distances in coaches may fall asleep, with postures that can be different from the standard posture. This paper investigates the effects of different sleeping postures on occupant injuries in frontal coach collisions by using sled test model and dummies. Four different sleeping postures are considered including head tilted sideway, slide down on seat in neutral position, turned torso-head diagonal with backrest and turned torso-head perpendicular with backrest posture. The results showed that the head tilted sideway posture increases occupant head injuries with the Head Injury Criteria (HIC) values of 399.3 to 494.6 and the peak head acceleration over 3 milliseconds (H3ms) reaches a maximum of 88.53 g which is above the accepted threshold of 80 g. Slide down on seat in neutral position posture reduces occupant head injuries where the HIC decreased by 28.47%, and for H3ms the decrease is 12.15%. Turned torso posture reduces neck injuries, and all those four sleeping postures are beneficial to reduce thorax injuries. The different turned torso postures simultaneously include the lowest risk and the highest risk postures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40148416/"}

Under this hypothesis, animals may evolve the ability to dispense with sleep when ecological demands favor wakefulness. Here, we show that male pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos), a polygynous Arctic breeding shorebird, are able to maintain high neurobehavioral performance despite greatly reducing their time spent sleeping during a 3-week period of intense male-male competition for access to fertile females.

Here, we quantified the duration of nighttime sleep of wild primates during behavioural observations. Wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui) form clusters at sleeping sites, where they huddle with group members. Macaques slept for longer when huddled in sleeping clusters with natal members than in those with non-natal members. A high degree of synchronisation of wakefulness in pairs of macaques huddling in non-natal clusters suggested that their sleep was often interrupted by the wakefulness of huddling members at night.

This pattern was most pronounced in infants who both nursed and shared a bed with the mother, common practices in many nonwestern cultures.

{"id": "38744537", "title": "Sleep Posture Influences Metabolic Rate and Vigilance in the Common Whitethroat (Curruca Communis).", "text": "Migration is an important life-history strategy that is adopted by a significant proportion of bird species from temperate areas. Birds initiate migration after accumulating considerable energy reserves, primarily in the form of fat and muscle. Sustained exercise, such as during the crossing of ecological barriers, leads to the depletion of energy reservesand increased physiological stress. Stopover sites, where birds rest and restore energy, play a fundamental role in mitigating these challenges. The duration of resting at stopover sites is influenced by environmental and physiological conditions upon arrival, and the amount of body fat reserves plays an important role. While sleep is recognized as essential for all organisms, its importance is accentuated during migration, where energy management becomes a survival constraint. Previous research indicated that individuals with larger fat reserves tend to sleep less and favor an untucked sleep posture, influencing energy recovery and anti-predatory vigilance. We explored the relationship between sleep behavior and posture, metabolic state, and energy conservation strategies during migration in the common whitethroat (Curruca communis). We were able to confirm that sleeping in a tucked position results in metabolic energy savings, at the cost of reduced vigilance. However, whitethroats did not show alterations of their sleep patterns as a response to the amount of stored reserves. This suggests that they may not be taking full advantage of the metabolic gains of sleeping in a tucked posture, at least at this stage of their migratory journey. We suggest that, to achieve optimal fuel accumulation and maximize stopover efficiency, whitethroats prioritize increased foraging over modulating their sleep patterns.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38744537/"}

We evaluated spatial patterns of EEG band synchronization between all possible pairs of electrodes (19) placed over the scalp of 10 sleeping healthy young normal subjects using two graph theoretical measures: the clustering coefficient (Cp) and the characteristic path length (Lp). The measures were obtained during wakefulness and the different sleep stages/CAP conditions from the real EEG connectivity networks and randomized control (surrogate) networks (Cp-s and Lp-s). We found values of Cp and Lp compatible with a small-world network organization in all sleep stages and for all EEG bands. All bands below 15Hz showed an increase of these features during sleep (and during CAP-A phases in particular), compared to wakefulness. The results of this study seem to confirm our initial hypothesis that during sleep there exists a clear trend for the functional connectivity of the EEG to move forward to an organization more similar to that of a small-world network, at least for the frequency bands lower than 15Hz.

Conditions to assure good quality sleep were studied. Of 500 obstetric facilities which were randomly selected from areas surveyed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 260 finally agreed to participate in this study. Women who had their pregnancy confirmed and were on a revisit to the 260 obstetric facilities were enrolled. These pregnant women completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires during the waiting time for treatment and submitted them to the obstetric facilities in sealed envelopes. The questionnaire covered personal attributes such as age and highest level of education, pregnancy status, working status, and patterns of smoking and alcohol drinking. Sleep-related items such as 1) subjective sleep quality, 2) difficulty in getting to sleep, 3) frequent awakenings, 4) waking up too early, 5) sleeping hours and 6) daytime drowsiness were also included. The month of pregnancy was significantly related to four sleep-related items, including difficulty in getting to sleep and waking up too early. With respect to the relationship between the number of pregnancies and sleep problems, significance was found for five sleep-related items, including subjective sleep quality and waking up too early. Poor subjective sleep quality was significantly related to sleeping less than seven hours and whether or not pregnant women had a regular job. It was also suggested that the greater the number of pregnancies, the shorter the sleeping hours. When responses to each sleep-related item were compared between pregnant women and the general population, the former were more likely to have sleep problems. These findings suggest that as well as the number of pregnancies and month of pregnancy with sleeping hours may be factor intimately related to sleep problems during pregnancy. A good quality sleep during pregnancy is vital for normal maternal health and fetal growth and sufficient sleeping hours are therefore needed. Attention should therefore be paid to the finding that pregnant women were more likely to have sleep problems than the general population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12872743/"}

However, the relationship between overall physical fitness and sleep-related problems in adolescents remains underexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the association between overall physical fitness and sleep-related problems in adolescents. This cross-sectional study included 812 adolescents (median age: 14 years [interquartile range = 12-17]; 54.9% girls) from the Eating Healthy and Daily Life Activities (EHDLA) data. Physical fitness was measured objectively using the Assessing the Levels of PHysical Activity and fitness (ALPHA-Fit) battery for children and adolescents and a flexibility test, while sleep-related problems were evaluated using the BEARS sleep screening tool (B = Bedtime problems, E = Excessive daytime sleepiness, A = Awakenings during the night, R = Regularity and duration of sleep, S = Snoring). Generalized linear models were used to examine the association of overall physical fitness with the different components of sleep-related problems. The odds of experiencing sleep-related problems decreased significantly with each kilogram increase in handgrip strength (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-0.99), and with each standard deviation increase in overall physical fitness (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.99). In contrast, despite not statistically significant, an increase in long jump appeared to reduce the sleep-related problems (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.82-1.02), while a longer time in the 4×10-m shuttle run test might increase sleep problems (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.98-1.28). In conclusion, greater levels of physical fitness, particularly muscular strength, may be key for reducing sleep-related problems, emphasizing the importance of personalized training programs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40105037/"}

Ideally future research will identify risk factors for higher positional increases to identify patients who may benefit from a change in sleep position. To date, medications and argon laser trabeculoplasty have been ineffective in blunting the positional increase, although glaucoma surgery does reduce it.

This study explores the associations among caffeine intake, sleep duration, and BMD. Data were sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2018, including 13,457 participants who self-reported sleep duration and caffeine intake, with BMD measured via dual X-ray absorptiometry. Multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for confounders, were used alongside restricted cubic splines to examine dose-response association. Of all participants, 6821 (50.7%) were males and 6636 were females (49.3%). The mean caffeine intake and sleep duration were 93.4 mg/day and 7.19 h, respectively. RCS results showed that BMD increased with the increase in caffeine intake, especially in the low dose range of 0-200 mg/day. The dose-response association between sleep duration and BMD showed that sleep durations of 0-6 h may promote the increase of BMD, but after sleep durations greater than 6 h, BMD decreases. After adjustment for potential confounders, compared to the lowest referent quartile, individuals with caffeine intake in quartiles 2, 3, and 4 had a positive correlation with BMD (0.62 95% CI: 0.24-1.37; 0.51 95% CI: 0.22-1.13; 0.75 95% CI: 0.41-1.46; P for trend < 0.05). In covariate-adjusted linear regression models, compared with those sleeping 6 h or less per night, the difference in BMD among those sleeping 6-7 h, 7-8 h, and 8-14.5 h per night were 1.81 (95% CI: 0.4122.71), 1.25 (95% CI: 0.55-2.93), and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.38-1.69).

Public awareness campaigns throughout the western world have led to an over 50% reduction in postneonatal mortality and frequency of SIDS. This reduction in mortality has been mainly attributed to the avoidance of the prone sleep position. Various mechanisms have been postulated to explain the increased risk of SIDS associated with prone sleeping, among these, impairment of arousal from sleep. This paper reviews the effects of prone sleeping on infant sleep architecture, arousability from sleep and cardiorespiratory controls. Sleeping in the prone position has been shown to increase the amount of time spent sleeping, particularly time spent in quiet sleep (QS). Sleeping prone has also been demonstrated to be associated with a reduced responsiveness to a variety of arousal stimuli. Such impairment of arousal has been demonstrated to be associated with changes in control of autonomic cardiac function. During arousal, heart rate, blood pressure and breathing movements increase, while gross body movements occur to avoid the stimulus. Any impairment in arousability from sleep such as could occur when infants sleep in the prone position, could possibly contribute to the final pathway to SIDS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12324180/"}

To investigate how the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) prepares for and behaves during cold nights in their harsh alpine forest habitat (above 3,000 m), we studied the sleeping habits of the 171 one-male units (OMU) in one group for 12 months at Xiangguqing in the Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve, China. It took 20.2 min from the time the study group entered a sleeping site until they fell asleep. This duration was consistent over seasons. On average, sleeping time was 11.5 hr per night over the year. Seasonal mean lengths of sleeping time varied significantly, however, and ranged from 10 to 13 hr per night, correlating with night length. Two sleeping styles were distinguishable: solitary sleeping and huddled sleeping. That adult males in OMUs principally slept alone. This is likely to reflect night-time guarding behavior. Female-juvenile and female-infant dyadic huddles were the most prevalent sleeping unit (42% of all observed data), and the monkeys employed female-biased huddling during nocturnal sleep. Huddled sleeping group size showed significant seasonal variation, with the largest huddle (eight individuals) occurring in winter. Climate and social organization profoundly influence the nocturnal sleeping habits of R. bieti, while huddling behavior may help shield animals from cold nights and provide additional protection against predators.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20665714/"}

We aimed to obtain experimental evidence to support these causal claims. A within-subjects experiment (baseline, intervention) was conducted in adolescents' homes, to determine the effect of restricting adolescents' pre-bed mobile phone use on school night sleep habits. Following a baseline week, adolescents were given individualized phone stop times, 1 hour before bed for one school week. An online sleep diary was used to monitor bedtime, lights out time, sleep latency and total sleep. Sixty three adolescents (age range 14-18, M = 16.3, SD = 0.93yrs; 17%male) provided data. During one week of phone restriction, adolescents stopped using their phones earlier (80 min, p < .001), turned their lights off earlier (17 min, p = .01), and slept longer (21 min, p = .01). Participant recruitment was low (26%), indicating many adolescents lack motivation to negotiate changes to their evening phone use. Overall, there are potential benefits of restricted mobile phone use during the pre-sleep period, yet, future research is needed to identify non-technological interventions to increase adherence to phone restriction (e.g., motivational interviewing) or otherwise decrease pre-sleep arousal (e.g., cognitive strategies).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29313721/"}

Six of 4 of the 9 subjects were also investigated in the same way after one night of selective REM deprivation and after one night of total sleep deprivation, respectively. In the first experiment, the amount of stage 1 in each of the sleep attempts varied rhythmically with a frequency of about 14.4 c/day. The average variance at the peak spectral frequency significantly exceeded the mean variance at the rest of the spectral frequencies and the mean variance at the adjacent frequencies. Stage 2 occurred more often around 15-16 h, with no evidence of ultradian rhythmicity. Both REM deprivation and total sleep deprivation disrupted the 100 min periodicity in stage 1 and modified the distribution of stage 2 toward a bimodal rather than a unimodal distribution.

In December 1991 recommendations concerning infants' sleeping position were published by The Danish National Board of Health in order to reduce the risk of SIDS. Babies were recommended to be placed in the supine or side position when sleeping. Parents have followed the guidelines. Most Danish infants are now sleeping on their back or in the side position. Simultaneously, the number of SIDS dropped from about 110 to 40 per year. The incidence decreased to 1.2 in 1992 and was further reduced in 1993 to 0.6 per 1000 live births. Referring to our knowledge of the infant's temperature regulation we discuss why the prone position is a risk factor for SIDS. The head is the site of up to 85% of heat loss in an infant in bed. Placed in the prone position, the infant is more likely to suffer a rise in body temperature, especially if this is combined with having a cold, being heavily wrapped and sleeping in a heated room. Preceding sudden death many infants are reported to have suffered from minor viral infections. These might per se increase the body temperature. Parents often wrap infants that have an infection too heavily, which in an infant sleeping in the prone position might increase the body temperature to a higher level than if sleeping supine. The body temperature influences the production of toxins from normal intestinal flora and from pathogenic bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7817426/"}

The current investigation looked to evaluate a practical sleep hygiene strategy (10-min showering at ∼40°C before lights out), within a group of 11 youth soccer players in comparison to normal sleeping conditions (control). Each condition consisted of three days within a randomised crossover trial design. Sleep information was collected using a commercial wireless bedside sleep monitor. Measures of skin temperature were evaluated using iButton skin thermistors to establish both distal and proximal skin temperatures and distal to proximal gradient. The shower intervention elevated distal skin temperature by 1.1°C (95% CI: 0.1-2.1°C, p = .04) on average prior to lights out. The elevation in distal temperature was also present during the first 30-min following lights out (1.0°C, 95% CI: 0.4-1.6°C, p < .01). The distal to proximal gradient also showed a significant effect between the conditions within the first 30-min after lights out (0.7°C, 95% CI: 0.3-1.2°C, p < .01). On average the sleep latency of the youth soccer players was -7-min lower (95% CI: -13 to -2 min, p < .01) and sleep efficiency +2% higher (95% CI: 1-3%; p < .01) in the shower condition.

Analyses were performed with logistic regression and adjusted for the main confounders, including lifestyle, health status, comorbidity and sleep quality, as measured by nighttime and daytime sleep complaints. Analyses were also stratified by age and sex. In total, 449 (29.1%) participants fell in the previous year; of these, 57.7% had one fall and 42.3% had recurrent (≥2) falls. As compared with those who usually slept 7-8 h, those sleeping ≥11 h were more likely to suffer recurrent falls [odds ratios (OR) 2.75; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.32-5.62]. In the stratified analysis, there was no association between sleep duration and falls in those aged ≤75 years and in men. In contrast, among those aged >75 years, the percentage of individuals with ≥1 falls was higher in those sleeping ≤5 h (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.20-3.87) and ≥11 h (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.17-4.68) than in those sleeping 7-8 h; also, women who slept ≥11 h were more likely to fall ≥1 times (OR 3.89; 95% CI 1.74-8.69). In conclusion, long sleep duration was associated with higher frequency of falls in older adults, even after adjustment for a wide range of sleep quality indicators.

After an initial adaptation night, each pair spent 1 night bed sharing and 1 night in solitary sleep in random order. Apnea and periodic breathing were scored from polysomnographic recordings. The frequency of central apnea was significantly increased on the bed-sharing night, compared with the solitary night, regardless of routine sleeping arrangement. There were significantly fewer obstructive apneas on the bed-sharing night than on the solitary night, but only in routinely solitary sleeping infants. In both groups, there was a significantly higher frequency of periodic breathing events on the bed-sharing night than on the solitary night.

Activities of the PCA and D increased in a parallel fashion with increasing CO2. The GG responded to steady state CO2 inhalation alinearly, with larger increases in activity occurring when CO2 was raised from 3.4 to 7.4% than when CO2 was increased from 0 to 3.4%. When gas mixtures containing CO2 were given, the GG reached its new steady state level more slowly than the D or PCA, and when CO2 was rapidly removed from the inspired gas mixture, the GG attained its steady state sooner than the D. These results suggest that in sleeping cats, hypercapnia does not affect either transient or steady state responses of the GG in the same way as the D or the PCA.

An extended time in bed in a separate study was used to evaluate the possible reversal of the impairments of these processes in habitual short sleepers. Ten self-defined short sleepers (total sleep time [TST] ≤ 6 h) and 9 normal-sleeping subjects with TST 7-8 h, participated. ERPs were recorded via a 64-channel EEG system. Two test conditions: \"ignore\" and \"attend\" were implemented. The ERPs were analyzed and compared between groups on the 2 task conditions and frontal/central/parietal electrodes by 3-factor ANOVA. Sleep diary data were compared between groups by t-test. Sleep was recorded by the Zeo sleep monitoring system for a week in both habitual and extended sleep conditions at home. The main findings of the present study show that short sleeping individuals had deficiency in activity of the MMN and P3a brain responses over frontal areas compared to normal-sleeping subjects.

As a complex process with various stages and cycles, sleep can be evaluated using polysomnography and consumer sleep trackers, although the latter are less accurate for monitoring sleep stages. Sleep needs and patterns evolve throughout life, from infancy to older adulthood, with adults ages 18 to 64 years typically requiring 7 to 9 hours per night for optimal health. Insufficient sleep is associated with an increased risk of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, and a weakened immune system. It also impairs cognitive function, decreases productivity and quality of life, and increases the risk of motor vehicle crashes. Sleep deprivation is closely tied to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. Although napping or sleep banking may offer temporary relief from sleep deprivation, they cannot be a substitute for regular, high-quality sleep. Consistently sleeping more than 9 to 10 hours per night, known as hypersomnia, has been linked to health issues including weight gain, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular disease.

Understanding whether sleep is a diagnostic trait for members of the kingdom Animalia has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of sleep and sleep functions. Unfortunately, knowledge on the phylogenetic breadth of sleep is restricted to vertebrates, a few arthropods and molluscs, and one species of nematode. There is a dearth of information on the other 30 or so animal phyla. Here, we provide original data on a previously unstudied group of animals with respect to sleep: platyhelminth flatworms. These free-living animals are relatively simple, with a rudimentary central nervous system and absence of many other specialized physiological systems. Despite this simplicity, inactive flatworms appeared to be sleeping. Specifically, quiescence was organized in a circadian manner, occurring largely during the daytime. This basic rhythm persisted under constant darkness, suggesting that it was endogenously generated. Active flatworms responded more readily to stimulation, and flatworms recovered lost sleep by sleeping longer after a 3-hour period of inactivity deprivation. We were also able to increase inactivity in a dose-dependent manner with exposure to melatonin, a hormone that increases sleep in diurnal animals. Taken together, these data expand our understanding of the phylogenetic extent of sleep and reinforce the idea that sleep evolved early in the evolutionary history of animals. However, additional studies on other types of animals are required for a comprehensive understanding of the origin(s) and evolution of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28958003/"}

However, the scientific foundation for this standard may be less canonical than previously assumed, particularly when considering individual variability in sleep needs and organization. Historical texts and recent research suggest an alternative view: that sleep can be naturally segmented into two periods across the 24h cycle - a pattern known as biphasic sleep. This review explores the physiological implications of biphasic sleep, examining its potential benefits and limitations under healthy conditions and in particular contexts, such as shift working. With this available data, an original hypothesis is proposed, consisting of a novel framework of sleep distribution according to sleeping types. This aims to stimulate new research about biphasic schedules and how sleep architecture might adapt to them over time. The strengths and weaknesses of existing research will be critically assessed, culminating in recommendations for future investigations and methodological approaches. These insights may ultimately inform more personalized and flexible sleep guidelines better aligned with individual and societal needs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40825260/"}

The aim was to study the variability of the ventilatory response to CO2 and take this into account to assess the relative magnitude of the response to CO2 during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and quiet sleep (QS). Five full-term babies aged 4-6 days were given 5% CO2 in air to rebreathe for 1.5-3 min. O2 was added to the rebreathing circuit to maintain arterial O2 saturation and transcutaneous PO2 (Ptco2) at prerebreathing levels. Tests were repeated four to five times in REM sleep and QS. Mean Ptco2 levels varied between individuals but were similar during REM sleep and QS tests for each subject. The mean coefficient of variability of the ventilatory response was 35% (range 15-77%) during QS and 120% (range 32-220%) during REM sleep. PtcO2 fluctuations during tests [6.0 +/- 3.0 (SD) Torr, range 1-13 Torr] were not correlated with ventilatory response. Overall the ventilatory response was significantly lower in REM sleep than in QS (12.2 +/- 3.0 vs. 38.7 +/- 3.0 ml.min-1.Torr-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001; 2-way analysis of variance) due to a small (nonsignificant) fall in the tidal volume response and a significant fall in breathing rate. In 12 REM sleep tests there was no significant ventilatory response; mean inspiratory flow increased significantly during 8 of these 12 tests. We conclude that there is a significant decrease in the ventilatory response of the newborn to CO2 rebreathing during REM sleep compared with QS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1917739/"}

The aim of this study was to investigate whether tolerance is also observed for the EEG effect, and whether the EEG can give insight into the pharmacodynamic aspects of GHB tolerance. In three series of experiments, rats were pre-treated with either the GHB precursor gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) or saline intraperitoneally twice daily. In the first series, a reduction in sleeping time was observed in the GBL pre-treated rats compared with controls. In the second series, a fast infusion of GHB (300 mg kg(-1) over 5 min) was given after 10 days pre-treatment. The GHB plasma concentration-time curves showed a slightly faster decrease in GHB concentration in the GBL pre-treated rats, suggesting a small induction of the GHB metabolism (V(max) = 2882 +/- 457 microg min(-1) kg(-1) vs 2205 +/- 315 microg min(-1) kg(-1), P < 0.01). In contrast to controls, GBL pre-treated rats did not lose righting reflex. In the third series, a slow infusion of 480 mg kg(-1) h(-1) was given after 7 days pre-treatment, which allowed fitting a sigmoid E(max) model to the EEG amplitude versus GHB plasma concentration curve. This showed reduced end-organ sensitivity to GHB in the GBL pre-treated rats (EC50 (concentration required to obtain 50% depression of the baseline effect) = 653+/- 183 microg mL(-1) vs 323 +/- 68 microg mL(-1), P < 0.001). In conclusion, chronic pre-treatment with gamma-butyrolactone in the rat results in a reduced sleeping time and this tolerance is reflected by the EEG.

We have recently shown that the MR antagonist spironolactone selectively increases the numbers of circulating naïve and central memory T cells during early sleep, which is the time period in the 24 h cycle hallmarked by predominant MR activation. To investigate whether this effect is specific to spironolactone's blockade of MRs and to study the underlying molecular mechanisms, healthy humans were given the selective MR-agonist fludrocortisone or placebo and numbers of eight T-cell subsets and their CD62L and CXCR4 expression were analyzed. Fludrocortisone selectively reduced counts of naïve CD4(+) , central memory CD4(+), and naïve CD8(+) T cells and increased CXCR4 expression on the naïve subsets. In complementing in vitro studies, fludrocortisone enhanced CXCR4 and CD62L expression, which was counteracted by spironolactone. Incubation of naïve T cells with spironolactone alone reduced CD62L and CCR7 expression. Our results indicate a regulatory influence of MR signaling on human T-cell migration and suggest a role for endogenous aldosterone in the redistribution of T-cell subsets to lymph nodes, involving CD62L, CCR7, and CXCR4. Facilitation of T-cell homing following sleep-dependent aldosterone release might thus essentially contribute to sleep's well-known role in supporting adaptive immunity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24595810/"}

In this cross-sectional study, the aim was to investigate the links between short-term sleep quality and duration, and heart rate variability in 60 healthy individuals, in order to provide useful information about the effects of stress and sleep on heart rate variability (HRV) indices, which in turn could be integrated into biological models for wearable devices. Sleep parameters were collected from participants on commencement of the study, and HRV was derived using an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a resting and stress task (Trier Stress Test). Low-frequency to high-frequency (LF:HF) ratio was significantly higher during the stress task than during the baseline resting phase, and very-low-frequency and high-frequency HRV were inversely related to impaired sleep during stress tasks. Given the ubiquitous nature of wearable technologies for monitoring health states, in particular HRV, it is important to consider the impacts of sleep states when using these technologies to interpret data.

Twelve adult male Wistar rats were equipped with electrodes and thermistor probes--which measured cortical (Tco), interscapular brown adipose tissue (Tibat), and liver (Tl) temperatures--for thermal and sleep studies. Six rats were exposed to thermoneutral (24 degrees C) and 6 to low (9 degrees C) ambient temperature.

The Tco, Tibat, and Tl levels were also assessed during the slow wave sleep that preceded each isolated paradoxical sleep episode. During slow wave sleep, the Tibat and Tl were clearly higher in rats exposed to the cold than in those exposed to the thermoneutral condition (< 1 degrees C). During paradoxical sleep, however, these 2 temperatures decreased in rats exposed to the cold condition, and the changes observed for Tco were completely inversed. These results support the hypothesis that the thermal state in the liver of rats deteriorates during paradoxical sleep and suggest that nonshivering thermogenesis in the liver contributes to the defense of global thermal homeostasis in the sleeping endothermic organism, especially during slow wave sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14746373/"}

As changes in skeletal muscle and fat mass index [kg/m<sup>2</sup>] were estimated by a validated prediction equation, multiple linear regression was used to calculate adjusted mean (adMean) of muscle and fat mass according to changes in sleep behavior. When sleep duration decreased and quality of sleep deteriorated (from good to poor), fat mass index significantly increased (adMean: 0.087 for the Good-to-Good group and 0.210 for the Good-to-Poor group; p-value = 0.006).

Actigraph data was obtained from 77 cadets participating in a month-long military training program. At day 17, participants transitioned from sleeping in garrison to sleeping in a field exercise setting. A discontinuous growth model tested for individual differences in 1) overall sleep time, 2) garrison sleep slope, 3) the transition, and 4) the sleep slope during the field exercise setting. Individuals varied significantly in their overall sleep time, pattern of sleep in garrison, and the degree to which sleep decreased at the transition. The decline in sleep at the transition was related to participant age such that increases in age were associated with larger declines in sleep minutes. Individuals display significant variability in sleep patterns that can be detected using discontinuous growth models. The individual difference variable of participant age explains some of this variability. Much of the variability, however, remains unexplained.

A number of features associated with the epoch RR-intervals, an inductance plethysmography estimate of rib cage respiratory effort, and an electrocardiogram-derived respiration (EDR) signal were investigated. A subject-specific quadratic discriminant classifier was trained, randomly choosing 20% of the subject's epochs (in appropriate proportions of W, S and R) as the training data. The remaining 80% of epochs were presented to the classifier for testing. An estimated classification accuracy of 79% (Cohen's kappa value of 0.56) was achieved. When a similar subject-independent classifier was trained, using epochs from all other subjects as the training data, a drop in classification accuracy to 67% (kappa = 0.32) was observed.

The subject-specific classifier performed better on subjects with low AHI than high AHI; the performance of the subject-independent classifier is not correlated with AHI.

This retrospective series was compiled from log books and files of the Medical Examiner Office, Palm Beach County, Florida. The incidence of sudden unexpected infant death decreased 50% over the study period (P <.01). Of the 217 infants that fit the study criteria, 62.7% were sleeping prone (on the stomach), 9.7% were supine (on the back), 5.5% were on their side, 22.1% were in an unknown position, and 40.1% were bed-sharing. Significant autopsy findings that could explain death were documented by autopsy in 37.5% of all supine and side sleeping infants and only 14.0% of all prone sleeping infants (P <.001). Deaths of supine and side sleeping infants were more likely to be classified as a natural disease process other than sudden infant death syndrome (P <.01).

This framework is developed in the light of recent findings. It is argued that the \"primitiveness\" of REM and its similarity to wakefulness liken it to a default state of \"non-wakefulness\" or a waking antagonist, anteceding \"true\" (non-REM) sleep. The \"toning up\" is reflected by inhibition of motor, sensory and (importantly) emotional systems, together pointing to integrated \"flight or fight\" activity, that preoccupies/distracts the organism when non-REM is absent and wakefulness unnecessary. Dreaming facilitates this distraction. In rodents, REM can provide stress coping and calming, but REM deprivation procedures incorporating immobility may further enhance stress and confound outcomes. REM \"pressure\" (e.g. REM rebounds) may be a default from a loss of inhibition of REM by non-REM. REM can be reduced and/or replaced by wakefulness, without adverse effects.

The goals of the current study were to (1) describe sleep health in an undergraduate college sample and (2) examine the role of a class activity using self-determination theory to promote better sleep health in this group. <b>Methods:</b> A cohort study was conducted using data drawn from class activities conducted in two undergraduate Introduction to Psychology courses. Students were undergraduates at a mid-Atlantic public university in the United States. Total sample size was <i>N</i> = 224 (intervention class [<i>n</i> = 98], and the control class [<i>n</i> = 127]). Both the intervention and control classes completed the RU SATED sleep health questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the semester. The intervention class also completed a self-determination activity focused on sleep health mid-semester. Both the RU SATED questionnaires and the self-determination activities were completed via in-class responder technology. Data were de-identified and downloaded from the responder technology at the end of the semester. Mixed methods were used for data analysis including quantitative analyses and a qualitative approach using a phenomenological, inductive, and reflexive qualitative method whereby themes were allowed to emerge from the data. <b>Results:</b> Overall, almost 25% of the students reported never or rarely obtaining healthy sleep on average. The majority (76%) said they sometimes have healthy sleep and no students reported usually or always obtaining healthy sleep. The components of sleep health the entire sample scored highest on were timing (sleeping between 2 and 4 AM), sleep duration (between 7 and 9 h), and staying awake during the day. The areas they scored the lowest on were maintaining regular bed and wake times, spending less than 30 min awake at night, and feeling satisfied with their sleep. Qualitatively, the most frequently obtained sleep health behaviors of the intervention class were rhythmicity, prioritizing sleep, timing of sleep, and tech hygiene. The intervention class had significantly better sleep health across the entire semester and significantly better daytime alertness post-intervention. The most commonly chosen sleep health behaviors to change were sleep hygiene, tech hygiene, and stimulus control. <b>Conclusion:</b> We examined the classroom environment as a venue for promoting sleep health among college students. Given the popularity of Introduction to Psychology courses, this class is a promising avenue to deliver sleep health promotions to a large number of students. The implementation of a self-determination framework, as part of sleep health promotion, shows potential for creating a person-centered, strengths-based approach to health behavior change within this population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886017/"}
{"id": "14996030", "title": "The nature of arousal in sleep.", "text": "The role of arousals in sleep is gaining interest among both basic researchers and clinicians. In the last 20 years increasing evidence shows that arousals are deeply involved in the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. The nature of arousals in sleep is still a matter of debate. According to the conceptual framework of the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria, arousals are a marker of sleep disruption representing a detrimental and harmful feature for sleep. In contrast, our view indicates arousals as elements weaved into the texture of sleep taking part in the regulation of the sleep process. In addition, the concept of micro-arousal (MA) has been extended, incorporating, besides the classical low-voltage fast-rhythm electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals, high-amplitude EEG bursts, be they like delta-like or K-complexes, which reflects a special kind of arousal process, mobilizing parallely antiarousal swings. In physiologic conditions, the slow and fast MA are not randomly scattered but appear structurally distributed within sleep representing state-specific arousal responses. MA preceded by slow waves occurs more frequently across the descending part of sleep cycles and in the first cycles, while the traditional fast type of arousals across the ascending slope of cycles prevails during the last third of sleep. The uniform arousal characteristics of these two types of MAs is supported by the finding that different MAs are associated with an increasing magnitude of vegetative activation ranging hierarchically from the weaker slow EEG types (coupled with mild autonomic activation) to the stronger rapid EEG types (coupled with a vigorous autonomic activation). Finally, it has been ascertained that MA are not isolated events but are basically endowed with a periodic nature expressed in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep by the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). Understanding the role of arousals and CAP and the relationship between physiologic and pathologic MA can shed light on the adaptive properties of the sleeping brain and provide insight into the pathomechanisms of sleep disturbances. Functional significance of arousal in sleep, and particularly in NREM sleep, is to ensure the reversibility of sleep, without which it would be identical to coma. Arousals may connect the sleeper with the surrounding world maintaining the selection of relevant incoming information and adapting the organism to the dangers and demands of the outer world. In this dynamic perspective, ongoing phasic events carry on the one hand arousal influences and on the other elements of information processing. The other function of arousals is tailoring the more or less stereotyped endogenously determined sleep process driven by chemical influences according to internal and external demands. In this perspective, arousals shape the individual course of night sleep as a variation of the sleep program.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14996030/"}

Experimental studies show that sleep deprivation is associated with higher nighttime energy intake, but no studies have examined the patterning of energy intake in relation to nighttime sleep duration in young children. The objectives of the study were to test the hypothesis that shorter-sleeping children would show higher nighttime energy intake and to examine whether the additional calories were from drinks, snacks or meals. Participants were 1278 families from the Gemini twin cohort, using data from one child per family selected at random to avoid clustering effects. Nighttime sleep duration was measured at 16 months of age using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Energy intake by time of day and eating episode (meal, snack, drink) were derived from 3-day diet diaries completed when children were 21 months. Consistent with our hypothesis, shorter-sleeping children consumed more calories at night only (linear trend P < 0.001), with those sleeping <10 h consuming on average 120 calories (15.2% of daily intake) more at night than those sleeping ≥13 h. The majority of nighttime intake was from milk drinks. Associations remained after adjusting for age, sex, birth weight, gestational age, maternal education, weight and daytime sleep. Shorter-sleeping, young children consume more calories, predominantly at night, and from milk drinks. Parents should be aware that providing milk drinks at night may contribute to excess intake. This provides a clear target for intervention that may help address associations between sleep and weight observed in later childhood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25565402/"}

However, spike-timing relationships across cortico-hippocampal networks-key determinants of synaptic changes-are poorly understood. Here we show that cells in prefrontal cortex fire consistently within 100 ms after hippocampal cells in naturally sleeping animals. This provides evidence at the single cell-pair level for highly consistent directional interactions between these areas within the window of plasticity. Moreover, these interactions are state dependent: they are driven by hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR) bursts in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and are sharply reduced during REM sleep. Finally, prefrontal responses are nonlinear: as the strength of hippocampal bursts rises, short-latency prefrontal responses are augmented by increased spindle band activity and a secondary peak approximately 100 ms later. These findings suggest that SWR events are atomic units of hippocampal-prefrontal communication during SWS and that the coupling between these areas is highly attenuated during REM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19249278/"}

Adv Exp Med Biol 758:359-363, 2012). Long term facilitation (LTF) of respiratory motor outputs following exposure to episodic, but not sustained, hypoxia has been described. We hypothesized that CIH would enhance ventilatory LTF during sleep. We examined the effects of 3 and 7 days of CIH exposure on the expression of ventilatory LTF in sleeping rats. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to 20 cycles of normoxia and hypoxia (5 % O(2) at nadir; SaO(2) ~ 80 %) per hour, 8 h per day for 3 or 7 consecutive days (CIH, N = 7 per group). Corresponding sham groups (N = 7 per group) were subjected to alternating cycles of air under identical experimental conditions in parallel. Following gas exposures, breathing during sleep was assessed in unrestrained, unanaesthetized animals using the technique of whole-body plethysmography. Rats were exposed to room air (baseline) and then to an acute IH (AIH) protocol consisting of alternating periods of normoxia (7 min) and hypoxia (FiO(2) 0.1, 5 min) for 10 cycles. Breathing was monitored during the AIH exposure and for 1 h in normoxia following AIH exposure. Baseline ventilation was elevated after 3 but not 7 days of CIH exposure. The hypoxic ventilatory response was equivalent in sham and CIH animals after 3 days but ventilatory responses to repeated hypoxic challenges were significantly blunted following 7 days of CIH. Minute ventilation was significantly elevated following AIH exposure compared to baseline in sham but not in CIH exposed animals. LTF, determined as the % increase in minute ventilation from baseline following AIH exposure, was significantly blunted in CIH exposed rats. In summary, CIH leads to impaired ventilatory responsiveness to AIH. Moreover, CIH blunts ventilatory LTF. The physiological significance of ventilatory LTF is context-dependent but it is reasonable to consider that it can potentially destabilize respiratory control, in view of the potential for LTF to give rise to hypocapnia. CIH-induced blunting of LTF may represent a compensatory mechanism subserving respiratory homeostasis. Our results suggest that CIH-induced increase in apnoea index (Edge D, Bradford A, O'halloran KD. Adv Exp Med Biol 758:359-363, 2012) is not related to enhanced ventilatory LTF. We conclude that the mature adult respiratory system exhibits plasticity and metaplasticity with potential consequences for the control of respiratory homeostasis. Our results may have implications for human sleep apnoea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26303498/"}

In addition, the rate of O2 consumption and ventilatory response to hypercapnia were decreased. In contrast, REM sleep was characterized by rapid, shallow, and considerably more irregular (coefficients of variation, 0.18-0.30) breathing; Ve increased markedly and PAco2 decreased (mean change, 5.2 mmHg). Blockade of both cervical vagus nerves produced comparable changes in each stage of sleep (W, NREM, REM): breathing became slower and deeper, but the differences between stages and the marked irregularity in REM sleep persisted. In contrast, the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex (HBIR) was strong in W and NREM sleep, but weak in REM sleep.

Parenting in the early months may be highly influential on infant sleep patterns and trajectories. This study used observational and survey data to investigate how sleeping arrangement and two types of nighttime interventions at one and three months (non-distress-initiated and distress-initiated) are associated with infants' sleep development across the first nine months. Distress-initiated interventions were identified as parents' responses to infants' distress signals whereas non-distress initiated interventions were identified as parents' behaviors in response to non-distressed vocalizations or while infants were asleep. Analysis from 107 families revealed that infant night wakings decreased over time as expected. The link between early non-distress initiated interventions and rate of change in infant night wakings was significantly moderated by sleep arrangement such that solitary sleeping infants who experienced higher levels of non-distress-initiated interventions showed a less steep decline across time in infant night wakings compared to solitary infants who experienced low levels of non-distress-initiated interventions. Results also showed that higher levels of distress-initiated interventions at one and three months were associated with a steeper decrease in infant night wakings for both solitary and cosleeping infants.

Participants included 1339 hospital employees, where 542 were shift workers and 797 were non-shift workers. Overall, a significant difference between network structures were observed. In particular, daytime dysfunction emerged as a strongly connected symptom in shift workers, as evidenced by strength centrality. Increased use of sleeping medication and decreased habitual sleep efficiency were more strongly associated with increased daytime dysfunction in shift workers. Sleep latency and sleep quality were also more strongly linked in shift workers. These results are in part attributable to differing causes of insomnia in shift and non-shift workers. Furthermore, the results indicate that shift workers are more vulnerable and susceptible to changes in sleep-related indices, such as sleep efficiency and latency.

The control group was composed of persons who slept naturally from 12-8:00 a.m. for 7-8 hr. Irregular sleepers were defined as those whose retiring and awakening times varied by about 2-4 hr. Measurements were obtained from an auditory reaction time task, a mood adjective check list, of sublingual temperature and pulse rate 30 min. after awakening in the (a) morning, at (b) noon, in the (c) afternoon and (d) early evening following an electroencephalographically recorded 12-8:00 a.m. sleep night. At various points in the diurnal cycle irregular sleepers compared with the control group had significantly lower levels of pulse rate and body temperature, but significantly longer reaction times. During the four time periods negative affects (deactivation-sleep, depression, general deactivation, inert-fatigued) were significantly greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activation--significantly less in the irregular sleepers. The irregular sleepers averaged significantly less stage 4, and REM, but more stage 2 and transitions between sleep stages. The present results indicate that relatively lowered levels of physiological arousal indexes, psychomotor performance and subjective mood are associated with irregularity in chronic sleep routines of young adult males. These psychobehavioral correlates of chronically maintained sleep pattern variations complement and extend previous findings on degradations in waking functions following acute 2-4 hr temporal shifts of habitual sleep periods. It is postulated that there were psychobehavioral deficits in the irregular sleepers attributable either to selective sleep stage (REM and/or stage 4) deprivation or to the more general consequence of disturbed sleeping patterns per se or to both of these factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/218642/"}

We used a non-invasive polysomnographic method to monitor and compare the characteristics of dogs' (N = 24) 3-hr-long afternoon naps on three occasions at the same location. We analysed how sleep macrostructure variables differed between the first, second and third occasions, considering also the effects of potential confounding variables such as the dogs' age and sleeping habits. Our findings indicate that first-night effect is present in dogs' sleep architecture, although its specifics somewhat deviate from the pattern observed in humans. Sleep macrostructure differences were mostly found between occasions 1 and 3; dogs slept more, had less wake after the first drowsiness episode, and reached drowsiness sleep earlier on occasion 3. Dogs, which had been reported to sleep rarely not at home, had an earlier non-rapid eye movement sleep, a shorter rapid eye movement sleep latency, and spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep on occasion 3, compared with occasion 1.

Interactions with diverse covariates were studied by multiple regression analysis. A significant correlation was found between 24-h crying/fussy behavior duration and proportion of active sleep in infants at 14-16 weeks and in within-infant relationships. Among potential covariates, gestational age and co-sleeping had a significant impact on proportion of active sleep. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that gestational age and co-sleeping were positively associated with proportion of active sleep, whereas 24-h crying/behavior duration was not associated with proportion of active sleep. Subsiding of early crying and decreasing of proportion of active sleep are parallel phenomena in some infants.

Here we show that in the first two days after hatching, chicks coming from eggs incubated in the light prevalently slept with their right eye open, whereas those coming from eggs incubated in the dark prevalently slept with their left eye open.

Episodes of interhemispheric EEG asymmetry, which typically lasted from 2 to 4 s, occurred when birds displayed the front sleep posture and they constituted 140-200 s of each night. Unihemispheric sleep episodes probably result from unilateral activation of the visual system, and they could be considered as an evolutionary adaptation. HR was highest in wakefulness and lower in sleep but, due to large variability, reliable discrimination between sleep and wakefulness could not be made. Comparison of the blackbird's behavior during 4 different nights revealed a strong effect of the first night on sleeping behavior. A significant reduction in back sleep posture occurred during the baseline night, when lead wires were connected.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8884941/"}

However, one type of cognition that may differ is episodic thoughts of the past and future. The current study investigated this across waking, NREM sleep and REM sleep. We analyzed thought reports obtained from a large sample of individuals (N = 138) who underwent experience-sampling during wakefulness as well as serial awakenings in sleep. Our data suggest that while episodic thoughts are common during waking spontaneous thought, episodic thoughts of both the past and the future rarely occur in either N2 or REM sleep. Moreover, replicating previous findings, episodic thoughts during wakefulness exhibit a strong prospective bias and frequently involve autobiographical planning. Together, these results suggest that the occurrence of spontaneous episodic thoughts differs substantially across waking and dreaming sleep states. We suggest that this points to a difference in the way that human consciousness is typically experienced across the sleep-wake cycle.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864360/"}

Insomnia disorder (ID) is a highly prevalent health problem characterized by increased arousal during the night and daytime. Whether or not a similar phenomenon occurs in patients with ID is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an unfamiliar environment on the sleep of patients with ID. In an unfamiliar sleep laboratory, polysomnographic recording testing was performed for two consecutive nights in patients with ID and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (HC). We collected sleep diaries and questionnaires regarding sleep, medical conditions, psychological status, and health history. Sleep continuity and architecture in both groups were compared and analyzed for two consecutive nights. Participants with ID (n = 39)  and HC (n = 35) demonstrated differentially poor sleep on laboratory adaptation after exposure to the sleep laboratory. Patients with ID had longer rapid eye movement (REM) latency on the first night than on the second sleep night. HC showed increased duration and percentage of N1, decreased duration and percentage of N3, and decreased REM percentage during initial nights compared to subsequent nights. The other sleep variables showed no differences between the first and second sleep nights in patients with ID and HC. An unfamiliar sleep environment does not aggravate the disruption of sleep continuity and sleep architecture but only affects the REM latency in patients with ID compared with HC.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37747601/"}

Although respiratory event durations are associated with OSA-related severe health consequences, it is unclear how sleeping position, obesity, and daytime sleepiness are associated with respiratory event durations during REM and NREM sleep. We hypothesize that irrespective of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), respiratory event durations differ significantly between various OSA subgroups during REM and NREM sleep. One night in-lab polysomnographic recordings were retrospectively analyzed from 1910 untreated suspected OSA patients. 599 patients (AHI ≥ 5) were included in study and divided into subgroups based on positional dependency, BMI, and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Multiple Sleep Latency Test). Differences in total hypopnea time (THT), total apnea time (TAT), and total apnea-hypopnea time (TAHT) within REM and NREM sleep between the subgroups were evaluated. During REM sleep, positional OSA patients had lower THT (OR = 0.952, p < 0.001) and TAHT (OR = 0.943, p < 0.001) than their non-positional counterparts. Compared to normal-weight patients (BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) had lower THT, TAT, and TAHT (ORs = 0.942-0.971, p ≤ 0.009) during NREM sleep but higher THT (OR = 1.057, p = 0.001) and TAHT (OR = 1.052, p = 0.001) during REM sleep. No significant differences were observed in THT, TAT, and TAHT between patients with and without daytime sleepiness.

Various parameters of sleep-related discharge bursts were analysed. Statistical analyses revealed striking similarities between motor relay (v.l.) and intralaminar (c.l.) neurones. More than 60% of bursts consist of three to five spikes at 250-400 Hz. The defining feature of bursts in all cortically projecting neurones is a progressive increase in the duration of successive interspike intervals. As in thalamocortical cells, all re. neurones change their tonic discharges in waking to bursting firing in sleep, regardless of the increased or decreased firing rates from wake to sleep in individual neurones. The bursts of re. neurones are essentially different from those of thalamocortical cells. In re. neurones, burst structure consists of an initial progressive decrease in duration of interspike intervals, followed by an increase in duration of successive intervals, eventually leading to a long-lasting tonic spike train at about 100 Hz. In contrast with bursts of thalamocortical neurones, only 6% of re. bursts are shorter than 50 ms; the total duration of the burst extends between 50 ms and 1.5 s. Population periburst histograms show the beginning of a decline in firing probability about 1.5 s prior to burst onset and an increased firing probability persisting for 300-350 ms after burst onset. The different electrophysiological properties underlying the burst structure of cat's thalamocortical and re. neurones are discussed, with emphasis on dissimilar aspects of re. bursts in unanaesthetized and barbituratized preparations.

A structural equation model was used to assess genetic and non-genetic contributions to BMI and sleep duration. The study sample included 1,224 twins comprised of 423 monozygotic, 143 dizygotic, and 46 indeterminate pairs. The mean age was 36.9 years; 69% were female.

We investigated factors and frequency of infant suffocation incidents associated with co-sleeping and breastfeeding in the side-lying position using a self-administered questionnaire survey of 895 mothers during their infant's 1-, 4-, or 10-month health checkups. Co-sleeping and breastfeeding in the side-lying position were practiced by 28.3% and 56.0% of mothers, respectively; thus, 84.3% of the mothers surveyed were practicing either co-sleeping or breastfeeding in the side-lying position. Of those who received guidance from a medical professional, 36.1% practiced only co-sleeping while 60.1% practiced only side-lying breastfeeding. In the co-sleeping group, 10.6% had faced infant suffocation incidents, while 13.2% in the breastfeeding in the side-lying position group had faced similar incidents. Regarding factors associated with suffocation incidents while co-sleeping, the frequency of occurrence was significantly more in mothers of 1-month and 4-month-old infants compared with those of 10-month-old infants. Of mothers who faced suffocation incidents while breastfeeding in the side-lying position, 45% also had faced similar incidents while co-sleeping. These results demonstrate the importance of thoroughly educating mothers about the risks associated with co-sleeping and breastfeeding in the side-lying position for preventing infant suffocation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30369557/"}

Early results show that the system can be used to detect the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is traditionally diagnosed using polysomnography, which requires a whole night stay at the sleep laboratory of a hospital, where the patient is attached to multiple electrodes and sensors. Our system detects heartbeats, breathing, snoring, sleeping positions and movements using a special electret microphone and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The system first analyses the sleep using the acoustic information provided by the electret microphone. From the acoustic information breathing events and heartbeats are identified. The system also analyses the patient's activity and positions from data delivered by the IMU. The information from both sensors is fused to detect sleep events. First experiments show that the system is capable of detecting and interpreting relevant data to improve sleep monitoring.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25571592/"}

In this paper, we characterize the WaveSleepNet (WSN), a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses wavelet transformed images of mouse EEG/EMG signals to autoscore sleep and wake. WSN achieves an epoch by epoch mean accuracy of 0.86 and mean F1 score of 0.82 compared to manual scoring by a human expert. In mice experiencing mechanically induced sleep fragmentation, an overall epoch by epoch mean accuracy of 0.80 is achieved by WSN and classification of non-REM (NREM) sleep is not compromised, but the high level of sleep fragmentation results in WSN having greater difficulty differentiating REM from NREM sleep. We also find that WSN achieves similar levels of accuracy on an independent dataset of externally acquired EEG/EMG recordings with an overall epoch by epoch accuracy of 0.91. We also compared conventional summary sleep metrics in mice sleeping ad libitum. WSN systematically biases sleep fragmentation metrics of bout number and bout length leading to an overestimated degree of sleep fragmentation. In a cross-validation, WSN has a greater macro and stage-specific accuracy compared to a conventional random forest classifier. Examining the WSN, we find that it automatically learns spectral features consistent with manual scoring criteria that are used to define each class. These results suggest to us that WSN is capable of learning visually agreeable features and may be useful as a supplement to human manual scoring.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34052291/"}

Despite numerous efforts, the reason behind our need for sleep is still unknown. The Theory of neuronal Cognition (TnC) proposes that sleep is the period of time during which the local inhibitory synapses (in particular the cortical ones) are replenished. Indeed, as long as the active brain stays awake, hebbian learning guarantees that efficient inhibitory synapses lose their efficiency – just because they are efficient at avoiding the activation of the targeted neurons. Since hebbian learning is the only known mechanism of synapse modification, it follows that to replenish the inhibitory synapses' efficiency, source and targeted neurons must be activated together. This is achieved by a local depolarization that may travel (wave). The period of time during which such slow waves are experienced has been named the \"slow-wave sleep\" (SWS). It is cut into several pieces by shorter periods of paradoxical sleep (REM) which activity resembles that of the awake state. Indeed, SWS – because it only allows local neural activation – decreases the excitatory long distance connections strength. To avoid losing the associations built during the awake state, these long distance activations are played again during the REM sleep. REM and SWS sleeps act together to guarantee that when the subject awakes again, his inhibitory synaptic efficiency is restored and his (excitatory) long distance associations are still there.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26138624/"}

Inverse associations between sleep length and overweight have been found in children. Short sleeping hours result in hormonal changes, which increase perceived hunger and appetite. This could affect food intake, and consequently lead to overweight. The aim is to find out whether there is an association between adequate sleep and food consumption among 10-11-year-old school children in Finland. One thousand two hundred and sixty-five children (response rate 79 %), aged 9-11, from thirty-one schools filled in a questionnaire about their health behaviour. Inadequate sleep was measured as short sleeping hours during school nights and weekend nights, difficulties in waking up in the morning and tiredness during the day. Food consumption patterns were measured by two consumption indices, energy-rich foods and nutrient-dense foods, based on a short FFQ (sixteen items). Inadequate sleep is associated with food consumption patterns. Boys with shorter sleep duration during school nights, and who were felt tired during the day, were more likely to consume energy-rich foods. Girls with shorter sleep duration during school nights consumed more likely energy-rich foods and less likely nutrient-dense foods. Adjusting for physical activity and screen time weakened the explored associations. The associations with energy-rich foods were stronger for boys than for girls. Sleeping habits are associated with food consumption patterns. Shorter sleep duration during school nights in school children is associated with higher consumption of energy-rich foods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19664303/"}

However, less is known about the etiology of the different sleep quality components and their associations. Subjective sleep quality has been studied most commonly using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Therefore, this work aimed to study the structure of sleep quality dimensions in a population-based twin sample by examining the etiology of the associations among the PSQI components themselves and between them. The sample comprised 2129 participants from the Murcia Twin Registry. In order to study the phenotypic, genetic and environmental structure of the PSQI we used three alternative multivariate twin models including all seven sub-scales of the PSQI (subjective sleep quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction): a multivariate model (with seven separate correlated factors), a common pathway model and an independent pathway model. The multivariate correlated factors model showed the best fit to the data. All twin models indicated significant genetic overlap among most of the PSQI components, except daytime dysfunction and use of sleep medication. Bivariate heritability explained between 25 and 50% of the covariance for most associations between dimensions. Furthermore, the common pathway model showed that around one third of the variance (0.32; CI 95% 0.18.0.43) of a latent factor common to all questionnaire dimensions is explained by genetic factors. Genetic influences on a latent factor common to all questionnaire dimensions produced the same heritability estimates as the PSQI global score.

This study was aimed at evaluating the biomechanical quality of different backrest and seat pan angle combinations, and at predicting the most favourable sleeping positions based on vehicle restriction. More specifically, the interface pressure distribution and subjective suitability rating of 23 subjects was assessed in a total of nine (3 × 3) combinations of seat pan (20°, 30°, 40°) and backrest (145°, 155°, 165°) angles. Biomechanical quality was evaluated with an interface pressure score (IPS) based on sensitivity weighted pressures and the total contact area. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that IPS significantly improves with increasing seat pan angle whereas backrest angles of 155° or 165° lead to significant better IPS compared to flatter ones (145°). The overall highest IPS was observed for a 40°-seat pan angle in combination with a 155°-backrest angle. Subjective suitability rating revealed that people prefer a combination of 165° backrest angle with a seat pan of 20°; however, eight of nine combinations can be considered as suitable for sleeping.

There was a significant positive additive interaction between short sleep duration and trouble sleeping on depressive symptoms in the fully adjusted model (Relative excess risk due to interaction, RERI<sub>OR</sub> = 4.42, 95 % CI: 1.12, 7.73), with 43 % of the association with depressive symptoms attributed to the interaction (attributable proportion of interaction, AP = 0.43, 95 % CI: 0.22, 0.64). Similarly, a significant positive additive interaction between long sleep duration and trouble sleeping on depressive symptoms was found (RERI<sub>OR</sub> = 4.17, 95 % CI: 0.96, 7.38), with 41 % of the association with depressive symptoms attributed to the interaction (AP = 0.41, 95 % CI: 0.21, 0.60). No multiplicative interaction was detected between short or long sleep duration and trouble sleeping. The cross-sectional design limits the ability to draw causal inferences.

Sleep stages were determined by electroencephalogram recording, whereas energy expenditure was measured in a 1,000-liter Plexiglas sleep box constructed around a bed as a fast-response open-circuit indirect calorimeter. Eighty-five percent of the interindividual variability in SMR was explained by differences in fat-free mass, fat mass, age, sex, and race (r2 = 0.85).

A cross-sectional analysis of cardiovascular disease-free participants aged 20-79 years from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was conducted. The primary exposures were self-reported sleep duration, sleep debt (difference between the average weekday and weekend sleep duration), and ideal cardiovascular health (11-14 points).

From an evolutionary point of view, almost all animal species that have been investigated exhibit sleep or sleep-like states, suggesting that sleep may benefit survival. In certain mammalian and avian species, sleep can be further divided into at least two stages, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep. In addition to a widely conserved role for sleep, these individual sleep stages may have roles unique to these animals. The recent use of state-of-the-art techniques, including optogenetics and chemogenetics, has greatly broadened our understanding of the neural mechanisms of sleep regulation, allowing us to address the function of sleep.

The eight subjects with both 24-h and 12-h rhythms showed a minor peak of sleep propensity in the early afternoon followed by a though in the early evening (20.00 hours). Sleep propensity then rose rapidly at about midnight to a major peak in the early morning. This was followed by a second trough of sleep propensity in the late morning. The average times of the sleep propensity phases relative to the circadian temperature rhythm were very similar to the earlier free-running studies. Furthermore, the times of the sleep propensity phases were highly correlated with the body temperature minimum.

The nosemask was attached to a wide-bore (20 mm ID) rigid tube to allow a constant-bias flow of room air from a blower. Total airway occlusion was achieved by simultaneously inflating two rubber balloons fixed in the inspiratory and expiratory pipes. A total of 39 tests were done in stage III/IV nonrapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep in 11 subjects and 10 tests in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in 5 subjects. The duration of total occlusion tolerated before arousal from NREM sleep varied widely (range 0.9-67.0 s) with a mean duration of 20.4 +/- 2.3 (SE) s. The breathing response to occlusion in NREM sleep was characterised by a breath-by-breath progressive increase in suction pressure achieved by an increase in the rate of inspiratory pressure generation during inspiration. In contrast, during REM sleep, arousal invariably occurred after a short duration of airway occlusion (mean duration 6.2 +/- 1.2 s, maximum duration 11.8 s), and the occlusion induced a rapid shallow breathing pattern.

Leaders were surveyed about sleep knowledge, sleep attitudes, sleep training, sleep quantity, sleep quality and sleep problems. Unit members were surveyed about sleep leadership behaviors, sleep hours, sleep quality and sleep problems. Leaders rated the training highly and most knowledge and some attitudes about sleep improved from the baseline to post-training survey. Fewer leaders in the training condition reported sleep problems at follow-up than those in the waitlist control condition; there were no differences in sleep hours or sleep quality. More unit members with leaders in the training condition reported that their leaders engaged in sleep leadership behaviors at least sometimes and reported sleeping at least 7 hours/24 hours period than did unit members in the waitlist control condition; sleep quality and sleep problems did not differ by condition. Results suggest a simple training intervention targeting leaders may be able to shift sleep health and the cultural perspective on sleep across an organization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32651093/"}

During sleep, domestic chicks show brief periods during which one eye is open whilst the other remains shut. In this study, time spent in sleeping and in monocular-unihemispheric sleep (Mo-Un sleep) was investigated following the monocular learning of a spatial discrimination task. Two groups of experimental chicks from day 8 to day 11 post-hatching were trained in a spatial paradigm based on geometrical and topographical clues. One group performed the task with left eye open (LE-chicks), whilst another group performed the task with the right eye open (RE-chicks). LE-chick learned the task, whilst RE-chicks were unable to learn. Time spent in binocular sleep and right Mo-Un sleep (right eye closed and left hemisphere sleeping) was equal in both groups of chicks. Time spent in left Mo-Un sleep (left eye closed and right hemisphere sleeping) was significantly higher in LE-chicks than in RE-chicks. Laterality index reveals that LE-chicks had a significant bias towards more left Mo-Un sleep at any recording day, whilst RE-chicks showed a significant bias towards more right Mo-Un sleep at day 8 and 9 but not at days 10 and 11. RE-chick bias at days 8 and 9 could be attributed to a recovery process in left hemisphere connected to its activation/use effect during trials whilst recovery would be absent at days 10 and 11. LE-chicks bias would be associated with the formation of a spatial memory trace and with a recovery process in right hemisphere.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22349558/"}

The research team reviewed current guidelines and existing evidence to draft tailored guidelines. Seventeen individual guidelines, covering sleep scheduling, napping, sleep environment, bedtime routine, substances, light exposure, diet, and exercise were drafted. Experts from sleep, shift work, and occupational health fields (n = 155) were invited to review the draft guidelines using a Delphi methodology. In each round, experts voted on individual guidelines, with 70% agreement considered consensus. Where consensus was not reached, written feedback from experts was discussed and incorporated into subsequent iterations. Of the experts invited, 68 (44%) agreed to participate, with 55 (35%) completing the third (final) round. Most experts (84%) agreed that tailored guidelines were required for shift workers. Consensus was reached on all guidelines after three rounds. One additional guideline (sleep inertia) and an introductory statement were developed, resulting in a final set of 18 individual guidelines, termed \"healthy sleep practices for shift workers.\" This is the first study to develop tailored sleep hygiene guidelines for shift workers.

Evidence showed the need to implement prevention strategies mainly focused on lifestyle habits. Sleep hygiene is a variable of great interest and this review systematically examined the effects of sleep duration in increasing childhood obesity risk. A systematic literature review was conducted from December 2023 to February 2024. Study selection and data extraction procedures were performed in accordance with Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines and Statement, and risk of publication bias was assessed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Original works in English were eligible for review and eleven studies that met the inclusion criteria were included. Studies collected were heterogeneous in terms of duration, sample characteristics, hours of sleep manipulation, anthropometric and hematological parameters collected, therefore it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. A narrative synthesis of the reported evidence highlighted the impact of sleep duration above all on food intake, eating habits and hormone levels and consequently on the risk of childhood obesity development. This finding suggests the need to consider sleep hygiene as a modifiable lifestyle habit like diet and physical activity, in order to early prevent childhood obesity. Poor sleep hygiene can significantly contribute to weight gain and exacerbation of metabolic disorders linked to childhood obesity. Although more rigorous studies are needed, clinicians need to be aware of the role of sleep hygiene in reducing childhood obesity risk.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39363896/"}

Spontaneous experience over the sleep-wake cycle.", "text": "Whether we are awake or asleep is believed to mark a sharp divide between the types of conscious states we undergo in either behavioural state. Consciousness in sleep is often equated with dreaming and thought to be characteristically different from waking consciousness. Conversely, recent research shows that we spend a substantial amount of our waking lives mind wandering, or lost in spontaneous thoughts. Dreaming has been described as intensified mind wandering, suggesting that there is a continuum of spontaneous experience that reaches from waking into sleep. This challenges how we conceive of the behavioural states of sleep and wakefulness in relation to conscious states. I propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes different subtypes of spontaneous thoughts and experiences independently of their occurrence in sleep or waking. I apply this framework to selected findings from dream and mind-wandering research. I argue that to assess the relationship between spontaneous thoughts and experiences and the behavioural states of sleep and wakefulness, we need to look beyond dreams to consider kinds of sleep-related experience that qualify as dreamless. I conclude that if we consider the entire range of spontaneous thoughts and experiences, there appears to be variation in subtypes both within as well as across behavioural states. Whether we are sleeping or waking does not appear to strongly constrain which subtypes of spontaneous thoughts and experiences we undergo in those states. This challenges the conventional and coarse-grained distinction between sleep and waking and their putative relation to conscious states.

Airflow was measured with a pneumotachograph, and sleep state was determined by behavioral, electroencephalographic, and electromyographic criteria. We found that the degree of laryngeal stimulation required to produce arousal and coughing was higher in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep than in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Stimuli that failed to cause arousal from SWS often produced a single expiratory effort, or brief apnea (1--2 s) and bradycardia. In contrast, during REM sleep subarousal stimuli often resulted in prolonged apnea (greater than 10 s) and marked bradycardia. We conclude that during REM sleep arousal responses to laryngeal stimulation are depressed, but ventilatory and cardiac responses are intact.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/215583/"}
{"id": "21887239", "title": "Ostriches sleep like platypuses.", "text": "Mammals and birds engage in two distinct states of sleep, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. SWS is characterized by slow, high amplitude brain waves, while REM sleep is characterized by fast, low amplitude waves, known as activation, occurring with rapid eye movements and reduced muscle tone. However, monotremes (platypuses and echidnas), the most basal (or 'ancient') group of living mammals, show only a single sleep state that combines elements of SWS and REM sleep, suggesting that these states became temporally segregated in the common ancestor to marsupial and eutherian mammals. Whether sleep in basal birds resembles that of monotremes or other mammals and birds is unknown. Here, we provide the first description of brain activity during sleep in ostriches (Struthio camelus), a member of the most basal group of living birds. We found that the brain activity of sleeping ostriches is unique. Episodes of REM sleep were delineated by rapid eye movements, reduced muscle tone, and head movements, similar to those observed in other birds and mammals engaged in REM sleep; however, during REM sleep in ostriches, forebrain activity would flip between REM sleep-like activation and SWS-like slow waves, the latter reminiscent of sleep in the platypus. Moreover, the amount of REM sleep in ostriches is greater than in any other bird, just as in platypuses, which have more REM sleep than other mammals. These findings reveal a recurring sequence of steps in the evolution of sleep in which SWS and REM sleep arose from a single heterogeneous state that became temporally segregated into two distinct states. This common trajectory suggests that forebrain activation during REM sleep is an evolutionarily new feature, presumably involved in performing new sleep functions not found in more basal animals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21887239/"}

We collected self-reported nocturnal sleep duration (<5, 5 to <6, 6 to <7, 7 to <9, ≥9 h/night) and midday napping duration (≤5, 5 to ≤30, and >30 min). The sleep information was classified into different sleep patterns. The primary outcome was self-reported hearing loss events. Multivariate Cox regression models and restricted cubic splines were used to investigate the longitudinal association of sleep characteristics with hearing loss. We applied Cox generalized additive models and bivariate exposure-response surface diagrams to visualize the effects of different sleep patterns on hearing loss. We confirmed 1,073 cases of hearing loss (55.1% female) during the follow-up. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and health condition, nocturnal sleep with < 5 h was positively associated with hearing loss [hazard ratio (HR): 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20, 1.75]. Individuals with napping for 5 to ≤30 min had a 20% (HR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.63, 1.00) lower risk of hearing loss compared with those with napping ≤ 5 min. Restrictive cubic splines showed the reverse J-shaped association between nocturnal sleep and hearing loss. Moreover, we found significant joint effects of sleeping < 7 h/night and midday napping ≤ 5 min (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.52) on hearing loss. Bivariate exposure-response surface diagrams also reflected the finding that short sleep without napping existed the highest risk of hearing loss. Compared with persistently sleeping moderately (7-9 h/night), those who persistently slept < 7 h/night or shifted from < 7 h/night to moderate or > 9 h/night had higher risks of hearing loss. Inadequate nocturnal sleep was associated with an elevated risk of poor subjective hearing in middle-aged and older adults, while moderate napping decreased the risk of hearing loss.

Like other non-standard working time arrangements, on-call work disrupts sleep and can therefore have negative effects on health, safety and performance. Unlike other non-standard working time arrangements, on-call work often allows sleep opportunities between calls. Any sleep obtained during on-call periods will be beneficial for waking performance. However, there is evidence that sleep while on call may be of substantially reduced restorative value because of the expectation of receiving the call and apprehension about missing the call. In turn, waking from sleep to respond to a call may be associated with temporary increases in performance impairment. This is dependent on characteristics of both the preceding sleep, the tasks required upon waking and the availability and utility of any countermeasures to support the transition from sleep to wake. In this paper, we critically evaluate the evidence both for and against sleeping during on-call periods and conclude that some sleep, even if it is of reduced quality and broken by repeated calls, is a good strategy. We also note, however, that organisations utilising on-call working time arrangements need to systematically manage the likelihood that on-call sleep can be associated with temporary performance impairments upon waking. Given that the majority of work in this area has been laboratory-based, there is a significant need for field-based investigations of the magnitude of sleep inertia, in addition to the utility of sleep inertia countermeasures.

This paper presents evidence from a recent survey conducted in the GB rail industry, which enabled the sleep and wakefulness of railway workers to be quantified. There were 7807 responses to the survey, which represents a very large sample. Responses were primarily collected online, though paper copies were made available in some organisations. Respondents reported sleeping less when working nights, more when working days, and the most on days off, which suggests a feast-and-famine pattern of sleep. 41% were getting 6 h of sleep or less when working days, compared to 63% when working nights. Getting 6 h or less of sleep was associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.

Here we address these questions using an evolutionary agent-based model. The model is spatially explicit, with food and sleep sites distributed in two clusters on the landscape. Agents acquire food and sleep energy based on an internal circadian clock coded by 24 traits (one for each hour of the day) that correspond to \"genes\" that evolve by means of a genetic algorithm. These traits can assume three different values that specify the agents' behavior: sleep (or search for a sleep site), eat (or search for a food site), or flexibly decide action based on relative levels of sleep energy and food energy. Individuals with higher fitness scores leave more offspring in the next generation of the simulation, and the model can therefore be used to identify evolutionarily adaptive circadian clock parameters under different ecological conditions. We systematically varied input parameters related to the number of food and sleep sites, the degree to which food and sleep sites overlap, and the rate at which food patches were depleted. Our results reveal that: (1) the increased costs of traveling between more spatially separated food and sleep clusters select for monophasic sleep, (2) more rapid food patch depletion reduces sleep times, and (3) agents spend more time attempting to acquire the \"rarer\" resource, that is, the average time spent sleeping is positively correlated with the number of food patches and negatively correlated with the number of sleep patches. \"Flexible\" genes, in general, do not appear to be advantageous, though their arrangements in the agents' genome show characteristic patterns that suggest that selection acts on their distribution. Collectively, the output suggests that ecological factors can have striking effects on sleep patterns. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a simple model can produce clear and sensible patterns, thus allowing it to be used to investigate a wide range of questions concerning the ecology of sleep. Quantitative data presently are unavailable to test the model predictions directly, but patterns are consistent with comparative evidence from different species, and the model can be used to target ecological factors to investigate in future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18479523/"}

Haematocrits ranged from 48% to 64% [57.9 (5.6)%]. The amount of slow wave rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was similar to that reported in young lowlanders sleeping at sea level but very different to the disturbed sleep in visitors sleeping at high altitude. All the Peruvians showed episodes of periodic breathing and respiratory apnoeas [29 (15) night-1] resulting in marked arterial oxygen desaturation [81 (4.5)%; changes of 6 (2.5)%]. These events occurred either during stage 2 or REM sleep and were more frequent in those with lower haematocrits. The amount of wakefulness during the night was 2-3 times greater than would be expected in an age-matched lowland population at sea level. The awakenings were strongly associated with apnoeas (P < 0.02) but were negatively correlated with haematocrit, although this was only significant for seven of the subjects (P < 0.05).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8477682/"}

Sleep spindles represent a prominent example of a poorly understood transient brain oscillation that is impaired in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, the causal role of these bouts of thalamo-cortical oscillations remains unknown. Demonstrating a functional role of sleep spindles in cognitive processes has, so far, been hindered by the lack of a tool to target transient brain oscillations in real time. Here, we show, for the first time, selective enhancement of sleep spindles with non-invasive brain stimulation in humans. We developed a system that detects sleep spindles in real time and applies oscillatory stimulation. Our stimulation selectively enhanced spindle activity as determined by increased sigma activity after transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) application. This targeted modulation caused significant enhancement of motor memory consolidation that correlated with the stimulation-induced change in fast spindle activity. Strikingly, we found a similar correlation between motor memory and spindle characteristics during the sham night for the same spindle frequencies and electrode locations. Therefore, our results directly demonstrate a functional relationship between oscillatory spindle activity and cognition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27476602/"}

Analysis is performed separately during the total recording time and during the time when the patient sleeps on his back. We have compared the automatic analysis with the results obtained on simultaneous daytime polysomnograph naps in 55 subjects (snorers or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [OSAS] patients). The compressed graphs obtained automatically demonstrated a periodic breathing pattern in all 22 patients who presented sleep-related apneas at polygraphic recording. The cumulative distribution of oxygen saturation was not as steep in the apnea patients as in patients not showing apneas; in 19 of the 22 OSAS patients, the value was outside our normal limits (80 percent of the recording time inside 3.6 percent SaO2 variation band). The apnea index (AI) was 26.4 in manual and 23.3 in automatic analysis. Using the automatic method there were three false negative cases in the analysis of desaturations; in these patients periodic breathing was present in output graphs indicating need for further polygraphic assessment. The duration of apneas in the automatic analysis was shorter than in manual analysis, but the agreement was sufficient for screening purposes (mean error less than 3 s, mean duration of apneas 20.1 s). The automatic method is presently used in clinical routine for screening purposes, for assessment of the severity of the disorder and the type of treatment that a subject may need, in epidemiologic investigation and follow-up of the treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2752807/"}

Data from 9,251 children aged 11 to 15 years-old, 50.7% of which were boys, as part of the cross-national study 2011 HBSC were analyzed. Self-completion questionnaires were administered in classrooms. An estimate of TSTS and TSTN (week-ends and vacations) was calculated based on specifically designed sleep habits report. Sleep deprivation was estimated by a TSTN - TSTS difference >2 hours. Sleep initiating nsomnia was assessed according to International classification of sleep disorders (ICSD 2). Children who reported sleeping 7 hours or less per night were considered as short sleepers. A serious drop of TST was observed between 11 yo and 15 yo, both during the schooldays (9 hours 26 minutes vs. 7 h 55 min.; p<0.001) and at a lesser extent during week-ends (10 h 17 min. vs. 9 h 44 min.; p<0.001).

After sleeping according to their habitual schedule, nine short sleepers (sleep duration < 6 h) and eight long sleepers (> 9 h) were recorded half-hourly during approximately 40 h of wakefulness in a constant routine protocol. Within the frequency range of 0.25-20.0 Hz, spectral power density in the 5.25-9.0 and 17.25-18.0 Hz ranges was higher in short sleepers than in long sleepers. In both groups, increasing time awake was associated with an increase of theta/low-frequency alpha activity (5.25-9.0 Hz), whose kinetics followed a saturating exponential function. The time constant did not differ between groups and was similar to the previously obtained time constant of the wake-dependent increase of slow-wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz) in the sleep electroencephalogram. In addition, the time constant of the decrease of slow-wave activity during extended recovery sleep following the constant routine did not differ between groups. However, short sleepers showed an abiding enhancement of theta/low-frequency alpha activity during wakefulness after recovery sleep that was independent of the homeostatic process. It is concluded that, while the kinetics of the homeostatic process do not differ between the two groups, short sleepers live under and tolerate higher homeostatic sleep pressure than long sleepers. The homeostat-independent enhancement of theta/low-frequency alpha activity in the waking electroencephalogram in the short sleepers may be genetically determined or be the result of long-term adaptation to chronically short sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11226688/"}

Using phylogenetic methods that quantitatively situate human phenotypes within a broader primate comparative context, we investigated the evolution of human sleep architecture, focusing on: total sleep duration, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep duration, and proportion of sleep in REM. We used two different Bayesian methods: phylogenetic prediction based on phylogenetic generalized least squares and a multistate Onrstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) evolutionary model of random drift and stabilizing selection. Phylogenetic prediction confirmed that humans sleep less than predicted for a primate of our body mass, predation risk, brain size, foraging needs, sexual selection, and diet. These analyses further revealed that humans pack an unexpectedly higher proportion of REM sleep within a shorter overall sleep duration, and do so by reducing NREM sleep (rather than increasing REM). The OU model generally confirmed these findings, with shifts along the human lineage inferred for TST, NREM, and proportion of REM, but not for REM. We propose that the risks and opportunity costs of sleep are responsible for shorter sleep durations in humans, with risks arising from terrestrial sleep involving threats from predators and conspecifics, and opportunity costs because time spent sleeping could be used for learning, creating material objects, and socializing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29446072/"}

Recordings were made twice yearly on 4 consecutive nights: 2 nights with the subjects maintaining their ongoing school-night schedules, and 2 nights with time in bed extended to 12 h. As expected, school-night total sleep time declined with age. This decline was entirely produced by decreasing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep durations increased slightly but significantly. NREM and REM sleep durations also exhibited different age trajectories when sleep was extended. Both durations exceeded those on school-night schedules. However, the elevated NREM duration did not change with age, whereas REM durations increased significantly. We interpret the adolescent decline in school-night NREM duration in relation to our hypothesis that NREM sleep reverses changes produced in plastic brain systems during waking. The \"substrate\" produced during waking declines across adolescence, because synaptic elimination decreases the intensity (metabolic rate) of waking brain activity. Declining substrate reduces both NREM intensity (i.e., delta power) and NREM duration. The absence of a decline in REM sleep duration on school-night sleep and its age-dependent increase in extended sleep pose new challenges to understanding its physiological role. Whatever their ultimate explanation, these robust findings demonstrate that the two physiological states of human sleep respond differently to the maturational brain changes of adolescence. Understanding these differences should shed new light on both brain development and the functions of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22116514/"}

Outcomes included sleep continuity, architecture, and REM-related parameters across nights one through four. Intraclass correlation coefficients with mixed-effect variances and repeated-measure analysis of covariance were used, respectively, to determine short-term stability as well as between-participants and time-by-group interaction effects. Wake after sleep onset and stage 1 showed \"poor stability\" in the comorbid insomnia/nightmare group compared to \"moderate stability\" in the good sleeping controls and chronic insomnia alone group. Significant between-group effects (all ps < .05) showed that the comorbid insomnia/nightmare group took longer to fall asleep and had a greater first-night-effect in stage 1 compared to good sleeping controls and chronic insomnia alone group; in addition, the comorbid insomnia/nightmare and insomnia alone groups slept shorter, with fewer awakenings and REM periods, compared to the good sleeping controls. Nightmares are associated with abnormal sleep above and beyond REM disruption, as sleep continuity was the primary aspect in which poor stability and group differences emerged. The greater inability to fall asleep and instability of sleep fragmentation in those with comorbid insomnia/nightmares compared to chronic insomnia alone may be attributed to the impact of presleep anticipatory anxiety and nightmare-related distress itself.

Sleep, cognition, and epilepsy are closely associated. Therefore, many studies on epilepsy and cognition have focused on sleep structures, such as sleep spindles, which are considered windows to understanding the sleeping brain. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep spindles and the severity of cognitive impairment in adult epilepsy. Fifty-seven adults with epilepsy underwent overnight sleep electroencephalogram recordings and cognitive testing. Slow (9-12 Hz) and fast (12-15 Hz) spindle characteristics during N2 sleep were calculated using a convolutional neural network-based sleep staging system and automatic spindle detection algorithm. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in fast and slow spindle densities among subgroups of patients based on cognitive impairment severity. A significant between-group effect was observed for both slow and fast spindle densities. Multiple comparisons showed that slow and fast spindle densities of the severe cognitive impairment subgroup were lower than those of the noncognitive impairment subgroup (P < 0.05). Simple-effect analysis revealed differences in slow spindle density distributed among the EEG channels Fp1, Fp2, F3, C3, P4, O1, O2, F8, T4, T5, T6, Fz, and Cz (P < 0.05).

The new challenge is therefore to understand functions and mechanisms of processes, which so far have been mainly investigated in awake subjects. The current study focuses on dynamic changes of brain oscillations and connectivity patterns in response to environmental stimulation during non-REM sleep. Our results indicate that aurally presented names were processed and neuronally differentiated across the wake-sleep spectrum. Simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG signals revealed two distinct clusters of oscillatory power increase in response to the stimuli: (1) vigilance state-independent θ synchronization occurring immediately after stimulus onset, followed by (2) sleep-specific α/σ synchronization peaking after stimulus offset. We discuss the possible role of θ, α, and σ oscillations during non-REM sleep, and work toward a unified theory of brain rhythms and their functions during sleep.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has revealed (residual) capacity of the sleeping human brain to interact with the environment. How sensory processing is realized by the neural assemblies in different stages of sleep is however unclear. To tackle this question, we examined simultaneously recorded MEG and EEG data. We discuss the possible role of θ, α, and σ oscillations during non-REM sleep. In contrast to versatile θ band response that reflected early stimulus processing step, succeeding α and σ band activity was sensitive to the saliency of the incoming information, and contingent on the sleep stage. Our findings suggest that the specific reorganization of mechanisms involved in later stages of sensory processing takes place upon falling asleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35508383/"}

However, for sleep and/or rest periods, the only pacemakers currently on the market that slow the pacing rate utilize an internal timer to determine a decrease in pacing rate. It would be advantageous if the pacing rate could be automatically lowered during periods of sleep or rest. This study utilized a rate responsive sensor, MV, to track the patient's sleeping and resting periods and to decrease the pacing rate at such times. A total of eight patients implanted with Sentri 1210 single chamber MV sensor pacemakers were studied. A sleep rate (SR) of 45 beats/min was selected. A sleep rate response function, which indicated the relationship between changes in MV and corresponding heart rate, was initially set at a value of 16 and continually and automatically updated in a 3-month study. Adaptation was based on the premise that 3 hours per day should be spent at the SR. The average decrease in pacing rates from onset to 3 month for the eight patients was 12.4% +/- 5.3%. Correspondingly, the histograms of the lowest datalog histogram (40-59 beats/min) increased from 0% to 15.4% +/- 0.9% of paced beats. Correlation between the patients' 24-hour diary and Holter recordings showed that the pacing rates during sleep were consistently lower than when the patients were awake and active. This was also the case with a patient whose nocturnal and daily routine was intentionally altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7845793/"}

This systematic review summarizes the characteristics and effectiveness of interventions aiming to stimulate healthy sleeping in a general population of school-aged children. The search engines PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Database Library were systematically searched up to March 2016. We included all studies evaluating interventions targeting healthy sleep duration and/or bedtime routines of children aged 4–12 years. All steps in this systematic review, i.e. search, study selection, quality assessment and data extraction, were performed following CRD Guidelines and reported according to the PRISMA Statement. Eleven studies were included, of which only two were of strong quality. The interventions varied in terms of targeted determinants and intervention setting. Overall, no evidence was found favoring a particular intervention strategy. One intervention that delayed school start time and two multi-behavioral interventions that targeted both the school and home setting showed promising effects in terms of increasing sleep duration. Due to few high quality studies, evidence for the effectiveness of any particular intervention strategy to stimulate healthy sleep in children is still inconclusive. However, the more effective interventions in stimulating healthy sleep duration and adherence to regular bedtimes were mostly multi-behavioral interventions that included creating daily healthy routines and combined intervention settings (e.g. home and school).

During the first night, subjects underwent standard polysomnography without the M40 mask. The second night entailed sleeping while wearing the mask, without the hood. Specific variables measured on each night included sleep stage distribution, time awake, number of awakenings, oxygen saturation, number of apneas and hypopneas, and time to sleep onset. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed, paired t-test for all variables except REM sleep, for which a one-tailed, paired t-test was used. There was a significant difference between mask and non-mask nights when measuring total sleep time, total awake time, percentage of time in REM, and number of awakenings.

The mechanism(s), prevalence and role of periodic breathing in acclimatized lowlanders at high altitude are contrasted with the available data from adapted indigenous populations (e.g. Andean and Tibetan highlanders). It is concluded that (1) periodic breathing persists with acclimatization in lowlanders and the severity is proportional to sleeping altitude; (2) periodic breathing does not seem to coalesce with poor sleep quality such that, with acclimatization, there appears to be a lengthening of cycle length and minimal impact on the average sleeping oxygen saturation; and (3) high altitude adapted highlanders appear to demonstrate a blunting of periodic breathing, compared to lowlanders, comprising a feature that withstands the negative influences of chronic mountain sickness. These observations indicate that periodic breathing persists with high altitude acclimatization with no obvious negative consequences; however, periodic breathing is attenuated with high altitude adaptation and therefore potentially reflects an adaptive trait to this environment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38534039/"}

The organization of their sleep differs immensely from adult sleep, and its quick maturation and fundamental changes correspond to the rapid cortical development at this age. Manual sleep classification is specifically challenging in this population given major body movements and frequent shifts between vigilance states; in addition various staging criteria co-exist. In the present study we utilized a machine learning approach and investigated how EEG complexity and sleep stages evolve during the very first weeks of life. We analyzed 42 full-term infants which were recorded twice (at week two and five after birth) with full polysomnography. For sleep classification EEG signal complexity was estimated using multi-scale permutation entropy and fed into a machine learning classifier. Interestingly the baby's brain signal complexity (and spectral power) revealed developmental changes in sleep in the first 5 weeks of life, and were restricted to NREM (\"quiet\") and REM (\"active sleep\") states with little to no changes in state wake. Data demonstrate that our classifier performs well over chance (i.e., >33% for 3-class classification) and reaches almost human scoring accuracy (60% at week-2, 73% at week-5). Altogether, these results demonstrate that characteristics of newborn sleep develop rapidly in the first weeks of life and can be efficiently identified by means of machine learning techniques.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31661522/"}

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the actual situation and interrelationships between night waking and other sleep problems in Japanese 4-month -old infant. The subjects were 194 mothers and infants who participated in health checkups at four months after delivery in Fukuoka City. The questionnaire consisted of 3 components: 1) infant's and mother's sleep practices and sleep problems; 2) coping behavior for infant's sleep; 3) perceptions of child-care and maternal health. Their responses were linked to health checkup's results. The subjects were divided into two groups; Waking Group (n = 111) who was wakening one or more times from 0-6 a.m. and Sleeping Group (n = 83) who was sleeping throughout the night. The proportion of Waking Group was constituted 57.2% in all infants. Infant's growth, sleep, and sleep problems were compared between two groups. The mean infant's bedtime was 10:28 p.m., and the proportion of infants reported to go to bed at 10 p.m. or later was 69.4%. The proportion of infants with irregular bedtimes was 16.5%. Twenty-eight point six percent of infants had sleep problems like difficulty settling, severe night waking and were suspected to be high risk of sleep disorders. Infants in the Waking Group were found to have more numbers of sleep problems than in the Sleeping Group. The proportion with difficulty settling was higher in the Waking Group.

Despite long hours of oneiric activity, and high individual differences in dream recall, dreams are lost into oblivion. Here, we conceptualize dreaming and dream amnesia as inherent aspects of the reactive and predictive homeostatic functions of sleep. Mental activity during sleep conforms to the interplay of restorative processes and future anticipation, and particularly during the second half of the night, it unfolds as a special form of non-constrained, self-referent, and future-oriented cognitive process. Awakening facilitates constrained, goal-directed prospection that competes for shared neural resources with dream production and dream recall, and contributes to dream amnesia. We present the neurophysiological aspects of reactive and predictive homeostasis during sleep, highlighting the putative role of cortisol in predictive homeostasis and forgetting dreams.

First, the activity data collected by PLUS CYCLE® were compared with the observation data in a video of hospitalized dogs (n = 9). We determined the correlation between the total hours of physical activity, Sleeping/Resting time and amount of physical activity collected by PLUS CYCLE®, and the time when body movements could not be confirmed (inactive time) recorded by video. There was a strong correlation between the inactive time observed in the videos and the Sleeping/Resting time in PLUS CYCLE® (p < 0.0001, r = 0.95).

A total of 194 middle-aged individuals aged 45 to 59 years participated in this study. The Chinese version of the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess the QOL and sleep quality, respectively. The relationship between sleep patterns and QOL was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Improvement in sleep disturbances and reduction in the use of sleeping medications are necessary conditions for enhancing QOL. Two configurations of sleep patterns positively influence QOL: the \"sufficiency type\" with high level of sleep duration, non-sleep disturbances, and non-daytime dysfunction as core conditions; and the \"efficiency type\" with high habitual sleep efficiency and non-daytime dysfunction as core conditions. Three configurations of sleep patterns negatively influence QOL: the \"low-quality type\" with non-high-level subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, and habitual sleep efficiency as core conditions; the \"barrier type\" with high level of sleep disturbances, non-high-level sleep latency, and non-high-level subjective sleep quality/sleep duration as core conditions; and the \"drug-based type\" with high level of use of sleeping medications and subjective sleep quality as core conditions. Using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method, this study initially reveals that the influence of sleep patterns on QOL in middle-aged individuals is a holistic effect combining multiple elements. This deepens and enriches the understanding of the relationship between sleep patterns and QOL and expands new perspectives for more in-depth research on how to improve the QOL of middle-aged individuals through sleep interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39496044/"}

Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review to evaluate the evidence on the effects of sleep deprivation on endothelial function (EF). This review adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and was pre-registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42020192485, 07/24/2020).

Two investigators independently performed the literature search, study selection, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, and qualitative data synthesis. Out of 3571 articles identified, 24 articles were included in the systematic review. Main findings include the following: (1) shorter sleep duration is associated with lower macrovascular EF; (2) not sleeping 7-9 h/night is linked with impaired microvascular EF; (3) sleep restriction impairs micro- and macrovascular EF; (4) acute total sleep deprivation impairs micro- and macrovascular EF but data on macrovascular EF are less consistent; and (5) shift work impairs macrovascular EF.

Notably, 'poor comprehenders' (children with reading comprehension deficits but intact word reading) often have vocabulary deficits, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Prior research suggests intact encoding but difficulties consolidating new word knowledge. We test the hypothesis that poor comprehenders' sleep-associated vocabulary consolidation is compromised by their impoverished lexical-semantic knowledge. Memory for new words was tracked across wake and sleep to assess encoding and consolidation in 8-to-12-year-old good and poor comprehenders. Each child participated in two sets of sessions, one beginning in the morning (AM-encoding) and the other in the evening (PM-encoding). In each case, they were taught 12 words and were trained on a spatial memory task. Memory was assessed immediately, 12- and 24-hr later via stem-completion, picture-naming, and definition tasks to probe different aspects of word knowledge. Long-term retention was assessed 1-2 months later. Recall of word-forms improved over sleep and postsleep wake, as measured in both stem-completion and picture-naming tasks. Counter to hypotheses, deficits for poor comprehenders were not observed in consolidation but instead were seen across measures and throughout testing, suggesting a deficit from encoding. Variability in vocabulary knowledge across the whole sample predicted sleep-associated consolidation, but only when words were learned early in the day and not when sleep followed soon after learning. Poor comprehenders showed weaker memory for new words than good comprehenders, but sleep-associated consolidation benefits were comparable between groups. Sleeping soon after learning had long-lasting benefits for memory and may be especially beneficial for children with weaker vocabulary. These results provide new insights into the breadth of poor comprehenders' vocabulary weaknesses, and ways in which learning might be better timed to remediate vocabulary difficulties.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32367542/"}

We studied the EMG activity of three laryngeal muscles in five trained dogs, two of which were completely intact, and three of which had a previously-formed side-hole tracheal stoma. Pairs of electrodes were implanted chronically into the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA), a laryngeal dilator, cricothyroid (CT), and thyroarytenoid (TA), a laryngeal adductor. EMG electrodes were also inserted into the costal portion of the diaphragm. In wakefulness (W), slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep the EMGs of the PCA and CT muscles increased in intensity during diaphragm activation, with varying levels of basal activity during expiration. However, the greatest levels of inspiratory activity in PCA and CT during sleep were found in REM sleep, usually in the absence of augmented diaphragm EMG activity. This laryngeal muscle activity was associated with laryngeal dilation. There were also marked state-related changes in the level of activity of CT during expiration, suggestive of changes in the degree of expiratory adduction of the larynx. The adductor muscles (TA) were not active during expiration, except during alert W. There were no consistent differences in respiratory activity of the laryngeal muscles between the two intact dogs and those with a tracheal stoma (whether or not an endotracheal tube was in place), nor was laryngeal muscle activity affected by the subsequent creation of a tracheal stoma in the two intact dogs.

Nevertheless, scalp electrode sensors are resource intensive and poorly tolerated by sleeping patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential usability of in-the-ear electroencephalography to implement auditory closed-loop stimulation during sleep. For this, we evaluated the agreement between slow oscillation recordings obtained through the in-ear sensor and those obtained simultaneously from standard scalp electrodes during naps of 13 healthy subjects. We found that in-ear activity provided enough information to automatically detect sleep slow oscillations in real-time. Based on this, we successfully enhanced scalp slow oscillations using auditory single-cycle closed-loop brain-state-dependent stimulation based on in-ear signals acquired in 11 further subjects. We conclude that in-ear sensors provide a feasible technology for the enhancement of sleep patterns, and could pave the way for new clinical applications in the near future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35124848/"}

The dogs had been prepared with a permanent side-hole tracheostomy and bilateral cervical vagal loops. During the studies, the dogs breathed through a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted through the tracheostomy. To monitor changes in tracheal smooth muscle tone, we measured the pressure in the water-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube. The technique was validated by examining changes in cuff pressure after administration to the dogs of a series of chemical agents and physiologic stimuli known to constrict or relax tracheobronchial smooth muscle. Sleep state of the dogs was determined by behavioral, electroencephalographic, and electromyographic criteria. During quiet wakefulness, tracheal smooth muscle tone was stable. With the onset and progression of sleep through the nonrapid-eye movement stages, airway smooth muscle tone relaxed (decrease in cuff pressure of 20 to 40 cm H2O), reaching a new steady level during slow-wave sleep. In contrast, during rapid-eye-movement sleep, tracheal smooth muscle tone fluctuated markedly and erratically, as reflected by changes in cuff pressure as large as 90 cm H2O. Partial blockade of the vagus nerves, by cooling the exteriorized cervical vagal loops, decreased or abolished the fluctuations in tracheal smooth muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement sleep at temperatures that did not abolish resting tone, demonstrating that the changes in tone during rapid-eye-movement sleep were related to variability in neural control of airway smooth muscle.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/217288/"}

This approximately 200-gram bathyergid rodent shows a nocturnal circadian rhythm, but sleep in this species is yet to be investigated. Using telemetric recordings of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) in conjunction with video recordings, we were able to show that the Cape mole rat, like all other rodents, has sleep periods composed of both rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave (non-REM) sleep. These mole rats spent on average 15.4 h awake, 7.1 h in non-REM sleep and 1.5 h in REM sleep each day. Cape mole rats sleep substantially less than other similarly sized terrestrial rodents but have a similar percentage of total sleep time occupied by REM sleep. In addition, the duration of both non-REM and REM sleep episodes was markedly shorter in the Cape mole rat than has been observed in terrestrial rodents. Interestingly, these features (total sleep time and episode duration) are similar to those observed in another subterranean bathyergid mole rat, i.e. Fukomys mechowii. Thus, there appears to be a bathyergid type of sleep amongst the rodents that may be related to their environment and the effect of this on their circadian rhythm. Investigating further species of bathyergid mole rats may fully define the emerging picture of sleep in these subterranean African rodents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27088160/"}

On the following three evenings placebo (Placebo I) was given, then 2 mg of flunitrazepam for the ensuing three nights and placebo again (Placebo II) for the last three nights. Thus, 90 investigation nights could be evaluated. 1. Latency times until the patients fell asleep and up to the first deep sleep were reduced significantly by the active preparation. Latency times up to the first REM-phase were prolonged. 2. The frequency of nocturnal awakenings was lessened significantly. Thus, disturbances in sleeping continuously disappeared for the duration of the treatment. Duration of wakefulness after having woken during the night decreased considerably. 3. Duration of wakefulness during the total night was reduced considerably, deeper sleep stages, such as D (stage III) and E(stage IV) were prolonged. 4. Duration of the REM-phases was reduced slightly. This reduction was not significant according to the t-test. 5. According to these results, the preparation showed a clear effect. A placebo-effect can be excluded, since the improvements mentioned were not found when placebo was given before administration of the medication and afterwards (Placebo I and II). 6.

Cephalometric measurements were obtained with subjects awake in the same position for both experimental conditions. UA critical pressure (Pcrit) was derived from the relationship between the breath-by-breath values of the maximal inspiratory airflow and the corresponding mask pressure. Pcrit was significantly less negative during MO than during MC (MO, -12.7 +/- 4.8 cm H2O; MC, -16.4 +/- 6 cm H2O, mean +/- SD; p = 0.03).

Unlike the rabbit, the pig, or the human mother, sleep has been claimed as an essential state for milk ejection in mother rats, where sleep deprivation using gentle handling (GH) prevents milk ejection and pup weight gain. Though sleep deprivation is a stressful situation itself, most common methodologies used in laboratory animals, including GH, usually involve aversive stimulus to prevent sleep, adding further stress to the animal. Deep brain electrical stimulation (DBES) of the brainstem reticular formation is a less common technique used to prevent sleep, and while this methodology may also carry unwanted effects, it avoids stressful conditions. In the present study, we examined the relationship between sleep and nursing, and how different sleep deprivation methodologies impact nursing and lactation. For this purpose, we carried out two sets of experiments. First, we correlated sleep and waking states with different nursing parameters of lactating rats under undisturbed conditions. Second, we slept deprived another group of mother rats using two different techniques: GH and DBES. Our main findings show that sleeping time was positively correlated with the time devote to nurse the pups, but not either with milk ejection or pup weight gain. When mother rats were sleep deprived, maternal behavior was fragmented using both methods, but was substantially more disrupted when using GH. Additionally, lactating dams were capable of ejecting milk and their pups gained weight despite of being sleep deprived using both techniques, but these parameters were significantly reduced using GH compared to control values, while DBES did not differ from control group. Overall, these results suggest that sleep and nursing are behaviorally compatible, but in disagreement with previous findings, we concluded that sleep is not necessary for milk ejection.

It is also unknown whether prior sleep buffers the impact of sleep restriction on anxiety symptoms.

Healthy sleeping adults (n = 73) completed measures of inhibition, anxiety symptoms, and sleep before and after one night of sleep restriction (4 h between 4:00am and 8:00am). Results indicate significant associations between decreased post-sleep restriction inhibition and increased post-sleep restriction RNT and obsessions. Prior night's subjective and objective sleep efficiency significantly moderated these relations, such that the highest post-sleep restriction anxiety symptoms were reported by those with the lowest post-sleep restriction inhibition and the lowest pre-sleep restriction sleep efficiency. These findings suggest decreased inhibition may be one mechanism by which sleep loss affects anxiety, and those with worse sleep prior to acute sleep loss may be particularly vulnerable.

The cholinergic system of the basal forebrain (BF) is hypothesized to play an important role in behavioural and electrocortical arousal. Adenosine has been proposed as a sleep-promoting substance that induces sleep by inhibiting cholinergic neurons of the BF and brainstem. However, adenosinergic influences on the activity of BF neurons in naturally awake and sleeping animals have not been demonstrated. 2. We recorded the sleep-wake discharge profile of BF neurons and simultaneously assessed adenosinergic influences on wake- and sleep-related activity of these neurons by delivering adenosinergic agents adjacent to the recorded neurons with a microdialysis probe. Discharge rates of BF neurons were recorded through two to three sleep-wake episodes during baseline (artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion), and after delivering an adenosine transport inhibitor (s-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine; NBTI), or exogenous adenosine, or a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dimethylxanthine; CPDX). 3. NBTI and adenosine decreased the discharge rate of BF neurons during both waking and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In contrast, CPDX increased the discharge rate of BF neurons during both waking and NREM sleep. These results suggest that in naturally awake and sleeping animals, adenosine exerts tonic inhibitory influences on BF neurons, supporting the hypothesized role of adenosine in sleep regulation. 4. However, in the presence of exogenous adenosine, NBTI or CPDX, BF neurons retained their wake- and sleep-related discharge patterns, i.e. still exhibited changes in discharge rate during transitions between waking and NREM sleep. This suggests that other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators also contribute to the sleep-wake discharge modulation of BF neurons.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10601498/"}

The foundation of sleep and wake promotion is laid primarily by the \"fast-acting\" neurotransmitters: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for sleep and glutamate for wake. External to these primary systems are a host of modulatory systems that are characterized by two flip-flop switches of mutually inhibitory neurotransmitter systems that facilitate transitions between wake and sleep as well as non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and REM sleep. Additional mechanisms are in place to help coordinate the sleep-wake states with environmental, metabolic, and behavioral demands. The complexity of the evolutionarily preserved sleep-wake and circadian systems, the proportion of the day dedicated to the natural sleeping period, as well as the neurocognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration caused by deficient sleep highlight the importance of defining, assessing, and optimizing the sleep health of our patients and ourselves. Exciting discoveries continue to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of sleep and wake state coordination, reinforcing fundamental healthy practices and paving the way for new interventions that preserve and promote optimal neurologic health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756225/"}

Latencies of the principal response components were found to decrease with log age, i.e., change was most rapid during the first year of life. From 15 days of age to 3 years, mean latencies decreased as follows: P2 from 230 to 150, N2 from 535 to 320 and P3 from 785 to 625 msec. Variance was quite high, especially at younger ages. The fact that decreases in the latencies of the various components proceeded at different rates suggest that the components reflect quasi-independent neural substrates. The components of shortest latency displayed the weakest relationship to age. Findings with respect to latency for the subset of data obtained during stage 2 sleep were similar to those for the total population which contained responses recorded during several sleep stages. The amplitude of AEP components increased with age with the exception of N1P2 which decreased. Observations with regard to amplitude held both for the overall data recorded during several sleep stages and stage 2 data for components N0P1, N1P2 and N2P3. The amplitude trends for P1N1 and P2N2 were, however, not significant for the stage 2 subset. The maturation of the morphology of the AEP was characterized by a relative increase in the prominence of long latency components. The most striking change was the development of P3. High amplitude, V shaped P3 waves were also associated with stage 3-4 sleep. The changes which were delineated by this study for infancy and early childhood appear to be continuations of developmental trends reported for premature infants and neonates. AEPs are a reliable elicited measure which correlate well with maturation. They, therefore, can be a useful tool both in the study of central nervous system development and in the diagnosis of sensory and neurologic abnormalities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/50197/"}

De novo acquisition of reflex stimulus-response associations was shown possible both in man and animal. Whether sleep allows more sophisticated forms of learning remains unclear. We recorded during diurnal Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep auditory magnetoencephalographic (MEG) frequency-tagged responses mirroring ongoing statistical learning. While in NREM sleep, participants were exposed at non-awakenings thresholds to fast auditory streams of pure tones, either randomly organized or structured in such a way that the stream statistically segmented in sets of 3 elements (tritones). During NREM sleep, only tone-related frequency-tagged MEG responses were observed, evidencing successful perception of individual tones. No participant showed tritone-related frequency-tagged responses, suggesting lack of segmentation. In the ensuing wake period however, all participants exhibited robust tritone-related responses during exposure to statistical (but not random) streams. Our data suggest that associations embedded in statistical regularities remain undetected during NREM sleep, although implicitly learned during subsequent wakefulness. These results suggest intrinsic limitations in de novo learning during NREM sleep that might confine the NREM sleeping brain's learning capabilities to simple, elementary associations.

The mechanism by which the nonprone sleeping position reduces the rate of sudden infant death syndrome is unclear for full-term infants and the precise effect of sleeping position on sleep and cardiorespiratory characteristics has never been addressed in preterm infants. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the effect of sleeping position on sleep and cardiorespiratory characteristics in preterm infants at an age when they are ready for discharge. Sixteen asymptomatic preterm infants were studied in both supine and prone sleeping positions at 36.5 +/- 0.6 weeks' postconceptional age using videosomnography. Sleep, respiratory, and heart rate characteristics were compared between the two positions using each infant as his/her own control. More awakenings (ie, arousals >/=60 seconds) were seen during all sleep states in the supine sleeping position but overall the total sleep and percent sleep state were not affected by sleeping position. After each feeding, the first quiet sleep was significantly shorter, with more heart rate variability and awakenings in the supine position. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of arousals (<60 seconds) or the incidence or severity of apnea and periodic breathing. No clinically significant apnea (>/=15 seconds), bradycardia, or oxygen desaturations were seen. In 36-week-postconceptional age preterm infants, the supine sleeping position had less quiet sleep and was associated with greater heart rate variability during the first sleep cycle after the feeding. More awakenings were seen during all sleep states in the supine position. These data support the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for \"Back to Sleep\" for asymptomatic preterm infants because more awakenings and lower threshold for arousal may provide some benefit for the infant responding to a life-threatening event. However, further studies are needed to address positional effect on the physiologic measures in preterm infants at older ages (later stages of development). Precisely what constitutes the most healthy or advantageous sleep for newborn infants remains an important question.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10049964/"}

Here, we compare sleep depth and efficiency and night-time positional behavior between a large-bodied cercopithecoid (Papio papio) and a large-bodied hominoid (Pongo spp.) at the Indianapolis Zoo. We used infrared videography to assess nightly sleep and awake behavioral states, gross body movements, and postures in baboons (N = 45 nights) and orangutans (N = 128 nights). We calculated the total waking time, total sleep time, sleep fragmentation (the number of brief awakenings ≥2 min/h), sleep motor activity (number of motor activity bouts per hour), sleep efficiency (sleep duration/time in bed), and percentage of time spent in each posture. By every measure, orangutans experienced overall deeper, more efficient sleep. Baboons were more likely to sleep in guarded, upright positions (weight bearing on their ischial callosities) and never opted to use additional materials to augment sleep environments, whereas orangutans slept in insouciant, relaxed positions on constructed sleeping materials.

However, how wild animals maintain sleep homeostasis and how socio-ecological pressures interfere with their sleep remain understudied. Here, we investigated sleep homeostasis and the factors that influence sleep duration among wild Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii), leveraging a comprehensive long-term dataset of their behavior, sociality, and ecology. We quantified sleep in 53 adult individuals using the time that an individual spent in a sleeping nest-i.e., its sleep period-as an indicator of time spent sleeping. We found that, after shorter nighttime sleep periods, orangutans' next-day cumulative nap period duration was longer and that shorter nap periods were associated with a higher number of naps on the same day. We also found that orangutans had shorter sleep periods (night and day) when they associated with more conspecifics. Orangutans also had shorter nighttime sleep periods when they traveled farther the day before, and they had longer cumulative nap periods on days when (1) they ate fewer calories, (2) the ambient temperature was cooler, and (3) it rained. Our results suggest that multiple factors shape wild orangutans' sleep behavior and that orangutans compensate for lost sleep via daytime napping.

However, how sleep-related activity within the brain's largest sensorimotor structure, the cerebellum, is multiplexed with well-described sleep-related mechanisms in regions such as the hippocampus remains unknown. We therefore simultaneously recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and three distinct regions of the cerebellum (Crus I, lobule VI, and lobules II/III) in male mice during natural sleep. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations were found to be coordinated between these structures in a sleep stage-specific manner. During non-REM sleep, prominent δ frequency coherence was observed between lobule VI and hippocampus, whereas non-REM-associated hippocampal sharp-wave ripple activity evoked discrete LFP modulation in all recorded cerebellar regions, with the shortest latency effects in lobule VI. We also describe discrete phasic sharp potentials (PSPs), which synchronize across cerebellar regions and trigger sharp-wave ripple suppression. During REM, cerebellar δ phase significantly modulated hippocampal theta frequency, and this effect was greatest when PSPs were abundant. PSPs were phase-locked to cerebellar δ oscillation peak and hippocampal theta oscillation trough, respectively. Within all three cerebellar regions, prominent LFP oscillations were observed at both low (δ, <4 Hz) and very high frequencies (∼250 Hz) during non-REM and REM sleep. Intracerebellar cross-frequency analysis revealed that δ oscillations modulate those in the very high-frequency range. Together, these results reveal multiple candidate physiological mechanisms to support \"offline,\" bidirectional interaction within distributed cerebello-hippocampal networks.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep is associated with widespread coordination of activity across a range of brain regions. However, little is known about how activity within the largest sensorimotor region of the brain, the cerebellum, is both intrinsically organized and links with higher-order structures, such as the hippocampus, during sleep. By making multisite local field potential recordings in naturally sleeping mice, we reveal and characterize multiple sleep stage-specific physiological mechanisms linking three distinct cerebellar regions with the hippocampus. Central to these physiological mechanisms is a prominent δ (<4 Hz) oscillation, which temporally coordinates both intracerebellar and cerebello-hippocampal network dynamics. Understanding this distributed network activity is important for gaining insight into cerebellar contributions to sleep-dependent processes, such as memory consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35091502/"}

Nine healthy adults (4 female, 5 male) slept with a mask glued to the face with medical silicone rubber and breathed from a closed valveless biased flow circuit, including an in-line bag-in-box and a variable soda-lime absorber. Progressive hypoxia was induced by consumption of oxygen and by gradual replacement of circuit volume with nitrogen. Tidal volume was measured by electrical integration of the flow signal from a pneumotach on the box. Arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured with an ear oximeter and end-tidal CO2 tension (PetCO2) was measured continuously and kept constant by variable absorption. Sleep state was identified using standard criteria with 2 channels each of EEG, submental EMG, and EOG. There was marked variability in arousal level both in NREM and REM sleep, with subjects failing to awaken by 70% SaO2, our previously agreed safety limit, on 12 of 26 NREM tests, and 7 of 15 REM tests. During wakefulness, the mean slope +/- SEM of the ventilatory response to hypoxia was 0.68 +/- 0.07 L/min% SaO2 (n = 36, mean PetCO2 = 37.0 mmHg). In NREM sleep, this response decreased to a mean of 0.42 +/- 0.06 L/min/% SaO2 (n = 26, mean PetCO2 = 37.2 mmHg). In REM sleep, the average ventilatory response was further decreased to 0.33 +/- 0.06 L/min/% SaO2 (n = 15, mean PetCO2 = 37.8 mmHg). Analysis of variance showed a significant state-dependent effect on ventilatory response (p less than 0.01). The wake-NREM and wake-REM differences were significantly different (p less than 0.05), but the NREM-REM difference was not (p greater than 0.2).

{"id": "16876583", "title": "Mechanisms and functions of coupling between sleep and temperature rhythms.", "text": "Energy metabolism is strongly linked to the circadian rhythms in sleep and body temperature. Both heat production and heat loss show a circadian modulation. Sleep preferably occurs during the circadian phase of decreased heat production and increased heat loss, the latter due to a profound increase in skin blood flow and, consequently, skin warming. The coupling of these rhythms may differ depending on whether they are assessed in experimental laboratory studies or in habitual sleeping conditions. In habitual sleeping conditions, skin blood flow is for a prolonged time increased to a level hardly ever seen during wakefulness. Possible mechanisms linking the rhythms in sleep and core body and skin temperature are discussed, with a focus on causal effects of changes in core and skin temperature on sleep regulation. It is shown that changes in skin temperature rather than in core temperature causally affect sleep propensity. Contrary to earlier suggestions of a functional role of sleep in heat loss, it is argued that sleep facilitates a condition of increased skin blood flow during a prolonged circadian phase, yet limits heat loss and the risk of hypothermia. Sleep-related behavior including the creation of an isolated microclimate of high temperature by means of warm clothing and bedding in humans and the curling up, huddling and cuddling in animals all help limit heat loss The increase in skin blood flow that characterizes the sleeping period may thus not primarily reflect a thermoregulatory drive. There is indirect support for an alternative role of the prolonged period of increased skin blood flow: it may support maintenance of the skin as a primary barrier in host defense.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16876583/"}

Spindles are defined as waxing and waning rhythmic waves at 7-14 Hz that recur periodically every 3-10 s. Spindling originates in the thalamus, but a role for the cerebral cortex in triggering and synchronizing thalamic spindles was shown by stimulation of the contralateral cortex avoiding antidromic activation of thalamocortical axons and by diminished coherency of thalamic spindles after hemidecortication. Spontaneous spindles under barbiturate anesthesia are waxing and waning but under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia or when evoked by strong stimuli spindle waves are almost exclusively waning, i.e. they start with maximum amplitude and then decrease progressively. Waxing and waning of spindles has been ascribed to progressive entrainment of units into the oscillation followed by a progressive desynchronization. Therefore, exclusively waning spindles would be produced by an initial high synchrony in the corticothalamic network. Such a situation is observable upon strong stimulation or, spontaneously, when spindles are paced by the slow cortical oscillation and preceded by a strong corticothalamic drive. We have conducted experiments in naturally sleeping cats to verify the occurrence of two patterns of spindle oscillations and to test the role of the cortex in synchronizing and shaping spindles. We have found that indeed two types of spindles (waxing and waning or mostly waning) occur in naturally sleeping animals. We also demonstrate that during cortical spreading depression spindles are less synchronous and only of the waxing and waning type. As cortical activity recovers, waning spindles reappear and are preceded by electroencephalogram deflections which are related to corticothalamic depolarizing inputs. Our results strongly support the hypothesis of the role of the cerebral cortex in shaping and synchronizing thalamically generated spindles.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9130774/"}

Ten infants were excluded from the study, because they woke up during the challenge.

Auditory challenges induced significantly less overall changes in heart rate, less heart rate drops, less heart rate variability, as well as fewer and shorter central apneas in the prone than in the supine position. Autoregressive power spectral analysis of the heart rate was consistent with a possible increase in orthosympathetic tone in the prone position.

Given the integral role circadian rhythms play in regulating sleep, circadian mechanisms may account in part for sleep-substance abuse interactions. Furthermore, a burgeoning research base supports a role for the circadian system in regulating reward processing, indicating that circadian mechanisms may be directly linked to substance abuse independently of sleep pathways.

Although LPO is needed for NREM sleep, we found that calcium signals were, surprisingly, highest in REM sleep. Furthermore, and equally surprising, NMDA receptors in LPO were the main drivers of excitation. Deleting the NMDA receptor GluN1 subunit from LPO abolished calcium signals in all cells and produced insomnia. Mice of both sexes had highly fragmented NREM sleep-wake patterns and could not generate conventionally classified REM sleep. The sleep phenotype produced by deleting NMDA receptors depended on where in the hypothalamus the receptors were deleted. Deleting receptors from the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) did not influence sleep-wake states. The sleep fragmentation originated from NMDA receptors on GABA neurons in LPO. Sleep fragmentation could be transiently overcome with sleeping medication (zolpidem) or sedatives (dexmedetomidine; Dex). By contrast, fragmentation persisted under high sleep pressure produced by sleep deprivation (SD), mice had a high propensity to sleep but woke up. By analyzing changes in δ power, sleep homeostasis (also referred to as \"sleep drive\") remained intact after NMDA receptor ablation. We suggest NMDA glutamate receptor activation stabilizes firing of sleep-on neurons and that mechanisms of sleep maintenance differ from that of the sleep drive itself.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Insomnia is a common affliction. Most insomniacs feel that they do not get enough sleep, but in fact, often have good amounts of sleep. Their sleep, however, is fragmented, and sufferers wake up feeling unrefreshed. It is unknown how sleep is maintained once initiated. We find that in mice, NMDA-type glutamate receptors in the hypothalamus are the main drivers of excitation and are required for a range of sleep properties: they are, in fact, needed for both sustained NREM sleep periods, and REM sleep generation. When NMDA receptors are selectively reduced from inhibitory preoptic (PO) neurons, mice have normal total amounts of sleep but high sleep-wake fragmentation, providing a model for studying intractable insomnia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35649726/"}

There were no differences in the blood pressure levels in the sleeping phases or in the working periods between the two 24-h cycles. Diurnal blood pressure fluctuations had equal amplitudes. Corresponding to the lag between the working period there was a phase difference of 8 h between the 24-h blood pressure curves. At this lag, there was a high correlation between the mean hourly blood pressure values (r = 0.683). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure curves during the first and last day of a night shift were nearly equal. Thus the effects of shift rotation on the 24-h blood pressure profile were fully expressed within the first 24 hours.

Sleep has been identified experimentally in many animals, including honey bees (Apis mellifera). As worker bees age they change castes, typically performing a sequence of different task sets (as 'cell cleaners', 'nurse bees', 'food storers' and 'foragers'). Belonging to a caste could differentially impact the duration, constitution and periodicity of a bee's sleep. We observed individually marked bees within observation hives to determine caste dependent patterns of sleep behavior. We conducted three studies to investigate the duration and periodicity of sleep when bees were outside comb cells, as well as duration of potential sleep when bees were immobile inside cells. All four worker castes we examined exhibited a sleep state. As bees aged and changed tasks, however, they spent more time and longer uninterrupted periods in a sleep state outside cells, but spent less time and shorter uninterrupted periods immobile inside cells. Although c cleaners and nurse bees exhibited no sleep:wake rhythmicity, food storers and foragers experienced a 24 h sleep:wake cycle, with more sleep and longer unbroken bouts of sleep during the night than during the day. If immobility within cells is an indicator of sleep, our study reveals that the youngest adult bees sleep the most, with all older castes sleeping the same amount. This in-cell potential sleep may compensate for what would otherwise indicate an exceptional increase of sleep in an aging animal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18775940/"}

However, both ictal and interictal events are not equally affected by the different sleep states. Besides the well-known dichotomy between non-REM sleep (high activation) and REM sleep (low activation), epileptic phenomena are deeply sensitive to the ongoing level of arousal. During non-REM sleep the arousal level can be either unstable, as expressed by the repetitive sequences of the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), or stable, as reflected by non-CAP. Phase A (arousal complex) and phase B (post-arousal rebound response) are the two basic components of the CAP cycle, which presents a 20-40 s periodicity. Three subtypes of A phases can be recognized: the A1 subtypes, which are thoroughly composed of K-complexes and delta bursts, and subtypes A2 and A3 dominated by moderate (A2) or prominent (A3) EEG desynchrony. As a manifestation of unstable sleep, CAP offers a favorable background for the occurrence of nocturnal motor seizures that in most cases arise in concomitance with a phase A. In primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) and in lesional epilepsies with fronto-temporal focus, activation of interictal discharges is high during CAP reaching the climax during phase A and the strongest inhibition during phase B. A lack of modulation is observed instead in epilepsy with benign rolandic spikes. In PGE, the interictal bursts are mostly associated with the highly synchronized phase A1 subtypes. The analysis of sleep microstructure based on CAP parameters offers a sensitive framework for exploring the linkage between dynamic EEG events and epileptic phenomena.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10996553/"}

In this study, temperature dependence of energy expenditure was assessed by comparing changes in sleeping energy expenditure and thermoregulation with menstrual cycle in 9 young females. Energy expenditure was measured using a metabolic chamber, in which sleep was recorded polysomnographically, and core body temperature and skin temperature were continuously monitored. Distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient was assessed as an index of heat dissipation. In the luteal phase, a significant increase in average core body temperature (+0.27°C) and energy expenditure (+6.9%) were observed. Heat dissipation was suppressed during the first 2 hr of sleep in the luteal phase, compared with follicular phase. Rise in basal body temperature in the luteal phase was accompanied by increased energy expenditure and suppressed heat dissipation.

In a global sample of over 10000 people, we demonstrated that cognitive performance, measured using a set of 12 well-established tests, is impaired in people who reported typically sleeping less, or more, than 7-8 hours per night-which was roughly half the sample. Crucially, performance was not impaired evenly across all cognitive domains. Typical sleep duration had no bearing on short-term memory performance, unlike reasoning and verbal skills, which were impaired by too little, or too much, sleep. In terms of overall cognition, a self-reported typical sleep duration of 4 hours per night was equivalent to aging 8 years. Also, sleeping more than usual the night before testing (closer to the optimal amount) was associated with better performance, suggesting that a single night's sleep can benefit cognition. The relationship between sleep and cognition was invariant with respect to age, suggesting that the optimal amount of sleep is similar for all adult age groups, and that sleep-related impairments in cognition affect all ages equally.

In this condition there was a significant interaction between type and time of day with respect to amount of sleep: morning types slept more during the night, and evening types slept more during the day. Based on their amounts of sleep, subjects were also divided into \"sleepy\" and \"alert\" types, which were independent from the chronotypology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2595175/"}

Slow wave sleep activity was increased during the first part of the night, whereas cortisol concentration was low and GH output reached maximal levels. The second half of the night was characterized by a relative preponderance of REM-sleep, low GH-concentration, and an increase in cortisol. However, no distinct reciprocal interaction between cortisol and GH concentration was noted. In all subjects, a pronounced GH surge between 22.00 and 02.00 h was recorded which occurred independently of the presence of slow wave sleep. Six out of the 25 subjects showed nocturnal GH increases even before sleep onset. These data indicate that somatotropic cell activity during night is less dependent upon the sleeping state or specific conventially defined sleep stages than originally reported.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3661056/"}

Sixty-four families (mostly Caucasian; 36 boys) were met twice, when children were 2 (T1) and 4 years of age (T2). At T1, children wore an actigraph monitor for a 72-hr period, and both mothers and fathers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. At T2, both parents as well as the daycare educator filled the Child Behavior Checklist. At T1, longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency were associated with fewer externalizing symptoms as assessed by mothers. Results also indicated that higher sleep efficiency at T1 was related to fewer parent-reported externalizing symptoms at T2 (while controlling for prior externalizing symptoms). Relations between sleep efficiency at T1 and externalizing symptoms as assessed by mothers at T1 and by fathers at T2 were moderated by child sex, such that links were significant among boys only. Results pertaining to educators' reports were inconclusive. The current study highlights the importance of rapidly treating sleep difficulties, which are associated with persistent behavioral maladjustment, perhaps especially for boys.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605811/"}

Rapid hypoxia was produced by inhalation of 5% O2 in N2 or 6% CO in 40% O2 by intact cats and 5% O2 in N2 after carotid body denervation. Preliminary studies identified a period of SWS unassociated with spontaneous arousals. In 69 studies during SWS unassociated with spontaneous arousals, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) values at arousal were: 47.1 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- SE) (5% O2, intact); 48.9 +/- 1.4% (6% CO, intact); and 49.9 +/- 2.0% (5% O2, denervated). During SWS associated with spontaneous arousals, SaO2 values at arousal were 71.6 +/- 1.8% (5% O2, intact). Arousal from REM occurred at significantly lower values: 31.7 +/- 3.9% (6% CO, intact) and 43.5 +/- 2.3% (5% O2, intact). During both SWS and REM, inhalation of 5% O2 by intact animals caused a substantial increase in ventilation while 6% CO did not. We conclude that more severe hypoxia is required for arousal from SWS when studies are done in a period unassociated with spontaneous arousals than from SWS associated with spontaneous arousals. Hypoxic arousal does not appear to require activation of the carotid bodies or hyperpnea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7298466/"}

Across a 14-day daily study, 59 racially and ethnically diverse adolescents ages 15 to 18 had their sleep assessed via Fitbit Inspire 2 devices and uploaded screenshots of their screen time, pickups, and notifications as logged by their iPhone's iOS. Multi-level modeling was performed to assess hourly level associations between adolescent smartphone use and wake-events during their sleep sessions (<i>N</i> = 4,287 hourly cases). In hours during adolescents' sleep session with more screen time or pickups, adolescents had longer wake event duration. More notifications in a given hour were not associated with wake event duration in the same hour.

However, the associations between sleep duration and adolescents' physical activity levels remain less explored. The aims of this paper were twofold: (1) to describe sleep and physical activity levels among Norwegian school-based adolescents, stratified by school level and sex and (2) to explore the association between sleep and physical activity levels. Data were derived from the 2022 Norwegian Ungdata Survey, totaling 63,113 adolescents from lower (aged 13 to 16 years) and upper (aged 16 to 19 years) secondary schools. Study variables were measured using single-item questions from the Ungdata survey and collected through an electronic questionnaire administered during school hours. Logistic regressions were performed using crude analysis and adjusted for Socioeconomic status (SES) and grade level (age). In lower secondary school, 57.0% of girls and 44.7% of boys reported sleeping less than the recommended 8 h, whereas in upper secondary school, the rate was 74.9% among girls and 74.3% among boys. Girls consistently reported more sleep problems, feeling more tired at school or during activities, and less physical activity than boys across school levels. Sleep duration was a significant predictor for all levels of weekly physical activity among girls across school levels, with the highest odds revealed in upper secondary school among those being active 5 times a week (<i>B</i> = 1.32; 95% CI [1.24 to 1.40]). Sleep duration was a predictor for being active 5 times a week for boys across school levels (<i>B</i> = 1.22; 95% CI [1.17 to 1.27]). About half of younger adolescents and three-quarters of older adolescents do not adhere to the sleep recommendation. Lower levels of physical activity were consistently reported by girls than boys. Sleep duration consistently predicted a 20 to 30% higher likelihood of being active at least 5 days a week across sex and school levels. These findings underscore the critical role of sleep duration relations to higher physical activity levels among Norwegian adolescents.

In the current study, we investigate whether one can actively enhance the beneficial effect of sleep on creativity by covertly reactivating the creativity task during sleep. Individuals' creative performance was compared after three different conditions: sleep-with-conditioned-odor; sleep-with-control-odor; or sleep-with-no-odor. In the evening prior to sleep, all participants were presented with a problem that required a creative solution. In the two odor conditions, a hidden scent-diffuser spread an odor while the problem was presented. In the sleep-with-conditioned-odor condition, task reactivation during sleep was induced by means of the odor that was also presented while participants were informed about the problem. In the sleep-with-control-odor condition, participants were exposed to a different odor during sleep than the one diffused during problem presentation. In the no odor condition, no odor was presented. After a night of sleep with the conditioned odor, participants were found to be: (i) more creative; and (ii) better able to select their most creative idea than participants who had been exposed to a control odor or no odor while sleeping. These findings suggest that we do not have to passively wait until we are hit by our creative muse while sleeping.

Post-training VO2max [mean (SE): 48.9 (1.7) ml.kg-1.min-1] values were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than pre-training [45.5 (1.8) ml.kg-1.min-1] values.

A three-way repeated measures ANOVA [training status (pre-/post-training) x activity (exercise day/nonexercise day) x sleep time (18 epochs of 20 min each)] revealed a significant main effect for sleep time (P < 0.001) as well as a sleep time x training status interaction (P < 0.02). No significant difference in sleeping heart rate was noted when exercise and non-exercise days were compared both before and after training.

Our objective was to determine whether the pattern of BP change and the slope of the morning BP surge were related to hostility. The subjects were 32 patients with a history of Stage 1 hypertension. The morning surge in BP was derived from ambulatory BP monitoring of sleeping and waking hours, which were averaged per subject and centered around the wake-up hour. The periods used were 3 h before and 3 h after awakening. Only systolic blood pressure (SBP) is being reported on in this paper as this is the primary measure found relevant to the morning surge phenomenon. Hostility was assessed by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (total score). The results revealed significant differences between low and high hostility subjects for overall levels of sleep SBP: 120 +/- 11.4 mm Hg for low hostility and 131.3 +/- 14.9 mm Hg for high hostility subjects (P = .02). Low hostility subjects showed a steep rise in SBP from sleeping to waking while high hostility subjects had almost reached their post-sleep level of SBP in the hours immediately before waking up (P = .03). These data indicate that individual differences in hostility are related to different patterns of BP during sleep and the early morning hours, a period of the day that has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular incidents. The data also suggest the need for further study of the significance of hostility and other personality traits and the relationship of these traits to the mechanisms of the morning surge and the risk of cardiovascular events.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9524056/"}

{"id": "28934526", "title": "Mechanisms of Memory Retrieval in Slow-Wave Sleep.", "text": "Memories are strengthened during sleep. The benefits of sleep for memory can be enhanced by re-exposing the sleeping brain to auditory cues; a technique known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Prior studies have not assessed the nature of the retrieval mechanisms underpinning TMR: the matching process between auditory stimuli encountered during sleep and previously encoded memories. We carried out two experiments to address this issue. In Experiment 1, participants associated words with verbal and nonverbal auditory stimuli before an overnight interval in which subsets of these stimuli were replayed in slow-wave sleep. We repeated this paradigm in Experiment 2 with the single difference that the gender of the verbal auditory stimuli was switched between learning and sleep. In Experiment 1, forgetting of cued (vs. noncued) associations was reduced by TMR with verbal and nonverbal cues to similar extents. In Experiment 2, TMR with identical nonverbal cues reduced forgetting of cued (vs. noncued) associations, replicating Experiment 1. However, TMR with nonidentical verbal cues reduced forgetting of both cued and noncued associations. These experiments suggest that the memory effects of TMR are influenced by the acoustic overlap between stimuli delivered at training and sleep. Our findings hint at the existence of two processing routes for memory retrieval during sleep. Whereas TMR with acoustically identical cues may reactivate individual associations via simple episodic matching, TMR with nonidentical verbal cues may utilize linguistic decoding mechanisms, resulting in widespread reactivation across a broad category of memories.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28934526/"}

Previous studies in adult humans and animals, and a single study in human newborns, have indicated that more sleep might be expected following the carbohydrate feed compared with the water and balanced-formula feeds because of recruitment of centrally mediated serotonergic systems. Behavioral effects were assessed for 40 minutes postfeeding by direct observation of the newborn's states (quiet, active, and indeterminate sleep; drowsiness; non-cry wakefulness; and fret/cry). Feed composition did affect behavior, and the effects were fairly specific to particular newborn states. Non-cry wakefulness and drowsiness were unrelated to the presence or type of nutrients, but they tended to occur soon after the meal in all groups. Crying was increased in water-fed newborns relative to both carbohydrate- and formula-fed newborns. Sleeping showed specific patterns of change in all three groups. Sleep duration was increased in the balanced-formula group compared with the water group throughout the observation period. Contrary to the prediction, sleeping duration in carbohydrate-fed newborns never exceeded that of formula-fed newborns; rather, it resembled that of water-fed newborns early in the postprandial period, but formula-fed newborns later.

In this technique, sleeping EE is usually estimated as the lowest value of a 30 min resting EE measurement x 0 x 90 to give an average for the total sleeping period. However, sleeping is a dynamic process in which sleeping EE is modulated by the effect of factors such as body movement and different sleep stages. The aim of the present study was to determine a new method to improve the sleeping EE measurement by taking into account body movements during sleep. Twenty-four non-obese children participated in the present study. All subjects passed through a calibration period. HR and EE measured by IC were simultaneously collected during resting, the postprandial period, and during different levels of activity. Different methods for computing sleeping EE (resting with different breakpoints ('flex point' HR with linear regression or 'inflection point' (IP) HR with the third order polynomial regression equation (P3)) were compared with EE measured for least 2.0 h in eight sleeping children. The best method of calculation was then tested in sixteen children undergoing HR monitoring and with a body movement detector. In a subset of eight children undergoing simultaneous sleeping EE measurement by IC and HR, the use of the equation resting when HR<IP and P3 when HR>IP during the sleeping period gave the lowest difference (1 (sd 5.4) %) compared with other methods (linear or polynomial regressions). The new formula was tested in an independent subset of sixteen other children. The difference between sleeping EE computed with the formula resting and sleeping EE computed with resting when HR<IP and the P3 equation when HR>IP during sleeping periods was significant (13 (sd 5.9) %) only for active sleeping subjects (n 6 of 16 subjects). The correlation between the difference in the results from the two methods of calculation and body movements was close (r 0.63, P<0.005, Spearman test) as well as computed sleeping EE (Spearman test, r 0.679, P<0.001), indicating that this new method is reliable for computing sleeping EE with HR monitoring if children are moving during sleep and improves the total EE assessment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12425734/"}

In contrast, during rapid eye movement sleep, rebreathing lasted for 1.71 +/- 0.27 min (P less than 0.05) before arousal occurred and the alveolar PCO2 at arousal was 60.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Linear regression analysis of breath-by-breath instantaneous minute volume of ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory frequency against alveolar PCO2 revealed regression coefficients in rapid eye movements sleep that were 14 to 33 per cent of those found in non-rapid eye movement sleep, and correlation coefficients of 0.26 to 0.46, compared to 0.71 to 0.91 in non-rapid eye movement sleep. Thus, the link between CO2 and ventilation appeared to be strong in non-rapid eye movement sleep but considerably disrupted during rapid eye movement sleep.

For instance, in SAE Level 4 autonomous driving, a driver may need to takeover the vehicle control in case the autopilot is exiting its operational design domain. Depending on the depth of the sleep, the subject may need time to takeover effectively; hence, it is particularly relevant to know in which sleep stage the subject is (e.g., light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep), and possibly initiate actions to prevent the subject to remain in those sleep stages that lead to longer takeover time. Sleep stage classification can be achieved through an on-the-fly algorithm, which generates output in response to each input portion without knowledge of future inputs, unlike an off-Line algorithm that provides output just after receiving the entire input sequence. Various studies have analyzed algorithms or devices that identify sleep stages during the night; however, these typically require electroencephalography (EEG), which is obtrusive, or specialized devices. This study describes the development of an on-the-fly sleep-scoring algorithm using Heart Rate (HR), RR intervals, which is the distance between two consecutive heartbeats, and accelerometer data from a smartwatch, widespread, non-invasive, and affordable but accurate device. The subjects involved in our study wore a commercial off-the-shelf wearable device during a full night's sleep, and were also monitored using a reference medical device to establish the ground truth by means of a full polysomnography (PSG) analysis. The on-the-fly sleep scoring algorithm based on smartwatch data was tested against PSG-based scoring, achieving 88.46% accuracy, 91.42% precision, and 93.52% sensitivity in sleep-wake identification. Deep sleep was correctly identified 69.38% of times, light sleep in 50.62%, REM sleep 62.02% and wakefulness 73.48% of times.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40218655/"}

A cross-sectional online survey was completed by a sample of 101 Australian new mothers with children under 12 months (M = 5.52 months, SD = 3.29 months) to examine the relationship between infant feeding method, infant sleeping location, and postpartum depression with maternal sleep quality. Subjective maternal sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and postpartum depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Overall, new mothers experienced poor subjective sleep quality, with high average PSQI scores, above the cut-off of 5 (M = 9.63, SD = 4.07). The majority of new mothers did not experience postpartum depression, with an average EPDS score below the cut-off of 11 (8.66, SD = 5.20). Mothers who breastfed their infants experienced significantly better subjective sleep quality than mothers who bottle-fed, with a medium effect size (ηp2 = 0.458). Subjective maternal sleep quality did not differ based on infant sleeping location. Poor subjective maternal sleep quality was a significant predictor of postpartum depression. While poor sleep was common in this sample of Australian new mothers, this study demonstrated that new mothers who breastfeed may experience slightly better subjective sleep quality than other feeding methods. Further research into, and better services for the education and advocation of, new mothers' sleep quality will be beneficial to both new mothers and clinicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37619378/"}

We determined the acute and sustained (4 min) ventilatory response to a range of external inspiratory resistive loads (4, 8, 12, and 25 cmH2O.l-1.s) during wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in seven normal men. We found that minute ventilation (VI) was well maintained with acute and sustained resistive loading during wakefulness. Immediate adjustments in ventilatory timing (prolongation of inspiratory duration) provided full compensation for airflow reduction. In marked contrast, resistive load application during NREM sleep invariably produced a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in VI with progressively larger resistive loads producing progressively greater ventilatory decrements. This decline in ventilation was a product of a falling inspiratory flow rate with inadequate prolongation of inspiratory duration (TI). The largest decrements in ventilation occurred immediately after load application followed by partial ventilatory recovery, which occurred over time in concert with rising PCO2 and augmented ventilatory effort (as reflected by P0.1 or mouth occlusion pressure). Similar observations were made during REM sleep, although the responses were less consistent and fewer data were obtained. These observations support the hypothesis that poor load compensation for increased upper airway resistance contributes to the hypoventilation characteristic of normal sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3130368/"}

Although in humans the daily amount of sleep decreases with aging, the total amount of time spent for sleep is estimated as up to one-third of one's lifetime. In mammals, sleep shows a clear daily rhythmicity as well as nightly phases, which are strongly controlled by the circadian clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei and are also regulated by ambient light. While it is certain that sleep is critical for survival in general, the functional significance of sleep is still under investigation. Dreaming is a common psychological phenomenon occurring during human sleep, yet its content and natural function, if any, are still a matter of debate. In recent years, accumulated evidence strongly supports the notion that new information acquired during the day time is processed and transformed into long-term memory in a complicated and sophisticated way during sleeping. Such information processing is commonly referred to as memory consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24665738/"}

Sleep loss affects activity patterns, increases anxiety-like behaviors, decreases cognitive performance and is associated with depressive states. The activity/rest cycle of dogs has been investigated before, but little is known about the effects of sleep loss on the behavior of the species. Dogs are polyphasic sleepers, meaning the behavior is most observed at night, but bouts are also present during the day. However, sleep can vary with ecological and biological factors, such as age, sex, fitness, and even human presence. In this study, kennelled laboratory adult dogs' sleep and diurnal behavior were recorded during 24-h, five-day assessment periods to investigate sleep quality and its effect on daily behavior. In total, 1560 h of data were analyzed, and sleep metrics and diurnal behavior were quantified. The relationship between sleeping patterns and behavior and the effect of age and sex were evaluated using non-parametric statistical tests and GLMM modelling. Dogs in our study slept substantially less than previously reported and presented a modified sleep architecture with fewer awakenings during the night and almost no sleep during the day. Sleep loss increased inactivity, decreased play and alert behaviors, while increased time spent eating during the day. Males appeared to be more affected by sleep fragmentation than females. Different age groups also experienced different effects of sleep loss. Overall, dogs appear to compensate for the lack of sleep during the night by remaining inactive during the day. With further investigations, the relationship between sleep loss and behavior has the potential to be used as a measure of animal welfare.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35013533/"}

Spindles play a role in sleep and wake functions and are altered in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. This study established the first threshold values for sleep spindles in healthy adults using scalp-EEG and explored their associations with other sleep parameters. This observational prospective study was conducted with 80 healthy participants stratified by age and sex (40.9 years, range 19-74, 50% females). All participants underwent in-laboratory polysomnography. Sleep spindles during N2 were analyzed using an automated procedure and categorized as fast (> 13 Hz) or slow (≤ 13 Hz). For fast spindles, the threshold values were duration (0.80-1.11 s), frequency (13.4-14.3 Hz), amplitude (5.2-15.2 μV), and density (1.0-5.8 spindles/min). For slow spindles, the values were duration (0.79-1.17 s), frequency (12.3-12.9 Hz), amplitude (4.1-13.2 μV), and density (0.03-3.15 spindles/min). From age 40 onwards, the density, amplitude, and duration of both types of spindles decreased; the amplitudes of both types of spindles were higher in females. Higher amplitude in fast spindles was associated with increased excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased proportion of slow-wave sleep. This study provides the first threshold values for sleep spindle characteristics in healthy adults. The findings emphasize the importance of investigating spindles to develop innovative biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric disorders and to gain deeper insights into the functioning of the sleeping brain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40256915/"}

In both waves, overall WTC was inversely associated with accidents (p = 0.048 and p = 0.038, respectively). Analyses of the sub-dimensions of WTC indicated that Control over Daily Hours (influence over start and finish times, and over length of shift) did not predict accidents in either wave, while Control over Time-off (CoT; influence over taking breaks, running private errands during work and taking paid leave) predicted fewer accidents in both waves (p = 0.013 and p = 0.010).

Moreover, the central cholinergic system plays an important role in the depressant action of ethanol and barbiturates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of arecoline on pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced hypnosis in mice. Male ICR mice were tested for locomotor activity following acute systemic administration of ethanol alone, arecoline alone, or ethanol plus arecoline. For the loss of the righting reflex (LORR) induced by pentobarbital and ethanol, sleep latency and sleeping duration were evaluated in mice treated with arecoline alone or the combination of arecoline and scopolamine or methscopolamine. Ethanol (1.0 to 3.0 g/kg, i.p.) reduced locomotor activity significantly and a declining trend was observed after treatment with arecoline (0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), but there were no synergistic effects of ethanol and arecoline on locomotor activity. The experiments on LORR demonstrated that arecoline (0.125 to 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) shortened the duration of sleeping induced by ethanol (4.0 g/kg, i.p.), but not pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.). In addition, alterations of sleep latency were not obvious in both pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced LORR. Statistical analyses revealed that scopolamine (centrally acting), but not methscopolamine (peripherally acting), could antagonize the effect of arecoline on the duration of ethanol-induced LORR in mice.

Experimental studies have shown that short-term partial sleep restriction decreases glucose tolerance, increases sympathetic tone, elevates cortisol concentrations, decreases the satiety hormone leptin, increases the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin, and increases hunger and appetite. Short sleep duration might increase the risk of becoming obese, because it does not allow the recovery of a hormonal profile facilitating appetite control. Lack of sleep could also lead to weight gain and obesity by increasing the time available for eating and by making the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle more difficult. Furthermore, the increased fatigue and tiredness associated with sleeping too little could lessen one's resolve to follow exercise regimens. Short sleep duration appears to be a novel and independent risk factor for obesity.

Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments.

Sleep was monitored by actigraphy. Self- and parent-reported SCT and inattention and self-reported driving problems were recorded at baseline and following each condition. Of the 38 eligible participants who completed the baseline session, 24 completed all five weeks of the protocol. After controlling for inattention, only parent-reported SCT was significantly positively associated with self-reported purposeful driving violations at baseline. Adolescents reported lesser SCT during EXT than during TYP. Further, after controlling for inattention, participants who reported improvement in SCT demonstrated fewer driving problems during EXT than during TYP. Preliminary findings suggest that extending sleep in short-sleeping adolescents may help alleviate SCT symptoms and improve driving.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28215271/"}

Fifteen healthy subjects participated in an adaptation and baseline night sleep, directly followed by seven simulated eight-hour night shifts (2300 to 0700 hours). At the end of each shift they were taken outside and exposed to natural light for 20 minutes. They then slept from approximately 0800 hours until they naturally awoke. There was a significant increase in mean performance on a visual psychomotor vigilance task across the week. Daytime sleep quality and quantity were not negatively affected. Total sleep time (TST) for each of the daytime sleeps was reduced, resulting in an average cumulative sleep debt of 3.53 hours prior to the final night shift. TST for each of the daytime sleep periods did not significantly differ from the baseline night, nor did TST significantly vary across the week. There was a significant decrease in wake time after sleep onset and sleep onset latency across the week; sleep efficiency showed a trend towards greater efficiency across the consecutive daytime sleeps. Hours of wakefulness prior to each simulated night shift significantly varied across the week. The melatonin profile significantly shifted across the week. Results suggest that under optimal conditions, the sleep debt that accumulates during consecutive night shifts is relatively small and does not exacerbate decrements in night-time performance resulting from other factors. When sleep loss is minimised, adaptation of performance during consecutive night shifts can occur in conjunction with circadian adaptation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14573724/"}

The influence of mianserin on acute ethanol toxicity (LD(50)), on ED(50) of ethanol in rota-rod test, on the duration of ethanol sleeping time as well as on spontaneous locomotor activity and ethanol-induced hypothermia was investigated. Moreover, the influence of mianserin administered in a dose of 10 mgkg(-1) i.p. on post-ethanol changes in the bioelectric brain activity (EEG) recordings in rabbits was also investigated. The electrodes were implanted into midbrain reticular formation (MRF), dorsal hippocampus (Hp) and frontal cortex (C). Mianserin administered as a single dose of 5 mgkg(-1) was found to decrease LD(50) of ethanol and its ED(50) in rota-rod test. Mianserin administered as a single dose of 5 or 20 mgkg(-1) prolongs ethanol sleeping time in mice but given daily for 14 days has no influence on this time. Mianserin-induced hypothermia was observed after administration of single dose as well as increase of ethanol-induced hypothermia after administration of higher dose (20 mgkg(-1)). Mianserin administered daily for 14 days had no influence on post-ethanol changes in body temperature.

In contrast, both single dose and repeated administration of mianserin prevents increased locomotor activity of animals observed after ethanol (2.5 mgkg(-1)). Mianserin administered to rabbits (10 mgkg(-1)) induces increase of share of low frequency 0.5-4 cps and decrease of share of frequencies 4-7 and 7-10 cps in EEG recordings from MRF and Hp.

However, most of the existing deep learning-based approaches are sharply constrained by the input modalities, where any insertion, substitution, and deletion of input modalities would directly lead to the unusable of the model or a deterioration in the performance. To solve the modality heterogeneity problems, a novel network architecture named MaskSleepNet is proposed. It consists of a masking module, a multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN), a squeezing and excitation (SE) block, and a multi-headed attention (MHA) module. The masking module consists of a modality adaptation paradigm that can cooperate with modality discrepancy. The MSCNN extracts features from multiple scales and specially designs the size of the feature concatenation layer to prevent invalid or redundant features from zero-setting channels. The SE block further optimizes the weights of the features to optimize the network learning efficiency. The MHA module outputs the prediction results by learning the temporal information between the sleeping features. The performance of the proposed model was validated on two publicly available datasets, Sleep-EDF Expanded (Sleep-EDFX) and Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS), and a clinical dataset, Huashan Hospital Fudan University (HSFU). The proposed MaskSleepNet can achieve favorable performance with input modality discrepancy, e.g. for single-channel EEG signal, it can reach 83.8%, 83.4%, 80.5%, for two-channel EEG+EOG signals it can reach 85.0%, 84.9%, 81.9% and for three-channel EEG+EOG+EMG signals, it can reach 85.7%, 87.5%, 81.1% on Sleep-EDFX, MASS, and HSFU, respectively. In contrast the accuracy of the state-of-the-art approach which fluctuated widely between 69.0% and 89.4%. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed model can maintain superior performance and robustness in handling input modality discrepancy issues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37028323/"}

The online news article and the 536 Facebook comments posted in response were analysed using thematic analysis. Although the scientific article and institutional press release were guarded about the implications of the research for human health, the media article used sensationalist reporting on the impact of a single night's sleep disruption to emphasize the everyday implications of the findings. Audience members who identified as sleeping poorly responded fatalistically, whereas commentors who identified as sleeping well were reassured by the news article. The sensationalist framing provoked an affective response in audience members, which at times led to disbelief in the specific message or questioning of scientific research. Sensationalist media reporting of science has unintended consequences. Attempts to engage audiences with science communication that is simplistic and personal may encourage readers to reject scientific evidence as logically incoherent.

Sleep is also present in invertebrates, and an extensive analysis in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that sleep in fruit flies shows most of the fundamental features that characterize sleep in mammals. In Drosophila, sleep consists of sustained periods of quiescence associated with an increased arousal threshold. Fly sleep is modulated by several of the same stimulants and hypnotics that affect mammalian sleep. Moreover, like in mammals, fly sleep shows remarkable interindividual variability. The expression of several genes involved in energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the response to cellular stress varies in Drosophila between sleep and wakefulness, and the same occurs in rodents. Brain activity also changes in flies as a function of behavioral state. Furthermore, Drosophila sleep is tightly regulated in a circadian and homeostatic manner, and the homeostatic regulation is largely independent of the circadian regulation. After sleep deprivation, recovery sleep in flies is longer in duration and more consolidated, indicated by an increase in arousal threshold and fewer brief awakenings. Finally, sleep deprivation in flies impairs vigilance and performance. Because of the extensive similarities between flies and mammals, Drosophila is now being used as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. Over the last few years, mutagenesis screens have isolated several short sleeping mutants, a demonstration that single genes can have a powerful effect on a complex trait like sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18591491/"}

Arousal delay measured from the neck muscle EMG was longer in active (21.1 sec) than in quiet sleep (5.4 sec, residual variance = 9.05). Arousal preceded apnea termination more often in quiet than in active sleep. When breathing resumed a sigh frequently occurred following prolonged apneas. We conclude that laryngeal stimulation elicits apnea in all states in mature lambs. The termination of apnea is related to waking up in quiet but not in active sleep, where arousal is depressed.

This report aims first, to fill the gap: sleep, like food, water and sex, is a primary reinforcer. The levels of extracellular mesolimbic dopamine show circadian oscillations and mark the \"wanting\" for pro-homeostatic stimuli. Further, the dopamine levels decrease during waking and are replenished during sleep, in opposition to sleep propensity. The wanting of sleep, therefore, may explain the homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep. Accordingly, sleep onset occurs when the displeasure of excessive waking is maximal, coinciding with the minimal levels of mesolimbic dopamine. Reciprocally, sleep ends after having replenished the limbic dopamine levels. Given the direct relation between waking and mesolimbic dopamine, sleep must serve primarily to gain an efficient waking. Pleasant sleep (i.e. emotional sleep), can only exist in animals capable of feeling emotions. Therefore, although sleep-like states have been described in invertebrates and primitive vertebrates, the association sleep-pleasure clearly marks a difference between the sleep of homeothermic vertebrates and cool blooded animals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29548930/"}

Experiments were done in the intact cortex and in isolated neocortical slabs of anesthetized animals, and in naturally sleeping and awake cats. There are at least four different electrophysiological cell classes in the neocortex. The responses of different neuronal classes to direct depolarization result in significantly different responses in postsynaptic cells. The activity patterns observed in the intact cortex of anesthetized cats depended mostly on the type of anesthesia. The intracellular activity in small neocortical slabs was composed of silent periods, lasting for tens of seconds, during which only small depolarizing potentials (SDPs, presumed miniature synaptic potentials) were present, and relatively short-lasting (a few hundred milliseconds) active periods. Our data suggest that minis might be amplified by intrinsically-bursting neurons and that the persistent Na+ current brings neurons to firing threshold, thus triggering active periods. The active periods in neurons were composed of the summation of synaptic events and intrinsic depolarizing currents. In chronically-implanted cats, slow-wave sleep was characterized by active (depolarizing) and silent (hyperpolarizing) periods. The silent periods were absent in awake cats. We propose that both intrinsic and synaptic factors are responsible for the transition from silent to active states found in naturally sleeping cats and that synaptic depression might be responsible for the termination of active states during sleep. In view of the unexpected high firing rates of neocortical neurons during the depolarizing epochs in slow-wave sleep, we suggest that cortical neurons are implicated in short-term plasticity processes during this state, in which the brain is disconnected from the outside world, and that memory traces acquired during wakefulness may be consolidated during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11165905/"}

Olfactory stimuli should have a stronger effect on dream emotions because their processing is linked directly to the limbic system. Because selective olfactory stimulation does not increase arousal activity, intense olfactory stimulation is therefore a prime paradigm for studying information processing during sleep. Fifteen healthy, normosmic volunteers were studied by intranasal chemosensory stimulation during rapid eye movement sleep based on air-dilution olfactometry. For olfactory stimulation, hydrogen sulphide (smell of rotten eggs) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (smell of roses) was used and compared with a control condition without stimulation. The olfactory stimuli affected significantly the emotional content of dreams: the positively toned stimulus yielded more positively toned dreams, whereas the negative stimulus was followed by more negatively toned dreams. Direct incorporations, i.e. the dreamer is smelling something, were not found. The findings indicate that information processing of olfactory stimuli is present in sleep and that the emotional tone of dreams can be influenced significantly depending upon the hedonic characteristic of the stimulus used. It would be interesting to conduct learning experiments (associating specific odours with declarative material) to study whether this declarative material is incorporated into subsequent dreams if the corresponding odour cue is presented during sleep.

With appropriate stimulation parameters, each TMS pulse at <1 Hz evokes an individual, high-amplitude slow wave that originates under the coil and spreads over the cortex. TMS triggering of slow waves reveals intrinsic bistability in thalamocortical networks during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

To determine the impact of adopting a sleep-promoting nighttime clinical workflow for hospitalized patients on nocturnal disruptions and sleep. Survey-based pre- and post-intervention cross-sectional study using convenience samples. Hospitalized veterans on a 23-bed general medical ward at a tertiary Veterans Administration Hospital. Baseline sleep surveys (N=149) identified two major sources of interruptions: blood pressure checks at 4 am for telemetry patients and subcutaneous (SQ) heparin injections between 4:30 and 6 am for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Clinical workflow was restructured to eliminate these disruptions: moving 4 am blood pressure checks to 6 am and providing daily SQ enoxaparin at 9 am as an alternative to Q 8-h SQ heparin, which had prompted an injection between 4:30 and 6 am. The impact of these changes was assessed in a second round of surveys (N=99). Frequency and sources for nighttime sleep disruptions; percentage of patients reporting longer time to fall asleep, more interruptions, and worse sleep quality (vs. home) before and after restructuring nighttime clinical workflow. After restructuring nighttime clinical workflow, medication administration as a source of nighttime disruption decreased from 40% (59/149) to 4% (4/99) (p<0.001). Blood pressure checks as a source of disruption decreased from 56% (84/149) to 42% (42/99) (p=0.033). Fewer patients reported taking longer to fall asleep in the hospital vs. home (39% pre-intervention vs. 25% post-intervention, p=0.021). Similarly, fewer patients experienced waking up more frequently in the hospital vs. home (46% pre-intervention vs. 32% post-intervention, p=0.036). Fewer patients reported sleeping worse in the hospital (44% pre-intervention vs. 39% post-intervention), though this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.54).

Sleep of adequate quality and duration is fundamental to neurobehavioral functioning, however astronauts commonly experience short sleep durations in spaceflight (<6 h). As humans embark on long-duration space exploration missions, there is an outstanding need to identify the consequences of sleep deficiency in spaceflight on neurobehavioral functions. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study that examined the sleep-wake behaviors, neurobehavioral functions, and ratings of stress and workload of N = 24 astronauts before, during, and after 6-month missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The computerized, Reaction SelfTest (RST), gathered astronaut report of sleep-wake behaviors, stress, workload, and somatic behavioral states; the RST also objectively assessed vigilant attention (i.e. Psychomotor Vigilance Test-Brief). Data collection began 180 days before launch, continued every 4 days in-flight aboard the ISS, and up to 90 days post-landing, which produced N = 2,856 RSTs. Consistent with previous ISS studies, astronauts reported sleeping ~6.5 h in-flight. The adverse consequences of short sleep were observed across neurobehavioral functions, where sleep durations <6 h were associated with significant reductions in psychomotor response speed, elevated stress, and higher workload. Sleep durations <5 h were associated with elevated negative somatic behavioral states. Furthermore, longer sleep durations had beneficial effects on astronaut neurobehavioral functions. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of sleep for the maintenance of neurobehavioral functioning and as with humans on Earth, astronauts would likely benefit from interventions that promote sleep duration and quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023565/"}

During sleep characterized by slow-wave electroencephalographic activity, such a reduction in the sleep-disturbing properties of jet aircraft noise has little effect. Moreover, even when effective during fast-wave sleep, the decreased arousal produced by the lower noise levels is not subjectively appreciated by the individual in terms of his estimate of the quality of his night's sleep.

To evaluate the effect of sleep extension on sensory gating, the extended sleep condition was performed in chronic short sleeping individuals. Thus, one week of time in bed (6 h 11 m) corresponding to habitual short sleep (hSS), and one week of extended time (∼ 8 h 25 m) in bed corresponding to extended sleep (eSS), were counterbalanced in the SS group. The gating ERP assessment was performed on the last day after each sleep condition week (normal sleep and habitual short and extended sleep), and was separated by one week with habitual total sleep time and monitored by a sleep diary. We found that amplitude of gating was lower in SS group compared to that in NS group (0.3 µV vs. 1.2 µV, at Cz electrode respectively). The results of the group × laterality interaction showed that the reduction of gating amplitude in the SS group was due to lower amplitude over the left hemisphere and central-midline sites relative to that in the NS group. After sleep extension the amplitude of gating increased in chronic short sleeping individuals relative to their habitual short sleep condition.

The development of innovative technologies for the stimulation of MLV functions is a promising direction in the progress of the treatment of various brain diseases associated with MLV abnormalities, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries, and intracranial hemorrhages. Sleep is a natural state when the brain's drainage processes are most active. Therefore, stimulation of the brain's drainage and MLVs during sleep may have the most pronounced therapeutic effects. However, such commercial technologies do not currently exist. This study presents a new portable technology of transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) under electroencephalographic (EEG) control of sleep designed to photo-stimulate removal of toxins (e.g., soluble amyloid beta (Aβ)) from the brain of aged BALB/c mice with the ability to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of different optical resources. The technology can be used in the natural condition of a home cage without anesthesia, maintaining the motor activity of mice. These data open up new prospects for developing non-invasive and clinically promising photo-technologies for the correction of age-related changes in the MLV functions and brain's drainage processes and for effectively cleansing brain tissues from metabolites and toxins.

Five-minute carrying promoted sleep for crying infants even in the daytime when these infants were usually awake, but not for non-crying infants. Maternal laydown of sleeping infants into a cot exerted bimodal effects, either interrupting or deepening the infants' sleep. During laydown, sleeping infants were alerted most consistently by the initiation of maternal detachment, then calmed after the completion of maternal detachment in a successful laydown. Finally, the sleep outcome after laydown was associated with the sleep duration before the laydown onset.

However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition, is not fully understood. Here, we present 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detect K-complexes, sleep spindles, and microarousals, and assess event-related and frequency responses as well as intertrial phase synchronization to the different stimuli presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observe larger evoked potentials, more precise time-locking of brain responses in the delta band (1-4 Hz), and stronger activity in the high frequency (>16 Hz) range, in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear completely when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the important internal processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital external sensory information.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has shown that sensory processing continues during sleep. Here, we studied the capacity of the sleeping brain to extract and process relevant sensory information. We presented sleepers with their own names and unfamiliar names spoken by either an FV or a UFV. During NREM sleep, UFVs elicited more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. By contrasting stimuli that evoked K-complexes, we demonstrate that UFVs evoked larger, more synchronized brain responses as well as stronger power at high frequencies (>16 Hz) relative to FVs. These differences in brain responses disappeared when no K-complexes were evoked. Our results suggest a pivotal role for K-complexes in the selective processing of relevant information during NREM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35039445/"}

Polysomnographic and physiological measurements, including oximetry, were made on three nights in random order and separated by 1 week.

Significant correlations indicated that both daytime napping and nighttime sleep were related to encoding and generalization across cues after the 2-h delay; significant findings were not found in relation to baseline or delayed recall performance.

Because short-term pulsatile administration of cortisol increases GH release and SWS in young adults, we wondered whether similar effects can be induced also in elderly men. Hourly injections of cortisol between 1700 and 600 h increased stage 2 and SWS and decreased rapid eye movement sleep. Spectral analysis revealed significant increases in delta and theta power. Cortisol infusions increased the GH secretion prior to sleep onset, but remained largely unchanged during sleep. Thus, sleep EEG and GH release are modulated by cortisol administration in a manner similar to that in young subjects, but to a lesser extent. The stimulatory effect of cortisol on both GH release and SWS points to a mechanism involving glucocorticoid-enhanced production and release of GH-releasing hormone that activates pituitary GH release and simultaneously antagonizes the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone and somatostatin.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9330974/"}

Prone sleeping impairs arousal from sleep and cardiovascular control in infants at 2-3 months, coinciding with the highest risk period for SIDS. We hypothesized that prone sleeping would also alter cerebrovascular control, and aimed to test this hypothesis by examining responses of cerebral oxygenation to head-up tilts (HUTs) over the first 6 months after birth. Seventeen healthy full-term infants were studied at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months, and 5-6 months of age using daytime polysomnography, with the additional measurements of blood pressure (BP, Finometer™, Finometer Medical Systems, The Netherlands) and cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI, NIRO 200, Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Japan). HUTs were performed in active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) in both prone and supine positions. When infants slept in the prone position, a sustained increase in TOI (P < 0.05) occurred following HUTs, except in QS at 2-3 months when TOI was unchanged. BP was either unchanged or fell below baseline during the sustained TOI increase, signifying cerebro-vasodilatation. In contrast, when infants slept supine, TOI did not change after HUTs, except in QS at 2-3 and 5-6 months when TOI dropped below baseline (P < 0.05). When infants slept in the prone position, cerebral arterial vasodilation and increased cerebral oxygenation occurred during head-up tilts, possibly as a protection against cerebral hypoxia.

We show that the responsiveness of sleeping flies and mice to mechanical vibrations is better suppressed when the diet is protein rich. In flies, we describe a signaling pathway through which information about ingested proteins is conveyed from the gut to the brain to help suppress arousability. Higher protein concentration in the gut leads to increased activity of enteroendocrine cells that release the peptide CCHa1. CCHa1 signals to a small group of dopamine neurons in the brain to modulate their activity; the dopaminergic activity regulates the behavioral responsiveness of animals to vibrations.

We studied prone sleeping infants to see whether they will sleep with their faces straight down; whether they can spontaneously change from this position; the way that thermal stimuli or bedding softness influences this change; and whether rebreathing or airway obstruction occurs. We studied 11 healthy infants, aged 0.2 to 6 months, while they slept on soft and on firm bedding. Most infants slept facedown spontaneously or when turned to this position. All could turn their heads readily but slept facedown for variable periods. All infants put their faces straight down more often after cold than after warm stimuli. Obstructive apnea occurred only once, but rebreathing occurred in all subjects. When the infants were in the facedown position, inspired carbon dioxide was three times greater on soft than on hard bedding. End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure rose in all subjects while they were in the facedown position; in one infant, high end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure and desaturation occurred without signs of arousal.

Sleeping longer (b = 0.1; p < 0.001) and later (b = 1.8; p = 0.01) than usual were both associated with better morning mood. There was a significant interaction between nightly actigraphic sleep duration and depression severity on morning affect (b = 0.003; p = 0.003). Participants with higher depression severity reported worse affect upon waking after sleeping less than their usual.

The frequency of night wakings was, on average, 77%, a finding that contrasted sharply with parental perception of frequency of night waking; the transition from bassinet/carrycot to cot was most common between 3 and 4 months of age; 25% of babies slept with the light on, 9% used a dummy, and 37% sucked their fingers; first-born infants woke significantly less often at night than those with one or more sibling.

Conditioned stimuli were then presented to subjects during non-REM sleep. Both delay-conditioned and trace-conditioned subjects exhibited conditioned EEG responses during post-training sleep. However, selectively in trace-conditioned subjects, fear-conditioned cues also affected the valence of dreamed emotions.

These methods of spatial segmentation show some advantages: i) they extract topographic descriptors independent of the chosen reference (reference-free methods), and ii) they achieve spatial data reduction that are more data-driven than dipole source analysis. The results obtained with this study revealed that alpha activity presented a different spatio-temporal pattern of brain electric fields in each arousal state used in this study. These differences were reflected in a) the mean duration of alpha microstates (longer in relaxed wakefulness than in drowsy period and REM sleep), b) the number of brain microstates contained in one second (drowsiness showed more different microstates than did relaxed wakefulness and REM state), and c) the number of different classes (more abundant in drowsiness than in the rest of brain states). If we assume that longer segments of stable brain activity imply a lesser amount of different information to process (as reflected by a higher stability of the brain generator), whereas shorter segments imply a higher number of brain microstates caused by more different steps of information processing, it is possible that the alpha activity appearing in the sleep onset period could be indexing the hypnagogic imagery self-generated by the sleeping brain, and a phasic event in the case of REM sleep. Probably, REM-alpha bursts are associated with a brain microstate change (such as sleep spindles), as demonstrated by its phasic intrusion in a desynchronized background of brain activity. On the other hand, alpha rhythm could be the \"baseline\" of brain activity when the sensory inputs are minimum and the state is relaxed wakefulness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10449257/"}

An important concern is when elephants avoid lying down, due to degenerative joint and foot disease, social structure, or stressful environmental changes. Inability or unwillingness to lie down for resting is an important welfare issue, as it may impair sleep. We emphasize the importance of satisfying rest in elephants by reviewing the literature on resting behavior in elephants (Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus) as well as the documentation of four cases from European zoos and our own direct observations in a zoo group of four female African elephants during 12 entire days. The common denominator in the case reports is the occurrence of a falling bout out of a standing position subsequently to a cessation of lying rest for different periods of time. Although well-known in horses as \"episodic collapse\" or \"excessive drowsiness,\" this syndrome has not been described in elephants before. To enable its detection, we recommend nocturnal video monitoring for elephant-keeping institutions. The literature evaluation as well as own observational data suggest an inverse relationship between lying rest and standing rest. Preventative measures consist of enclosure modifications that facilitate lying rest (e.g., sand hills) or standing rest in a leaning position as a substitute. Anecdotal observations suggest that the provision of appropriate horizontal environmental structures may encourage safe, sleep-conducive standing rest. We provide drawings on how to install such structures. Effects of providing such structures should be evaluated in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29600558/"}

Although the precise function of sleep remains elusive, research increasingly suggests that sleep plays a key role in memory consolidation. Newly formed memories are highly labile and susceptible to interference, and the sleep period offers an optimal window in which memories can be strengthened or modified. Interestingly, a small but growing research area has begun to explore the ability of odors to modulate memories during sleep. The unique anatomical organization of the olfactory system, including its intimate overlap with limbic systems mediating emotion and memory, and the lack of a requisite thalamic intermediary between the nasal periphery and olfactory cortex, suggests that odors may have privileged access to the brain during sleep. Indeed, it has become clear that the long-held assumption that odors have no impact on the sleeping brain is no longer tenable. Here, we summarize recent studies in both animal and human models showing that odor stimuli experienced in the waking state modulate olfactory cortical responses in sleep-like states, that delivery of odor contextual cues during sleep can enhance declarative memory and extinguish fear memory, and that olfactory associative learning can even be achieved entirely within sleep. Data reviewed here spotlight the emergence of a new research area that should hold far-reaching implications for future neuroscientific investigations of sleep, learning and memory, and olfactory system function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24767488/"}

However, since adenosine receptors are critically involved in sleep regulation, and sleep also modulates breathing, we tested the hypothesis that neonatal caffeine treatment disrupts regulation of sleep and breathing in the adult rat. Neonatal caffeine treatment (15 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was administered from postnatal days 3-12. At adulthood (8-10 weeks old), sleep and breathing were measured with a telemetry system and whole-body plethysmography respectively. In adult rats treated with caffeine during the neonatal period, sleep time was reduced, sleep onset latency was increased, and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep was fragmented compared to controls. Ventilation at rest was higher in caffeine-treated adult rats compared to controls across sleep/wake states. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were significantly reduced in caffeine-treated rats compared to control rats across sleep/wake states. Additional experiments in adult anaesthetized rats showed that at similar levels of arterial blood gases, phrenic nerve activity was enhanced in caffeine-treated rats.

Despite these disruptions, finding adequate nighttime care is often difficult for people with disabilities, and consequently, night is often when social isolation and vulnerability are most profound. In addition, caretakers themselves often find their own sleep profoundly disrupted, whether this occurs in a family setting or an institutional space.

Our hypothesis synthesizes data from a variety of model systems, some which require sleep (e.g. rodents and adult flies) and others that probably do not sleep (e.g. adult nematodes and cultured cell lines). Non-sleeping systems can be made insensitive (or hypersensitive) to some anesthetics by modifying a single pre-synaptic protein, syntaxin1A. This suggests that the synaptic release machinery, centered on the highly conserved SNARE complex, is an important target of general anesthetics in all animals. A careful consideration of SNARE architecture uncovers a potential mechanism for general anesthesia, which may be the primary target in animals that do not sleep, but a secondary target in animals that sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24449137/"}

The study was a single-blinded crossover trial including nine patients with cirrhosis. Sleep was evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and monitored for twelve nights with wrist accelerometers and sleep diaries. On two experimental days, separated by one week, patients were randomized to ingest either an oral amino acid challenge (AAC) or an isocaloric glucose solution (GS). We measured pupillary light response, capillary ammonia, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and two neuropsychological tests on both experimental days. The patients had poor self-assessed sleep quality. The amino acid challenge led to a significant increase in capillary ammonia and KSS. The time spent in bed sleeping after AAC was longer and with a reduced movement index compared to baseline but not different from GS. We found no difference in the pupillary light response or neuropsychiatric tests when comparing the effect of AAC with GS. Patients with cirrhosis had impaired sleep quality.

Second, enhancing accessibility to child development researchers, state of the science sleep assessment methodologies are presented with a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. Third, seven empirical studies conducted with \"typically\" developing infants and children provide examples of relations between sleep and some of the many individual and familial factors that influence and are influenced by sleep. In the presentation of empirical findings, a developmental ecological systems perspective adapted to sleep was espoused to illustrate some of the multiple levels of influence in the study of child sleep and development. Collectively, studies in this volume build significantly on the literature through: (a) illustrating linkages between various sleep parameters (e.g., quality, sleeping arrangements) and other key developmental domains (e.g., attachment, parenting); (b) demonstration of longitudinal relations connecting sleep with development, which is scarce in this field; and (c) utilization of actigraphy-based assessments of sleep duration and quality, which are underutilized in the literature yet important for a more nuanced understanding of sleep and development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25704742/"}

The upper airway was assessed at velum, oropharynx, tongue base, and epiglottis level in supine position. The patients head were then tilted to the left and the right side and the DISE findings were recorded. One hundred consecutive patients were included. In positional apneics (n = 67), lateral position was associated with decreased frequency of complete anteroposterior collapse at velum (P < 0.01), tongue base (P < 0.01), and epiglottis (P < 0.01) level-and increased frequency of partial anteroposterior collapse at velum (P < 0.01), tongue base (P < 0.01), and epiglottis (P <0.05) level in comparison with supine position.

The main research of this article is based on the observation of the effect of smart medical nursing intervention on the sleep quality of cardiology patients. The convenience sampling method was used to randomly select 80 cardiology patients from the electronic medical record system of the hospital, and the patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group was the control group. The routine nursing method was adopted, and a dedicated nurse paid attention to the sleep status; the other group was the control group. The research group adopts targeted nursing methods. This paper selects three kinds of sensor data as features. When collecting each scene record, it is first divided into sleeping and awake states, and then the classified time is composed of time segments, and these time segments are finally accumulated into sleep duration. Using sleep time, waking time, and sleep duration as input, the participants were divided into good sleepers and poor sleepers. Through a self-made questionnaire survey, the factors that have an adverse effect on the patient's sleep are divided into 7 aspects. Using the method of internal continuity measurement, Cronbach's coefficient <i>a</i> is 0.811, suggesting that the internal consistency is better, and the calculation reliability and validity are 86.1% and 83.4%, respectively, suggesting that the table can be used for sleep in hospitalized patients.

It is the three-way interaction between sleep quality, general work efficiency, and sensorimotor integration that is the subject of this paper and the focus of new work in our laboratory. To record sleep under field conditions including microgravity, we utilize a novel system called the Nightcap that we have developed and extensively tested on normal and sleep-disordered subjects. To perturb the vestibular system in ground-based studies, we utilize a variety of experimental conditions including optokinetic stimulation and both minifying and reversing goggle paradigms that have been extensively studied in relation to plasticity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Using these techniques we will test the hypothesis that vestibular adaptation both provokes and is enhanced by REM sleep under both ground-based and space conditions.

Here, we aimed to assess the relationship between sleep-related metacognitive beliefs, thought control strategies, excessive intrusive cognitive activities, such as dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, or objective and/or perceived sleep disruptions in elderly people.

Objective measures of sleep were also collected over 7 days of actigraphic recordings. Regression analyses showed that subjective sleeping difficulties were explained by sleep-related metacognitive activity, and particularly by metacognitive beliefs about sleeping difficulties. Interestingly, objective sleep measures were not associated with metacognitive activity.

Studies 1 (n = 134) and 2 (n = 47) used prospective designs and showed that undergraduates with high, but not low, levels of cognitive vulnerability were most likely to exhibit increases in depressive symptoms when sleeping well as operationalized by self-reported quality and objectively measured duration (via actigraphy).

Several tests were conducted on twelve volunteers while their sleeping situations during one day prior to the tests, were fully under control. Although the impact of the proposed system on the improvement of the detection accuracy is not remarkable, the results indicate the main advantages of the system are the reliability of the detections and robustness to the loss of the input signals.

Two different administration timings (pre-treatment and single shot treatment) and three dosages (0.5 ml in pre-treatment, 1.5 ml in pre-treatment, and 3 ml in single shot) were tested. The following parameters were evaluated: time needed for the subject to fall asleep before ABR testing, subject sl'eep features during ABR testing (quality, stability, duration), recorded ABR quality (including presence of abnormalities in amplitude and latency), subject waking up modality, and time needed for the subject to wake up at the end of the ABR exam. Quality of ABR signals was similar across treatments, and subjects responded in a similar manner in terms of time needed to wake-up and wake-up modality. However, pretreatment with the 1.5 ml dose induced sleep faster than the two other dosages, and the length of the induced sleep was longer than that induced by pre-treatment with 0.5 ml. In general, the pre-treatment with 1.5 ml led to a shorter ABR exam, because reduces the time for inducing sleep, allows a long sleeping phase with a good quality, without variation in the wakening up times.

Sleeping in the lateral decubitus position often results in significantly fewer apneas, and some have recommended sleeping on the side as the major treatment intervention. Previous studies, although calculating apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for supine and lateral decubitus positions, have not taken sleep stage into account. To examine the effect of both sleep stage and body position on apnea duration (AD) and frequency, we determined AHI and AD in all spontaneous body positions during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep by reviewing videotapes and polysomnograms from 11 overnight studies of 7 obese patients with severe sleep apnea. Consistent with previous work, AD was significantly longer in REM then in NREM (32.5 +/- 2.3 s versus 23.5 +/- 1.9 s; p less than 0.05). This difference persisted when adjusting for body position. AHI was greater on the back than on the sides (84.4 +/- 4.9/h versus 73.6 +/- 7.5/h, p less than 0.05), but after accounting for sleep stage, this difference remained only for NREM (103 +/- 4.8/h versus 80.3 +/- 9.2/h, p less than 0.05) and not for REM (83.6 +/- 5.3/h versus 71.1 +/- 4.2/h, p NS). Although reduced, AHI on the sides still remained clinically very high. Body position changed frequently throughout the night, but some patients spent little or no time on their back. We conclude that AD is longer in REM than NREM, regardless of position, and AHI is higher on the back only in NREM. As AHI remains very high on the sides, favoring the lateral decubitus position may not be as beneficial as previously thought in very obese patients.

The changes in the circumference of the chest and abdomen were measured with mercury-in-silastic strain gauges; nasal air flow was monitored with a pneumotachograph. During quiet sleep, the movements of the chest wall and the abdominal wall were congruent and regular, and the tidal volume was not dependent on the observed phase differences between them. In active sleep, the breathing movements were incongruent, the tidal volume was negatively correlated with the phase shift between the movements of the chest wall and the abdominal wall, and the mean inspiratory flow was increased. Ventilation (ml/min) did not differ between the sleep states. This study thus suggests that, in healthy newborns in active sleep, the chest wall distortion leads to a reduction of the tidal volume, but ventilation is upheld by compensatory mechanisms, i.e. increased breathing rate and increased amplitude of movements of the diaphragm.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6227654/"}

During sleep, while room air was breathed, VT decreased significantly from 410 to 360 ml, and respiratory rate also fell from 17 to 16 breaths/min. As a consequence, ventilation was significantly reduced from 6.5 to 5.8 l/min, and end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PCO2) rose from 39.1 to 42.5 Torr. Ventilatory responses to CO2 were reduced, on the average, during sleep to 79% of waking levels. The change in average inspiratory flow produced by CO2 was also less during sleep. Waking and sleeping ventilatory responses to CO2 correlated inversely with the rise in end-tidal PCO2 when room air was breathed during sleep.

In specific basal ganglia regions, gamma frequency oscillations occur during various behavioral states, including sleeping periods. Given the critical role of sleep in regulating vocal plasticity of songbirds, we examined the presence of such oscillations in the basal ganglia. In the song system nucleus Area X, epochs of high-gamma frequency (80-160 Hz) oscillation of local field potential during sleep were associated with phasic increases of neural activity. While birds were awake, activity of the same neurons increased specifically when birds were singing. Furthermore, during sleep there was a clear tendency for phase locking of spikes to these oscillations. Such patterned activity in the sleeping songbird basal ganglia could play a role in off-line processing of song system motor networks.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22031768/"}

Using a technique known as targeted memory reactivation, it is possible to selectively strengthen newly learned memories by re-exposing the sleeping brain to auditory cues. The aim of the current study was to examine whether emotionally salient memories are also more responsive to targeted memory reactivation in slow-wave sleep than neutral memories. In an initial training phase, participants memorised emotionally negative and neutral pictures, which were each paired with a semantically related sound. Recognition for the pictures was assessed before and after a 90-min nap opportunity, during which half the sounds were re-presented during slow-wave sleep (as assessed via online polysomnographic sleep monitoring). We observed no effect of targeted memory reactivation on the recognition of emotionally negative or neutral memories. Our results highlight the importance of the memory paradigm used to assess targeted memory reactivation, and suggest that the robust and durable nature of recognition memory may make it an insensitive measure of behavioural targeted memory reactivation benefits. To fully assess the impacts of targeted memory reactivation on emotional memory processing in sleep, future studies should adopt experimental paradigms that maximise the salience of emotional stimuli while also providing a sensitive index of memory accuracy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28493346/"}

A total of 48.6 % slept with the child in the same room, 53.2 % rocked, picked up, soothed, fed or interacted with their children to help them fall asleep. Regular night waking was found in 10.8 % of children. In these cases, only 7.2 % of parents left their children to fall asleep again alone. In general, parents' measures to help their children fall asleep are inappropriate, resulting in problems of falling asleep and night waking. The most effective way to prevent these problems is to introduce consistent routines in the first few months of life. To prevent these problems, primary care pediatricians should provide guidance to parents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12139867/"}

In individuals reporting the integration of the transcendent with waking and sleeping, CNV was higher in simple but lower in choice trials, and 6-12 Hz EEG amplitude and broadband frontal EEG coherence were higher during choice trials. Increased EEG amplitude and coherence, characteristic of TM practice, appeared to become a stable EEG trait during CNV tasks in these subjects.

Thumb users or occasional pacifier users were not included in the study. The infants were recorded at a median age of 10 weeks (range 6 to 19 weeks). To evaluate auditory arousal thresholds, the infants were exposed to white noise of increasing intensity during rapid eye movement sleep. Polygraphic arousals occurred at significantly lower auditory stimuli in pacifier users than in nonusers (P =.010). Compared with nonusers, pacifier users were more frequently bottle-fed than breast-fed (P =. 036). Among infants sleeping without a pacifier, breast-fed infants had lower auditory thresholds than bottle-fed infants (P =.049). Infants using pacifiers during sleep had lower auditory arousal thresholds than those who did not use a pacifier during sleep.

In particular, sleep has been shown to enhance learning and memory in both humans and animals. While the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, it has been suggested that brain activity during sleep modulates neuronal communication through synaptic plasticity. These insights were mostly gained using electrophysiology to monitor ongoing large scale and single cell activity. While these efforts were instrumental in the characterisation of important network and cellular activity during sleep, several aspects underlying cognition are beyond the reach of this technology. Neuronal circuit activity is dynamically regulated via the precise interaction of different neuronal and non-neuronal cell types and relies on subtle modifications of individual synapses. In contrast to established electrophysiological approaches, recent advances in imaging techniques, mainly applied in rodents, provide unprecedented access to these aspects of neuronal function in vivo. In this review, we describe various techniques currently available for in vivo brain imaging, from single synapse to large scale network activity. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these approaches in the context of sleep research and describe which particular aspects related to cognition lend themselves to this kind of investigation. Finally, we review the few studies that used in vivo imaging in rodents to investigate the sleeping brain and discuss how the results have already significantly contributed to a better understanding on the complex relation between sleep and plasticity across development and adulthood.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30208306/"}

Three doses of I1-1 were tested. The dose of 10 nmol slightly prolonged sleep, whereas a dose of 40 nmol totally inhibited sleep. Twenty nmol of I1-1 elicited sleep and increased body temperature. Total sleep (TS) time was significantly increased due to the significant increase in non REM (NREM) sleep as compared to the control day 1. REM sleep was also increased, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. Wakefulness (W) was significantly reduced. At this time the cats were febrile. On day 3, a further significant increase in TS occurred. NREM was significantly increased when compared with day 1, whereas the increase in REM sleep was significant when compared to both day 1 and day 2. At this time body temperature was normal. The increase in REM sleep on days 2 and 3 resulted entirely from the significant increase in the number of REM periods. On day 4, W showed tendency to increase while sleeping time decreased; such tendency suggests that sleep increase caused by I1-1 slowly returns to the control levels.

It was also found that the average score for the 6th experimental day after the third cycle was significantly increased, compared with that for the 1st 22 h waking period. These results show that the cerebral arousal level, which was indicated on the scores of SSS, was gradually decreased under the present experimental wake-sleep condition. The day-to-day variation of critical fusion frequency showed a tendency similar to that of SSS, demonstrating a gradual decrease in arousal level.

After review of 864 published articles, the following sleep durations are recommended: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Sleeping the number of recommended hours on a regular basis is associated with better health outcomes including: improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health. Regularly sleeping fewer than the number of recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems.

The distributions of the study variables were reported using standard parameters. We found that sleep quality is highly variable particularly during the first two years of life, but this variability decreased markedly towards the second year. First, sleep latency decreased by the age of six months, while night-time sleep began to consolidate during the second year.

Surveys were returned either via reply-paid mail or online. Questionnaires explored prevalence of infant care practices and awareness of safe sleep recommendations. Univariable analysis was used to generate descriptive statistics for key variables. Overall, only 13% of families routinely practised all six 'Safe Sleeping' program messages. More than one third (1118, 34%) of infants had slept in a non-supine sleep position at some time. Potentially hazardous sleep environments were common, with 38% of infants sleeping with soft items or bulky bedding, or on soft surfaces. Nearly half, for either day- or night-time sleeps, were routinely placed in a sleep environment that was not designed or recommended for safe infant sleep (i.e. a bouncer, pram, beanbag).

The population consisted of 60 healthy, preterm newborns and 63 full-term newborns, divided into four age groups, 1 week apart, throughout the first month of life. Preterm newborns were further divided into five groups according to conceptional (corrected) age. An observer took note every 30 min, for 24 h, of sleep or wakefulness in every case. The average sleeping time in preterm groups according to postnatal age remained unchanged during the first month of life: 17.57 h on day 1 and 17.15 h on day 28. When the preterm infants were re-grouped according to conceptional age, average daily sleep was 17.86 h at 32 weeks and 15.22 h at 37 weeks. The full-term newborns had an average daily sleep of 14.78 h on day 1 and 11.94 h on day 28, with a decrease throughout week 4 of life (p < 0.001). The decrease in daily sleeping time in the full-term groups, took place at the expense of the daylight span, where there was a decrease throughout the first month of life (p < 0.01).

The responsible mechanisms are, however, unclear. Since little is known about the non-nutritive sucking (NNS) habits of infants during sleep, we investigated NNS patterns and changes of physiological parameters during NNS in sleeping infants. Polygraphic recordings were performed in 12 infants with a median age of 55 days (range 7-82) who regularly used a pacifier during sleep. Episodes of active suckling (bursts) and quiescent periods were differentiated by video observations. We evaluated the time of suckling in relation to the total time of pacifier use, the median number of bursts per min, the median duration of single bursts and the median interval between 2 sequent bursts. In 48 randomly selected bursts, we additionally analyzed changes in heart rate, respiratory frequency and oxygen saturation compared to the 10-second period preceding the burst. Median sleep time with a pacifier held in mouth was 31.3 min (13.0-117.6), of which 15.5% (6.4-36.7%) was spent with active suckling. The median number of bursts per min was 2.2 (1.2-4.5). The median duration of a burst was 3 s (1-22) and the median interval between 2 bursts was 10 s (1-1,434). Heart rate, respiratory frequency and oxygen saturation did not change significantly during suckling bursts. This pilot study presents important data for sucking habits in pacifier users which may provide a basis for further investigations concerning the efficacy of pacifiers in SIDS prophylaxis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19648773/"}

The emergence of these rhythms is related to physiology and natural cycles as well as social constructs. The human body and its biological functions undergo near 24-h rhythms (circadian rhythms). While their frequencies are similar across people, their phases differ. In the chronobiology literature, people are categorized into morning-type, evening-type, and intermediate-type groups called chronotypes based on their tendency to sleep at different times of day. Typically, this typology builds on carefully designed questionnaires or manually crafted features of time series data on people's activity. Here, we introduce a method where time-stamped data from smartphones are decomposed into components using non-negative matrix factorization. The method does not require any predetermined assumptions about the typical times of sleep or activity: the results are fully context-dependent and determined by the most prominent features of the activity data. We demonstrate our method by applying it to a dataset of mobile phone screen usage logs of 400 university students, collected over a year. We find four emergent temporal components: morning activity, night activity, evening activity and activity at noon. Individual behavior can be reduced to weights on these four components. We do not observe any clear categories of people based on the weights, but individuals are rather placed on a continuous spectrum according to the timings of their phone activities. High weights for the morning and night components strongly correlate with sleep and wake-up times. Our work points towards a data-driven way of characterizing people based on their full daily and weekly rhythms of activity and behavior, instead of only focusing on the timing of their sleeping periods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35365710/"}

The dogs were previously prepared with a permanent side-hole tracheal stoma and were trained to sleep with a tight-fitting snout mask, hermetically sealed in place, while breathing through a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted through the tracheostomy. Sleep state was determined by behavioral, electroencephalographic, and electromyographic criteria, and EMGgg activity was measured using fine bipolar electrodes inserted directly into the muscle. Oscillatory pressure waves of 30 Hz and +/- 3 cmH2O (tested at atmospheric and subatmospheric upper airway pressures) were applied at the dog's nostrils or larynx, either constantly for a period of 1 min or in 0.5-s bursts. We found that the pressure stimulus had two major effects. First, it was a potentially powerful arousal-promoting stimulus. Arousal occurred in 78% of tests in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and 55% of tests in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, with swallowing and sighing accompanying many of the arousals. Second, it produced an immediate and sustained augmentation of EMGgg, in wakefulness, SWS, and REM sleep. We conclude that oscillatory pressure waves in the upper airway, as found in snoring, produce reflex responses that help maintain upper airway patency during sleep. Loss of this type of reflex might contribute to the onset of obstructive sleep apnea in chronic snorers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2384434/"}

Parents reported on sociodemographics and adolescent depressive and anxiety symptoms, and adolescents reported on their subjective sleep need and sleep duration. Altitude was calculated using U.S. Geological Survey data. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, rurality, and sleep duration, living at higher altitude was associated with reports of greater sleep need.

This article reviews the empirical literature on behavioral infant sleep interventions, sleep regulation, and sleep disturbance. Based on the available scientific literature, a new paradigm for infant sleep intervention, from birth to 6 months of age, is proposed. This new approach, the Possums Sleep Intervention, integrates interdisciplinary knowledge from developmental psychology, medical science, lactation science, evolutionary science, and neuroscience with third-wave contextual behaviorism, acceptance and commitment therapy, to create a unique, new intervention that supports parental flexibility, cued care, and the establishment of healthy biopsychosocial rhythms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25798510/"}

Although the early character of therapeutic incubation was purely ritual and mystical, however, the concept of this process seems to be matched with that of the holistic and personalized modern medical approach. Moreover, the importance of its role is in the transition of medicine from its pioneer empirical practices to the most modern scientific concepts, since it was incubation that sowed the seeds of modern medicine and established it from art to science. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of therapeutic incubation, either as an holistic approach to the patient and as a placebo effect, as well as its relationship with modern procedures of therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40157241/"}

Approximately 60% of SIDS victims are male, and it has been suggested that male infants have delayed cortical maturation compared to females. We hypothesized that CA frequency would be lower and CA threshold would be higher in male infants during both active (AS) and quiet (QS) sleep. 50 healthy term infants (21 male, 29 female) were studied with daytime polysomnography at 2-4 weeks and 2-3 months after birth. Arousal from sleep was induced using a pulsatile air-jet to the nostrils at increasing pressures. At 2-4 weeks, arousability from AS was similar in males and females, however during QS, male infants required a lower stimulus to induce SCA and CA. This gender difference in arousal threshold was not observed at 2-3 months. CA frequencies were similar between genders during both sleep states at both ages, though overall, CA was more frequent in AS than in QS. This study demonstrated that at 2-4 weeks, male infants were easier to arouse than female infants during QS. There were no significant effects of gender on total arousability or SCA and CA frequencies at 2-3 months, the age of peak SIDS incidence. Thus, although male infants are at greater risk of SIDS than female infants, this difference is unlikely to be associated with gender differences in CA threshold or frequency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20815186/"}

{"id": "9751278", "title": "Electrophysiological correlates of sleep delta waves.", "text": "Recent studies have disclosed several oscillations occurring during resting sleep within the frequency range of the classical delta band (0.5-4 Hz). There are at least 3 oscillations with distinct mechanisms and sites of origin: a slow (<1 Hz) cortically-generated oscillation, a clock-like thalamic oscillation (1-4 Hz), and a cortical oscillation (1-4 Hz). The present paper reviews data on these oscillations and the possible mechanisms which coalesce them into the polymorphic waves of slow wave sleep. Data stem from intracellular (over 500 single cell and 50 double impalements) and field potentials recorded from the cortex and thalamus of cats (120 animals) under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Other experiments were based on whole night EEG recordings from humans (5 subjects). The frequency of the slow oscillation both in anesthetized animals and in naturally sleeping humans ranged between 0.1 and 1 Hz (89% of the cases being between 0.5 and 0.9 Hz). The slow (<1 Hz) oscillation is reflected in the EEG as rhythmic sequences of surface-negative waves (associated with hyperpolarizations of deeply-lying neurons) and surface-positive K-complexes (representing excitation in large pools of cortical neurons). Through its long-range synchronization, the slow oscillation has the ability to trigger and to group thalamically-generated spindles and two delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations. Finally, it is argued that the analysis of the electroencephalogram should transcend the spectral analyses, by taking into account the shape of the waves and, when possible, the basic mechanisms that generate those waves.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9751278/"}

The data were analysed by means of power spectral analysis and coherence spectra. The peak frequency of high-frequency heart rate fluctuations was always clearly related to the breathing frequency, i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia is present in both states. Moving squared coherence analysis demonstrates the stability of the cardiorespiratory coupling to remain constant during wakefulness or non-REM sleep. However, coherence increases from waking state to non-REM sleep. The lower coherence during waking state may be explained by greater additional central and peripheral influences on the cardiorespiratory coupling or by increased non-linear properties of the transfer system due to operating point shifting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8964938/"}

In the resting, sleeping and agitated states both alveolar oxygen (PAO2) and carbon dioxide tensions (PACO2) were 'stratified' (unevenly distributed) within the alveolar lungs at end inspiration, during breath holding for up to 6 minutes and, when VA was low, at end expiration. The blood flow was also stratified. The degree of stratification of VA was influenced by the rate and depth of breathing and the length of the breath hold which preceeded the gas sampling. Similar results were obtained with a glass lung model. In both resting and sleeping states VA/Q ratios were similar over the proximal 75% of the alveolar lungs whereas VA nearly always exceeded Q over the distal 25%. The anatomic features of the lung are proposed as a possible mechanism for maintaining a uniform VA/Q distribution. Since the anatomical arrangement places the heart at the apical regions of the lungs, absence of cardiac mixing, combined with low respiratory rates, enables stratification to continue for very long periods within the aveolar lungs of the snake.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/741108/"}

Utilizing a purposeful sample method, twelve participants diagnosed with IH underwent telephone interviews guided by a semi-structured protocol. The interviews were subjected to thematic analysis to extract relevant themes. Analysis unveiled three primary themes along with subthemes: 1) Being confined, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, negative emotional processes and cognitive disturbances, 2) Missing out on life, involving loss of time and adverse social consequences, and 3) Trying to cope, encompassing strategies like napping, adapting, activating oneself and mentally fighting sleepiness, while also embracing acceptance and self-compassion. The identified themes reflected numerous aspects previously reported to be associated with living with IH. Notably, the study brought novel subthemes to light, such as the existential dilemma of \"sleeping one's life away\" and feelings of guilt and shame.

The aim of this case series is to comprehensively describe a cohort of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome. Eighty-two patients were studied concerning demographic and socio-economic features, medical, psychiatric and sleep comorbidities, substance use, sleep symptoms, actigraphy, video-polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests and treatment. The typical patient with insufficient sleep syndrome is a middle-aged adult (with no difference of gender), employed, who has a family, often carrying psychiatric and neurological comorbidities, in particular headache, anxiety and depression. Other sleep disorders, especially mild sleep apnea and bruxism, were common as well. Actigraphy was a valuable tool in the characterisation of insufficient sleep syndrome, showing a sleep restriction during weekdays, associated with a recovery rebound of night sleep during weekends and a high amount of daytime sleep. An over- or underestimation of sleeping was common, concerning both the duration of night sleep and daytime napping. The average daily sleep considering both daytime and night-time, weekdays and weekends corresponds to the recommended minimal normal duration, meaning that the burden of insufficient sleep syndrome could mainly depend on sleep fragmentation and low quality. Sleep efficiency was elevated both in actigraphy and video-polysomnography. Multiple sleep latency tests evidenced a tendency toward sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods. Our study offers a comprehensive characterisation of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome, and clarifies their sleeping pattern, opening avenues for management and treatment of the disorder. Current options seem not adapted, and in our opinion a cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy protocol should be developed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37909272/"}

Here, we report that memory traces can be both formed or suppressed during sleep, depending on sleep phase. We played samples of acoustic noise to sleeping human listeners. Repeated exposure to a novel noise during Rapid Eye Movements (REM) or light non-REM (NREM) sleep leads to improvements in behavioral performance upon awakening. Strikingly, the same exposure during deep NREM sleep leads to impaired performance upon awakening. Electroencephalographic markers of learning extracted during sleep confirm a dissociation between sleep facilitating memory formation (light NREM and REM sleep) and sleep suppressing learning (deep NREM sleep). We can trace these neural changes back to transient sleep events, such as spindles for memory facilitation and slow waves for suppression. Thus, highly selective memory processes are active during human sleep, with intertwined episodes of facilitative and suppressive plasticity.Though memory and sleep are related, it is still unclear whether new memories can be formed during sleep. Here, authors show that people could learn new sounds during REM or light non-REM sleep, but that learning was suppressed when sounds were played during deep NREM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28790302/"}

Moreover, many studies might be subject to methodological bias, as invasive sleep measurements may themselves serve as confounders. The aim of the SleepSmart study was to assess the impact of caffeine consumption through coffee and energy drinks, utilizing both smartwatch data and questionnaire responses. <b>Methods:</b> The SleepSmart study is an observational cohort study conducted at LMU Hospital Munich, Germany, from July 2024 to January 2025. The study investigated two intervention groups: (1) coffee and (2) energy drink consumption. Each intervention lasted 1 week, with days 1 to 3 serving as a reference period (water consumption to adjust for increased fluid intake) and days 4 to 6 serving as the intervention period (consumption of an equivalent of 240 mg of caffeine per day, 3 h before bedtime). Data was collected through self-administered questionnaires and wearable devices. The primary endpoint was sleep duration. Objective measures of sleep (duration of light/deep sleep, duration of wake phases, heart rate) and self-assed quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) served as secondary endpoints. <b>Results:</b> For the primary endpoint, we did not find a significant difference in average sleep duration (baseline [hours] 6.7, coffee 6.9, energy drink 6.7, <i>p</i>-value 0.183). Similarly, secondary endpoints related to sleep measures showed no significant changes in the duration of light/deep sleep (coffee [min]: 242.2, reference coffee [ref<sub>C</sub>] 255.7 I energy drink: 237.5, reference energy drink [ref<sub>E</sub>] 261.3), time awake (coffee 22.7, ref<sub>C</sub> 23.4 I energy drink 21.3, ref<sub>E</sub> 18.9), time to fall asleep/wake up (coffee 4.2, ref<sub>C</sub> 4.0 I energy drink 4.4, ref<sub>E</sub> 2.7), or average heart rate (coffee [bpm] 62.2, ref<sub>C</sub> 62.1 I energy drink 62.6, ref<sub>E</sub> 62.3)-neither between the two intervention groups nor compared to the reference period.

As more neural correlates of behavior are identified in freely moving animals, this three-fold subdivision becomes too simplistic. During wakefulness, ensembles of global and local cortical activities, together with peripheral parameters such as pupillary diameter and sympathovagal balance, define various degrees of arousal. It remains unclear the extent to which sleep also forms a continuum of brain states-within which the degree of resilience to sensory stimuli and arousability, and perhaps other sleep functions, vary gradually-and how peripheral physiological states co-vary. Research advancing the methods to monitor multiple parameters during sleep, as well as attributing to constellations of these functional attributes, is central to refining our understanding of sleep as a multifunctional process during which many beneficial effects must be executed. Identifying novel parameters characterizing sleep states will open opportunities for novel diagnostic avenues in sleep disorders. We present a procedure to describe dynamic variations of mouse non-REM sleep states via the combined monitoring and analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG)/electrocorticogram (ECoG), electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using standard polysomnographic recording techniques. Using this approach, we found that mouse non-REM sleep is organized into cycles of coordinated neural and cardiac oscillations that generate successive 25-s intervals of high and low fragility to external stimuli. Therefore, central and autonomic nervous systems are coordinated to form behaviorally distinct sleep states during consolidated non-REM sleep. We present surgical manipulations for polysomnographic (i.e., EEG/EMG combined with ECG) monitoring to track these cycles in the freely sleeping mouse, the analysis to quantify their dynamics, and the acoustic stimulation protocols to assess their role in the likelihood of waking up. Our approach has already been extended to human sleep and promises to unravel common organizing principles of non-REM sleep states in mammals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28809834/"}

A scientist examined the whole crew on board 22 container ships (323 seafarers; participation rate 88.5%). Data about energy consumption and heart rate were continuously collected during the seafarers' leisure and sleeping time through a SenseWear<sup>®</sup> wrist monitor and a Polar watch RS 800 worn for at least 2.5 days. The seafarers spent an average of 28.2% of the day for leisure time activities and 32.6% for sleeping. A significantly higher energy consumption was found among deck ratings compared to engine room personnel and nautical officers. Across all occupational groups, the variability of the heart rate was lower during sleeping hours than during leisure time. Suggestions for substantial improvement of the leisure time opportunities on board included more frequent and free opportunities for telecommunication (59.1%), shorter work assignments, and a stronger cohesion of the crew. The following coping strategies were paramount: \"calming down/settling down\" (41.9%), getting in touch with the family (32.0%) and relaxing/sleeping (30.4%). The limited heart rate variability during sleeping hours suggests a reduced quality of sleep that might be due to the permanent heaving motions of the vessel, noise, and vibration. The (deck) ratings had more physical activities that corresponded with their higher energy consumption during leisure time. Altogether, there is a need to optimize opportunities for relaxation and recreation on board, taking into consideration characteristics of the different occupational and ethnic groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31114964/"}

However, most of the world's cultures practice some form of parent-infant cosleeping. In addition, no previous polysomnographic studies in infants examined the frequency of electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals. This is the first study to assess (a) EEG arousals in infants and their relationship to sleep stages; (b) the impact on arousals of mother-infant bed sharing; and (c) the temporal overlap of infant with maternal arousals during bed sharing. Three nights of polysomnography were performed in 35 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs when the infants were 11 to 15 weeks old. An adaptation night was followed by one bed sharing night and one solitary sleeping night. Twenty infants had been bed sharing since birth and 15 were routine solitary sleepers. Both epochal awakenings (EWs), based on 30-second epoch scoring of sleep-wake stages, and more transient arousals (TAs) >/=3 seconds were quantified. Stage 3-4 sleep was associated with a striking paucity of EWs and TAs compared with stages 1-2 or rapid eye movement sleep. Bed sharing facilitated EWs and TAs selectively during stage 3-4 sleep. EWs from stage 3-4 sleep were more frequent on the bed sharing night than on the solitary night in both infant groups. Routinely bed sharing infants also exhibited more frequent TAs in stage 3-4 than the routine solitary sleepers in both conditions. In both groups, the number of infant arousals (EWs + TAs) that overlapped the mother's was doubled during bed sharing, with infant arousals leading most often. Mother-infant bed sharing promotes infant arousals. Together with a previous report that bed sharing reduces stage 3-4 sleep, this suggests that normative values for infant sleep must be interpreted within the context of the sleeping environment in which they were established. Given that arousability is diminished in stage 3-4, we speculate that, under otherwise safe conditions, the observed changes in stage 3-4 sleep and arousals associated with bed sharing might be protective to infants at risk for SIDS because of a hypothesized arousal deficit. The responsivity of the mother to infant arousals during bed sharing might also be protective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9346985/"}

Forty-one normal, full-term infants were observed in a warmer-skin temperature maintained at 36.1 degree C--located in a sound-attenuated room for 1 hr during 2 successive mid-feeding periods. The infant's state was recorded on a check-list every 10 sec using the following categories for sleep and wakefulness: Quiet Sleep A, Quiet Sleep B, Active Sleep Without REM, Active Sleep With REM, Active Sleep With Dense REM, Drowsy, Alert Inactivity, WAKING Activity, Fussing, Crying, and Indefinite State. Immediately following the completion of each observation, the 2 observers made independent judgments of the degree of organization shown by the infant, using a 6-point scale. Over the two 1-hr observations, only Quiet Sleep A, Quiet Sleep B, and Crying showed any consistency. Active Sleep as typically defined showed no consistency whatsoever. However, 2 of the 3 components of Active Sleep were significantly reliability measures for the 2 observations; in sleeping infants all 3 components of active sleep showed high reliability. These results indicate that Active Sleep may be a composite of at least 3 meaningful categories. To look at overall state organization in the neonate, including both sleep and wake states, we considered Active Sleep as 3 separate states and then combined the resulting 11 behavioral states into derived clusters such that each combination of states showed a test-retest reliability above .52. With these 5 state clusters we viewed each infant's state behaviors in terms of a profile depicting the percent of time spent in each state cluster. We found a close association between these profiles and the subjective judgments of sleep-wake state organization made by the observers. The results clearly indicate that a 1-hr observation provides reliable information on individual sleep-wake states in the newborn.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/182605/"}

This constrains the identification of other determinants driving parasite infections. Here, we investigate for the first time intestinal parasites in two sympatric arboreal primate species, which share similar activity patterns, feeding ecology, body size and sociality, and cope with the same climate conditions, but differ in sleeping site ecology: the Milne-Edward's sportive lemur (Lepilemur edwardsi) and the Western woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis). Comparison of these two species aimed to test whether differences in sleeping sites are related to differences in parasite infection patterns. Additionally, gender and seasonal factors were taken into account. Animals were radio-collared to record their sleeping site dynamics and to collect fecal samples to assess intestinal parasitism during both the dry and the rainy season. Only low parasite diversity was detected, which is attributable to the strict arboreal lifestyle of these lemurs, limiting their contact with infective parasite stages. L. edwardsi, which sleeps in tree holes and repeatedly uses the same sleeping site, excreted eggs of strongyle and oxyurid nematodes, whereby strongyles always occurred in coinfection with oxyurids. In contrast, A. occidentalis, which sleeps on open branches and frequently changes sleeping sites, only excreted eggs of strongyle nematodes. This difference can be attributed to a potential favorable environment presented by tree holes for infective stages, facilitating parasitic transmission. Additionally, Strongylida in A. occidentalis were only observed in the rainy season, suggesting an arrested development during the dry season in the nematodes' life cycle. Males and females of both lemur species showed the same frequency of parasitism. No differences in body mass of infected and non-infected individuals were observed, indicating that the animals' body condition remains unaffected by the detected gastrointestinal parasites. The comparison of two primate hosts with a very similar lifestyle suggests an influence of the sleeping site ecology on intestinal parasites. In A. occidentalis there was a clear seasonal difference in strongyle egg excretion. These results improve our understanding of the parasite ecology in these endangered primate species, which may be critical in the light of species conservation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005645/"}

The sample consisted of 2,241 (53.5% girls) Estonian and Swedish children (9-10 years) and adolescents (15-16 years), from the European Youth Heart Study, in 1998-1999. Sleep duration was calculated by the difference between self-reported bedtime and time for getting up on a normal weekday. Sedentary time/physical activity was measured by accelerometry (valid data on 1,462 participants). Adolescents had lower odds than children, and Swedish higher odds than Estonian, of meeting the sleep recommendations (>9 h) (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.17-0.27; and 1.32, 1.07-1.61, respectively). Participants sleeping longer than 10 h spent more time on physical activities (all intensities) and less time on sedentary activities than those sleeping shorter durations (all P < 0.001). The associations with physical activity became non-significant after additional adjustment for age or sexual maturation (Tanner stages), whereas the associations with sedentary time became borderline significant (P = 0.09/0.03, for age and Tanner, respectively). In conclusion, these results do not suggest a link between sleep durations and activity in a relatively large sample of children and adolescents from two European countries. Consequently, the common assumption that physical activity is a mediator in the relationship between short sleep durations and obesity is not supported by our findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21380543/"}

During nine long-range AEMS missions, pilots kept a sleep and sleepiness logbook and wore a wrist activity monitor to evaluate the timing of sleep/wake. Missions had a mean duration of 20 h 00 min ± 2 h 39 min, involved two to four flight legs, and were crewed by three or four pilots who rotated between operating and sleeping in curtained-off bunks. The pilots obtained a mean of 15 h 26 min ± 4 h 51 min and 7 h 54 min ± 1 h 33 min of sleep in the 48 h and 24 h prior to checking in for duty, respectively. During missions, a mean of 3 h 33 min ± 1 h 46 min of sleep was taken, usually across two in-flight sleep periods. Karolinska Sleepiness Scores (KSS) at top of climb and top of descent were typically less than 5 ('neither alert nor sleepy'). A small number of individual higher KSS scores were recorded on the longest missions and on flights between 02:00 and 06:00. These findings suggest that despite the long duration, timing, and multileg nature of AEMS missions, it is possible via careful design and management to operate these missions with appropriate levels of pilot alertness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25197895/"}

Reduced napping behavior is associated with an advance in the timing of the circadian system; however, it is unknown if this advance represents a standard response of the circadian clock to altered patterns of light exposure or if it additionally reflects features of the developing circadian system. Using a mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker, we investigated the impact of napping and non-napping patterns of light exposure on entrained circadian phases. Simulated light schedules were based on published data from 20 children (34.2 ± 2.0 months) with habitual napping or non-napping sleep patterns (15 nappers). We found the model predicted different circadian phases for napping and non-napping light patterns: both the decrease in afternoon light during the nap and the increase in evening light associated with napping toddlers' later bedtimes contributed to the observed circadian phase difference produced between napping and non-napping light schedules. We systematically quantified the effects on phase shifting of nap duration, timing, and light intensity, finding larger phase delays occurred for longer and earlier naps. In addition, we simulated phase response curves to a 1-h light pulse and 1-h dark pulse to predict phase and intensity dependence of these changes in light exposure. We found the light pulse produced larger shifts compared with the dark pulse, and we analyzed the model dynamics to identify the features contributing to this asymmetry. These findings suggest that napping status affects circadian timing due to altered patterns of light exposure, with the dynamics of the circadian clock and light processing mediating the effects of the dark pulse associated with a daytime nap.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427666/"}

Given the important role sleep plays in learning and memory, here we extend this work to evaluate whether nightly sleep duration predicts change in end-of-semester grade point average (GPA). First-year college students from three independent universities provided sleep actigraphy for a month early in their winter/spring academic term across five studies. Findings showed that greater early-term total nightly sleep duration predicted higher end-of-term GPA, an effect that persisted even after controlling for previous-term GPA and daytime sleep. Specifically, every additional hour of average nightly sleep duration early in the semester was associated with an 0.07 increase in end-of-term GPA. Sensitivity analyses using sleep thresholds also indicated that sleeping less than 6 h each night was a period where sleep shifted from helpful to harmful for end-of-term GPA, relative to previous-term GPA. Notably, predictive relationships with GPA were specific to total nightly sleep duration, and not other markers of sleep, such as the midpoint of a student's nightly sleep window or bedtime timing variability. These findings across five studies establish nightly sleep duration as an important factor in academic success and highlight the potential value of testing early academic term total sleep time interventions during the formative first year of college.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36780521/"}

Pups sniffed in response to the highest concentrations of DMDS, exhibiting a lower olfactory threshold when awake. Surprisingly, sniffing occurred even while pups remained asleep. Sniffing was mediated by the olfactory system, as evidenced by the abolition of sniffing when the lateral olfactory tracts, were cut and the retention of rapid arousal in response to a trigeminal stimulant, acetic acid. Finally, sleeping pups presented with acetic acid awakened without sniffing.

Participants' demographic variables including age, gender, religion, education level, marital and financial status, any chronic illness, previous experiences of music intervention as well as depression levels were collected. Participants were asked to listen to soft, instrumental slow sedative music without lyrics, of approximately 60-80 beats per minute, and 40 min in duration, for 6 weeks. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the effects of the intervention on the elders' sleep quality. Significant reductions in PSQI scores were found in the intervention group (n=28) from baseline (mean±SD, 10.2±2.5) to week 6 (5.9±2.4, p<0.001), while there were no changes in the control group (n=32) from baseline (9.0±2.4) to week 6 (9.5±2.6).

This study tested the simultaneous contribution of several health-promoting behaviors and factors and examined listening to music and positive social interaction by means of perceived respect as new potentially preventive and health-promoting behaviors and factors using an ambulatory assessment design. Seventy-seven young healthy adults (38 women, 23.9 ± 4.5 years) completed surveys on their psychological state (i.e., mood, stress, and fatigue) five times a day for four consecutive days. A saliva sample was collected with each data entry to explore the physiological stress markers salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase, and flow rate as further outcome variables. As predictors, perceived respect, self-reported physical activity, the sleep's restfulness, daily coffee, alcohol, vegetable/fruit consumption, and music listening behavior were recorded. Overall, restful sleep, mean daily perceived respect, and listening to music were most clearly associated with more positive psychological states, that is, better mood and lower fatigue and perceived stress. Associations with daily alcohol, coffee, and vegetable/fruit consumption appeared rather minor. While perceived respect scores were associated with lower daily cortisol output, coffee consumption was positively related to daily cortisol and alpha-amylase. Self-reported physical activity was unrelated to either outcome measure. These findings provide important insights regarding potential resources of health (i.e., music and respect), their covariation, and which psycho-physiological mechanisms may underlie the links between health factors and well-being.

This study addresses these gaps. Using six waves of longitudinal data from the 2011-2016 Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (N = 6633), this study examined the relationship between weekday sleep duration, WCS duration, and two measures of adolescent health, body mass index (BMI) and self-rated health (SRH). We estimated fixed effects models to account for individual-level heterogeneity. Fixed effects estimates suggest that part of the associations between short sleep duration and adolescent health are confounded by unobserved individual heterogeneity (62% for BMI and 30% for poor SRH), although the associations remain statistically significant. Sleeping less than 6 h increased BMI by 0.203 and the probability of reporting poor SRH by about 2 percentage points. Controlling for individual heterogeneity, however, changed the sign of the WCS duration coefficient, suggesting that a longer WCS duration is positively associated with BMI (b = 0.021).

We experimentally tested whether nests provide insulation by measuring heat loss within and outside nests, and took detailed measurements of the number, size, and type of materials used in nest building across two dry-habitat research sites (Fongoli, Senegal, and Issa, Tanzania). We tested application of principal components analysis (PCA) to extract composite quantitative measures of the key components of shape and architecture, before testing how PCs vary across populations with overnight weather conditions that reflect hypothesized thermoregulatory function. Heat loss is greater and occurs faster outside of nests. PCA allowed meaningful comparison of nests within and between sites. Nest variation at both sites revealed chimpanzees built thicker nests in cooler conditions and used more broken branches and support in moister conditions. Chimpanzees in Fongoli used more lining and mattress material in colder conditions, whilst in Issa nest depth and support branch size were larger in windier conditions. Shape and architectural measures reflected insulation and stability of nest structure. Chimpanzees in Fongoli and Issa may achieve the same functional goals by adjusting nest shape and architecture in different ways.

Three vigilance states were determined using visual scoring and EEG power spectra (0.25-25 Hz) computed for 4-s episodes. The effects of two methods of total sleep deprivation (SD) were examined on vigilance states and the EEG power spectrum. The animals were subjected to 24 h SD by: (1) forced locomotion in a slowly rotating drum, (2) gentle handling whenever the hamsters attempted a sleeping posture. In addition, the hamsters were subjected to SD by handling during the first 3 h of the L period. Sleep predominated in the L period (78.2% of 12 h) and the D period (51.2%). The power spectra of the 3 vigilance states were similar during the L and D period. In NREM sleep, power density values in the low frequency range (0.25-6.0 Hz) exceeded those of REM sleep and W by a maximum factor of 8.3 and 2.8, respectively. At frequencies above 16 Hz, NREM and REM sleep power density values were significantly lower than during W. A progressive decrease in power density for low EEG frequencies (0.25-7 Hz) during NREM sleep was seen in the course of the L period. Power density values of higher frequencies (8-25 Hz) increased at the end of the L period and remained high during the first hours of the D period. The effect of prolonged SD on vigilance states and EEG spectra was similar by both methods and strikingly small compared to similar results in rats. In contrast, 3 h SD induced a large and more prolonged effect. The similarities and differences of sleep and sleep regulation are summarized for the hamster, rat and man.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3668881/"}

Research to date has demonstrated a relationship between low parental cry tolerance and infant sleep problems. The aim of this study was to explore whether three emotion regulation strategies could increase parental cry tolerance. This study utilised a quasi-experimental design. We recruited 83 females (Mage= 32, SD= 5.26) comprising 3 groups: mothers of good sleeping infants aged 6-24 months, mothers of poor sleeping infants aged 6-24 months, and good sleeping women aged 23-40 years without children. Participants were instructed to listen to crying audio segments and indicate when they felt the child needed to be tended to (measured in seconds). This crying audio was paired with one of three emotion-regulation strategies (i.e., music, gaming, reappraisal). Each participant completed all 4 cry conditions which were counterbalanced to control for order effects. We found that all three strategies yielded significantly longer reaction times (indicating higher cry tolerance) compared to the control condition (p <.001). We also found that mothers of poor sleepers and good sleeping women benefitted from all three emotion regulation strategies compared to control (p <.001 and p= <.05, respectively). The cry tolerance of mothers of good sleepers, on the other hand, did not differ between the control condition and any of the strategies (all ps >.05). This demonstrates that cry tolerance can be increased using emotion regulation strategies, such as distraction via music or gaming, and reappraisal. This has clinical implications for families implementing behavioural sleep interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37121221/"}

A particular challenge is sleep. A further challenge is coping with the demands of boarding with its potential impact on psychological well-being. To explore how boarders' sleep differs from that of their day-student peers, and how this relates to psychological well-being. 309 students (59 boarding students and 250 day-students, at one Adelaide school) completed the School Sleep Habits Survey, Depression-Anxiety-Stress-Scale-21 (DASS-21), and Flourishing Scale. Boarding students additionally completed the Utrecht Homesickness Scale. Thirteen boarding students described experiences of sleeping in boarding through focus groups. Boarding students, compared to day-students reported 40 minutes more sleep per weeknight (p < .001), with earlier sleep onset (p = .026), and later wake-up (p = .008) times. No significant differences were observed between boarding' and day-students' DASS-21 scores. Hierarchical regression revealed longer total weekday sleep time predicted higher psychological well-being in both boarding and day-students. Additionally, in boarding students, low homesickness-loneliness and homesickness-ruminations further predicted psychological well-being. Thematic analysis of boarding students' focus group responses revealed that night-time routine, and restricting technology use at night facilitated sleep. This study supports - in both boarding and day-students - the importance of sleep for adolescent well-being. Sleep hygiene can play an important role in boarding student sleep, especially: regular night-time routine and restricting technology use at night. Finally, these findings suggest that poor sleep and homesickness have an adverse effect on boarding student psychological well-being. This study highlights the importance of strategies which promote sleep hygiene and minimize homesickness, in boarding school students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37409726/"}

We tested different hypotheses regarding possible ultimate causes of sleeping-site selection. Most sleeping sites were located in areas of tall, mature forest. Of the 34 sleeping sites the monkeys used during 203 nights, five were more frequently used than the others (more than 20 times each, constituting 67% of the nights). Four species of tree (Peltophorum dubium, Parapiptadenia rigida, Copaifera langsdorfii and Cordia trichotoma) were the most frequently used. They constituted 82% of all the trees used, though they represent only 12% of the trees within the monkeys' home range which had a diameter at breast height (DBH) > 48.16 cm (1 SD below the mean DBH of sleeping trees). The sleeping trees share a set of characteristics not found in other trees: they are tall emergent (mean height +/- SD = 31.1+/-5.2 m) with large DBH (78.5+/-30.3 cm), they have large crown diameter (14+/-5.5 m), and they have many horizontal branches and forks. Adult females usually slept with their kin and infants, while peripheral adult males sometimes slept alone in nearby trees. We reject parasite avoidance as an adaptive explanation for the pattern of sleeping site use. Our results and those from other studies suggest that predation avoidance is a predominant factor driving sleeping site preferences. The patterns of aggregation at night and the preference for trees with low probability of shedding branches suggest that social preferences and safety from falling during windy nights may also affect sleeping tree selection. The importance of other factors, such as seeking comfort and maintaining group cohesion, was not supported by our results. Other capuchin populations show different sleeping habits which can be explained by differences in forest structure and by demographic differences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10768350/"}

Acute partial sleep deprivation (PSD; sleep ≤ 6 h) can increase BP, associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Acute exercise can reduce BP for up to 24 h, a phenomenon termed postexercise hypotension. The present study tested whether aerobic exercise could mitigate the augmented 24-h ambulatory BP caused by acute PSD. Twenty-four young otherwise healthy adults (22 ± 3 yr; 14 females; self-reported chronotypes: 6 early/10 intermediate/8 late; Pittsburgh sleep quality index: 17 good/7 poor sleepers) completed a randomized crossover trial in which, on different days, they slept normally (2300-0700), restricted sleep [0330-0700 (PSD)], and cycled for 50 min (70-80% predicted heart rate maximum) before PSD. Ambulatory BP was assessed every 30 min until 2100 the next day. Acute PSD increased 24-h systolic BP (control 117 ± 9 mmHg, PSD 122 ± 9 mmHg; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and prior exercise attenuated (exercise + PSD 120 ± 9 mmHg; <i>P</i> = 0.04 vs. PSD) but did not fully reverse this response (exercise + PSD, <i>P</i> = 0.02 vs. control). Subgroup analysis revealed that the 24-h systolic BP reduction following exercise was specific to late types (PSD 119 ± 7 vs. exercise + PSD 116 ± 6 mmHg; <i>P</i> < 0.05). Overall, habitual sleep quality was negatively correlated with the change in daytime systolic BP following PSD (<i>r</i> = -0.56, <i>P</i> < 0.01). These findings suggest that the ability of aerobic cycling exercise to counteract the hemodynamic effects of acute PSD in young adults may be dependent on chronotype and that habitual sleep quality can predict the daytime BP response to acute PSD.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We demonstrate that cycling exercise attenuates, but does not fully reverse, the augmented 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) response caused by acute partial sleep deprivation (PSD). This response was primarily observed in late chronotypes. Furthermore, daytime BP after acute PSD is related to habitual sleep quality, with better sleepers being more prone to BP elevations. This suggests that habitual sleeping habits can influence BP responses to acute PSD and their interactions with prior cycling exercise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38038716/"}

To study the relationship of actigraph-derived activity data to BP variability in more detail, 30 patients underwent paired monitoring 1 to 18 (mean 8) days apart. Mean waking BP was then corrected for activity to determine whether this technique could improve reproducibility. Statistically but not clinically significant differences between waking and daytime BP were seen, with larger and potentially clinically relevant differences between sleeping and nighttime BP. The midnight to 7 AM time period gave the best estimate of observed sleeping time and the nocturnal dip of BP. The average correlation between activity and BP was 0.25 for systolic and 0.34 for diastolic BP, but with wide variation in the strength of the relationship both between and within individual patients. On average, activity accounts for 20% of systolic and 26% of diastolic BP variation. Correcting the mean waking BP to a standard activity level reduced within-patient variation by 6%/9%. This made no significant difference to overall reproducibility, perhaps because variability in this sample was low before adjustment, with the standard deviation of the difference equal to 8/4 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8347313/"}

What should sleep do with that information it chooses to keep? For information that is retained, sleep can integrate it into existing memory networks, look for common patterns and distill overarching rules, or simply stabilize and strengthen the memory exactly as it was learned.

In terms of pressure, the difference remained five times higher for the back (209 +/- 18 g/cm(2)) than the foot (40 g +/- 7 g/cm(2)). Because the king penguin incubates its single egg and rears its young chick on its feet, the low threshold measured at this level could be viewed as an adaptation against progeny predation.

Results showed that there was a phase difference in the circadian rhythm of core temperature that was associated with the morningness score, with calculations that \"morning types\" would be phased earlier than \"evening types\" by up to about 3 h. This difference in phase (which was also statistically significant when the group was divided by a median split into a \"morning group\" and an \"evening group\") could not be attributed to effects of waking activity and existed in spite of the subjects keeping the same sleep-wake schedule. Moreover, it persisted when the subjects' data had been purified and when the data were obtained from the constant routine. That is, there was an endogenous component to this difference in phase of the core temperature.

Even though the morning group was sleeping at a later phase of their circadian temperature rhythm than was the evening group, neither group showed a fall of temperature due to sleep that varied with time elapsed since the temperature acrophase.

We use the recently established sleep model system organism Drosophila melanogaster to examine dynamic changes in gene expression during sleep and during prolonged wakefulness in the brain. Our experimental design controls for circadian processes by killing animals at three matched time points from the beginning of the consolidated rest period [Zeitgeber time (ZT) 14)] under two conditions, sleep deprived and spontaneously sleeping. Using ANOVA at a false discovery rate of 5%, we have identified 252 genes that were differentially expressed between sleep-deprived and control groups in the Drosophila brain. Using linear trends analysis, we have separated the significant differentially expressed genes into nine temporal expression patterns relative to a common anchor point (ZT 14). The most common expression pattern is a decrease during extended wakefulness but no change during spontaneous sleep (n = 114). Genes in this category were involved in protein production (n = 47), calcium homeostasis, and membrane excitability (n = 5). Multiple mechanisms, therefore, act to limit wakefulness. In addition, by studying the effects of the mechanical stimulus used in our deprivation studies during the period when the animals are predominantly active, we provide evidence for a previously unappreciated role for the Drosophila immune system in the brain response to stress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16954408/"}

Weekend catch-up sleep (WCS) serves as a compensatory strategy for sleep deficits, yet its association with MetS in children and adolescents remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether WCS is related to a decreased risk for MetS in sleep-deprived individuals of this population. A total of 8930 participants aged 7-17 years with weekday sleep insufficiency were selected from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance of Children and Lactating Women (2017). Sleeping hours on weekdays/weekends and WCS duration were calculated based on self-reported weekday/weekend sleep schedules. MetS was defined using Cook's criteria. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression models adjusting for covariates were used to assess the relationships between WCS and MetS. WCS had a significantly protective association with the prevalence of MetS (p < 0.05). RCS analysis revealed an L-shaped relationship (p for non-linear = 0.029), with 1 h of WCS emerging as a potentially optimal duration.

The current study examined the occurrence of co-sleeping in both healthy and clinically anxious children and its associated sleep patterns. A total of 113 children (ages 6-12), 75 with primary generalized anxiety disorder and 38 healthy controls, participated along with their primary caregiver. Families completed structured diagnostic assessments, and parents reported on their child's co-sleeping behaviors and anxiety severity. Children provided reports of anxiety severity and completed one week of wrist-based actigraphy to assess objective sleep patterns. A significantly greater proportion of anxious youth compared to healthy children co-slept, and greater anxiety severity was related to more frequent co-sleeping. Co-sleeping in anxious youth was associated with a delay in sleep timing and with greater sleep variability (i.e., more variable nightly sleep duration). All analyses controlled for child age, race/ethnicity, family income, and parental marital status. Co-sleeping is highly common in anxious school-aged children, with more than 1 in 3 found to co-sleep at least sometimes (2-4 times a week). Co-sleeping was even more common for youth with greater anxiety severity. Increased dependence on others to initiate and maintain sleep may contribute to poorer sleep in this population via shifted schedules and more variable sleep patterns.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29302831/"}

In the present study, the effects of playing a computer game and using a bright display on nocturnal sleep were examined in a laboratory. Seven male adults (24.7+/-5.6 years old) played exciting computer games with a bright display (game-BD) and a dark display (game-DD) and performed simple tasks with low mental load as a control condition in front of a BD (control-BD) and DD (control-DD) between 23:00 and 1:45 hours in randomized order and then went to bed at 2:00 hours and slept until 8:00 hours. Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions. No significant effects of either computer games or BD were found on slow-wave sleep.

Likewise, studies of interhemispheric coordination during sleep<sup>4-6</sup> are often hard to connect precisely to known sleep circuits and mechanisms. Here, by recording from the claustra of sleeping bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps), we show that, although the onsets and offsets of Pogona rapid-eye-movement (REM<sub>P</sub>) and slow-wave sleep are coordinated bilaterally, these two sleep states differ markedly in their inter-claustral coordination. During slow-wave sleep, the claustra produce sharp-wave ripples independently of one another, showing no coordination. By contrast, during REM<sub>P</sub> sleep, the potentials produced by the two claustra are precisely coordinated in amplitude and time. These signals, however, are not synchronous: one side leads the other by about 20 ms, with the leading side switching typically once per REM<sub>P</sub> episode or in between successive episodes. The leading claustrum expresses the stronger activity, suggesting bilateral competition. This competition does not occur directly between the two claustra or telencephalic hemispheres. Rather, it occurs in the midbrain and depends on the integrity of a GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) nucleus of the isthmic complex, which exists in all vertebrates and is known in birds to underlie bottom-up attention and gaze control. These results reveal that a winner-take-all-type competition exists between the two sides of the brain of Pogona, which originates in the midbrain and has precise consequences for claustrum activity and coordination during REM<sub>P</sub> sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36949193/"}

This study, combined with sensor application, aims to explore the determinants of perceived comfort when using smart bedding to provide empirical evidence for improving sleep quality. This study was conducted in a standard sleep laboratory in Quanzhou, China, from March to April of 2023. Perceived comfort was evaluated using the Subjective Lying Comfort Evaluation on a seven-point rating scale, and body pressure distribution was measured using a pressure sensor. Correlation analysis was employed to analyze the relationship between perceived comfort and body pressure, and multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors of perceived comfort. The results showed that body pressure was partially correlated with perceived comfort, and sleep posture significantly influenced perceived comfort. In addition, height, weight, and body mass index are common factors that influence comfort. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the angular range of boards based on their comfort performance to adjust sleeping posture and equalize pressure distribution. Future research should consider aspects related to the special needs of different populations (such as height and weight), as well as whether users are elderly and whether they have particular diseases.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the brain reactivity (evoked potentials) of subjects with high (HR, N = 18) and low (LR, N = 18) DRF during wakefulness and sleep. During data acquisition, the subjects were presented with sounds to be ignored (first names randomly presented among pure tones) while they were watching a silent movie or sleeping.

During wakefulness, the attention-orienting brain response (P3a) and a late parietal response were larger in HR than in LR. During sleep, we also observed between-group differences at the latency of the P3a during N2 and at later latencies during all sleep stages.

The registration was done in the awake state, during falling asleep and during sleep. During falling asleep the average urethral pressure as well as the UPV amplitude and frequencies decreased and remained at a lower stable level during sleep. Urethral pressure and its variations seemed to be interrelated since the UPV frequency and amplitude decreased when the average UP decreased.

It is unknown whether sleep itself affects ghrelin levels or whether circadian networks are involved. Therefore, we studied the effect of sleep deprivation on nocturnal ghrelin secretion. In healthy male volunteers, plasma levels of ghrelin, cortisol, and human growth hormone (hGH) were measured during two experimental sessions of 24 h each: once when the subjects were allowed to sleep between 2300 and 0700 and once when they were kept awake throughout the night. During sleep, ghrelin levels increased during the early part of the night and decreased in the morning. This nocturnal increase was blunted during sleep deprivation, and ghrelin levels increased only slightly until the early morning. Ghrelin secretion during the first hours of sleep correlated positively with peak hGH concentrations. We conclude that the nocturnal increase in ghrelin levels is more likely to be caused by sleep-associated processes than by circadian influences. During the first hours of sleep, ghrelin might promote sleep-associated hGH secretion and contribute to the promotion of SWS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14871884/"}

It is unknown whether this subjective-objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture 'wake-like' brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro- and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought-like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake.

In this protocol, we describe a procedure for performing multichannel local field potential (LFP) recordings in the fruit fly, with a flexible system that can be adapted to different experimental paradigms and situations. The approach uses electrodes containing multiple recording sites (16), allowing the acquisition of large amounts of neuronal activity data from a transect through the brain while flies are still able to sleep. The approach starts by tethering the fly, followed by positioning it on an air-supported ball. A multichannel silicon probe is then inserted laterally into the fly brain via one eye, allowing for recording of electrical signals from the retina through to the central brain. These recordings can be acquired under spontaneous conditions or in the presence of visual stimuli, and the minimal surgery promotes long-term recordings (e.g., overnight). Sleep and wake can be tracked using infrared cameras, which allow for the measurement of locomotive activity as well as microbehaviors such as proboscis extensions during sleep. The protocol has been optimized to promote subject survivability, which is an important factor when performing long-term (∼16-h) recordings.

Subjects were either paid based on their performance at retest ($1 for each correct answer), or received a flat fee for participation. After a 12 hr interval we observed pronounced benefits of both sleep and reward on memory. Over an extended 24 hr interval we found 1) that an initial night of sleep partially protects memories from subsequent deterioration during wake, and 2) that sleep blocks further deterioration, and may even have a restorative effect on memory, when it follows a full day of wake. Interestingly, the benefit imparted to rewarded (relative to unrewarded) stimuli was equal for sleep and wake subjects, suggesting that the sleeping brain may not differentially process rewarded information, relative to wake. However, looking at the overall impact of sleep relative to reward in this protocol, it was apparent that sleep both imparted a stronger mnemonic boost than reward, and provided a benefit to memory regardless of whether it occurred in the first or the second 12 hrs following task training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21799746/"}

These findings suggest an incomplete arousal process in victims of SIDS. Prone sleep position, a major risk factor for SIDS, has been reported to reduce arousal responses during sleep. The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether the prone sleep position impairs the arousal process in healthy infants. Twenty-four healthy infants were studied polygraphically during 1 night; 12 infants regularly slept supine and 12 infants regularly slept prone. Infants were matched for sex, gestational age, and age at recording. Arousals were differentiated into subcortical activations or cortical arousals, according to the presence of autonomic and/or electroencephalographic changes. Frequencies of subcortical activations and cortical arousals were compared in the prone- and the supine-sleeping infants. Compared with supine sleepers, prone sleepers had significantly fewer cortical arousals during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (p = .043). There were no significant differences in cortical arousals between the 2 groups during non-REM sleep. No significant differences were seen in the frequencies of subcortical activations during both REM and non-REM sleep between supine and prone sleepers. The ratio of cortical arousal to subcortical activation showed no significant differences between the prone and the supine sleepers. Prone sleep position decreased the frequency of cortical arousals but did not change the frequency of subcortical activations, as has been previously found in SIDS victims. These results suggest specific pathways for impairment of the arousal process in SIDS victims.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16796217/"}

ISFs correlate with the amplitude dynamics of fast (>1 Hz) neuronal oscillations, and may arise from permeability fluctuations of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is unclear if physiological rhythms like respiration drive or track fast cortical oscillations, and the role of sleep in this coupling is unknown. We used high-density full-band electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy human volunteers (N = 21) to measure concurrently the ISFs, respiratory pulsations, and fast neuronal oscillations during periods of wakefulness and sleep, and to assess the strength and direction of their phase-amplitude coupling. The phases of ISFs and respiration were both coupled with the amplitude of fast neuronal oscillations, with stronger ISF coupling being evident during sleep. Phases of ISF and respiration drove the amplitude dynamics of fast oscillations in sleeping and waking states, with different contributions. ISFs in slow cortical potentials and respiration together significantly determine the dynamics of fast cortical oscillations. We propose that these slow physiological phases play a significant role in coordinating cortical excitability, which is a fundamental aspect of brain function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37972532/"}

Prematurity, defined by birth occurring prior the 37th week of gestation, disrupts normal brain in-utero programming, with long-lasting consequences that carry a high social burden.

In this pilot study we aimed to describe the 24-h distribution of sleep states among very preterm infants (VPI), and to correlate it with neurobehavioral assessment up to 6 months of corrected age (CA). Secondly, we aimed to assess if the presence of a brain lesion detected at MRI could affect sleep duration, architecture, and quality. Ten VPI were assessed at 32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) with a 24-h video-polysomnography and received a neurobehavioral examination at the time of the recording, at term equivalent age (TEA), and at 6 months CA. Analysis of sleep stages distribution and transitions, and power spectra were conducted. Total sleep time and amount of quiet sleep positively correlated with neurological, and neurobehavioral assessment at 32 weeks PMA, at TEA, and at 6 months CA, while Sleep Onset Active Sleep (SOAS) had a negative association. Infants carrying brain lesions showed lower QS time accompanied by a higher prevalence of AS + SOAS and showed a gradient for higher power of posterior slow activity (slow δ and δ) during SOAS in the left hemisphere posterior regions.

{"id": "3764290", "title": "Sleeping and waking thought: effects of external stimulation.", "text": "This article describes some of the variables that distinguish waking and sleeping (REM) thought. Mentation reports from the waking state, as described here, tend to have more topic shifts than those from the REM state, which often have a single-theme storylike quality. It is assumed that heightened response thresholds to sensory stimuli, in conjunction with the state of high cortical activation typical of REM sleep, account for the storylike quality of REM imagery. In this experiment, an intermittent auditory stimulus was the model for environmental influences on waking mentation. It was hypothesized that the removal of this intermittent auditory stimulation, simulating in waking subjects the increased sensory thresholds of REM sleep, would decrease the number of topic shifts in spontaneous thought. It was expected that this reduction in number of topics would approach levels achieved in REM sleep. Thirty subjects participated in individual sessions in which they lay in a sound-attenuated, lightproof room with eyes closed. They were asked for mentation reports as follows: after lying awake with external stimulation (W), after lying awake without external stimulation (WO), and after being wakened from REM sleep. Transcribed mentation reports were scored on seven content rating scales, including total recall count, a count of all words in which the subject was describing his/her experience during the previous interval, and number of thought units (TU) per report, a count of the distinct, thematically homogeneous thought sequences. Hotelling t-squared tests were performed with the different states as the independent variables and the scores on the cognitive scales as the dependent variables. The major factor distinguishing mentation reports of waking subjects and subjects wakened from REM sleep was the TU count, with waking subjects changing topics more frequently. Removal of the intermittent auditory stimulus reduced the number of topic shifts in waking subjects, with a significance approaching the 95% confidence limit.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3764290/"}
{"id": "20462704", "title": "Recalibrating sleep: is recalibration and readjustment of sense organs and brain-body connections the core function of sleep?", "text": "Sleep is an enigma because we all know what it means and does to us, yet a scientific explanation for why animals including humans need to sleep is still lacking. However, the enigma can be resolved if the animal body is regarded as a purposeful machine whose moving parts are coordinated with spatial information provided by a disparate array of sense organs. The performance of all complex machines deteriorates with time due to inevitable instrument drift of the individual sensors combined with wear and tear of the moving parts which result in declining precision and coordination. Peak performance is restored by servicing the machine, which involves calibrating the sensors against baselines and standards, then with one another, and finally readjusting the connections between instruments and moving parts. It follows that the animal body and its sensors will also require regular calibration of sense organs and readjustment of brain-body connections which will need to be carried out while the animal is not in functional but in calibration mode. I suggest that this is the core function of sleep. This recalibration hypothesis of sleep can be tested subjectively. We all know from personal experience that sleep is needed to recover from tiredness that sets in towards the end of a long day. This tiredness, which is quite distinct from mental or muscular exhaustion caused by strenuous exertion, manifests itself in deteriorating general performance: the sense organs lose precision, movements become clumsy and the mind struggles to maintain focus. We can all agree that sleep sharpens the sense organs and restores agility to mind and body. I now propose that the sense of freshness and buoyancy after a good night's sleep is the feeling of recalibrated sensory and motor systems. The hypothesis can be tested rigorously by examining available data on sleep cycles and stages against this background. For instance, REM and deep sleep cycles can be interpreted as successive, separate calibration runs of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and the sensory-motor systems, respectively, amongst other functions running in parallel, such as dreaming. Because the split-second connections between sensory information and emotional responses will also require calibration, some aspects of dreaming could be interpreted in this light. Much of the baffling behaviour and patterns of brain activity of sleeping animals and humans make sense in the framework of this technological paradigm since different animal lineages will have evolved different techniques to achieve calibration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20462704/"}

While REM sleep is characterized by brain activity similar to wakefulness, the EEG activity changes drastically with the emergence of K-complexes, sleep spindles and slow oscillations during NREM sleep. These changes are regulated by circadian and ultradian rhythms, which emerge from an intricate interplay between multiple neuronal populations in the brainstem, forebrain and hypothalamus and the resulting varying levels of neuromodulators. Recently, there has been progress in the understanding of those rhythms both from a physiological as well as theoretical perspective. However, how these neuromodulators affect the generation of the different EEG patterns and their temporal dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we build upon previous work on a neural mass model of the sleeping cortex and investigate the effect of those neuromodulators on the dynamics of the cortex and the corresponding transition between wakefulness and the different sleep stages.

This classical definition of sleep has been applied effectively across the animal kingdom to identify this common behavioral state in a growing list of creatures, from mammals to invertebrates. Yet, it remains unclear whether decreased behavioral responsiveness during sleep is necessarily associated with decreased responsiveness in brain activity, especially in insects. Here, we performed long-term multichannel electrophysiology in tethered Drosophila melanogaster flies exposed continuously to repetitive visual stimuli. Flies were still able to sleep under these visual stimulation conditions, as determined by traditional immobility duration criteria for the field. Interestingly, we did not find any difference between responses to repetitive visual stimuli during sleep compared with wake when we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) across a transect of the fly brain from optic lobes to the central brain. However, we did find LFP responses to be altered when visual stimuli were variable and of lower probability, especially in the central brain. Central brain responses to less predictable or 'deviant' stimuli were lower during the deepest stage of sleep, a time of quiescence characterized by more regular proboscis extensions. This shows that the sleeping fly brain processes low-probability visual stimuli in a different way from more repeated stimuli, and presents Drosophila as a promising model for studying the potential role of sleep in regulating predictive processing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40296777/"}

At baseline and the 2 follow-ups, new polygraphic registration comparing the proportion of treatment responders without position-dependent OSA (non-position-dependent OSA [non-POSA]) and with POSA was used. At the 8-week and 1-year follow-up, 205 and 139 patients were included, respectively. The proportion of responders (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] <10 and/or ≥50% reduction in AHI) was 56% for the non-POSA group and 69% for the POSA group (not significant [NS]). The responders increased at the 1-year follow-up: 68% and 77% for the non-POSA and POSA groups (NS), respectively. The absolute change in AHI in all sleeping positions at 8 weeks was -12.9 (interquartile range, -25.0 to -0.5) in the non-POSA group and -10.5 (interquartile range, -19.9 to -5.3; NS) in the POSA group. However, the decrease in supine AHI was significantly greater among subjects with POSA. In contrast, the decrease in nonsupine AHI was significantly greater in the non-POSA group, an effect that remained at the 1-year follow-up. Our hypothesis that subjects with POSA at baseline would have a higher treatment response rate after oral appliance treatment compared with subjects without POSA was rejected.

Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder which results in disrupted sleep architecture and frequent arousals. Because sleep apnea leads to sleep arousals, and because sleep arousals are thought to result in increased parafunctional activity, we undertook the present study to determine the relationship between sleep apnea and parafunctional activity. We were also interested in assessing the effects of sleep posture on sleep disordered breathing and parafunctional activity. We prospectively studied 24 patients who were referred to the clinical sleep apnea laboratory for study. They underwent standard nocturnal polysomnographic examination; in addition, masticatory activity was measured with a masseter electromyogram. Patients slept in the supine and lateral decubitus positions. Nocturnal clenching was slightly higher in patients with sleep apnea than those without (12.2 vs 7.6 clenches/hr, p = 0.18), and there was a correlation between the clench index (CI) and apnea plus hypopnea index (A + HI) by linear regression (r = 0.49, p less than 0.05). There were significant falls in both the A + HI (64.4 +/- 28.8 vs 36.5 +/- 36.7, p = 0.02) and CI (12.5 +/- 12.1 vs 7.0 +/- 8.6, p = 0.04) in the lateral decubitus vs supine sleeping positions. We conclude that there is an association between obstructive sleep apnea and parafunctional activity, that sleep position affects the incidence of both sleep disordered breathing and parafunctional activity, and that analysis of apneas and hypopneas in both supine and lateral decubitus sleeping positions may be helpful.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3743157/"}

To test these hypotheses, we studied the sleeping trees used by a group of wild silky sifakas (Propithecus candidus) in Marojejy National Park, Madagascar. During this 10-month study, the group slept in 828 sleeping trees from approximately 35 genera. In support of thermoregulation, generalized linear models revealed that as temperature decreased, the number of individuals sleeping together significantly increased and they slept at further distances from the trunk. As rainfall increased, sleep site height significantly increased. Weinmannia was the most frequented tree genus, despite low abundance, accounting for 29% of all sleeping trees. In support of food access, 94.8% of sleeping trees were food trees. Weinmannia is among the most highly preferred food trees. The group slept at a mean height of 16.0 m near the top of tall trees which averaged 19.5 m. Sleep trees were significantly taller than trees in botanical plots within the sifaka's home range. They never slept in the same trees on consecutive nights, and sleeping heights were significantly higher than daytime heights which is consistent with predation avoidance. Social sleeping in groups of 2 or 3 individuals (62.9%) was more common than solitary sleeping (37.1%). At such heights, huddling may increase vigilance and lessen the risk of predation by fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) while also reducing heat loss. These patterns suggest that silky sifaka sleep site choice is influenced by thermoregulation and food access in addition to predation avoidance. We suggest that understanding sleep site use can assist in conservation of species like silky sifakas by enabling researchers to find new groups, protect habitats with key tree species and inform reforestation efforts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34749372/"}

Chronic recording of hippocampal and neocortical slow-wave activity and muscle activity showed that the ibotenic acid treatment had selectively abolished the atropine-sensitive (presumably cholinergic) form of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) normally seen during the tonic component of active sleep. Large-amplitude irregular activity (LIA), that is normally associated with waking immobility and quiet sleep, and the atropine-resistant (probably serotonergic) RSA that normally accompanies phasic muscular activity during active sleep, were also somewhat depressed. However, clear RSA was seen during phasic muscular activity in active sleep and LIA was clearly seen during quiet sleep in all rats. Neocortical activity was not affected by the ibotenic acid treatment. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, both in the sleeping and the waking state, RSA can be produced by either of two distinctive inputs to the hippocampus.

Recent neuroimaging studies revealed that the association cortices of infants show activation related to auditory-stimulus discrimination and novelty detection during sleep. In the present study, we expected that when an auditory cue (beeps) predicted an auditory event (a female voice), specific regions of the infant cortex would show anticipatory activation before the event onset even while sleeping. We examined the cortical activation of 3-month-old infants during delays between the cue and the event by using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. To investigate spatiotemporal changes in cortical activation over the experimental session, we divided the session into two phases (early and late phase) and analyzed each phase separately. In the early phase, the frontal regions showed activation in response to the cue that was followed by the event compared with another cue that was not followed by any event. In the late phase, the temporoparietal region, in addition to the frontal region, showed prominent activation in response to the cue followed by the event. In contrast, when the cue was followed by an event and no-event in equal proportions, cortical activation in response to the cue was not observed in any phase. Sleeping 3-month-old infants showed anticipatory cortical activation in the temporoparietal and frontal regions only in response to the cue predicting the event, suggesting that infants can implicitly form associations between temporally separated events and generate the anticipatory activation before the predictable event. Furthermore, the different time evolution of activation in the temporoparietal and frontal regions suggests that these regions may be involved in different aspects of learning and predicting future events.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19066629/"}

This cross-sectional study examines the preschool wave (n = ∼8950). We estimated nighttime sleep duration from parent's reports of their 4-year-old child's typical weekday bed and wake times. Parents rated their child on 6 different externalizing behaviors (overactivity, anger, aggression, impulsivity, tantrums, and annoying behaviors) on a scale from 1 through 5 using the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale-second edition. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between sleep duration and behavior scores and to control for possible confounders. Results are weighted to total United States population, ∼3,895,100 children born in 2001. Mean sleep duration was 10.47 hours. Mean bedtime was 8:39 PM and wake time was 7:13 AM. The adjusted odds ratios for children sleeping <9.44 hours (1 standard deviation below the mean) versus those sleeping ≥9.44 hours for 6 different externalizing behavior outcomes were as follows: overactivity = 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.65); anger = 1.40 (95% CI, 1.15-1.71); aggression = 1.81 (95% CI, 1.36-2.41); impulsivity = 1.44 (95% CI, 1.12-1.86); tantrums = 1.46 (95% CI, 1.16-1.85); and annoying behaviors = 1.40 (95% CI, 0.97-1.87).

The study was designed to investigate sleep habits, circadian rhythm and subjective satisfaction with sleep.

The average length of nocturnal sleep in the adolescents was 7.3 hrs on weekdays and 10.1 hrs on weekends. They went later to bed and rose earlier than the children, sleeping 1.7 hrs less before schooldays and 1.6 hrs more during the weekend than the 8.5 hrs which were their own sleep estimate. All the children were reported to satisfy their need for sleep, but none of the adolescents reported feeling content. The larger the difference between hours in bed on weekdays and hours in bed on weekends, the more dissatisfaction was observed. The present data suggest that the adolescents were chronic partially sleep deprived and had a tendency toward delayed sleep phase. They did not satisfy their need for sleep as defined by themselves, due to late bedtime throughout the week.

This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of research from anthropology, nursing, pediatrics, sociology, social work, public health, family studies, and psychology to focus on the role of physical touch in the context of co-sleeping, and how close physical contact in this context affects infants and their caregivers. Including an anthropological, evolutionary view of co-sleeping with other perspectives highlights it as an experience-expectant proximal context for infant growth and development. From this view, the importance of physical contact and touch in the nighttime caretaking microenvironment of co-sleeping becomes a central question, rather than an artifactual byproduct of \"unhealthy\" sleep arrangements. Rather than trying to eliminate co-sleeping, public health messages for parents would likely benefit from a more culturally-sensitive approach that focuses on advising how to co-sleep safely for families choosing it. For families trying to retain physical closeness between parent(s) and infants in the context of modern (especially Western) infant care practices that have reduced this physical contact, co-sleeping can be an important developmental context for encouraging and engaging in sensitive and responsive caregiving and providing a context for maternal-infant physiological synchrony and regulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31655427/"}

Therefore, an additional analysis of the interindividual variability of the AEP shape and component structure can simplify the detection of individual components of group-averaged AEP at different stages of the slow-wave sleep. The AEPs were recorded in healthy volunteers (n = 26) during falling asleep in the evening from eight EEG derivations (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2) in reference to a linked mastoid electrode.

{"id": "35970642", "title": "[Sleepiness among adolescents: etiology and multiple consequences].", "text": "Over the past century a dramatic decline in sleep duration among adolescents, such as more than one hour of sleep loss per night, has been reported. A debt in sleep duration could lead to sleep deprivation, a major risk factor associated with daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness refers to the inability to maintain an adequate level of alertness during the day which may result in more or less being able to control falling asleep at inappropriate times. This literature review updates on sleepiness regarding its characteristics, etiology and consequences on adolescents. Studies revealed that from 25 % to 78 % of adolescents had reported sleepiness. Its manifestations may include heavy lids, yawns, difficulties to concentrate and emotional irritability. In addition, while it is recommended that adolescents under 18 years-old should sleep from eight to ten hours a night, only 63 % of them actually do so. The etiology of sleep deprivation and sleepiness in this population can be explained by various biological and societal factors. First, the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents shows a biological shift from the beginning of pubertal maturation, described as a perfect storm. It refers to a social jetlag by going to sleep and waking up later and accumulating a sleep debt during weekdays which they try to reimburse during weekends. This phenomenon can be explained by physiological changes such as a slower accumulation of sleep pressure. In addition to this perfect storm, environmental and societal factors contribute to the social jetlag and reduce sleep duration in adolescents. Screen exposure before bedtime can delay sleep and wake onset, which is a risk factor for sleeping debt. Substance use such as caffeine, cigarettes or electronic vaporizer, ADHD or freely available medication, alcohol, cannabis use or drug consumption could further disrupt sleep-wake cycle by stimulating, depressing or otherwise disrupting the central nervous system. Early, before 8:30 am, class start times have been associated with chronic sleep deprivation, higher level of sleepiness and delayed melatonin peak secretion. Adolescents working or doing extracurricular occupations for more than 20hours a week are more at risk for reduced sleep duration and sleepiness. Parental supervision about sleep during the weekdays were associated with more appropriate bedtime. Adolescents from low socio-demographic characteristics and from minority ethnic groups have reported displaying a shorter sleep duration. Finally, sleep disorders of a physiological origin such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, may explain the sleep deprivation and sleepiness. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents have consequences on their health. Cognitive functioning, such as problem solving, attention or memory, as well as school performance, can be compromised by sleep deprivation and sleepiness. At the psychological level, adolescents reporting sleepiness are more prone to display mental health problems: associations were found between sleepiness and subjective perception of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints as well as with antisocial behaviors. Finally, 68 % of 16 year-old adolescents reported they drove a car, and the reported sleepiness could lead to road accidents due to reduced attentional functioning, reaction time and decision-making abilities. In the United-States, from 7 % to 16.5 % of deadly accidents were related to driving while drowsy. Highlighting etiology and problems associated with sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents could guide researchers and clinicians towards the development of possible interventions. Public health measures and knowledge transfer programs regarding modifiable psychosocial and societal factors associated with sleep-wake bioregulation could increase awareness in parents as well as in political and societal decision makers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35970642/"}

We assessed subjective sleepiness among the workers with obstructive sleep apnea before and after continuous positive airway pressure treatment, and evaluated insomnia in all workers before and after workers with obstructive sleep apnea were given continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Workers who received continuous positive airway pressure treatment reported significantly improved subjective sleepiness, but did not experience a significant change in insomnia symptoms. However, workers without obstructive sleep apnea reported significant improvements in their insomnia symptoms following the treatment of workers with obstructive sleep apnea. Using continuous positive airway pressure to treat workers with obstructive sleep apnea residing in temporary shelters may help prevent adverse health consequences from insomnia among other individuals sleeping nearby.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37532606/"}

Thermal stress is a major risk factor and makes infants more vulnerable to SIDS. Although it has been suggested that thermal stress could lead to SIDS by disrupting autonomic functions, clinical and physiopathological data on this hypothesis are scarce. We evaluated the influence of ambient temperature on autonomic nervous activity during sleep in thirty-four preterm neonates (mean ± SD gestational age: 31.4±1.5 weeks, postmenstrual age: 36.2±0.9 weeks). Heart rate variability was assessed as a function of the sleep stage at three different ambient temperatures (thermoneutrality and warm and cool thermal conditions). An elevated ambient temperature was associated with a higher basal heart rate and lower short- and long-term variability in all sleep stages, together with higher sympathetic activity and lower parasympathetic activity. Our study results showed that modification of the ambient temperature led to significant changes in autonomic nervous system control in sleeping preterm neonates. The latter changes are very similar to those observed in infants at risk of SIDS. Our findings may provide greater insight into the thermally-induced disease mechanisms related to SIDS and may help improve prevention strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23840888/"}

Previous evidence from this phenomenon, however, mainly stems from experimental studies which may not generalize to an ecologically valid setting. In the current study, we used a dataset of 246 individuals sleeping for at least seven nights each with a mobile electroencephalography headband according to their ordinary daily schedule to investigate the effect of time spent in wakefulness on sleep characteristics. Increased time in wakefulness prior to sleep was associated with decreased sleep onset latency, increased sleep efficiency, a larger percentage of N3 sleep, and higher delta activity. Moreover, increased sleep pressure resulted in an increase in both the slope and the intercept of the sleep electroencephalography spectrum. As predicted, power spectral density effects were most prominent in the earliest hours of sleep. Our results demonstrate that experimental findings showing increased sleep depth after extended wakefulness generalize to ecologically valid settings, and that time spent awake is an important determinant of sleep characteristics on the subsequent night.

This study of insulin sensitive and resistant adults examined the effect on postprandial metabolic regulation of repeated mixed-meal challenges of different carbohydrate loading. The aim was to examine whether the relationship between lower sleeping oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and poorer fasting and postprandial metabolic function may be linked with reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) duration, independent of age, sex and total adiposity. The 24 men and women, aged 25-54 years, had no diabetes or other diagnosed conditions, were evaluated with polysomnography to derive indices of SaO<sub>2</sub> and sleep architecture. In addition, an OGTT and two 14-h serial mixed-meal tests were administered over 3 successive in-patient days. The carbohydrate content of the mixed-meals was manipulated to compare a standard-load day with a double-load day (300 vs. 600 kcal/meal). Quantitative modeling was applied to derive β-cell glucose sensitivity (β-GS), early insulin secretion rate sensitivity (ESRS), and total postprandial insulinemia (AUC<sub>INS</sub>). Analyses showed that, for the 14-h tests, the SaO<sub>2</sub> relationship with metabolic outcomes was associated significantly with percent time spent in REM but not SWS, independent of age, sex and total adiposity. Specifically, indirect pathways indicated that lower SaO<sub>2</sub> was related to shorter REM duration, and shorter REM was respectively associated with higher β-GS, ESRS, and AUC<sub>INS</sub> for the 300- and 600-load days (300 kcal/meal: β = -8.68, p < .03, β = -8.54, p < .002, and β = -10.06, p < .008; 600 kcal/meal: β = -11.45, p < .003, β = -11.44, p < .001, and β = -11.00, p < .03).

This is called the first-night effect (FNE) in human sleep research and has been regarded as a typical sleep disturbance [2-4]. Here, we show that the FNE is a manifestation of one hemisphere being more vigilant than the other as a night watch to monitor unfamiliar surroundings during sleep [5, 6]. Using advanced neuroimaging techniques [7, 8] as well as polysomnography, we found that the temporary sleep disturbance in the first sleep experimental session involves regional interhemispheric asymmetry of sleep depth [9]. The interhemispheric asymmetry of sleep depth associated with the FNE was found in the default-mode network (DMN) involved with spontaneous internal thoughts during wakeful rest [10, 11]. The degree of asymmetry was significantly correlated with the sleep-onset latency, which reflects the degree of difficulty of falling asleep and is a critical measure for the FNE. Furthermore, the hemisphere with reduced sleep depth showed enhanced evoked brain response to deviant external stimuli. Deviant external stimuli detected by the less-sleeping hemisphere caused more arousals and faster behavioral responses than those detected by the other hemisphere. None of these asymmetries were evident during subsequent sleep sessions. These lines of evidence are in accord with the hypothesis that troubled sleep in an unfamiliar environment is an act for survival over an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous environment by keeping one hemisphere partially more vigilant than the other hemisphere as a night watch, which wakes the sleeper up when unfamiliar external signals are detected.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27112296/"}

Internal load (rating of perceived exertion × duration of training or match) was assessed 30 minutes posttraining or postmatch, and the total quality of recovery was recorded every morning. A series of multilevel models were used to analyze the data. Time in bed and wake-up time were earlier on both training (P < .001) and rest days (P < .001) than on the day of the match. Internal workload did not predict any of the players' sleeping patterns. Midday naps predicted less time in bed (P = .03) and likely less sleep time (P = .08). The total quality of recovery was predicted only by the total sleep time (P < .01). Women exhibited higher sleep efficiency (P < .001), less waking after sleep onset (P = .01), and a lower number of awakenings (P = .02) than men. The current results indicate that the nocturnal sleep patterns of elite water polo players are not associated with internal load and that women display better nocturnal sleep quality compared with men.

I slept 11 nights in chimpanzee nests and on the bare ground to test for differences in sleep quality, potential exposure to disease through bites from possible vectors, and insulation. No difference was found in the total amount of sleep nor in sleep quality; however, sleep was more disturbed on the ground. Differences in sleep disturbance between arboreal and ground conditions seemed primarily due to causes of anxiety and alertness, e.g., vocalizations of terrestrial mammals. Arboreal nest-sleeping seems to reduce risk of bites from possible disease vectors and provide insulation in cold conditions.

On three consecutive days in all piglets, physiological recordings were made during sleep; on at least one of these days, simultaneous physiological and radiological observations were made. 4. Following sedation, sleep time and time in active sleep were increased significantly (P < 0.01). The spontaneous occurrence of swallowing, arousal, body movement, gastrooesophageal reflux and apnoea was compared between naturally and sedated sleeping piglets. Sedation with promethazine significantly decreased the spontaneous occurrence of swallowing (P < 0.05) and arousal (P < 0.05) and increased the occurrence of both central (P < 0.05) and obstructive sleep apnoea (P < 0.0001). 5.

It also means a feeling of being trapped by circumstances. As the adolescents' lived experiences become apparent, the possibility for parents, school nurses, and other professional caregivers to support adolescents' sleep increases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33063632/"}

The study was done in a backyard near a tertiary-care center during winter nights with ambient temperatures of less than 0 degrees C. Subjects were 10 healthy volunteers, 8 males and 2 females, aged 23-40 years, with a mean of 30.9 years. In a crossover design study, subjects slept alone in mountaineering tents on two nights (8 h each night) using sleeping bags and ground insulation. On one night, they wore heat-and-moisture-retaining masks designed for cold weather exercise. On the other night, they wore no mask. Subjects were weighed before and after each session to obtain an estimate of respiratory water loss. Comparisons were made of weight loss with and without the mask. We found the use of the masks resulted in decreased weight loss in all but one subject. The mean reduction in weight loss was 0.13 kg (SD +/- 0.18 kg). Using a one-tailed t-test, this difference was found to be significant (p < .05). We conclude that the use of a simple and inexpensive face mask can result in a meaningful decrease in overnight respiratory water loss while sleeping in a cold environment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11995907/"}

As the final cortical element of the arousal process may be the most critical for survival, we hypothesized that the increased vulnerability of preterm infants to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) could be explained by depressed cortical arousal (CA) responses. We evaluated the effects of preterm birth on stimulus-induced arousal processes in both the prone and supine sleeping positions. 10 healthy preterm infants were studied with daytime polysomnography, in both supine and prone sleeping positions, at 36 weeks gestational age, 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months and 5-6 months post-term corrected age. Sub-cortical activations and cortical arousals (CA) were expressed as proportions of total arousal responses. Preterm data were compared with data from 13 healthy term infants studied at the same corrected ages. In preterm infants increased CAs were observed in the prone position at all ages studied. Compared to term infants, preterm infants had significantly fewer CAs in QS when prone at 2-3 months of age and more CAs when prone at 2-4 weeks in AS. There were no differences in either sleep state when infants slept supine. Prone sleeping promoted CA responses in healthy preterm infants throughout the first six months of post-term age. We have previously suggested that in term infants enhanced CA represents a critical protection against a potentially harmful situation; we speculate that for preterm-born infants the need for this protection is greater than in term infants.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23725788/"}

We studied the effect of inspiratory flow-resistive loading (18 cm H2O/L/s) for two consecutive breaths on inspiratory (diaphragm) and expiratory (external oblique) muscle activity, and respiratory timing, in six awake and sleeping goats. During the first loaded breath in the awake state, peak integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram activity (EMGdi) increased 16.7 +/- 3.9% (p less than 0.01), peak integrated external oblique EMG activity (EMGeo) increased 21.0 +/- 7.5% (p less than 0.001), and electrical inspiratory time (Ti) increased 18.1 +/- 2.1% (p less than 0.01). In contrast, loading did not significantly change peak EMGdi or EMGeo on the first or second breaths in any sleep state. However, Ti was significantly increased during loading in all sleep states (p less than 0.01) to a similar degree seen during wakefulness. Loading did not significantly alter electrical expiratory time. No significant differences were noted between the first and second loaded breaths. We conclude that the reflex increases in peak EMG of both inspiratory and expiratory muscles in response to inspiratory flow-resistive loading during the awake state are absent during all stages of sleep; however, one aspect of load compensation, prolongation of Ti, is preserved during sleep and aids in maintaining tidal volume.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1952440/"}
{"id": "11483717", "title": "The ventilatory response to arousal from sleep is not fully explained by differences in CO(2) levels between sleep and wakefulness.", "text": "1. Arousal from sleep is associated with transient stimulation of ventilation above normal waking levels that predisposes to subsequent breathing instability and central apnoea. The transient hyperpnoea at arousal is normally explained by differences in arterial partial pressure of CO(2) (P(a,CO2)) between sleep and wakefulness, with a higher P(a,CO2) in sleep leading to stimulation of ventilation at arousal according to the awake ventilatory response to CO(2). Surprisingly, however, the validity of this current model in fully explaining the increased ventilation at arousal from sleep has not been directly tested. 2. This study tests the hypothesis that the level of ventilation at arousal from non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep is greater than that produced by elevating P(a,CO2) in wakefulness to the sleeping level, i.e. the ventilation predicted by the current model. 3. Studies were performed in five dogs. Inspired CO(2) was used to increase end-tidal partial pressure of CO(2) (P(ET,CO2)) in wakefulness and measure the ventilatory response. The same P(ET,CO2) was then maintained in non-REM sleep. Ventilation was measured for 10 breaths before and after arousal from non-REM sleep induced by a 72 dB tone. 4. Arousal from sleep produced a transient surge in ventilation of 1.42 +/- 0.35 l min(-1) (P = 0.005). This increased ventilation was due to arousal from sleep per se as the tone alone produced no change in awake ventilation. In support of the hypothesis, ventilation at wake onset from sleep was greater by 0.83 +/- 0.28 l min(-1) (P = 0.031) than the ventilation elicited in wakefulness by raising P(ET,CO2) to the sleeping level. 5. The results show that > 50 % of the increase in ventilation at wake onset from sleep is not attributable to the awake ventilatory response to the elevated P(a,CO2) that was previously present in sleep. This result leads to important modifications of the physiological model currently used to explain the ventilatory consequences of arousal from sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11483717/"}

Twenty university students, who usually listen to music at bedtime, were asked to take a nap in the laboratory while being monitored by a polysomnograph. Each participant selected preferred music to be played as they fell asleep. Stage 2 sleep latency was shorter for those sleeping with music playing compared to the no music control group. This tendency was reversed when participants tried to fall asleep quickly. Differences in sleep latency between the music and control conditions were due to the amount of episodic wakefulness. Results imply that music promotes or interferes with falling asleep by modulating the appearance of episodic wakefulness. Considering the mood, especially pleasantness while falling asleep and the ironic process theory of mental control (Wegner, 1994), the mechanisms of the effects of music on sleep are discussed.

Unpredictable stressors can cause ulcers, prolonged pituitary-adrenal activation, and anhedonia. Similarly, pain has been demonstrated to slow wound healing, and mice experiencing pain exhibit altered behavior. However it is unknown how husbandry, which occurs when the mice are inactive, and lack of analgesia, specifically in a punch biopsy procedure, effects animal physiology, behavior, and welfare, particularly as it relates to sleep fragmentation. We hypothesized that sleep fragmentation, induced by unpredictable husbandry and lack of pain management will slow wound healing. Two main treatments were tested in a factorial design in C57BL/6 mice of both sexes (64 mice total); 1) analgesia (carprofen and saline) and 2) sleep disruptions (random and predictable). Mice were singly housed in a non-invasive sleep monitoring apparatus on arrival (Day -4). Disruption treatments were applied from Day -3 to 2. All mice received a punch biopsy surgery (Day 0) with topical lidocaine gel and their analgesic treatment prior to recovery, and on Days 1 and 2. Nesting behavior was assessed daily and a sugar cereal consumption test, as a measure of anhedonia, was conducted on Days -1 to 2. On Day 3, mice were euthanized and wound tissue and adrenal glands were collected. We found that the disruption predictability had no effect on mouse sleep, wound healing, or adrenal cortex:medulla ratio. It's possible that the disruption period was not long enough to induce chronic stress. However, male mice who received analgesia slept more than their female counterparts; this may be related to sex differences in pain perception. Overall, it does not appear that the predictability of disturbance effects sleep fragmentation or stress responses, indicating that husbandry activities do not need to occur at set predictable times to improve welfare.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30703113/"}

The function of micro-arousals remains unclear, for example, whether it reflects a disturbance or a preparatory response to environmental changes. The goal of this study was to assess arousal responsiveness when two types of sensory stimulations were used: auditory (AD) alone and the addition of a vibrotactile (VT) sensation. Ten normal sleepers participated in three nights of polygraphic recordings. The first night was for habituation and to rule out sleep disorders, and the second to collect baseline sleep data. During the third night, AD and VT + AD stimuli, with three levels of intensities for auditory and vibratory signals, were randomly given to induce arousal responses in sleep stages 2, 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement (REM). The frequency of the arousal responses increased with stimulus intensity for all sleep stages and was lowest in stages 3 and 4. In non-REM (NREM) sleep, combined VT + AD stimulation induced more frequent and more intense arousal responses than AD alone. In REM sleep, more frequent micro-arousals rather than awakenings were triggered by combined stimulations. In stage 2, the response rate of total induced K-complexes did not differ between both types of stimulations while more K-complexes followed by arousals were evoked by the combined VT + AD stimulation than by the AD alone. The induced arousals were associated with an increase in heart rate in all sleep stages. An increase in suprahyoid muscle tone was observed in NREM sleep only, REM being not associated with a rise in muscle tone following experimental stimulation. Most leg and body movements occurred in response to induced awakenings. These results suggest that the cross-modality sensory stimuli triggered more arousal responses in comparison with single-modality stimuli. In an attempt to wake a sleeping subject, the addition of a tactile stimulation, such as shaking the shoulder, is an effective strategy that increases the arousal probability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15339258/"}

With our proposed system, there is no need to attach any sensors or medical devices to the human body or the bed. That is the limitation of the sensor-based technology. Additionally, our system does not raise a privacy concern, which is the major limitation of vision-based technology. Experiments using low-cost, low-power 2.4 GHz IEEE802.15.4 wireless networks have been conducted in laboratories. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can automatically monitor and classify human sleeping postures in real time. The average classification accuracy of activities and sleep postures obtained from different subjects, test environments, and hardware platforms is 99.92%, 98.87%, 98.01%, 87.57%, and 95.87% for cases (a) to (e), respectively. Here, the proposed system provides an average accuracy of 96.05%. Furthermore, the system can also monitor and separate the difference between the cases of the man falling from his bed and the man getting out of his bed.

We here show proof of principle for a conceptualization of sleep stages as attractor states in a nonlinear dynamical system in order to develop new empirical criteria for sleep stages. EEG (single channel) of two healthy sleeping participants was used to demonstrate this conceptualization. Firstly, distinct EEG epochs were selected, both detected by a MLR classifier and through manual scoring. Secondly, change point analysis was used to identify abrupt changes in the EEG signal. Thirdly, these detected change points were evaluated on whether they were preceded by early warning signals. Multiple change points were identified in the EEG signal, mostly in interplay with N2. The dynamics before these changes revealed, for a part of the change points, indicators of generic early warning signals, characteristic of complex systems (e.g., ecosystems, climate, epileptic seizures, global finance systems). The sketched new framework for studying critical transitions in sleep EEG might benefit the understanding of individual and pathological differences in the dynamics of sleep stage transitions. Formalising sleep as a nonlinear dynamical system can be useful for definitions of sleep quality, i.e. stability and accessibility of an equilibrium state, and disrupted sleep, i.e. constant shifting between instable sleep states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32304989/"}

Goal execution declined after the 12-hr wake delay relative to the short delay. In contrast, goal execution was relatively preserved after the 12-hr sleep delay relative to the short delay. The sleep-enhanced goal execution was not accompanied by a decline in performance of an ongoing task in which the prospective memory goal was embedded, which suggests that the effect was not a consequence of attentional resources being reallocated from the ongoing task to the prospective memory goal.

One hundred appropriate-for-gestational age full-term infants were studied: 28 C, 48 SIDS siblings (SS), and 24 near-miss for SIDS (NM) within the first 2 weeks following the first detected apparent life-threatening event. The three groups of infants were comparable with respect to gestational and conceptional ages, birthweights, sex distribution and socio-economic backgrounds. CPG were done over two successive nights.

However, much less is known about how rest opportunities can be structured to optimise recovery from fatigue. The nature of the road transport industry often requires that rest be taken in various locations. New investigation in this area, focusing on sleep obtained in truck cabs and other non-home environments is critically important to complement existing understanding. This study examined sleep at home and in truck cabs, in truck drivers who were actively working during the time of the study. Thirty-seven male drivers aged between 24 and 63 years (age: 48.7 ± 9.0 years; mean ± SD) wore activity monitors (also known as 'sleep watches') and completed work and sleep diaries for a period of 21 days, recording their subjective fatigue levels before, during and after work shifts, and before and after sleep periods. They also self-rated their sleep quality and noted the number of times they woke during sleep periods. Analyses focused on home versus in-truck sleep periods. The subjective data suggested that a greater quantity (P<.001) and quality (P<.05) of sleep was obtained at home than in the truck, and that sleeping at home more effectively reduced fatigue levels (P<.001). The objective data showed trends towards longer sleep length at home, but other variables, including total sleep per 24h and sleep quality, showed no significant differences. This study demonstrates that measuring sleep quantity and quality in operational road transport environments is feasible. The findings caution against over-reliance on laboratory and simulator studies since there are critical aspects of the operating environment that cannot be validly studied in artificially controlled settings.

To determine whether the effects of sleeping position on state distribution vary with time after feeding, we studied prematurely born infants in both the prone and supine sleeping positions. Sleep states were recorded each minute during interfeed intervals. Results demonstrate expected effects of sleep position on state distribution: prone sleeping is associated with a 79% increase in quiet sleep and a 71% decrease in time awake. While the decreases in time awake are seen throughout the interfeed interval, increases in quiet sleep in the prone position are found only within the first hour and again near the end of the interfeed interval.

SO-delta and SO-theta coupling, as well as interactions between delta/theta and spindle/beta frequencies also occurred. During REM, limited interactions between delta/theta and beta frequencies emerged. Moreover, oscillatory organization differed substantially between i) hippocampus and scalp, ii) sites along the anterior-posterior hippocampal axis, and iii) individuals. Overall, these results extend and refine our understanding of hippocampal sleep oscillations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31505272/"}

PURE China study recruited 46 285 participants, aged 35-70, from 12 provinces and 115 communities in China. Habitual sleep patterns and CV disease were self-reported. Multilevel logistic regression was used in our analysis. In this study, 39 515 participants were eligible in our analysis, including 23 345 (59.1%) women and 16 170 (40.9%) men. Sleeping ≥9 h per day was associated with increased odds of CV disease (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32, p = 0.033) compared with sleeping 7-8 h per day. Taking daytime naps was also associated with an increased odds of CV disease, and the CV odds increased with increasing napping duration (p for trend < 0.001). For the sleeping < 6 h per day, we only found an association with coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.01-2.48, p = 0.046). Participants with only 7-8 h sleep per night had lowest prevalence of CV disease (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.90, p = 0.001) compared with other sleep patterns. Napping, long and short duration of habitual sleep may increase the odds of CV disease. Only participants sleeping 7-8 hours at night are recommended in this study, and large longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these results.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28276852/"}

Assessment of sleep during infancy presents an opportunity to study the impact of sleep on the maturation of the central nervous system (CNS), overall functioning, and future cognitive, psychomotor, and temperament development. To assess what is currently known regarding sleep during infancy and its effects on cognitive, psychomotor, and temperament development, we assessed the relevant literature published over the last several decades. To provide a foundation for a more in-depth understanding of this literature, we preface this with an overview of brain maturation, sleep development, and various assessment tools of both sleep and development during this unique period. At present, we do not have sufficient data to conclude that a causal relationship exists between infant sleep and cognitive, psychomotor, and temperament development. Caution should be used in predicting outcomes, as the timing and subjectivity of evaluations may obviate accurate assessment. Collectively, studies assess a wide array of sleep measures, and findings from one developmental period cannot be generalized readily to other developmental periods. Future studies should follow patients longitudinally. Additionally, refinements of existing assessment tools would be useful. In view of the relatively high reported pediatric prevalence of cognitive and behavioral deficits that carry significant long-term costs to individuals and society, early screening of sleep-related issues may be a useful tool to guide targeted prevention and early intervention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928384/"}

The UA was isolated, and the dogs breathed through an endotracheal tube while wearing a fitted fiberglass snout mask. NP (-2 to -32 cmH2O) was applied in a square wave below the larynx or at the snout at end expiration and was held until inspiratory effort during wakefulness, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. During all states of consciousness, NP applied to the UA prolonged expiratory time (TE) 1) below a threshold of -8 to -10 cmH2O, which coincided with closure of the oro- and/or velopharynx; and 2) in a progressive fashion at more negative pressures than threshold, up to a mean apneic length of 324% of the control value (or 13.9 s) at -30 cmH2O. TE prolongation was less during REM sleep at a given NP (P < 0.05). Augmented tonic genioglossal electromyographic activity also occurred with the applied NP during wakefulness and NREM sleep but not with REM sleep. NP (-20 to -32 cmH2O) applied as a brief pulse (300-500 ms) during NREM sleep caused transient airway occlusion, terminated the breath during inspiration, and prolonged TE when applied at end expiration. Central apneas always persisted beyond the termination of the UA closure. TE prolongation in response to NP persisted in the presence of a topical anesthetic nebulized through the UA sufficient to abolish the laryngeal gag reflexes.

The measures were obtained during the different sleep stages and CAP conditions from the real EEG connectivity networks and randomized control (surrogate) networks (Cp-s and Lp-s). Cp and Cp/Cp-s increased significantly from wakefulness to sleep while Lp and Lp/Lp-s did not show changes. Cp/Cp-s was higher for A1 phases, compared to B phases of CAP.

Because environmental or caretaking factors have been shown to exert powerful effects on susceptibility to SIDS, manipulations that facilitate arousability might be protective against SIDS. All-night laboratory polysomnographic recordings were performed in 20 routinely bedsharing and 15 routinely solitary sleeping healthy breast-feeding Latino infants within the peak age range for SIDS, in both bedsharing (with mother) and solitary sleeping environments. The most important findings revealed by repeated measures analyses of variance were a significant reduction in stage 3/4 sleep and an inverse increase in stage 1/2 sleep on the bedsharing night compared to the solitary night, irrespective of routine sleeping arrangement. Shorter mean duration episodes of stage 3/4 sleep and longer mean stage 1/2 sleep episodes accounted for these differences. Because the arousal threshold is high in the electroencephalographic delta range, by limiting the amount of stage 3/4 sleep, bedsharing should promote infant arousability and might be protective against SIDS. The results also suggest that accepted normative values for infant sleep established in solitary sleeping infants may not be representative of infants raised in social sleeping environments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9122552/"}

In birds, broad-spectrum white ALAN can have disruptive effects on activity patterns, metabolism, stress response and immune function. There has been growing research on whether the use of alternative light spectra can reduce these negative effects, but surprisingly, there has been no study to determine which light spectrum birds prefer. To test such a preference, we gave urban and forest great tits (Parus major) the choice where to roost using pairwise combinations of darkness, white light or green dim light at night (1.5 lux). Birds preferred to sleep under artificial light instead of darkness, and green was preferred over white light. In a subsequent experiment, we investigated the consequence of sleeping under a particular light condition, and measured birds' daily activity levels, daily energy expenditure (DEE), oxalic acid as a biomarker for sleep debt and cognitive abilities. White light affected activity patterns more than green light. Moreover, there was an origin-dependent response to spectral composition: in urban birds, the total daily activity and night activity did not differ between white and green light, while forest birds were more active under white than green light. We also found that individuals who slept under white and green light had higher DEE. However, there were no differences in oxalic acid levels or cognitive abilities between light treatments. Thus, we argue that in naive birds that had never encountered light at night, white light might disrupt circadian rhythms more than green light. However, it is possible that the negative effects of ALAN on sleep and cognition might be observed only under intensities higher than 1.5 lux. These results suggest that reducing the intensity of light pollution as well as tuning the spectrum towards long wavelengths may considerably reduce its impact.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31213184/"}

In order to determine what molecular changes occur during the sleep-waking cycle, we have recently performed a systematic screening of gene expression in the brain of sleeping, sleep deprived, and spontaneously awake rats. Out of the approximately 10,000 genes screened so far, a small minority ( approximately 0.5%) was differentially expressed in the cerebral cortex across behavioral states. Most genes were upregulated in wakefulness and sleep deprivation relative to sleep, while only a few were upregulated in sleep relative to wakefulness and sleep deprivation. Almost all the genes upregulated in sleep, and several genes upregulated in wakefulness and sleep deprivation, did not match any known sequence. Known genes expressed at higher levels in wakefulness and sleep deprivation could be grouped into functional categories: immediate early genes/transcription factors, genes related to energy metabolism, growth factors/adhesion molecules, chaperones/heat shock proteins, vesicle and synapse-related genes, neurotransmitter/hormone receptors, neurotransmitter transporters, enzymes, and others.

Three Ca(V)3 channel subtypes are expressed in the thalamocortical (TC) system, but their respective roles for the sleep EEG are unclear. Ca(V)3.3 protein is expressed abundantly in the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt), an essential oscillatory burst generator. We report the characterization of a transgenic Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mouse line and demonstrate that Ca(V)3.3 channels are indispensable for nRt function and for sleep spindles, a hallmark of natural sleep. The absence of Ca(V)3.3 channels prevented oscillatory bursting in the low-frequency (4-10 Hz) range in nRt cells but spared tonic discharge. In contrast, adjacent TC neurons expressing Ca(V)3.1 channels retained low-threshold bursts. Nevertheless, the generation of synchronized thalamic network oscillations underlying sleep-spindle waves was weakened markedly because of the reduced inhibition of TC neurons via nRt cells. T currents in Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mice were <30% compared with those in WT mice, and the remaining current, carried by Ca(V)3.2 channels, generated dendritic [Ca(2+)](i) signals insufficient to provoke oscillatory bursting that arises from interplay with Ca(2+)-dependent small conductance-type 2 K(+) channels. Finally, naturally sleeping Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mice showed a selective reduction in the power density of the σ frequency band (10-12 Hz) at transitions from NREM to REM sleep, with other EEG waves remaining unaltered. Together, these data identify a central role for Ca(V)3.3 channels in the rhythmogenic properties of the sleep-spindle generator and provide a molecular target to elucidate the roles of sleep spindles for brain function and development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21808016/"}

We studied the stability of ventilatory pattern in nine awake CHF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 9-48%) who demonstrated CSB only while asleep and compared results with 13 age-matched normals. The test involved brief (30-50-second) exposure to hypoxia (end-tidal PO2 = 55 Torr) followed by breathing pure oxygen. During hypoxia, ventilation increased about 40% above air breathing control in both groups, whereas end-tidal CO2 declined to 92% of control in both groups. During hyperoxia, however, breathing pattern differed between groups. In the normals, ventilation gradually declined to air-breathing levels and did not significantly undershoot. In the patients, ventilation dropped more rapidly to baseline and an overshoot was present with ventilation being 72% and air-breathing control at 45 seconds of hyperoxia. Circulatory delay was calculated from the time interval between alveolar hypoxia and in increase in ventilation, and when corrections for circulatory delay were applied to ventilation during hyperoxia the differences between groups increased in that the patients' ventilation was less than baseline immediately after the delay. In the normals, the gradual decline in hyperoxic ventilation probably represents the decay of short-term potentiation (STP) activated by hypoxic hyperventilation. Results in the patients were compatible with absence of such STP decay, but could also have been due to a reduction in ventilatory drive early in hyperoxia related to prolonged circulation times.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7809566/"}

The response to reflex stimulation with a 5 sec-water infusion was evaluated during 30 sec, as % change in ventilation, heart rate and blood pressure. Apnea, hypertension and bradycardia were more pronounced during sleep than during wakefulness, when arousal was not associated with the stimulation. The response was similar during quiet and REM sleep. Arousal, which occurred in 24 and 31% of the tests respectively, resulted in a response comparable to that seen during wakefulness. The respiratory drive was evaluated by measurement of the mean inspiratory flow and was found to be decreased during both sleep states when compared to wakefulness. We propose that during sleep in the newborn period there is a decreased ability to respond to asphyxia possibly due to a functional immaturity of the arterial chemoreceptors. This results in a low incidence of arousal and a delayed termination of the pronounced poststimulus apnea resulting from laryngeal chemoreflex stimulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7110784/"}

The first nocturnal pulse oximetry (FNPO) recordings were made on 3 different nights while the participants were sleeping without dentures (WOD). Oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and other PO parameters of the participants, including total respiratory event (TRE), basal SpO<sub>2</sub> (BSpO<sub>2</sub>), time≤88 (T88), average low SpO<sub>2</sub> (ALSpO<sub>2</sub>), total pulse event (TPE), average pulse rate (APR), and heart rate variability index (HRVI), were processed and the obtained data were recorded as WOD condition values. According to the ODI scores, the OSA status of the participants was grouped as normal (ODI<5), mild (5<ODI<15), moderate (15<ODI<30), or severe (ODI>30). Complete dentures were fabricated by an experienced prosthodontist and a dental laboratory technician by following conventional procedures. At the end of the first month of the follow-up period, the second nocturnal PO recordings (SNPO) were made on 3 different nights while the participants slept wearing dentures (WID), and the data obtained were recorded as WID condition values. The comparison of mean PO values obtained from WOD and WID were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed- rank test (α=.05). Significant differences were found between WOD and WID values in terms of TRE (P=.01), ODI (P=.001), ALSpO2 (P=.006), TPE (P=.001), and HRVI (P=.001) parameters.

The highest level of exercise increased 24-h energy expenditure by 34 per cent. Food intake was modified for each measurement in order to maintain energy balance. Sleeping and basal metabolic rates on the night following exercise were raised even at low intensities of exercise. There was an almost linear dose-response relationship and no evidence of a threshold. However, the effect was small, amounting to only 5.8 per cent overnight and 3.9 per cent in the morning following 2 h exercise at over 60 per cent VO2 max during the preceding day.

Containing a numerically small but broadly efferent cell population, the LC provides brain-wide noradrenergic modulation that optimizes network function in the context of attentive and flexible interaction with the sensory environment. This review turns attention to the LC's roles during sleep. We show that these roles go beyond down-scaled versions of the ones in wakefulness. Novel dynamic assessments of noradrenaline signaling and LC activity uncover a rich diversity of activity patterns that establish the LC as an integral portion of sleep regulation and function.

Reaction to and processing of external stimuli is attenuated in sleep. During sleep, the reticular thalamic nucleus reduces the flow of sensory activity to the cerebral cortex through inhibition of the thalamus. This sensory gating process facilitates sleep. After reaching the afferent layers of primary cortex, the reduced sensory flow is adjusted, gained, and processed within various cortical layers before being transferred by the corticofugal system back to appropriate subdivisions of the thalamus as feedback. Thalamic subdivisions then dispatch this sensory information to related areas of the cerebral cortex, where it is (sub)consciously perceived. When necessary, a sleeping individual can be awakened by a wake-up call, either by stimuli indicating danger, or by personally meaningful stimuli. It is safe for a sleeping individual that it can be aroused when necessary. Evidently, there are two processes by which the brain adjusts the response to sensory stimuli before entering (sub)consciousness. Firstly 'sensory gating', a process favourable to the maintenance of sleep by reducing the sensory input to the brain through the reticular thalamic nucleus and secondly 'sensory gaining', a process implying that the gained preserved sensory input is continuously analysed by the corticofugal system to detect dangerous and relevant environmental elements, indispensable for safeness and well-being of the sleeper.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38286435/"}

Here, the hypothesis that mother-infant co-sleeping will be associated with a lower probability of infant breathing distress is tested in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 18,552 infants). Maternal, infant, family, and socio-economic covariates were included in logistic regression analysis, and in a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to make full use of the number of variables available in the birth cohort study data. Results from logistic regression analysis showed that co-sleeping was associated with a reduced risk of breathing difficulties (OR = 0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.027). The Random Forest algorithm placed high importance on socio-economic aspects of infant environment, and indicated that a number of maternal, child, and environmental variables predicted breathing distress.

These estimates were age-matched with recommended pediatric guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the National Sleep Foundation to yield 3 groups: expect less (8%-11%), expect appropriate (85%-89%), and expect more (3%-4%). Sleep duration for school nights and weekends were reported by children and parents. Sleep hygiene included sleep-promoting practices (quiet, dark bedroom, regular bed/wake times, consistent routine) and sleep-interfering practices (physiological arousal, presleep worry, alcohol/smoking intake, daytime napping, screen time). Most parents (68.7%) endorsed that children do not get enough sleep. Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the impact of parental expectations. For every additional hour of sleep expected, children slept between 15.5 (parent-report 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0-22.0) and 17.9 minutes (child-report 95% CI, 9.7-26.2) longer on school nights, adjusted for age, sex, puberty, and parental education. For parents who expected less sleep than recommended, their children had the shortest sleep duration, least favorable sleeping environments, and greater presleep worry.

It is not known what conductance dynamics underlie such activity and how neurons process information in such highly stochastic states. Here, we combine intracellular recordings in awake and naturally sleeping cats with computational models to investigate subthreshold dynamics of conductances and how conductance dynamics determine spiking activity. We show that during both wakefulness and the \"up-states\" of natural slow-wave sleep, membrane-potential activity stems from a diversity of combinations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances, with dominant inhibition in most of the cases. Inhibition also provides the largest contribution to membrane potential fluctuations. Computational models predict that in such inhibition-dominant states, spikes are preferentially evoked by a drop of inhibitory conductance, and that its signature is a transient drop of membrane conductance before the spike. This pattern of conductance change is indeed observed in estimates of spike-triggered averages of synaptic conductances during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep up states. These results show that activated states are defined by diverse combinations of excitatory and inhibitory conductances with pronounced inhibition, and that the dynamics of inhibition is particularly effective on spiking, suggesting an important role for inhibitory processes in both conscious and unconscious cortical states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17507551/"}

Using videography and behavioral measures of twitching during bouts of daytime sleep, we find at all ages that twitching across the body occurs predominantly in bursts at intervals of 10 s or less. We also find that twitching is expressed differentially across the body and with age. For example, twitching of the face and head is most prevalent shortly after birth and decreases over the first several months. In addition, twitching of the hands and feet occurs at a consistently higher rate than does twitching elsewhere in the body. Finally, the patterning of twitching becomes more structured with age, with twitches of the left and right hands and feet exhibiting the strongest coupling.

To evaluate whether experimental nondipping mediated by angiotensin II during sleep would alter blood pressure and baroreflex function the next day in healthy humans, angiotensin-II or placebo (saline) was infused for a 7-h period at night, preventing blood pressure dipping in 11 sleeping normotensive individuals (5 males, balanced, crossover design). Baroreflex function was assessed about 1 h upon awakening and stop of infusion via microneurographic recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), showing that resting MSNA was significantly increased following angiotensin II nondipping compared with placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.029), whereas blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. Baroreflex sensitivity in response to vasoactive drug challenge was preserved, and neuroendocrine markers of fluid balance and electrolytes did not differ between conditions. Ambulatory blood pressure during subsequent daytime was not altered. Data were compared with analog experiments previously performed within the same subjects during awake daytime (ANCOVA). We conclude that angiotensin-II mediated nocturnal nondipping did not induce blood pressure elevation at subsequent daytime in healthy humans but was linked to increased vasoconstrictive sympathetic activity. This is in contrast to a prolonged increase in blood pressure in corresponding daytime experiments of the same individuals.

We placed a portable weather monitor within 1 m of chimpanzee SPs and compared the microenvironment of this site with terrestrial monitors placed 10 cm above the ground directly underneath the simultaneously studied SP. We calculated physical \"comfort levels\" of monitored sites using the RayMan thermophysiological model that we modified to take ape body proportions into account. The RayMan tool gauges energy balance using wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and heat index in conjunction with the study subject's mass and stature to determine whether the individual is in energy balance or homeostasis. We found that (1) terrestrial microclimates have greater homeostatic potential than arboreal microclimates, and (2) there is a significant positive linear relationship between wind speed and height of SP in the forest canopy. Advantages of terrestrial sites are that they require lesser energetic expenditure to stabilize the body when the SP is under construction and perhaps during use as well. We found that terrestrial sites also had better homeostatic potentials. This combination of advantages explains why SPs are so often sited terrestrially in habitats where predation risk is low. Early hominins must have had technological or social measures to avoid or deter predators that were significantly advanced over those found among chimpanzees before they began sleeping on the ground.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22553185/"}

Studies were repeated at 31-32, 33-34, and 35-36 weeks postconceptional age. Premature infants had rare episodes of spontaneous oronasal breathing during sleep. The frequency of oral breathing in response to nasal occlusion increased with advancing postconceptional age, from 8% +/- 8% at 31-32 weeks to 26% +/- 18% at 33-34 weeks and 28% +/- 33% at 35-36 weeks. Oral breathing in preterm infants, unlike that in term infants, was characterized by intermittent airway obstruction leading to a significant decrease in respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and tcpo2 (P less than 0.005). When inspiratory (Rl) and expiratory (RE) resistances during nasal and oral breathing were compared, Rl increased from 41 +/- 30 to 234 +/- 228 (P less than 0.004) and RE from 62 +/- 16 to 145 +/- 43 cm H2O X L-1 X sec (P less than 0.004). The ability of preterm infants to use the oral route of breathing thus increases with advancing postnatal maturation, but its effectiveness may remain limited by high oral airway resistance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3746545/"}

To assess the usefulness of the test the effects of amphetamine, chlorpromazine, histamine, morphine, nikethamide, pentobarbitone and SKF 525A have been investigated. The interaction between 5 benzodiazepines and halothane has been studied in particular. Results from sleeping time experiments, measurements of body temperature and of brain halothane concentrations suggest that the halothane-benzodiazepine interaction is due to additive CNS depressant effects.

The deficits appear to involve alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. SIDS risk is enhanced by pre- and postnatal nicotine exposure, and possibly by hypoxic experiences. The prone sleeping position plays a significant role in risk, as do head positions that minimize facial escape from enclosed spaces; elevated body temperature may also be a factor. Compensatory mechanisms, including diminished gasping ability, relative failure to arouse to a safer state, or a failure to recruit respiratory efforts to overcome a blood pressure loss have been the object of recent research efforts. The findings suggest that the fatal event involves a neurally-compromised infant, circumstances that challenge vital physiology, most likely during sleep, at a particular developmental period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10722855/"}

HRQOL was assessed using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's HRQOL-4 scale. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the sleep-HRQOL associations. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine whether the associations varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Approximately 35.6 % of young adults slept <7 h, 41.9 % had insomnia, 4.4 % had sleep disorder, and 8.5 % had sleep apnea. More females had insomnia than males (48.6 vs. 35.9 %, P < 0.001). US-born young adults had more sleep disturbances than their foreign-born counterparts. Compared with those sleeping 7-8 h, the adjusted odds ratio of poor general health was 1.60 (95 % confidence interval, 1.08-2.35) for individuals sleeping 6-7 h and 1.88 (1.23-2.86) for those sleeping <6 h. Similar results were found for low mental HRQOL and overall HRQOL. Insomnia, long sleep latency, troubling falling asleep, daytime sleepiness, and frequent sleeping pill use were significantly associated with low mental HRQOL and overall HRQOL. The associations between sleep disturbances and low HRQOL varied little by sex, race/ethnicity, and country of birth. Sleep disturbances are common among US young adults and are significantly associated with low HRQOL.

Recorded noises from trucks, civilian aircraft, low altitude military aircraft and tones were presented at 55, 65, and 75 L(Amax). Sleep stage, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures before and immediately after onset of noise events were compared. Spectral analyses of heart rate and blood pressure variabilities were used to compare sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous tone in 10-min. intervals containing noise and quiet. Heart rate was responsive to noise level but not noise type. Blood pressure increased primarily to sounds of sudden onset. Noise-induced awakening and alpha EEG responses were related to BP increase. Increase in HR was greatest when subjects were awakened by noise or already awake. Spectral analysis of BP variabilities indicated increased sympathetic vascular tone due to noise. Similar analyses of HR data indicated no noise effect. No habituation to noise was apparent over three consecutive sleep sessions. It was concluded that over the range of noise levels used, heart rate responds to noise level during sleep; blood pressure to sounds of sudden onset. Spectral analysis of blood pressure variabilities is a sensitive measure of autonomic nervous response to environmental noise and should also be studied in subjects sleeping at home.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12071548/"}

Here, considering the case of Singapore, we study how peoples' sleep behaviors-which are closely linked to their mental health-varied as a result. However, different from most studies, this paper uses household electricity consumption data to estimate the sleeping behaviors of nearly 10,000 households in the city-state. With this, we study how the residents' daily sleep durations changed dynamically during the lockdown and afterwards when restrictions were progressively eased, and show their strong connection to major changes in the public health policy and current events during this period. Our results add to the evidence for the stress endured by the populace during the lockdown; we find that sleep durations for all demographics, while higher than before the lockdown, became more fluctuating across days. A major, and surprising, finding is that it was the lockdown that determined the residents' sleeping duration, rather than simply working-from-home arrangements. That is, the sleeping durations largely reverted back to their pre-pandemic levels when the lockdown was lifted-with small variations based on demographic factors-although a vast majority of people continued to work from home. This highlights the resilience of the daily routines of the Singapore populace. While providing insights into how a pandemic influences the dynamics of urban sleep patterns, our finding also has broader implications regarding the efficiency of the workforce, suggesting that concerns about asynchronous work routines and productivity may be overblown.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39242575/"}

Apnoeas were classified as \"spontaneous\" or \"post-sigh\". Daily average spontaneous apnoea index was 35 times greater (p<0.0001) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than in non-REM (NREM) sleep. In contrast, daily average post-sigh apnoea index was not significantly greater in REM sleep than in non-REM (NREM) sleep (p=0.39). There was a greater post-sigh apnoea index during daytime REM than during nighttime REM (p=0.043) but REM-related spontaneous apnoea index was unaffected by time of day. There was no day to night difference in spontaneous apnoea index or post-sigh apnoea index during NREM sleep. Respiratory variability (coefficient of variation for breath duration and tidal volume) was not affected by time of day in REM or NREM sleep.

We perform local field potential (LFP) recordings on flies spontaneously sleeping, and compare their brain activity to flies induced to sleep using either genetic activation of sleep-promoting circuitry or the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist Gaboxadol. We find a transitional sleep stage associated with a 7-10 Hz oscillation in the central brain during spontaneous sleep. Oscillatory activity is also evident when we acutely activate sleep-promoting neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of Drosophila. In contrast, sleep following Gaboxadol exposure is characterized by low-amplitude LFPs, during which dFB-induced effects are suppressed.

Thirty-four nurses working irregular night shifts participated; 17 were classified as good sleepers and 17 as poor sleepers based on the Sleep-Wake Experience List, a validated self-report instrument that measures one's sleep quality. Interviews were conducted using open questions to explore strategies around the night-shift set. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Both groups described similar and different strategies that help them work and sleep well during and after night shifts. However, good sleepers mentioned a greater number of strategies and seemed to have thought about them more than poor sleepers. The most common strategies were having a clear structure, being organized-especially regarding sleeping time-maintaining a daily routine and adjusting their sleep environment.

Although 79.3% of OAs showed a significant increase of thoracoabdominal asynchrony, only 10.9% of the events scored by the identification of phase opposition were true OAs. Next, we developed two artificial neural networks (ANNs) as classifiers for the study of the thoracoabdominal signals. The first network was trained to locate obstructive and central apnea events. It correctly detected 75% of the OAs; however, only 6.2% of the detected events were true OAs. When a second network was used, OAs could not be discriminated from other portions of the signals showing similar phase characteristics. It was concluded that the information available in uncalibrated signals of thoracic and abdominal respiratory movements was insufficient to unambiguously detect OA events in sleeping infants.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12028481/"}

To this end, 504 participants (42.1% males), with a mean age of 16.17 (standard deviation = 1.39), were examined in the this cross-sectional study. Participants were asked to wear the Micro Motionlogger Watch actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardlsey, NY, USA) around their non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days in order to objectively assess social jetlag and weekend catch-up sleep. Participants were also asked to fill in the Mental Health Continuum—Short Form for the assessment of subjective, social, and psychological well-being, as well as the SF-36 Health Survey for the perception of physical health. In adolescents sleeping less than 7 h, those experiencing weekend catch-up sleep longer than 120 min reported significantly lower subjective well-being compared to those with a weekend catch-up sleep duration between 0 and 59 min. These data pointed out the detrimental effect of long weekend catch-up sleep on self-reported well-being only in adolescents getting less than the recommended amount of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36612896/"}

The circadian rhythm and sleep quality among adolescents were evaluated by using the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) and Self-rating scale of Sleep (SRSS) scales. Furthermore, correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the effects of demographic factors, sleeping arrangement, sleep quality, and circadian rhythm on depressive symptoms. The DG group's CES-DC, BRIAN and SRSS scores were significantly higher than the control group's. Higher scores of BRIAN and SRSS were risk factors for depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents.

{"id": "33090597", "title": "Sleep restriction alters physiological and emotional responses to emotion induction.", "text": "What is the central question of this study? The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of sleep restriction on self-report and autonomic responses to neutral and sad film clips. What is the main finding and its importance? Ratings of sadness and heart rate deceleration were greater while watching the sad clip, with no effect of sleep restriction, whereas heart rate variability and skin conductance were impacted by sleep restriction and, to a lesser extent, by film clips. The results suggest that autonomic function was adaptively altered by sleep restriction, in order to maintain a 'normal' response to emotional cues, despite mounting fatigue. Habitual insufficient sleep has long-term health consequences via its impact on autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and on regulation of emotion. To our knowledge, the effects of insufficient sleep on emotion-induced ANS function have not been tested. The present study aimed to address this lacuna. Using an emotion induction procedure, the effects of sleep restriction on physiological responses to validated neutral and sad film clips were assessed in a two-by-two, pseudo-randomized, cross-over design. Thirty-one participants, aged 20-33 years, were assessed after sleeping for either 5 h (sleep restricted, SR) or 8 h (well rested, WR) per night, for three consecutive nights. Physiological measures included heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance response (SCR) and participants' ratings of affect and fatigue. There was no effect of sleep conditions on self-reported negative affect, but watching the sad clip reduced self-reported fatigue in the SR condition. There was greater heart rate deceleration while watching sad relative to neutral clips, independent of the sleep condition. Sleep restriction increased heart rate variability measures, with no effect of emotion induction. There was an interaction of emotion induction with sleep condition for SCR, with more SCRs to sad relative to neutral clips in the WR condition, and the opposite effect in the SR condition. Combined, the results suggest that the ANS response to an emotional cue was altered by sleep restriction. The results suggest an adaptive ANS response to mild, chronic sleep restriction, resulting in constant heart rate response and self-reported experience across WR and SR conditions, despite mounting fatigue.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33090597/"}

To further explore the effect of Banxia Houpo decoction on known or unknown biological pathways during treatment of insomnia, the metabonomics method based on ¹H-NMR was developed for detecting the significant changes in metabolomics after the administration with Banxia Houpo decoction in pentobarbital sodium-induced rat sleeping experiment. Serum and urine samples were analyzed by ¹H-NMR. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out for endogenous small molecule metabolites in urine and serum. H-NMR spectroscopies and relevant metabolites were found and identified by Simca-p 17.0 (Umet-rics, Umea, Sweden) and Chenomx NMR Suite 7.1 (Chenomx, Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) software. The result suggests that Banxia Houpo decoction group and indiplon group had significant differences. The load diagram showed the biggest variation metabolites and intergroup significant differences among 10 metabolic substances. According to the experiment, Banxia Houpo decoction group and indiplon group can prolonge the sleeping time of pentobarbital sodium-induced sprague-dawley rats, with a synergistic effect. The significant changes of these biomarkers indicated that the Banxia Houpo decoction could aid sleep by adjusting the content of glutamine, creatine phosphate, 2-oxoglutarate, and reducing the activity of brain nerves.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28884548/"}

Self-report questionnaires were used to collect data on sleep duration, sleepiness, and trouble sleeping, classified into three categories: healthy, intermediate, and poor sleep patterns. Healthy sleep was defined as sleeping seven to nine hours per night with no self-reported sleepiness or trouble sleeping, while intermediate and poor sleep patterns indicated one and two to three sleep problems, respectively. The oxidative balance score (OBS) was calculated based on twenty oxidative stress-related exposures to dietary and lifestyle factors, with a higher score indicating greater antioxidant exposure. Survey-based multivariable-adjusted regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of sleep patterns or OBS alone and combined with the total and specific CVD risk. Participants with poor sleep patterns had a higher likelihood of developing CVD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-2.45, P < 0.05), while an inverse association was found between OBS and CVD risk (quartile (Q) 4 vs Q1: OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.47-0.94, P = 0.02, P for trend <0.05). There was an interaction between sleep patterns and OBS (P for interaction = 0.03). Participants with unhealthy (intermediate and poor) sleep patterns and pro-oxidant OBS (Q1 and Q2) were significantly associated with increased risk of total CVD (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.42-3.74, P < 0.05), as well as angina and congestive heart failure, but not coronary heart disease (CHD). Stratified analysis showed that among individuals without hyperlipidaemia, participants with both unhealthy sleep patterns and pro-oxidant OBS exhibited a higher risk of CHD compared to those with healthy sleep patterns and antioxidative OBS.

Spindles can be subdivided into two groups, slow (10-13 Hz) and fast (13-16 Hz), which are each associated with different functions. Specifically, fast spindles oscillate in the high-sigma band and are associated with sensorimotor processing, which is affected by visual deprivation. However, how blindness influences spindle development has not yet been investigated. We recorded nap video-EEG of 50 blind/severely visually impaired (BSI) and 64 sighted children aged 5 months to 6 years old. We considered aspects of both macro- and micro-structural spindles. The BSI children lacked the evolution of developmental spindles within the central area. Specifically, young BSI children presented low central high-sigma and high-beta (25-30 Hz) event-related spectral perturbation and showed no signs of maturational decrease. High-sigma and high-beta activity in the BSI group correlated with clinical indices predicting perceptual and motor disorders.

Our aim was to detect and quantitate RRV during the various sleep stages, including wakefulness. The nasal pressure transducer signal was acquired at 100 Hz and consecutive frequency spectra were generated for the length of the PSG with the Fast Fourier Transform. For each spectrum, we computed the amplitude ratio of the first harmonic peak to the zero frequency peak (H1/DC), and defined as RRV as (100 - H1/DC) %. RRV was greater during wakefulness compared to any sleep stage, including rapid-eye-movement. Furthermore, RRV correlated with the depth of sleep, being lowest during N3. Patients spent most their sleep time supine, but we found no correlation between RRV and body position. There was a correlation between respiratory rate and sleep stage, being greater in wakefulness than in any sleep stage. We conclude that RRV varies according to sleep stage.

The proportion of mismatches between electrophysiologically defined sleep and state judgements was time-dependent with more awake judgements for REM sleep in the second half of the sleep period (41.7%) than in the first one (17.4%). Those subjects who made an awake judgement more frequently had a feeling of being aware of the situation and their surroundings than those who made a sleep judgement (80% versus 33%). Awareness during sleep may be a cognitive style, which favours mismatches between state perception and electrophysiologically defined sleep. Sleep periods with concordant or discordant state judgements did not differ in electrophysiologically defined sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, or sleep state distribution.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18036079/"}

For awake subjects, AM/FM tones produced larger amplitude responses than did AM tones. Awake and sleeping responses to 30-dB HL AM/FM tones were compared. Response amplitudes were lower during sleep and the extent to which they differed from awake amplitudes was dependent on both carrier and modulation frequencies. Background EEG noise at the stimulus modulation frequency was also reduced during sleep and varied with modulation frequency. A detection efficiency function was used to indicate the modulation frequencies likely to be most suitable for electrical estimation of behavioral threshold. In awake subjects, for all carrier frequencies tested, detection efficiency was highest at a modulation frequency of 45 Hz. In sleeping subjects, the modulation frequency regions of highest efficiency varied with carrier frequency. For carrier frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, and 1 kHz, the highest efficiencies were found in two modulation frequency regions centered on 45 and 90 Hz. For 2 and 4 kHz, the highest efficiencies were at modulation frequencies above 70 Hz. Sleep stage affected both response amplitude and background EEG noise in a manner that depended on modulation frequency. The results of this study suggest that, for sleeping subjects, modulation frequencies above 70 Hz may be best when using steady-state potentials for hearing threshold estimation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1774415/"}

This study investigates the relationship between naps, night-time sleep, and cognitive function over time among middle-aged and older adults in China, as well as how this relationship may differ between rural and urban residents. A total of 2,938 community residents aged 45 and older were selected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, conducted in 2013, 2015, and 2018). The study examined the relationship between napping, night-time sleep, and cognitive function using fixed-effects analysis over a period of five years. Sleeping 6-8 hours/ night and napping for less than 30 minutes/ day were associated with better cognitive function (β = 0.383, 95% CI: 0.198, 0.567) and memory (β = 0.304, 95% CI: 0.155, 0.451) across the entire sample. In contrast, sleeping more than 8 hours/ night and napping more than 90 minutes/ day were associated with poor mental status. Specifically, sleeping 6-8 hours/ night was significantly associated with better cognitive function (β = 0.501, 95% CI: 0.252, 0.750) and memory (β = 0.372, 95% CI: 0.173, 0.572) in rural respondents. Sleeping more than 8 hours/ night was associated with poorer mental status among urban respondents (β = -0.291, 95% CI: -0.551, -0.032). Rural respondents who napped less than 90 minutes/ day had improved cognitive function. Napping for more than 90 minutes/ day was significantly correlated with cognitive function and mental status, which was primarily observed among urban respondents. Considerable differences were observed between rural and urban areas regarding the relationship between napping, night-time sleep, and cognitive function. When designing interventions to enhance cognitive function, it's essential to take into account cultural context, geographical factors, and individual differences.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40700415/"}

However, despite opposition from medical authorities or the police, many western parents are increasingly adopting night-time infant caregiving patterns that include some co-sleeping, especially by those mothers who choose to breast feed. This review will show that the relationships between infant sleep patterns, infant sleeping arrangements and development both in the short and long term, whether having positive or negative outcomes, is anything but simple and the traditional habit of labelling one sleeping arrangement as being superior to another without an awareness of family, social and ethnic context is not only wrong but possibly harmful. We will show that there are many good reasons to insist that the definitions of different types of co-sleeping and bedsharing be recognised and distinguished. We will examine the conceptual issues related to the biological functions of mother-infant co-sleeping, bedsharing and what relationship each has to SIDS. At very least, we hope that the studies and data described in this paper, which show that co-sleeping at least in the form of roomsharing especially with an actively breast feeding mother saves lives, is a powerful reason why the simplistic, scientifically inaccurate and misleading statement 'never sleep with your baby' needs to be rescinded, wherever and whenever it is published.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15911459/"}

However, it is considered that it may increase phase 3 of non rapid eye movement sleep, where somnambulism can take place. Our aim is to report 8 cases of sleep related eating disorders associated with the use of this drug. We have evaluated the medical history of 8 patients who had received zolpidem for sleeping disorders and who have presented sleep related eating disorders. Eight patients (6 women, 2 men) aged between 32 to 72 years old, which received 10 mg of zolpidem/night except 1 that received 12.5 mg, were presented. They have referred strange eating behavior compatible to sleep related eating disorder. Symptoms appeared at a mean of 39.8 days after starting the medication. The numbers of nocturnal episodes recorded by the family or by the patient were 1 to 8 episodes of nocturnal eating per night. The morning after, patients found leftovers from the night before which they did not recall to have eaten. The remission was complete after discontinuing zolpidem. Zolpidem may induce sleep related eating disorder in about 1% of patients, although we consider there may be a subdiagnosis of this phenomenon. It will be important to bear in mind and look for this side effect because all the episodes could easily be controlled by withdrawing the drug.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20529770/"}

The objective of this study was to investigate Head Start children's sleeping patterns and the impact on cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Using the 2009 cohort of the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (N = 2,868), information on sleeping patterns was assessed through parent interviews. Cognitive outcomes were assessed using direct assessments (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV, the Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test, and Subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III) in addition to teacher report. Behavioural outcomes were assessed through parent and teacher reports. A multiple regression analysis was performed for each outcome variable. Descriptive findings showed that 89% of children had a regular bedtime at least 4 days per week and that the average amount of sleep per night was 10.41 hr. White mothers were more likely than other racial groups to adhere to a consistent bedtime, and maternal employment predicted less hour of sleep per night. Multiple regression analyses revealed that disrupted sleep had a negative influence on cognitive outcomes, especially in areas of mathematical problem solving, receptive language, teacher-reported literacy behaviours, and approaches to learning. Disrupted sleep was associated with the risk of misbehaviour by increasing teacher and parent ratings on aggressive behaviours, hyperactivity, and withdrawing in addition to decreased scores on overall social skills. Having an inconsistent bedtime negatively predicted expressive vocabulary and teacher-reported literacy behaviours. The findings of this study support the influential role of sleep on children's development. Sleeping through the night and having a consistent bedtime were found to be predictive of many areas of cognitive and behavioural development.

Unilateral BBF, which was continuously measured with an electromagnetic flow probe placed around the internal maxillary artery, progressively increased with CO inhalation in the awake and both sleep stages. The increase in BBF with CO inhalation during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (delta BBF/delta arterial O2 saturation = 1.34 +/- 0.27 ml X min-1 X %-1) was significantly greater than that manifested during wakefulness (0.87 +/- 0.14) or slow-wave sleep (0.92 +/- 0.13). Ventilation was depressed by CO inhalation during both sleep stages but was unchanged from base-line values in awake goats. In contrast to slow-wave (non-REM) sleep, the ventilatory depression of REM sleep was primarily due to a reduction in tidal volume. Since tidal volume is more closely linked to central chemoreceptor function, we believe that these data suggest a possible role of the increased cerebral perfusion during hypoxic REM sleep. Induction of relative tissue alkalosis at the vicinity of the medullary chemoreceptor may contribute to the ventilatory depression exhibited during this sleep period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3944039/"}

Recent physiology studies have demonstrated that airway obstruction arises more commonly in the supine position particularly at the level of the soft palate and epiglottis. Increased airway collapsibility is reliability observed supine relative to lateral position.

Six routinely bedsharing and six routinely solitary-sleeping pairs slept 3 nights in the sleep laboratory.

During bedsharing infants were never placed prone, regardless of their routine sleeping condition. On the bedsharing night, mothers and infants spent most of the night oriented toward each other; seven of 12 infants remained oriented toward their mothers the entire night. While sleeping in a face-to-face orientation, most pairs slept most of the time less than 30 cm apart with appreciable amounts of time at less than 20 cm. This orientation and proximity should facilitate sensory exchanges between mother and infant which, we hypothesize, influence the infant's sleep physiology and nocturnal behavior. We conclude that bedsharing minimizes the use of the prone infant sleeping position, probably in part to facilitate breast feeding. By promoting nonprone positions, bedsharing may protect some infants from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), since prone sleeping is a known risk factor for SIDS. The large percentage of the night that mothers spent oriented toward their infants suggests that a higher degree of maternal vigilance may also result from bedsharing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9122553/"}

Attempts were made to measure SMR in the home of one group of infants at monthly intervals over the first year of life and of another group in the 1 to 12 age range, over three consecutive days. Sixty one infants were recruited and 181 measurements made. In 11 infants six or more satisfactory measurements were made a monthly intervals and in another 11 infants, three consecutive daily measurements were obtained. Parents chose the clothing and bedding that they judged their infant needed to fall asleep. The room air and radiative temperatures, humidity, and amount of insulation were recorded. The mean (SD) SMR was 2.4 (0.4) watts (W)/kg or 45 (10) W/m2. The rate was the same for infants in the age groups 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 years; individual infants did not show a systematic change with age. There was wide variation. Ninety eight per cent of infants had a SMR between 1.8 and 3.1 W/kg. The mean SMR for the infants measured on three consecutive days varied from 1.7 to 3.1 W/kg, and SMR varied within infants, from 0.06 to 0.86 W/kg. The variation within six to 11 measurements on infants over the first year of life ranged from 0.38 to 1.05 W/kg. Infants in the first year of life exhibit wide variations in SMR from day to day and from month to month. As the range is wide, guidance on clothing and bedding for thermal comfort can be given only in broad terms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8984912/"}

Continuous measurements of sleep state, respiratory pattern, carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption were made before, during, and after a 3-h period of sustained hyperthermia. During hyperthermia, rectal temperatures were raised a mild 1-1.5 degree C above normal, well below the levels likely to cause severe physiologic distress in this species. This resulted in a disruption of the sleep state pattern characterized by a decrease in duration of rapid eye movement (REM) episodes, whereas immediately afterwards, during recovery, the amount of REM sleep increased. In some cases the amount of REM sleep in recovery more than doubled the basal level. Apneas were rarely observed during hyperthermia, but in recovery there was an increase in the total amount of time spent in apnea in both REM and non-rapid eye movement sleep states with a predominance in the REM state. Arousal responses to chemostimulation were not affected at this time. We conclude that the sleeping newborn piglet does indeed show marked changes in sleep state pattern (particularly REM sleep) and in the amount of apnea recorded during and immediately after only a mild increase in core temperature.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8255687/"}

During the first 4 wk, the heart rate in quiet sleep was lower than in active sleep due to a significantly higher parasympathetic tone. The heart rate decreased with age in both sleep states: the decrease in quiet sleep was accompanied by a transition from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance.

Acute administration of large amounts of alcohol prior to sleep leads to decreased sleep-onset latency and changes in sleep architecture early in the night, when blood alcohol levels are high, with subsequent disrupted, poor-quality sleep later in the night. Alcohol abuse and dependence are associated with chronic sleep disturbance, lower slow-wave sleep, and more rapid-eye-movement sleep than normal, that last long into periods of abstinence and may play a role in relapse. This chapter outlines the evidence for acute and chronic alcohol effects on sleep architecture and sleep electroencephalogram, evidence for tolerance with repeated administration, and possible underlying neurochemical mechanisms for alcohol's effects on sleep. Also discussed are sex differences as well as effects of alcohol on sleep homeostasis and circadian regulation. Evidence for the role of sleep disruption as a risk factor for developing alcohol dependence is discussed in the context of research conducted in adolescents. The utility of sleep-evoked potentials in the assessment of the effects of alcoholism on sleep and the brain and in abstinence-mediated recovery is also outlined.

We recently found that the hippocampal population activity of a spontaneous sleep state whose EEG resembles SIA reflects the rat's current location in space, suggesting that it is also a state of heightened arousal. To test whether this spontaneous SIA state corresponds to the SIA state reported in the literature and to compare the level of arousal during SIA to the other well-characterized physiological states, we recorded unit activity from ensembles of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, EEG from the hippocampus and the neocortex, and electromyography (EMG) from the dorsal neck musculature in rats presented with auditory stimuli while foraging for randomly scattered food pellets and while sleeping. Auditory stimuli presented during sleep reliably induced SIA episodes very similar to spontaneous SIA in hippocampal and neocortical EEG amplitudes and power spectra, EMG amplitude, and CA1 population activity. Both spontaneous and elicited SIA exhibited neocortical desynchronization, and both had EMG amplitude comparable to that of waking LIA. We conclude based on this and other evidence that spontaneous SIA and elicited SIA correspond to a single state and that the level of arousal in SIA is higher than in the well-characterized sleep states but lower than the active theta state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14749309/"}

In Experiment 1, 30 good and 30 poor sleepers were instructed either to monitor or not to monitor a clock as they were trying to get to sleep. Worry was indexed by self-rating. Sleep was measured by self-report and actigraphy. Compared to non-monitors, clock-monitors reported more pre-sleep worry and they experienced longer sleep onset latency (SOL). These findings held true for both good and poor sleepers. In Experiment 2, following one night of baseline measurement, 38 individuals diagnosed with primary insomnia were instructed to monitor either a clock or a digit display unit (a control monitoring task) as they were trying to get to sleep. The clock-monitoring task was rated to be more worry provoking and sleep interfering than the display unit-monitoring task. Whilst display unit-monitors experienced less pre-sleep worry, the clock-monitors experienced more pre-sleep worry and reported a longer SOL on the experimental night, relative to baseline. Further, compared to the display unit-monitors, the clock-monitors overestimated their SOL more on the experimental night. Together, these findings suggest that clock monitoring may trigger pre-sleep worry and serve to maintain insomnia by fuelling pre-sleep worry and exacerbating misperception of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16793001/"}

The crew followed a strict scheme of watch-on blocks at 0:00-06:00 h and at 12:00-18:00 h (<i>group 1</i>, diurnal sleep group) or watch-on blocks at 06:00-12:00 h and 18:00-24:00 h (<i>group 2</i>, nocturnal sleep group). We sampled saliva during the operational blocks over a 24-h period at <i>day 55</i> of the mission and collected sleep actigraphy data during the entire mission in 10 participants. Sleep showed a biphasic split pattern with significantly unequal distributions of total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE) between the two sleeping blocks, i.e., one long and one short sleep bout. Melatonin secretion showed no adjustment at the end of the mission to the watch standing blocks, following an endogenous circadian rhythm independent from the social zeitgebers with indications of a phase shift. Cortisol secretion however matched the biphasic work-sleep shift routine. Human physiology does not fully obey operational needs and there are differences in adjustment between melatonin and cortisol. A watch standing schedule that provides a balance between physiology and operationality still needs to be established. The potential adaptation effects of bright light therapy and melatonin supplementation should be investigated in future research.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> The current study has a unique character due to the field context in which the data were collected.

Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment predispose individuals to poor metabolic health and promote weight gain and have received increased research attention in the past 10 years. Insufficient sleep is defined as sleeping less than recommended for health benefits, whereas circadian misalignment is defined as wakefulness and food intake occurring when the internal circadian system is promoting sleep. This Review discusses the impact of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in humans on appetite hormones (focusing on ghrelin, leptin and peptide-YY), energy expenditure, food intake and choice, and risk of obesity. Some potential strategies to reduce the adverse effects of sleep disruption on metabolic health are provided and future research priorities are highlighted. Millions of individuals worldwide do not obtain sufficient sleep for healthy metabolic functions. Furthermore, modern working patterns, lifestyles and technologies are often not conducive to adequate sleep at times when the internal physiological clock is promoting it (for example, late-night screen time, shift work and nocturnal social activities).

{"id": "29144169", "title": "Bright-light exposure during daytime sleeping affects nocturnal melatonin secretion after simulated night work.", "text": "The guidelines for night and shift workers recommend that after night work, they should sleep in a dark environment during the daytime. However, staying in a dark environment during the daytime reduces nocturnal melatonin secretion and delays its onset. Daytime bright-light exposure after night work is important for melatonin synthesis the subsequent night and for maintaining the circadian rhythms. However, it is not clear whether daytime sleeping after night work should be in a dim- or a bright-light environment for maintaining melatonin secretion. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the effect of bright-light exposure during daytime sleeping on nocturnal melatonin secretion after simulated night work. Twelve healthy male subjects, aged 24.8 ± 4.6 (mean ± SD), participated in 3-day sessions under two experimental conditions, bright light or dim light, in a random order. On the first day, the subjects entered the experimental room at 16:00 and saliva samples were collected every hour between 18:00 and 00:00 under dim-light conditions. Between 00:00 and 08:00, they participated in tasks that simulated night work. At 10:00 the next morning, they slept for 6 hours under either a bright-light condition (>3000 lx) or a dim-light condition (<50 lx). In the evening, saliva samples were collected as on the first day. The saliva samples were analyzed for melatonin concentration. Activity and sleep times were recorded by a wrist device worn throughout the experiment. In the statistical analysis, the time courses of melatonin concentration were compared between the two conditions by three-way repeated measurements ANOVA (light condition, day and time of day). The change in dim light melatonin onset (ΔDLMO) between the first and second days, and daytime and nocturnal sleep parameters after the simulated night work were compared between the light conditions using paired t-tests. The ANOVA results indicated a significant interaction (light condition and3 day) (p = .006). Post hoc tests indicated that in the dim-light condition, the melatonin concentration was significantly lower on the second day than on the first day (p = .046); however, in the bright-light condition, there was no significant difference in the melatonin concentration between the days (p = .560). There was a significant difference in ΔDLMO between the conditions (p = .015): DLMO after sleeping was advanced by 11.1 ± 17.4 min under bright-light conditions but delayed for 7.2 ± 13.6 min after sleeping under dim-light conditions. No significant differences were found in any sleep parameter. Our study demonstrated that daytime sleeping under bright-light conditions after night work could not reduce late evening melatonin secretion until midnight or delay the phase of melatonin secretion without decreasing the quality of the daytime sleeping. Thus, these results suggested that, to enhance melatonin secretion and to maintain their conventional sleep-wake cycle, after night work, shift workers should sleep during the daytime under bright-light conditions rather than dim-light conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29144169/"}

In all sleep states we found significant but variable transient hyperventilation following release of occlusion. In NREM sleep, a significant central apnea [expiratory time (TE) prolonged 2-10 times control] followed the hyperpneic response, so long as the increase in tidal volume (VT) during the hyperpnea exceeded three times control VT, that is, a volume-dependent apneic threshold. In REM sleep with maintained levels of eye movement density, hyperventilation commonly followed release of obstruction but only very rarely did VT exceed the volume threshold, and central apnea was rare. Cervical vagal blockade was used to show that significant inhibitory pulmonary stretch receptor reflexes were present in both NREM and REM sleep, although the strength of the reflex was diminished in REM. We postulate that the phasic events of REM sleep inhibit the increase in VT in response to the chemical stimuli accumulated during airway occlusion and also interfere with the prolongation of TE in response to lung stretch and/or transient hypocapnia.

Seasonal changes in photoperiod accounted for a significant amount of variation in sleeping site entry and exit times. Time of exit was more closely correlated with sunrise than time of entry was with sunset. Both species entered their sleeping sites when light levels were significantly higher than when they left them in the morning. Troops of both species used >80 individual sites, the majority being used once. Mustached tamarins never used the same site for more than two consecutive nights, but saddlebacks reused the same site for up to four consecutive nights.

We hypothesized that the sleeping ventilatory response to hypercapnia (HCVR) and/or hypoxia (HVR) would predict respiratory events following release of inspiratory airway obstruction (IAO) in normal men during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. We therefore measured HCVR, HVR, and ventilation for three breaths preceding and eight breaths following three totally obstructed inspirations in eight normal subjects during NREM sleep. After IAO, we generally observed transient hyperventilation that resulted in hypocapnia and prolonged expiratory time. We found the initial increase in inspiratory minute ventilation (VI) following IAO to be correlated with HCVR (r = 0.72, P less than 0.05) but not HVR. In addition, the maximum decrease in PCO2 below base line was also related to HCVR (r = 0.83, P less than 0.05). This decrement in PCO2 predicted the subsequent prolongation in expiratory time (TE, r = 0.83, P less than 0.05) that was frequently observed. HCVR tended to predict the prolongation of TE, at the nadir of CO2 (r = 0.69, P = 0.057). In conjunction with this hypocapnia and prolongation of TE, hypoventilation with falling VI was often observed followed by periodic hyper- and hypoventilation. These results suggest that high HCVR may result in ventilatory overshoot following IAO and may contribute to ventilatory instability during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2793763/"}

We found previously that arousal to a non-respiratory (tactile) stimulus occurs in a sequence of events that begins with spinal, followed by brainstem responses, and then a cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) arousal response. We hypothesized that repeated stimuli would depress the arousal responses by habituation and that spinal and brainstem responses would be more resistant to habituation than cortical responses. We studied 22 normal infants. The infants underwent polysomnographic monitoring during a daytime nap. Tactile stimuli was applied to the infants foot at 5-second intervals. We found that spinal, brainstem, and cortical responses occurred on the first trial of each test. Repeated trials during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep resulted in a decrease in the incidence of each individual response and eventually elimination of the arousal responses. Cortical responses were eliminated first, followed by brainstem responses and finally spinal responses. The elimination of each of the responses occurred more rapidly during REM sleep that during NREM sleep. Habituation of the infant arousal sequence occurs with repeated tactile stimulation. There is a serial habituation of responses from the cortical to the spinal level, which occurs more rapidly during REM sleep. Rapid habituation to innocuous stimuli is probably beneficial in avoiding detrimental sleep disruptions.

These results show a critical role of DA signaling in the BLA in initiating REM sleep and provide a neuronal basis for sleep cycle generation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35239361/"}

Direct cooling and warming of the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic region was accomplished with water-perfused thermodes. Neuronal thermosensitivity was determined by means of the linear regression analysis of firing rate changes vs anterior hypothalamic-preoptic temperature changes. A total of 117 neurons were classified as thermosensitive during wakefulness and synchronized sleep (20.1% of the studied neurons). Cold-sensitive neurons outnumbered warm-sensitive neurons by 3.7:1. The homeothermic states, wakefulness and synchronized sleep, are characterized by similar frequency distributions of neuronal thermosensitivity, although variable changes in single neuron thermosensitivity are state-dependent. Such changes underlie the quantitative differences in homeothermic regulation between these states. The impairment of thermoregulation during desynchronized sleep is characterized by a different frequency distribution of neuronal thermosensitivity resulting from both a drop in the responsiveness to thermal stimulation of a majority of neurons and a reversal in the sensitivity to cooling and warming of a minority of neurons. In conclusion, only the frequency distribution of thermosensitivity in the neuronal population is indicative of changes in the thermoregulation paradigm across behavioral states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3620945/"}

We describe three kinds of episodes during the sleeping period-awake episodes which occur completely during electroencephalogram (EEG)-defined wakefulness associated with clinical evidence of the waking state (62 episodes), episodes occurring during EEG-defined sleep which have a rapid drop in pH at their onset (119 episodes), and episodes occurring during EEG-defined sleep in which the esophageal pH drifts down slowly over a period up to 30 min (113 episodes). Only 9 of the 10 control subjects experienced any reflux episodes during monitoring. The total number of episodes of reflux in controls (34) was less than the total number in reflux subjects (260). Controls did, however, experience all three types of reflux episode. Awake episodes all had a rapid drop in pH at their onset and were characterized by a short acid clearance time (2.0 +/- 0.3 min in reflux patients and 1.0 +/- 0.2 min in controls). The sleep episodes with rapid onset had longer mean acid clearance time than the awake episodes, significantly so in GER subjects (20.1 +/- 6.8 min in reflux subjects and 2.6 + 1.3 min in controls). Body movement was noted at the onset of 93.4% of rapid-onset sleep episodes in reflux subjects and 88.9% in controls.

Sleep/wake initially was assessed at home using actigraphy and diary for 1 week on each child's self-selected schedule followed by an 8-night fixed light-dark (LD) condition, while sleeping from 22:00 to 08:00 h and wearing an eye mask to exclude as much light as possible. Phase measurements included 4-night mean actigraphically estimated sleep onset and offset as well as 1-night dim light salivary melatonin onset (DLSMO) phase at the end of each condition. Subjects then lived in the laboratory for 6 consecutive cycles: Day 1 LD = 14:10 h, lights out 22:00 to 08:00 h; Days 2-4 LD = 6:18 h, lights out 18:00 to 12:00 h; Days 5-6 = constant routine in continuous dim light (about 20 lux); Night 6 = 14 h recovery sleep. Phase markers (sleep onset, sleep offset, DLSMO) were significantly less dispersed after the fixed LD as compared to the self-selected condition, indicating efficacy of the LD protocol. Phase markers were correlated at the self-selected assessment (sleep onset vs. sleep offset r = .72; DLSMO vs. sleep onset r = .82; DLSMO vs. sleep offset r = .76) but not on the fixed schedule, probably due to restricted range. The constant routine provided additional phase markers, melatonin offset and midphase. Offset phase of melatonin secretion was significantly correlated with age (r = .62) and Tanner stage (r = .62). In conclusion, these preliminary data indicate a relationship between adolescent development and circadian phase. Thus, the long nights protocol is a feasible way in which to assess circadian parameters in young humans as well as to examine intrinsic sleep processes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9181439/"}

Only a few years ago, if patients complained of difficulty sleeping, they were given pills, often dangerous and addictive pills, to induce sleep no matter what the basis of the complaint might be. Sleeping pills may be safer now, and the understanding of the sleep state itself has increased rapidly. Diagnoses are still diffuse, however, and treatments are often poorly directed. Depression is the offspring of the phlegmatic disposition and the melancholia of another era. Clinically, diagnosis is based on a global assessment of symptoms. It is likely that a diagnosis of depression may include a spectrum of underlying diseases that cannot now be clinically differentiated. Medications have multiple effects on sleep and have many side effects. Progress has, however, been made beyond mother's little pills.

Sleeping newborns rapidly learned the predictive relationship between the tone and the puff. Additionally, in the latter part of training, these infants exhibited a frontally maximum positive EEG slow wave possibly reflecting memory updating. As newborns spend most of their time sleeping, the ability to learn about external stimuli in the postnatal environment during nonawake states may be crucial for rapid adaptation and infant survival.

A brief review is made of epidemiologic findings on SUD, including the fact that around 9000 infant fatalities per year are attributed to SUD in the U.S.A. alone. Evidence for excessive vagal discharge as a likely factor in SUD is discussed. The nature of the oculo-cardiac reflex discovered by Aschner is described, with particular attention to those factors which appear to make specific categories of sleeping infant more vulnerable to cardiac arrest in circumstances where this reflex is elicited. The factors include prematurity and an existing electrical instability of the heart. Regarding the manner in which such an oculo-cardiac reflex might in practice be set off, it is suggested that this could occur if the infant slept in such a position that the weight of the head could press the eye against any irregular surface which might exist on the mattress, or any object which was resting on the mattress. Evidence is cited for SUD infants being in fact more likely than controls to sleep in such a position. Children with exophthalmos would be more at risk in this respect.

Decreased slow wave sleep and increased awakenings have been reported in laboratory polysomnography in TS patients, and a serotoninergic disorder of arousal has been postulated. We recorded outpatient sleep in 20 patients newly diagnosed with TS utilizing a 4-channel cassette EEG system. The newly-diagnosed patients were predominantly male, and ranged in age from 10 to 36 years. Some had taken psychotropic medications in the past, but none had been treated systematically for TS. Seven patients had chronic tics only, 8 had tics and attention deficit-hyperactivity, and 5 had tics plus obsessions and compulsions. None had other medical, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders. All were nocturnal sleepers, and were recorded in their usual sleeping environments and routines. TS patients had reduced sleep, decreased sleep efficiency, increased awakenings, and decreased slow wave sleep. Tic patients had increased nocturnal awakenings and movements, particularly those who had tics during sleep. Sleep fragmentation and loss of slow wave sleep was most marked in TS patients with attention deficit-hyperactivity. Sleep latency was increased, REM sleep reduced, and REM sleep latency decreased in TS patients with obsessions and compulsions. These findings accord with previous reports of sleep disturbance in TS, and suggest that these disturbances may vary with TS symptoms. Chronic tics may persist in sleep and cause awakenings, TS with attention deficit may be associated with a disorder of arousal and alertness, and obsessions and compulsions may be manifestations of a biochemical disturbance involving paradoxical sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1628407/"}

During quiet wakefulness and sleep, phasic hypoglossal activity was either very small or not observable above the baseline noise. Applying a perpendicular force on the submental region by using a mechanical device to narrow the pharyngeal airway passage increased the phasic hypoglossal activity, the phasic esophageal pressure, and the inspiratory time in the next breath during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. The phasic hypoglossal activity sustained at the elevated level while the force was present and increased with increasing amounts of loading. The hypoglossal nerve was very active in rapid-eye-movement sleep, especially when the submental force was present.

We measured IOP using an Icare tonometer in both eyes 5 minutes after assuming each position in a randomized sequence. We calculated the OPP using the formulas based on the mean BP adjusted for the height of the eye over the heart. The eye on the lower side in the lateral decubitus or prone with head turn position was termed the dependent eye. Difference in IOP and OPP of the dependent and nondependent eyes during changes of sleeping positions of body and head. Mean IOP of right and left eyes while sitting was significantly lower than that measured in each recumbent position (all P<0.001). The OPPs in both eyes were significantly higher in all recumbent positions than in a sitting position (all P<0.001). Mean IOP of the dependent eyes was higher than that of the nondependent eyes in the lateral decubitus positions and in the prone positions with head turns (all P<0.001). No significant intereye difference in OPP was found for any position. Among IOPs measured in the recumbent positions, mean IOP of the dependent eye in the lateral decubitus position or in the prone position with head turn was significantly higher than that of the ipsilateral eye in the supine position (all P<0.0001). All sleeping positions of head and body resulted in an elevation of IOP and an increase in the calculated OPP compared with the sitting position in healthy, young subjects. The postural change from supine to lateral decubitus or prone with head turn position increased the IOP of the dependent eyes without significant alteration in OPP in healthy awake subjects.

Although both species spent between 9 and 10 h per day sleeping, the mainland sloths showed a preference for sleeping at night, whereas island sloths showed no preference for sleeping during the day or night. Standardized EEG activity during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep showed lower low-frequency power, and increased spindle and higher frequency power in island sloths when compared to mainland sloths. In sloths sleeping in the wild, predation pressure influenced the timing of sleep, but not the amount of time spent asleep. The preference for sleeping at night in mainland sloths may be a strategy to avoid detection by nocturnal cats.

Intraperitoneal injection of PCPA induced the experimental condition, and the therapeutic effect of SLP was evaluated by studying the sleep pattern and expression of various neurotransmitters and receptors, along with neurotrophins. Moreover, insomnia-associated oxidative stress and inflammation were also studied. From the findings, we found that the SLP-supplemented animals improved their sleeping behaviour and that the major neurotransmitters, hormones, and receptors were maintained at an equilibrium level. Furthermore, the neurotrophin level was increased and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced. The evaluation of oxidative stress markers shows that the antioxidants were significantly boosted, and as a result, lipid peroxidation was prevented. The overall findings suggest that SLP can be used as an effective medication for the treatment of sleep disorders like insomnia as it triggers the major neurotransmitter system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37768468/"}

Actiwatch was used to track the sleep-wake pattern development trajectory of healthy infants in the first year of life in the home setting. Participating infants were followed up at 10th day and 28th day during the first month, and then monthly from the second to the sixth month after birth, and then at ninth and twelve months of age respectively. Meanwhile, infantile sleep was observed continuously for about 60 hours at each visit. According to the characteristics of repeated measurement data of this study, two-level random effect model was adopted to analyze the trend of infantile nocturnal sleep-wake parameters changing with age, and the gender difference. A total of 473 healthy infants were included in this study, among whom 246 (52.0%) were boys, and 227 (48.0%) were girls; 355 (75.1%) infants completed the whole year follow-up survey. With infants' age increasing, the latency of infants' nighttime sleep onset decreased from 66.8 minutes on 10th day to 15.5-18.7 minutes at 6-12 months of age. The number of night wakes also decreased with age, while uninterrupted sleep periods lengthened with age. On the 10th day, there were 3.0 times of nightwaking on average, and the longest continuous sleeping interval lasted for 227.6 minutes on average. At 12-month of age, infants could sleep continuously for 350.9 minutes at most on average, while the number of nightwaking decreased to 1.6 times per night on average.

The infants had a median age of 8 weeks (range 4-26 weeks); 54 were boys. In each child a pH probe was placed in the proximal portion of the thoracic oesophagus, under radiological control. Polygraphic monitoring of state of alertness, cardiorespiratory activity, and proximal oesophageal pH changes was conducted continuously during 1 night. The data were analysed blind. In 80 infants a total of 186 decreases in oesophageal pH below 4 units were seen; 37% occurred during wakefulness, and 40% during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A total of 7029 central and 61 obstructive apnoeas were monitored, mainly during REM sleep. Within 5 min before, and 5 min after the drops in pH, there was no difference in the number, or the duration of bradycardia, central, mixed, or obstructive apnoea. The infants with an ALTE could not be differentiated from the non-ALTE infants for any of the variables studied.

County of Avon. 35 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly (32 of the sudden infant death syndrome), 70 matched controls, and 152 population based controls. The prevalence of prone sleeping in the matched controls was much lower than that found in an earlier study in Avon (28% (18/64) 1990-1 v 58% (76/131) 1987-9; p less than 0.001) and was comparable with the prevalence in population based controls (29%).

The actual mortality fell from 3.5/1000 in 1987-9 to 1.7/1000. The fall in mortality can be almost entirely accounted for by the reduction in prone sleeping, suggesting a causal relation exists between them. Side and supine positions confer protection but the side position is unstable and the infant may roll prone. We therefore recommend supine as the safest sleeping position for babies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1739827/"}

To determine what molecular changes occur in the brain during the sleep-waking cycle and after sleep deprivation, our laboratory is performing a systematic screening of brain gene expression in rats that have been either sleeping or spontaneously awake for a few hours and in rats that have been sleep deprived for different periods of time ranging from a few hours to several days. So far, ~10,000 transcripts expressed in the cerebral cortex have been screened. The expression of the vast majority of these genes does not change either across behavioral states or after sleep deprivation, even when forced wakefulness is prolonged for several days. A few hours of wakefulness, either spontaneous or forced by sleep deprivation, increase the expression of the same small groups of genes: immediate-early genes/transcription factors, genes related to energy metabolism, growth factors/adhesion molecules, chaperones/heat shock proteins, vesicle- and synapse-related genes, neurotransmitter/hormone receptors, neurotransmitter transporters, and enzymes. Sleep, on the other hand, induces the expression of a few unknown transcripts whose characterization is in progress. Thus, although the characterization of the molecular correlates of behavioral states is not yet complete, it is already apparent that the transition from sleep to waking can affect basic cellular functions such as RNA and protein synthesis, neural plasticity, neurotransmission, and metabolism. The pattern of changes in gene expression after long periods of sleep deprivation is unique and does not resemble that of short-term sleep deprivation or spontaneous wakefulness. A notable exception is represented, however, by the enzyme arylsulfotransferase, whose induction appears to be proportional to the duration of previous wakefulness. Arylsulfotransferase in rodents plays a major role in the catabolism of catecholamines, suggesting that an important role for sleep may be that of interrupting the continuous activity, during wakefulness, of brain catecholaminergic systems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11744682/"}

Here, we used wireless recording from primary motor cortex (M1) and the cerebellum in three female monkeys to examine the relationship between patterns of single-unit spiking activity observed during waking behavior and in natural sleep. Across the population of recorded units, we observed similarities in the timing of firing relative to local field potential features associated with both movements during waking and up state during sleep. We also observed a consistent pattern of asymmetry in pairwise cross-correlograms, indicative of preserved sequential firing in both wake and sleep at low frequencies. Despite the overall similarity in population dynamics between wake and sleep, there was a global change in the timing of cerebellar activity relative to motor cortex, from contemporaneous in the awake state to motor cortex preceding the cerebellum in sleep. We speculate that similar population dynamics in waking and sleep may imply that cerebellar internal models are activated in both states, despite the absence of movement when asleep. Moreover, spindle frequency coherence between the cerebellum and motor cortex may provide a mechanism for cerebellar computations to influence sleep-dependent learning processes in the motor cortex.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that sleep can lead to improved motor performance. One possibility is that off-line learning results from neural activity during sleep in brain areas responsible for the control of movement. In this study we show for the first time that neuronal patterns in the cerebro-cerebellar system are conserved during both movements and sleep up-states, albeit with a shift in the relative timing between areas.

We aimed at studying the impact of sleep duration, circadian disruption and sleep quality on MS risk. We used a Swedish population-based case-control study (2075 cases, 3164 controls). Aspects of sleep were associated with MS risk by calculating OR with 95% CIs using logistic regression models. Compared with sleeping 7-9 hours/night during adolescence, short sleep (<7 hours/night) was associated with increased risk of developing MS (OR 1.4, 95% OR 1.1-1.7). Similarly, subjective low sleep quality during adolescence increased the risk of subsequently developing MS (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9), whereas phase shift did not significantly influence the risk. Our findings remained similar when those who worked shifts were excluded. Insufficient sleep and low sleep quality during adolescence seem to increase the risk of subsequently developing MS. Sufficient restorative sleep at young age, needed for adequate immune functioning, may be a preventive factor against MS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36690431/"}

The discharge of cells with overlapped place fields is more correlated in subsequent sleep, particularly during sharp waves, than in sleep episodes prior to the behavior, or than cell pairs with non-overlapped place fields. The reactivated correlated states appear during hippocampal sharp waves (SPWs), and are weak or absent in the inter-SPW interval. A simple conceptual hypothesis for this phenomenon is developed, based on the idea that hippocampal place fields reflect a two-dimensional distribution of continuously overlapping dynamic attractors in which each location is represented by the self-sustaining activity of a small subset of neurons with overlapping place fields. A numerical simulation of this hypothesis, based on a simplified representation of the CA8 recurrent network, accounts qualitatively for the main observations, including SPW-like dynamics. It is shown that, under conditions in which the connection patterns have been previously established, either associative or nonassociative mechanisms might underlie the reactivation of recently experienced states.

{"id": "9521831", "title": "Neuronal phenomena associated with vigilance and consciousness: from cellular mechanisms to electroencephalographic patterns.", "text": "The neuroanatomical substrates controlling and regulating sleeping and waking, and thus consciousness, are located in the brain stem. Most crucial for bringing the brain into a state conducive for consciousness and information processing is the mesencephalic part of the brain stem. This part controls the state of waking, which is generally associated with a high degree of consciousness. Wakefulness is accompanied by a low-amplitude, high-frequency electroencephalogram, due to the fact that thalamocortical neurons fire in a state of tonic depolarization. Information can easily pass the low-level threshold of these neurons, leading to a high transfer ratio. The complexity of the electroencephalogram during conscious waking is high, as expressed in a high correlation dimension. Accordingly, the level of information processing is high. Spindles, and alpha waves in humans, mark the transition from wakefulness to sleep. These phenomena are related to drowsiness, associated with a reduction in consciousness. Drowsiness occurs when cells undergo moderate hyperpolarizations. Increased inhibitions result in a reduction of afferent information, with a lowered transfer ratio. Information processing subsides, which is also expressed in a diminished correlation dimension. Consciousness is further decreased at the onset of slow wave sleep. This sleep is controlled by the medullar reticular formation and is characterized by a high-voltage, low-frequency electroencephalogram. Slow wave sleep becomes manifest when neurons undergo a further hyperpolarization. Inhibitory activities are so strong that the transfer ratio further drops, as does the correlation dimension. Thus, sensory information is largely blocked and information processing is on a low level. Finally, rapid eye movement sleep is regulated by the pontine reticular formation and is associated with a \"wake-like\" electroencephalographic pattern. Just as during wakefulness, this is the expression of a depolarization of thalamocortical neurons. The transfer ratio of rapid eye movement sleep has not yet been determined, but seems to vary. Evidence exists that this type of sleep, associated with dreaming, with some kind of perception and consciousness, is involved in processing of \"internal\" information. In line with this, rapid eye movement sleep has higher correlation dimensions than slow-wave sleep and sometimes even higher than wakefulness. It is assumed that the \"near-the-threshold\" depolarized state of neurons in the thalamus and cerebral cortex is a necessary condition for perceptual processes and consciousness, such as occurs during waking and in an altered form during rapid eye movement sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9521831/"}

Several factors, including reversed shift missions, can negatively affect sleep patterns and increase the risk of fatigue due to sleep restriction. Currently, there is a lack of objective data regarding the current rest and activity patterns of military aviators across multiple operational conditions. The purpose of this descriptive study was to document the rest and activity patterns of U.S. Army aviators in operational training and garrison (routine) environments using wrist-worn actigraphy devices.<b>METHODS:</b> Actigraphy data were collected from U.S. Army aviators in training (<i>N</i> = 20) and garrison (<i>N</i> = 77) environments for a period of 1 wk.<b>RESULTS:</b> Results from this study indicate that 90% of subjects in the training environment, even after accounting for small sleep bouts during the day, averaged less than the recommended 8 h of sleep daily across the recording week. Approximately half of subjects in garrison averaged less than 8 h of sleep daily after accounting for smaller sleep bouts. Sleep efficiency was relatively high and similar in both groups (∼84%). Subjects in the training group averaged significantly more time awake and less time sleeping than those in the routine garrison group. Moreover, subjects in training were exposed to more light during sleep than those in garrison.<b>DISCUSSION:</b> Training environments that are representative of deployed conditions restrict aviator restorative sleep.

Following the collection of basic information of the nurses and their scores in the various constructs of the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) questionnaire, each nurse wore an actigraph for seven consecutive days to collect for analysis the sleep-wake rhythm parameter dichotomy index (I < O) and durations of continuous sleep and wake. Multivariable linear regression was then used to determine whether the influence of various variables on fatigue differed between the two groups. Results revealed that the sleep-wake rhythm parameter I < O of the day worker group was significantly higher than that of the shift worker group (<i>t</i> = 5.08, <i>p</i> < .001). The shift worker group exhibited significantly higher PSQI global scores (<i>t</i> = -2.00, <i>p</i> = .047), longer total sleep time (<i>t</i> = 2.07, <i>p</i> = .040), poorer habitual sleep efficiency (<i>t</i> = -3.06, <i>p</i> = .003), and greater use of sleeping medication (<i>t</i> = -2.90, <i>p</i> = .004) than did the day worker group. Multivariable linear regression was performed to analyze the important predictors of the CIS score in the two groups with body mass index, age, work experience, marital status, educational background, department of employment, shift type at the time of recruitment, sleep-wake rhythm parameter I < O, and quality of sleep as independent variables. Results indicated that in the shift worker group, the overall explanatory power (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>) of the multivariable linear regression model was 22.9% (F = 3.01, <i>p</i> = .003), and only the PSQI global score (β = 0.33, <i>p</i> = .003) influenced the CIS score. In the day worker group, the various variables did not influence the CIS score in the multivariable linear regression model. Although the female nurses working rotating shifts spent more time in bed, their sleep-wake rhythms and sleep quality were poorer than those of the day worker group. Furthermore, the sleep quality of female nurses in the shift worker group had a significant impact on their fatigue. In other words, for female nurses who must work rotating shifts, sleep quality determines whether fatigue can be reduced. The shift-working nurses themselves should implement sleep management, such as avoiding disruptions to their sleep-wake rhythm and improving sleep quality, which should be effective strategies to reduce fatigue.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906006/"}

During studies dogs lay quietly in a lateral position and breathed through an endotracheal tube inserted via a chronic tracheostomy. Linear resistances of 6, 10, 19, and 31 cmH2O X l-1 X s were applied during inspiration for only a single breath to assess the immediate ventilatory response. The highest resistance was also applied for five successive breaths to assess the progressive ventilatory response. Ventilatory responses to hyperoxic progressive hypercapnia were also examined, with and without flow-resistive loading. During loading the maintenance of constant states of quiet wakefulness and NREM sleep was confirmed by electroencephalographic monitoring. Ventilation decreased on the first loaded breath and returned to control in a stepwise manner by the fifth loaded breath. No state-related differences were observed in either the immediate or progressive ventilatory responses. During CO2 rebreathing, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 was reduced by loading, with the reduction in slope (as percent of control) greater in the NREM state. We therefore conclude that in the dog immediate and progressive ventilatory responses to resistive loads are unaffected by NREM sleep, whereas the decrease in ventilatory response to CO2 resulting from loading tends to be greater in NREM sleep than in quiet wakefulness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6874476/"}

Consequently, sufficient n-3 PUFA intake by mothers during pregnancy is considered to contribute to CNS development in their infants. CNS development is known to be associated with sleep, but no large epidemiological studies have yet confirmed that n-3 PUFA intake during pregnancy is associated with infants' sleep. After exclusion and multiple imputation from a dataset comprising 104 065 records from the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), we examined 87 337 mother-child pairs for the association between mothers' fish and n-3 PUFA intakes and risk of their infants sleeping less than 11 h at 1 year of age. Multiple logistic regression analysis with the lowest quintile used as a reference revealed odds ratios for the second through fifth quintiles of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.76-0.87), 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.87), 0.78 (95% CI 0.72-0.84), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76-0.88) for fish intake (p for trend < 0.001) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.97), 0.88 (95% CI 0.81-0.94), 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.95), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-0.998) for n-3 PUFA intake (p for trend = 0.04). Low fish intake during pregnancy may increase the risk of infants sleeping less than 11 h at 1 year of age.

Individual differences in work stress appraisal and psychobiological cost of prolonged load seem to be of importance in view of expanding compressed working time schedules. Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers (mean +/- SD: 27.9 +/- 4.9 yrs) were required to stay in semiconstant routine conditions. They performed four sessions (each lasting approximately 2.5 h) of simulated driving, i.e., completed chosen tasks from computer driving games. Saliva samples were collected after each driving session, i.e., at 10:00-11:00, 14:00-15:00, 18:00-19:00, and 22:00-23:00 h as well as 10-30 min after waking (between 05:00 and 06:00 h) and at bedtime (after 00:00 h). Two subgroups of subjects were distinguished on the basis of the Chronotype Questionnaire: morning (M)- and evening (E)-oriented types. Subjective data on sleep need, sleeping time preferences, sleeping problems, and the details of the preceding night were investigated by questionnaire. Subjective measures of task load (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]), activation (Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List [AD ACL]), and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS]) were applied at times of saliva samples collection. M- and E-oriented types differed significantly as to their ideal sleep length (6 h 54 min +/- 44 versus 8 h 13 min +/- 50 min), preferred sleep timing (midpoint at 03:19 versus 04:26), and sleep index, i.e., 'real-to-ideal' sleep ratio, before the experimental day (0.88 versus 0.67). Sleep deficit proved to be integrated with eveningness. M and E types exhibited similar diurnal profiles of energy, tiredness, tension, and calmness assessed by AD ACL, but E types estimated higher their workload (NASA-TLX) and sleepiness (KSS). M types exhibited a trend of higher mean cortisol levels than E types (F = 4.192, p < .056) and distinct diurnal variation (F = 2.950, p < .019), whereas E types showed a flattened diurnal curve. Cortisol values did not correlate with subjective assessments of workload, arousal, or sleepiness at any time-of-day. Diurnal cortisol pattern parameters (i.e., morning level, mean level, and range of diurnal changes) showed significant positive correlations with sleep length before the experiment (r = .48, .54, and .53, respectively) and with sleep index (r = .63, .64, and .56, respectively). The conclusions of this study are: (i) E-oriented types showed lower salivary cortisol levels and a flattened diurnal curve in comparison with M types; (ii) sleep loss was associated with lower morning cortisol and mean diurnal level, whereas higher cortisol levels were observed in rested individuals. In the context of stress theory, it may be hypothesized that rested subjects perceived the driving task as a challenge, whereas those with reduced sleep were not challenged, but bored/exhausted with the experimental situation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20636209/"}

Narcolepsy is a rare sleep condition. Most people with narcolepsy experience disrupted nighttime sleep and have poor quality of sleep. Sometimes these symptoms are not easily diagnosed as a symptom of narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is an approved treatment for narcolepsy. The only version of sodium oxybate that was available until 2023 required people to take their sodium oxybate at bedtime and then again in the middle of the night. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA for short) has approved a once-nightly bedtime dose of sodium oxybate (ON-SXB for short, also known as FT218 or LUMRYZ<sup>™</sup>) to treat symptoms of narcolepsy in adults. These symptoms are daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, which is an episode of sudden muscle weakness. The once-nightly bedtime dose of ON-SXB removes the need for a middle-of-the-night dose of sodium oxybate. The REST-ON clinical study compared ON-SXB to a placebo (a substance that contains no medicine) to determine if it was better at treating symptoms of disrupted nighttime sleep associated with narcolepsy. This summary looks at whether; ON-SXB was better than placebo at treating symptoms of disrupted nighttime sleep. Compared to people who took placebo, people who took ON-SXB had fewer number of changes from deeper to lighter sleep stages and woke up less during the night. They also reported that they slept better at night and felt more refreshed when waking up in the morning. People with narcolepsy sometimes take alerting agents to help with sleepiness during the day, but alerting agents can cause difficulty sleeping at night. This study showed that people who took ON-SXB had better nighttime sleep even if they were taking alerting agents during the day. The most common side effects of ON-SXB included dizziness, nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting, headache, and bedwetting. A once-nightly bedtime dose of ON-SXB is a narcolepsy treatment option for people without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose of sodium oxybate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37971303/"}

Here we present evidence that 5h of acute sleep deprivation impairs mouse skilled reach learning compared to a matched period of ad libitum sleep. In sleeping mice, the duration of total sleep time during the 5h of sleep opportunity or during the first bout of sleep did not correlate with ultimate gain in motor performance. In addition, we observed that reversal learning during the skilled reaching task was also affected by sleep deprivation. Consistent with this observation, 5h of sleep deprivation also impaired reversal learning in the water-based Y-maze.

Postawakening salivary cortisol, immunoglobulin-A, and subjective wellness were measured during PRE-CAMP, CAMP, and POST-CAMP, and internal training/match load (ITL) was calculated daily. The averaged values for dependent variables were compared among training phases and analyzed using linear mixed models. At CAMP compared with PRE-CAMP, ITL was higher (P < .01), and sleep onset and offset were earlier (P < .01). At this period, sleep interruptions and salivary cortisol were higher (P < .01, d = 1.6, d = 1.9, respectively), and subjective wellness was worsened (P < .01, d = 1.3). At POST-CAMP, the reduction of workload was followed by increased sleep efficiency, reduced sleep interruptions, and moderately affected salivary cortisol, yet overall wellness remained unaltered. In POST-CAMP, 2 of the players demonstrated severe symptoms of illness. At the highest level of the sport and prior to the Olympics, large increments in workload during a training camp induced meaningful sleep interruptions and salivary cortisol increases, both of which were reversed at POST-CAMP.

In this cross-sectional interview-based questionnaire study, patients from 3 different pain treatment centers in Vienna aged 18-65 years, with pain lasting 3 months or longer were asked to participate. The association between the short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and sleep quality (sleep onset latency, interrupted sleep due to pain, sleep duration and recovering effect of sleep) was assessed. In this study 121 patients (male 32, female 89, mean age 49 ± 9 years) could be analyzed. Of the patients 38.8% needed more than 30 min for falling asleep, 63.6% reported sleep fragmentation, 30.6% slept less than 5 h and 60.3% reported no recovering effect of sleep. The strongest associations between pain characteristics and sleep quality were found for pain intensity and affective pain aspects. Logistic regression analyses revealed that one point more in the total score of SF-MPQ increased the odds of needing more than 30 min for falling asleep, waking up more than 3 times due to pain, sleeping less than 5 h, and perceiving the sleep as non-recovering, by 6%. Adjusting for physical and psychological quality of life lowered the odds ratios and the association was no longer significant.

This study aims at automatically detecting SWS from nocturnal sleep using cardiorespiratory signals that can be acquired with unobtrusive sensors in a home-based scenario. From the signals, time-dependent features are extracted for continuous 30-s epochs. To reduce the measuring noise, body motion artifacts, and/or within-subject variability in physiology conveyed by the features, and thus, enhance the detection performance, we propose to smooth the features over each night using a spline fitting method. In addition, it was found that the changes in cardiorespiratory activity precede the transitions between SWS and the other sleep stages (non-SWS). To this matter, a novel scheme is proposed that performs the SWS detection for each epoch using the feature values prior to that epoch. Experiments were conducted with a large dataset of 325 overnight polysomnography (PSG) recordings using a linear discriminant classifier and tenfold cross validation. Features were selected with a correlation-based method. Results show that the performance in classifying SWS and non-SWS can be significantly improved when smoothing the features and using the preceding feature values of 5-min earlier. We achieved a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.57 (at an accuracy of 88.8%) using only six selected features for 257 recordings with a minimum of 30-min overnight SWS that were considered representative of their habitual sleeping pattern at home.

{"id": "28626013", "title": "Sleep Disrupts High-Level Speech Parsing Despite Significant Basic Auditory Processing.", "text": "The extent to which the sleeping brain processes sensory information remains unclear. This is particularly true for continuous and complex stimuli such as speech, in which information is organized into hierarchically embedded structures. Recently, novel metrics for assessing the neural representation of continuous speech have been developed using noninvasive brain recordings that have thus far only been tested during wakefulness. Here we investigated, for the first time, the sleeping brain's capacity to process continuous speech at different hierarchical levels using a newly developed Concurrent Hierarchical Tracking (CHT) approach that allows monitoring the neural representation and processing-depth of continuous speech online. Speech sequences were compiled with syllables, words, phrases, and sentences occurring at fixed time intervals such that different linguistic levels correspond to distinct frequencies. This enabled us to distinguish their neural signatures in brain activity. We compared the neural tracking of intelligible versus unintelligible (scrambled and foreign) speech across states of wakefulness and sleep using high-density EEG in humans. We found that neural tracking of stimulus acoustics was comparable across wakefulness and sleep and similar across all conditions regardless of speech intelligibility. In contrast, neural tracking of higher-order linguistic constructs (words, phrases, and sentences) was only observed for intelligible speech during wakefulness and could not be detected at all during nonrapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. These results suggest that, whereas low-level auditory processing is relatively preserved during sleep, higher-level hierarchical linguistic parsing is severely disrupted, thereby revealing the capacity and limits of language processing during sleep.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the persistence of some sensory processing during sleep, it is unclear whether high-level cognitive processes such as speech parsing are also preserved. We used a novel approach for studying the depth of speech processing across wakefulness and sleep while tracking neuronal activity with EEG. We found that responses to the auditory sound stream remained intact; however, the sleeping brain did not show signs of hierarchical parsing of the continuous stream of syllables into words, phrases, and sentences. The results suggest that sleep imposes a functional barrier between basic sensory processing and high-level cognitive processing. This paradigm also holds promise for studying residual cognitive abilities in a wide array of unresponsive states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28626013/"}

Following initial anesthesia by diethyl ether the sleeping time of workers and drones at 22 degrees C in the dark was 59 +/- 15 min. After repeated anesthesia the sleeping time was 30 +/- 15 min in the dark. When exposed to polychromatic light from a halogen lamp of 230 mW/cm2, focused on a spot of the cuticle of the hornet, the sleeping time was markedly shortened so that following initial as well as repeated anesthesia the hornets woke up after 4.5 +/- 2.9 min. Any decrease in light intensity resulted in an increase in the sleeping time but irradiances of less than 14 mW/cm2 had no measurable influence on the wake-up time. After illumination with polychromatic light from a mercury lamp the sleeping times were much shorter than after illumination with a halogen lamp at the same conditions and intensity. This difference is attributed to the relatively higher portion of U.V. light in the total emission of the Hg lamp. Effects of the spectral composition of the incident light beam on the wake-up of the sleeping hornets were also investigated. Near U.V. light in the 300-400 nm region was found to be most efficient. Shorter wavelengths as well as wavelengths between 400-470 nm had less influence and wavelengths above 470 nm had very little effect on the wake up. The sleeping times of hibernating queens were relatively longer than those of workers and drones under the same conditions. These effects are ascribed to the extraretinal light perception. The possible reasons underlying this phenomenon are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8868579/"}

The influence of the upper airway on the ventilatory and arousal responses to hypercapnia in wakefulness and sleep was investigated using a chronic animal model. 2. Experiments were performed in five unrestrained dogs trained to sleep naturally in the laboratory. The animal rebreathed through a chronic tracheostoma (thus excluding the upper airway from the breathing circuit), or through the snout (intact upper airway). Resistance to breathing and volume of dead space during quiet tracheal breathing were matched to those in quiet nasal breathing during wakefulness and sleep. CO2 rebreathing tests were performed during wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, during nasal and tracheal breathing. 3. The ventilatory response to hypercapnia was significantly lower in nasal breathing compared with tracheal breathing, in all behavioural states. This was due to a smaller tidal volume and lower breathing frequency. 4. The ventilatory response to CO2 was lowest during REM sleep, irrespective of route used for breathing. 5. Alveolar partial pressure of CO2 (PA,CO2) level at arousal was identical in NREM nasal and tracheal rebreathing tests. Differences in PA,CO2 levels at arousal between NREM and REM sleep were not significant in nasal tests and only marginally different during tracheal breathing. 6.

To date, researchers have attempted to model insomnia in animals through breeding strategies that create pathologically short-sleeping individuals or with drugs and environmental contexts that directly impose sleeplessness. While these approaches have been invaluable for identifying insomnia susceptibility genes and mapping the neural networks that underpin sleep-wake regulation, they fail to capture concurrently several of the core clinical diagnostic features of insomnia disorder in humans, where sleep continuity disturbance is self-perpetuating, occurs despite adequate sleep opportunity, and is often not accompanied by significant changes in sleep duration or architecture. In the present review, we discuss these issues and then outline ways animal models can be used to develop approaches that are more ecologically valid in their recapitulation of chronic insomnia's natural aetiology and pathophysiology. Conditioning of self-generated sleep loss with these methods promises to create a better understanding of the neuroadaptations that maintain insomnia, including potentially within the infralimbic cortex, a substrate at the crossroads of threat habituation and sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36748845/"}

Swaddling did not alter sleep time, spontaneous arousability, or heart rate variability in routinely swaddled infants at either age. During active sleep at 3 months, cortical arousal frequency was decreased, and total sleep time was increased by swaddling in infants who were naïve to swaddling. Heart rate variability when swaddled was also highest in the naïve group. The effects of infant swaddling on sleep time, arousability, and autonomic control are influenced by previous swaddling experience. Infants in the naïve to swaddling group exhibited decreased spontaneous cortical arousal, similar to responses observed in future victims of sudden infant death syndrome. Infants in unfamiliar sleeping conditions may therefore be more susceptible to cardiorespiratory challenges that fail to stimulate arousal and may lead to sudden infant death syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20227720/"}

Male hamsters copulate faster and they do not display the motor inhibition observed in rats after each ejaculation. Moreover, close to exhaustion, hamsters display a behavioral pattern known as Long Intromission, which has been linked to an sexual inhibitory process. The present study was performed to determine the effects of male sexual activity on the sleep pattern in hamsters. Subjects were allowed to copulate for 30 and 60 min. In addition, the effect of locomotor activity was also assessed. The results show that male sexual behavior induced a significant increase of SWS II, with a reduction of wakefulness.

Sprague-Dawley rats, kept at an ambient temperature of 24°C and under a 12 h∶12 h light-dark cycle, were exposed to a prolonged osmotic challenge of three days of water deprivation (WD) and two days of recovery in which free access to water was restored. Two sets of parameters were determined in order to assess: i) the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis (water and food consumption; changes in body weight and fluid composition); ii) the effects of the osmotic challenge on behavioral states (hypothalamic temperature (Thy), motor activity, and W-S states). The first set of parameters changed in WD as expected and control levels were restored on the second day of recovery, with the exception of urinary Ca(++) that almost disappeared in WD, and increased to a high level in recovery. As far as the second set is concerned, WD was characterized by the maintenance of the daily oscillation of Thy and by a decrease in activity during the dark periods. Changes in W-S states were small and mainly confined to the dark period: i) REMS slightly decreased at the end of WD and increased in recovery; ii) non-REM sleep (NREMS) increased in both WD and recovery, but EEG delta power, a sign of NREMS intensity, decreased in WD and increased in recovery.

This applied to animals that led relatively simple lives with few needs for long-term memories, such as many lower invertebrates - many molluscs, echinoderms, worms, etc. As more complex lifestyles and detailed focal vision evolved, needs for self-initiated and reflexive activities increased in frequency, and recognition of many locales, conspecifics, and other forms of life became essential. These developments were accompanied by greatly expanded needs for neural processing supporting sensory and motor activities, and establishing and storing long-term memories. Since these categories of neural processing occur in largely overlapping brain regions, brain functioning would have become increasingly maladaptive, had the evolution of these more complex lifestyles not been accompanied by compensating adaptations that obviated these potentially conflicting brain activities. These adaptations consisted of: first, restful waking; second, primitive sleep; and finally, fully developed sleep, with its specialized rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement states, that contribute to the maintenance of great efficiency of brain function. The only animals with detailed focal vision that can achieve highly efficient brain function without sleep, are those in which demands on memory processing are greatly reduced in consequence of routine, monotonous, almost purely reflexive lifestyles, with few needs for acquiring experiential long-term memories.

We measured sick participants' sleep at home, both objectively (actigraphy) and subjectively (diary ratings), for one week as well as four weeks later when healthy. During the week with RI, people spent objectively longer time in bed and had a longer total sleep time compared to the healthy week. During the infection, participants also had more awakenings, but no significant differences in sleep latency or sleep efficiency. While sick, people also reported increased difficulties falling asleep, worse sleep quality, more restless sleep and more shallow sleep, while they did not report sleep to be less sufficient. Most problems occurred at the beginning of the sickness week, when symptoms were strong, and showed signs of recovery thereafter (as indicated by interactions between condition and day/night of data collection for all the 10 sleep outcomes). The degree of symptoms of RI was related to a worse sleep quality and more restless sleep, but not to any of the objective sleep outcomes or the other subjective sleep variables. Having a higher body temperature was not significantly related to any of the sleep variables. This study suggests that having a respiratory infection is associated with spending more time in bed and sleeping longer, but also with more disturbed sleep, both objectively and subjectively.

Similarly, higher scores of self-reported sleep quality were obtained in subjects sleeping on the two models with intermediate pressure distribution. Thus, pressure distribution, at least to some degree, influences sleep quality and self-reported feelings of sleep-related events, though the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The regulation of pressure models imposed by external sleep environment may be a new direction for improving sleep quality. Only an appropriate interface pressure distribution is beneficial for improving sleep quality, over-concentrated or -even distribution of pressure do not help for good sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24924427/"}

After learning something new, the brain initiates a complex set of post-learning processing that facilitates recall (i.e., consolidation). Evidence points to sleep as one of the determinants of that change. But whenever a behavioral study of episodic memory shows a benefit of sleep, critics assert that sleep only leads to a temporary shelter from the damaging effects of interference that would otherwise accrue during wakefulness. To evaluate the potentially active role of sleep for verbal memory, we compared memory recall after sleep, with and without interference before testing. We demonstrated that recall performance for verbal memory was greater after sleep than after wakefulness. And when using interference testing, that difference was even more pronounced. By introducing interference after sleep, this study confirms an experimental paradigm that demonstrates the active role of sleep in consolidating memory, and unmasks the large magnitude of that benefit.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19127287/"}

Vigilance states associate with variable levels of neuronal activity: waking with high-frequency activity patterns while during NREMS, SWA influences neuronal activity in many brain areas. On a glial level, sleep deprivation modifies microglial morphology, but only few studies have investigated microglia through the physiological sleep-wake cycle. To quantify microglial morphology (territory, volume, ramification) throughout the 24 h light-dark cycle, we collected brain samples from inbred C57BL male mice (n = 51) every 3 h and applied a 3D-reconstruction method for microglial cells on the acquired confocal microscopy images. As microglia express regional heterogeneity and are influenced by local neuronal activity, we chose to investigate three interconnected and functionally well-characterized brain areas: the somatosensory cortex (SC), the dorsal hippocampus (HC), and the basal forebrain (BF). To temporally associate microglial morphology with vigilance stages, we performed a 24 h polysomnography in a separate group of animals (n = 6). In line with previous findings, microglia displayed de-ramification in the 12 h light- and hyper-ramification in the 12 h dark period. Notably, we found that the decrease in microglial features was most prominent within the early hours of the light period, co-occurring with maximal sleep SWA. By the end of the light period, all features reached maximum levels and remained steadily elevated throughout the dark period with minor regional differences. We propose that vigilance-stage specific neuronal activity, and SWA, could modify microglial morphology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36196985/"}

The present study aimed to investigate differences in the pattern of sleep problems between Japanese and Chinese preschoolers. Data were collected from one city in Japan and 10 cities in China. The present study recruited 438 Japanese and 1020 Chinese preschoolers aged four and five years. Sleep problems and patterns were assessed on the basis of parental reports using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Analysis of covariance revealed no significant difference in total CSHQ scores between Japanese and Chinese preschoolers, thus indicating that the total severity of sleep problems did not differ between the groups. Japanese preschoolers exhibited higher scores on the bedtime resistance subscale of the CSHQ than Chinese preschoolers. Conversely, Chinese preschoolers exhibited higher subscale scores for night wakings and sleep-disordered breathing. In addition, Japanese preschoolers exhibited earlier bedtimes and wake times and shorter total sleep times than Chinese preschoolers. Our findings indicate that the patterns of sleep problems in preschoolers differ between Japan and China and that such differences may be due to differences in cosleeping practices, bedtime routines, and/or environmental conditions.

In industrialized countries, 75% of the total workforce is estimated to have been involved in shift work and night work. Epidemiologic studies, mainly of nurses, have revealed an association between sustained night work and a 50-100% higher incidence of breast cancer. The potential and multifactorial mechanisms of the effects include the suppression of melatonin secretion by ALAN, sleep deprivation, and circadian disruption. Shift and/or night work generally decreases the time spent sleeping, and it disrupts the circadian time structure. In the long run, this desynchronization is detrimental to health, as underscored by a large number of epidemiological studies that have uncovered elevated rates of several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular risks, obesity, mood disorders and age-related macular degeneration. It amounts to a public health issue in the light of the very substantial number of individuals involved. The IARC has classified shift work in group 2A of \"probable carcinogens to humans\" since \"they involve a circadian disorganization\". Countermeasures to the effects of ALAN, such as melatonin, bright light, or psychotropic drugs, have been proposed as a means to combat circadian clock disruption and improve adaptation to shift and night work. We review the evidence for the ALAN impacts on health.

However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM), and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary, objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of latent representations.

Participants were awakened 15 s after an ELM was observed during ongoing REM and stage 2 sleep and immediately asked for a mentation report and to rate the visual vividness of any imagery they could remember. These reports were compared with control reports collected after a period of ELM quiescence before awakening (noELM). Significantly greater frequencies of imagery reports were collected after ELM awakenings compared with noELM awakenings from stage 2, but not REM sleep. When imagery was reported, imagery ratings were not significantly different between ELM and noELM conditions, regardless of sleep stage. The average amount of electroencephalogram (EEG) arousal 15 s after stage 2 awakenings was significantly higher in the ELM compared with noELM conditions. In addition, within the stage 2 ELM condition, EEG arousal was significantly higher when visual imagery was reported compared with reports without imagery; suggesting that the observed increase in imagery reporting from the stage 2 ELM condition could have been mediated by the level of brain arousal. Such arousal possibly provides better conditions to attend and recall previous mental activity from NREM sleep.

Awake replay may reflect trajectories through either the current environment or previously visited environments that are spatially remote.

Using a phylogenetic approach, we established ancestral states of sleep site selection in lorisiforms and traced their evolution. The ancestral lorisiform was a fur-clinger and used dense tangles and branches/forks as sleep sites. Use of tree holes and nests as sleep sites emerged ∼22 Mya (range 17-26 Mya) in Africa, and use of bamboo emerged ∼11 (7-14) Mya in Asia and later in Africa. Fur clinging and some sleep sites (e.g., tree holes, nests, but not bamboo or dense tangles) show strong phylogenetic signal.

During sleep, the brain generates oscillatory activities that represent characteristic states of sleep. In addition to electrophysiology, opto/chemogenetics and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging methods have clarified that the sleep/wake states organized by neuronal and glial ensembles in the cerebral cortex are transitioned by neuromodulators. Even with these methods, however, it is extremely difficult to elucidate how and when neuromodulators spread, accumulate, and disappear in the extracellular space of the cortex. Thus, real-time monitoring of neuromodulator dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution is required for further understanding of sleep.

Approximately 90% retention of habituation was shown 32 days following 10 stimulus presentations, and some degree of retention was shown for as long as 50 days. After habituation had reached a long-term asymptote, 600 stimulus presentations over 2-sec ISIs produced further response decrements, but these decrements recovered completely within a matter of minutes and responsiveness returned to the previously established long-term asymptote. Habituation was shown to be frequency-specific over both 24-hr and 32-day intervals. Habituation produced by stimulus presentations to awake animals transferred to the condition in which stimuli were presented to sleeping animals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/730856/"}

Recently, a possible association between active travel to school and the duration of sleep was suggested. Thus, the aim was of this study to investigate the associations between the type of transportation and travel time to school, the time in bed and sleepiness in the classroom of high school students. Information on sleeping habits and travel to school of 1126 high school students were analyzed, where 55.1% were girls with an average age of 16.24 (1.39) years old, in Santa Maria Municipality, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Multiple linear regression and adjusted prevalence rates analyses were carried out. The frequency of active travel found was 61.8%. Associations between time in bed, sleepiness in the classroom and the type of transportation (active or passive) were not identified. Nevertheless, the time in bed was inversely associated with the travel time (p = 0.036) and with a phase delay. In the adjusted analysis, active travel was more incident for the students of schools in the suburbs (PR: 1.68; CI: 1.40-2.01) in comparison with the students of schools in the center. Therefore, longer trips were associated with a reduction of sleep duration of morning and night groups. Interventions concerning active travel to school must be carried out cautiously in order not to cause a reduction of the sleeping time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24152062/"}

Sleep period was objectively measured using wrist actigraphy at baseline and 2 months post-randomization. Moderation analysis was performed using ordinary least squares regression using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Controlling for sleep period at baseline, treatment condition was significantly related to the sleep period at 2 months post-randomization, with the intervention group achieving a longer sleep period compared to the usual sleep period group (control) (b = 46.30, p < .01). Intervention response was moderated by child routines (b = 1.43, p < .05). Specifically, the intervention produced the greatest change in sleep period for children who engaged in greater routine behaviors at baseline than those who engaged in fewer routine behaviors. Families that engage in routine behaviors may be better equipped to adopt the behavioral modifications required to get a good night's sleep. The findings highlight the importance of working with families to establish routine behaviors to improve responses to behavioral sleep interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38553029/"}

{"id": "21295501", "title": "Behavioural sleep treatments and night time crying in infants: challenging the status quo.", "text": "In Australia, as in many Westernised industrialised nations, the majority of families encourage infants to sleep alone or 'solo' from an early age. Sleeping solo can increase night time crying, which in turn disrupts sleep for both parent and infant. Night time waking and crying are frequently culturally constructed as behavioural sleep 'problems'. The pursuit of solo sleeping is thus achieved through 'behavioural sleep treatments' that teach an infant to sleep alone. Some behavioural extinction treatments necessitate a parent leaving an infant to cry for extended periods unattended, a practice reportedly difficult for parents. Despite parent's anxieties, and the potential (though little studied) stress to the infant, the pursuit of those behavioural sleep treatments are advocated by many psychologists and clinicians as acceptable and necessary interventions. This paper questions this necessity and critically reviews and debates these methods from biological, anthropological and cultural perspectives. Specifically, it considers Foucaultian, Leidloffian, attachment and behavioural perspectives. The central debate in this paper is if and why an infant's nocturnal cries should be ignored. It challenges the aetiology and acceptance of the status quo in the hope of revisiting the underlying belief that these methods are necessary. In doing so, the paper theorises the ways in which current sleep training techniques do or do not satisfy the needs of infants and their parents and questions the extent to which they can be reconciled. The paper posits an agenda for further research in the area that may facilitate the reconciliation of the needs of parents and those of their infants.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295501/"}

The participants of the study were home care workers working in two shifts in one municipality in Eastern Finland (N = 395). Of these, 52 females (mean age 42.78 y, SD 12.92 y) completed the study questionnaire and participated in physiological measurements. Several sleep-related parameters were assessed (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, and length of awakening) and indices of autonomic nervous system based on HRV were calculated. The participants worked in two shifts: a morning shift (7:00-15:00 h) and an evening shift (14:00-21:30 h). All these parameters were assessed during the night before the first work shift (N1), the night before the second work shift (N2), the night before the final work shift (N3), and the night before the first day off work (N4). According to the results, 21.2% of the participants were M-types, 17.3% were E-types, and 61.5% were N-types. On average, the participants had been in working life for 18.8 years and performing shift work for 13.7 years. On night N3, E-types had a significantly shorter total sleep time and spent less time in bed compared to M- and N-types. The total sleep time of M-type and N-type participants was on average 66 minutes and 82 minutes longer, respectively, when compared to E-types on night N3. There were no statistically significant differences in actigraphy-based sleep quality parameters between M-, N-, and E-types on nights N1, N2, and N4. Our results together indicate that M- and N-type individuals may have better sleep quality than E-types, which was also reflected in HRV parameters.

An extensive literature from cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies shows a relationship between short sleep and prevalence of obesity and weight gain. However, causality cannot be inferred from such studies. Clinical intervention studies have examined whether reducing sleep in normal sleepers, typically sleeping 7-9 h/night, can affect energy intake, energy expenditure, and endocrine regulators of energy balance. The aim of this review is to evaluate studies that have assessed food intake, energy expenditure, and leptin and ghrelin levels after periods of restricted and normal sleep. Most studies support the notion that restricting sleep increases food intake, but the effects on energy expenditure are mixed. Differences in methodology and component of energy expenditure analyzed may account for the discrepancies. Studies examining the effects of sleep on leptin and ghrelin have provided conflicting results with increased, reduced, or unchanged leptin and ghrelin levels after restricted sleep compared to normal sleep. Energy balance of study participants and potential sex differences may account for the varied results. Studies should strive for constant energy balance and feeding schedules when assessing the role of sleep on hormonal profile. Although studies suggest that restricting sleep may lead to weight gain via increased food intake, research is needed to examine the impact on energy expenditure and endocrine controls. Also, studies have been of short duration, and there is little knowledge on the reverse question: does increasing sleep duration in short sleepers lead to negative energy balance?", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23319909/"}

Simultaneous recordings of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP), multiple unit activities (MUA) and current source-densities (CSD) at 12 depths through area 1 were collected during both states and analyzed to identify the cortical events that generate the SEP. As previously reported, the N1 component of the SEP was diminished during sleep. Although the earlier components of the SEP were evoked during both states, the excitatory events that characterize the awake N1 were replaced during SWS by an interval of strong inhibition which was terminated by a burst of cortical MUA. CSD analysis of the SWS inhibitory interval revealed large current sources through layer III above the depth of maximal MUA inhibition indicating that an outward conductance became activated on the apical trunks of pyramidal neurons during SWS.

The purpose of this study was to compare the estimated objective and subjective sleep measures of people with Parkinson's disease sleeping under (ON-night) versus without (OFF-night) the effects of the last daily dopaminergic medication before going to bed. A total of 23 people with Parkinson's disease were instructed to wear an actigraphy device for 4 consecutive nights to objectively measure the sleep behaviour.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that mechanoreceptor stimuli arising in the ventilatory apparatus have a role in the arousal responses to progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia by comparing arousal responses during spontaneous ventilation with those obtained when the inspiratory muscles were unloaded by mechanical ventilatory assistance. Studies were performed in three trained dogs in which the adequacy of inspiratory muscle unloading was verified by diaphragmatic electromyographic (EMG) recordings. In rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep the arousal threshold during progressive hypercapnia increased from 68.4 +/- 0.5 (SE) mmHg during spontaneous runs to 72.3 +/- 0.8 mmHg during mechanically assisted runs (P < 0.01). In contrast there were no changes in arousal responses to hypercapnia during non-REM (NREM) sleep or to hypoxia in either NREM or REM sleep. However, during the assisted hypoxic runs, EMG activity of the transversus abdominis muscle was increased compared with the unassisted runs; therefore, the effects on arousal threshold of unloading the inspiratory muscles may have been offset by increased loading of the expiratory muscles.

Developmental studies of arousal responses to respiratory stimuli are lacking. Arousal responses to chemoreceptor stimuli have been examined in adult tracheotomized dogs, both before and following bilateral surgical denervation of the carotid bodies. Prior to denervation of the carotid bodies arousal in response to isocapnic progressive hypoxia occurred at an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 83% during slow-wave sleep and 70% in rapid-eye-movement sleep. Airway occlusion induced arousal from Slow-wave-sleep at SaO2 of 88% and from rapid-eye-movement sleep at SaO2 of 84%. Following denervation of the carotid bodies, arousal failed to occur in response to either progressive hypoxia or airway occlusion despite desaturation to 60% in Slow-wave sleep and 50% in rapid-eye-movement-sleep, at which level experiments were arbitrarily terminated. The effect of sleep fragmentation on arousal responses of sleeping dogs to chemoreceptor stimuli has also been studied. A marked impairment of both hypoxic and hypercapnic arousal was produced by sleep fragmentation. The consequences of interfering with arousal mechanisms in experimental animals indicates the considerable potential for similar dysfunction in man to contribute to the pathophysiology of the clinical syndromes of obstructive sleep apnoea and sudden infant death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6747223/"}

Automatic sleep posture detection systems, both wearable and non-wearable, have been developed to assess sleep quality. However, wearable solutions can be intrusive and affect sleep, while non-wearable systems, such as camera-based approaches and pressure sensor arrays, often face challenges related to privacy, cost, and computational complexity. The system in this paper proposes a microcontroller-based approach exploiting the execution of an embedded machine learning (ML) model for posture classification.

Triazolam reduced the likelihood of subjects reporting that they had been awake by about half.

We studied 17 children, aged 3 d to 48 mo, and three healthy adults. Visual stimulation was performed with 8-Hz flickering light through the sleeping childs' closed eyelids. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed with a gradient echoplanar sequence in a l.5-T magnetic resonance scanner. Six subjects were excluded because of movement artifacts; the youngest infant showed no response. In 10 children, we could demonstrate areas of signal decrease during visual stimulation in the occipital cortex (mean decrease 2.21%), contrary to the signal increase observed in the adult controls (mean increase 2.82%). This decrease may be due to a higher proportional increase in oxygen extraction compared with increase in cerebral blood flow during activation. The different response patterns in young children and adults can reflect developmental or behavioral differences. Localization of the activation seemed to be age-dependent. In the older children and the adults, it encompassed the whole length of the calcarine sulcus, whereas it was restricted to the anterior and medial part of the calcarine sulcus in the younger infants. This may reflect a different functional organization of the young child's visual cortex or the on-going retinal development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9773849/"}
{"id": "40409925", "title": "The structure of sleep and how it may be altered by visual impairments.", "text": "Individuals with visual impairments often experience poor sleep health, which may impact brain physiology and function, as evidenced by altered brain activity during sleep. The sleeping brain can be categorized into stages: three non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages and one rapid eye movement (REM) stage, with each stage defined by its structure, that is, the duration and frequency of specific brain oscillations. Research investigating alterations in sleep structure among visually impaired individuals has yielded mixed results: some studies indicate reduced or absent deep sleep (N3), others report longer REM latency (the time until the first REM epoch), while some suggest that circadian dysfunction may play a more significant role than visual impairment itself. Sleep is regulated by two processes: the homeostatic sleep drive, which accumulates during wakefulness and is relieved during sleep, and the circadian process, which describes the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. The circadian process is particularly vulnerable to disruption by visual impairments, as damage to the retina can alter photic entrainment, the process by which light signals from the retina align the circadian sleep-wake cycle with the solar day. Visually impaired individuals often experience a drifting sleep-wake cycle that misaligns with the light-dark cycle, and during periods of misalignment, sleep quality may be particularly poor, especially REM sleep, which is largely under circadian control. Some causes of visual impairment, such as glaucoma, may be more susceptible to circadian dysfunction than others, as glaucoma affects cells in the retinal layer necessary for photic entrainment, which in turn may increase the risk of changes to sleep structure. Given that abnormal sleep structure is associated with long-term health consequences, including increased risks of depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline, it may contribute to the high prevalence of these issues found among the visually impaired population. Further research is needed to clarify the roles of the causes of visual impairments, circadian misalignment, and the impact on sleep structure. A better understanding of these relationships could help develop targeted interventions to improve sleep and enhance health outcomes for visually impaired individuals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40409925/"}

In the present study, two groups of women, who placed in either the upper or lower percentile ranks on the Sexual Arousal Inventory (Hoon et al., 1976a), were compared on a physiological measure of sexual arousal, vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA), during both waking erotic conditions and sleep. As hypothesized, no differences in VPA were found between groups during either waking or sleeping conditions. Contrary to expectation, groups also did not differ on subjective ratings of their laboratory arousal. With both groups combined, differences in VPA levels were evident between baseline and erotic conditions. Similarly, VPA levels differed between stages of sleep, with highest levels observed during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. These findings suggest that self-reported low arousability is not based on lack of physiological response and that retrospective, self-report measures of sexual arousability differ in important ways from subjective and physiological measures of sexual arousal in the laboratory. In order to adequately assess sexual arousability, future researchers must either devise laboratory conditions that more closely resemble erotic stimuli occurring in subjects' natural environments or validate physiological measures of arousal in nonlaboratory settings. Finally, the nocturnal evaluation of VPA seems potentially useful for cases in which organic factors may be contributing to sexual dysfunction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4051720/"}

Chimpanzee sleeping behavior has been examined only in a limited fashion, both in the wild and in captivity. Previous research, however limited, has suggested that chimpanzee sleep is non-dynamic. This study used an objective behavioral model of sleep as a framework in which to test the hypothesis that changes in individual (age and sex) and environmental (temperature and humidity) factors influence sleep patterns in 20 captive chimpanzees. The nocturnal behavior of the subjects was recorded continuously using video cameras equipped with enhanced nighttime visibility connected to time-lapse videocassette recorders. Chimpanzees in this study slept 8.81 h per night, close to the averages reported for both industrialized and traditional human societies (7-9h), as opposed to that of previous chimpanzee studies (11-12h). Also, the idea that chimpanzees sleep in one continuous period with little to no nocturnal awakenings was also refuted. Captive chimpanzee sleep behavior was, in fact, dynamic and complex with frequent awakenings. Older chimpanzees slept longer, had higher sleep quality, and shorter nighttime disturbances than prime adult chimpanzees. Finally, ambient temperature and humidity affected sleep duration and quality. The results of this study reveal that chimpanzee sleep behaviors are complicated interactions between both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16458369/"}

This has made clinical assessment of dysrhythmia in newborns difficult. We therefore performed continuous 24-hour electrocardiography in 29 normal newborn subjects (age range, 1 to 6 days; mean, 3.5 days). The ECG tapes were then analysed in detail to define the normal range of cardiac rate, conduction intervals, and rhythm during waking and sleeping periods. Maximum sinus rate (awake) ranged from 150 to 222 beats per minute (mean, 192 +/- 16 [SD]), and minimum rate (awake) from 78 to 140 beats per minute (mean, 107 +/- 15). During sleep, the maximum rate ranged from 125 to 210 (mean, 168 +/- 23) and the minimum from 72 to 120 beats per minute (mean, 92 +/- 11). The maximum variation in rate for any individual during the 24-hour period ranged from 73 to 134 beats per minute (mean, 100 +/- 17). Sinus rhythm predominated with mild irregularity occurring episodically in 24 and moderate irregularity in 4 infants. An isolated atrial premature beat was present in 2 subjects, and an atrioventricular (AV) junctional escape rhythm occurred in one other after a sinus pause of 840 msec. Ventricular premature beats or AV conduction abnormalities were not observed. The corrected QT interval (QTc) ranged from 0.298 to 0.514 sec (mean, 0.390 +/- 0.026). The maximum variation in QTc over 24 hours ranged from 0.052 to 0.160 sec (mean, 0.097 +/- 0.028).

This study aimed to elucidate ways in which such memory sources vary by sleep stage and time of night. Twenty healthy participants (11 F; 24.1 ± 5.7 years) spent a night in the laboratory and were awakened for dream collection approximately 12 times spread across early, middle, and late periods of sleep, while covering all stages of sleep (N1, N2, N3, REM). In the morning, participants identified and dated associated memories of waking-life events for each dream report, when possible. The incorporation of recent memory sources in dreams was more frequent in N1 and REM than in other sleep stages. The incorporation of distant memories from over a week ago, semantic memories not traceable to a single event, and anticipated future events remained stable throughout sleep. In contrast, the relative proportions of recent versus distant memory sources changed across the night, independently of sleep stage, with late-night dreams in all stages having relatively less recent and more remote memory sources than dreams earlier in the night. Qualitatively, dreams tended to repeat similar themes across the night and in different sleep stages. The present findings clarify the temporal course of memory incorporations in dreams, highlighting a specific connection between time of night and the temporal remoteness of memories.

Artificial light at night (ALAN) has been shown to affect sleep in wild birds. Even cavity-nesting bird species may be affected when sleeping inside their cavity. Correlational studies suggest that light from outside the cavity/nest box, for example from street lights, may affect sleep. We used an experimental design to study to what extent nest boxes shield animals from effects of ALAN on sleep. We recorded individual sleep behavior of free-living great tits (Parus major) that were roosting in dark nest boxes and exposed their nest box entrance to ALAN the following night (1.6 lux white LED light; a similar light intensity as was found at nest boxes near street lights). Their behavior was compared to that of control birds sleeping in dark nest boxes on both nights. Our experimental treatment did not affect sleep behavior. Sleep behavior of birds in the control group did not differ from that of individuals in the light treated group. Our results suggest that during winter cavities shield birds from some effects of ALAN. Furthermore, given that effects of ALAN and exposure to artificial light are species-, sex-, and season-dependent, it is important that studies using wild animals quantify individual exposure to light pollution, and be cautious in the interpretation and generalization of the effects, or lack thereof, from light pollution.

The ethanol (4 g/kg i.p.)-induced sleeping time was shortened by ifenprodil 1 mg/kg but was not affected by ifenprodil 0.3 mg/kg, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron 0.03 mg/kg and the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cycloheptan-5,10-imine maleate) 0.01 mg/kg. Ifenprodil 10 mg/kg mimicked the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin 1 mg/kg in that it prolonged the hypnotic response to ethanol (no additive effect when both drugs were given in combination); this is compatible with an involvement of alpha1-adrenoceptors in this effect of ifenprodil.

To determine the importance of this variability in nursing, 26 neonates were explored at thermoneutrality and in a cool environment (-1.5 degrees C from thermoneutrality) similar to that which occurs currently in clinical procedure. Oxygen consumption (VO2), oesophageal and skin temperatures, as well as sleep parameters were recorded continuously in both conditions. Analysis of all of the data from all of the neonates revealed that the cool exposure induced thermal and sleep disturbances, but VO2 did not increase and was not negatively correlated to body temperature (as might be expected). Analyses of individual data showed large variability in body temperature regulation: the neonates could be assigned to one of three groups according to the direction of the individual slopes of VO2 versus oesophageal or skin temperature. The groups also differed according to the sleep changes recorded in the cool condition. The results show that the definition of thermoneutrality should be revised by incorporating non only changes in the body temperature, but also the sleep disturbances (increased wakefulness and active sleep, decreased quiet sleep), which are criteria that are more sensitive to mild cool exposure. Thermoneutrality should be defined for each individual, since the results stress that the variability does not help to predict a general pattern of thermoregulatory responses in cool-exposed neonates.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10774868/"}

Twelve healthy undergraduate college students (83% female; age 20.2 ± 1.5years) completed a study consisting of sleeping typically for 1week (\"Habitual\"), then extending sleep by ≥1 hour/night during the second week (\"Extension\"). Sleep and physical activity actigraphy were collected throughout. Following each week, participants completed cardiometabolic assessments including a meal response and provided a urine sample for markers of hydration. In Extension compared to Habitual, average sleep duration increased (mean change±SEM, +42.6 ± 15.1 minutes; p = .005), while subjective sleepiness (-1.8 ± 0.8 units; p = .040), systolic blood pressure (-6.6 ± 2.8 mmHg; p = .037), postprandial glucose area under the curve (-26.5 ± 10.2 mg/dL × h; p = .025) and time to baseline (-83.0 ± 46.4 minutes; p = .031) after the meal response, sedentary time (-44.3 ± 15.7 minutes; p = .018), and percentage of wake in moderate-to-vigorous activity (-0.89% ± 0.35%; p = .030) decreased. Participants who increased average sleep duration by ≥20 minutes (n = 9) were better hydrated according to urine osmolality (-187.0 ± 68.4 mOsm/kg; p = .026) and specific gravity (-0.01 ± 0.002 g/mL; p = .012) and had reduced odds of dehydration according to urine osmolality (≥800 mOsm/kg; -67%; OR=0.03; p = .035). This pilot study's findings suggest that sleep extension may improve cardiometabolic functioning and hydration, and alter sedentary behavior and physical activity, in college students. Sleep extension may be employed to improve multiple aspects of health in this sleep-deprived population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37996285/"}

Information about favourite sleeping positions at the age of one month and four months was collected by interviews with parents, performed consecutively by health visitors at the routine examinations of 174 infants aged eight months. Information about sex, birthweight, gestational age, complications of delivery, mother's age and maternal smoking in pregnancy was collected for each child from the Birth Registration form. Thirty-two SIDS-cases from the 10 year period 1982-91, mostly based on police reports, were analysed retrospectively as regards sleeping positions and other possible risk factors. The distribution of different sleeping positions at the age of one month/four months was: prone 59%/52%, lateral 39%/41%, supine 2%/6%. There was a significant negative correlation between birthweight and use of the prone position. Among the SIDS-cases, the prone sleeping position was reported in 18 of 21 cases (86%), where this information was available. In conclusion, the prone sleeping position seemed to be associated with an increased risk of SIDS (estimated OR 4.1) but some of this difference can be accounted for by the more frequent use of this position among children with low birthweight and other risk factors.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1462465/"}

A cross-sectional study was conducted on the sleep quality of postmenopausal women attending a network of first-level outpatient menopause clinics in Italy for general counseling about menopause or treatment of its symptoms. Eligible for the study were women observed consecutively during the study period with natural or spontaneous menopause. All participating centers enrolled women into the study who had never used hormone therapy (HT) (group 1, 819 women), current users of transdermal estrogens with or without progestins (group 2, 819 women), and current users of oral estrogens with or without progestins (group 3, 790 women). The women were asked about their quality of sleep using the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, their quality of life using the Short Form-12 questionnaire, and the intensity of hot flushes using a visual analogue scale. Women in groups 2 and 3 tended to report difficulties in sleeping less often than those in group 1. For example, never users of HT more frequently reported sleeping poorly and needed more time to sleep or had problems falling asleep; these differences were significant (P < 0.05). Otherwise, no difference emerged from the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire between women in groups 2 and 3. This study gives support to the suggestion that HT improves the quality of sleep.

We examined this notion by activating the concept of \"relaxation\" during sleep using relaxation-related words in 50 healthy participants. In support of our hypothesis, playing relaxing words during non-rapid eye movement sleep extended the time spent in slow-wave sleep, increased power in the slow-wave activity band after the word cue, and abolished an asymmetrical sleep depth during the word presentation period. In addition, participants reported a higher sleep quality and elevated subjective alertness.

{"id": "7566746", "title": "Neuronal activities underlying the electroencephalogram and evoked potentials of sleeping and waking: implications for information processing.", "text": "The low amplitude, high frequency waves of the electroencephalogram (EEG) indicative of wakefulness, are produced by a summation of potentials of thalamocortical neurons, which fire in a \"tonic mode\" of depolarization. In this mode, the transfer of information from the peripheral sense organs to the sensory cortex is facilitated, due to a tonic lowering of the discharge threshold of thalamocortical neurons. The transfer decreases during drowsiness when thalamocortical units are more hyperpolarized and have higher thresholds. In this state, neurons fire synchronously in a \"burst mode,\" which is expressed in EEG spindling. During slow wave sleep sensory blocking reaches a maximum, when thalamocortical cells are yet more deeply hyperpolarized, although that what still passes to the cortex allows a shallow, subconscious, evaluation. The collective burst firing is more irregular, which results in large and slow EEG waves. In contrast, during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep the depolarized tonic mode of firing commonly associated with waking, is again reached. Similar to EEG-patterns, the architecture of evoked potentials is dependent on the state of alertness. During waking, components in event related potentials (ERP) are moderate in amplitude, while during slow wave sleep larger waves are visible. This is caused by more synchronized unit responses with sharper phases of excitations and inhibitions, which results from increased hyperpolarizations. In contrast, visual ERPs belonging to REM sleep closely resemble those of wakefulness. In analyzing unit responses of thalamocortical neurons, it appeared that neuronal excitations are expressed in negative components of the ERP, while inhibitory neuronal activities are associated with positivity. Transient phenomena in the EEG, such as ERP waves, spindles and spike-wave discharges, are the expression of synaptic potentials in superficial cortical layers, where numerous synapses of afferent thalamocortical fibers are localized on the apical dendrites of deeper lying pyramidal neurons. It is suggested that the morphology of these EEG components is primarily due to the discharge characteristics of thalamocortical relay cells, whereby excitations underly negative waves and inhibitions positive waves. The notion of a general correspondence between thalamocortical neuronal activities and the polarity of transients in the cortical surface EEG, allows prudent speculations regarding components of ERPs. Two examples are given: the contingent negative variation (CNV) and the P300 of an ERP which can be elicited by an infrequent stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7566746/"}

Gas exchange (MO2, MCO2), lung ventilation (VE), and body temperature (Tb) were simultaneously measured during sleep, shallow torpor (Tb 25-29 degrees C), deep torpor (Tb 11-15 degrees C), awake heterothermia (Tb 30-42.5 degrees C), and transitions between these states. CO2 retention (falling MCO2/MO2 and VE/MCO2) accompanied entrance into sleep and torpor. CO2 retention lowered MO2 in sleeping and torpid squirrels beyond that caused by reduced Tb. In torpor at steady state, MCO2/MO2 (R) and ventilation returned to control values, and no further CO2 retention occurred. Arousal from sleep or torpor was accompanied by transiently high VE/MCO2 and R values as CO2 was released from the body fluids. R and VE/MCO2 values during heterothermia in awake squirrels (Tb 32-42.5 degrees C) showed that total body CO2 content remained unchanged until Tb reached 40 degrees C with onset of hyperventilation. Altered CO2 content of the body fluids is thus not a general feature of mammalian heterothermy. The difference in CO2 homeostasis of torpid and heterothermic awake animals may have implications for the difference in metabolic intensity of these states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6421175/"}

Evidence from event-related brain potential (ERP) studies indicates that auditory information processing is selectively affected, even at early phases, across the different stages of sleep-wakefulness continuum. According to these studies, 3 main conclusions are drawn: (1) the sleeping brain is able to automatically detect stimulus occurrence and trigger an orienting response towards that stimulus if its degree of novelty is large; (2) auditory stimuli are represented in the auditory system and maintained for a period of time in sensory memory, making the automatic-change detection during sleep possible; and (3) there are specific brain mechanisms (sleep-specific ERP components associated with the presence of vertex waves and K-complexes) by which information processing can be improved during non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, the remarkably affected amplitude and latency of the waking-ERPs during the different stages of sleep suggests deficits in the building and maintenance of a neural representation of the stimulus as well as in the process by which neural events lead to an orienting response toward such a stimulus. The deactivation of areas in the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex during sleep contributing to the generation of these ERP components is hypothesized to be one of the main causes for the attenuated amplitude of these ERPs during human sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11682341/"}

Fifty-two healthy volunteers (27 women and 25 men) were recruited to participate in the study. Volunteers underwent sleep evaluation through nocturnal polysomnography and completed a 3-day food diary to evaluate food intake. No differences in sleep patterns were observed in either gender, except in the percentage of stage 1 sleep, which was greater in men. Different correlations were observed between sleep and dietary variables according to gender. The correlation between dietary and sleep variables in men indicated a negative relationship between nocturnal fat intake and the sleep latency, including REM sleep. The percentage of nocturnal fat intake correlated with sleep efficiency, sleep latency, REM latency, stage 2 sleep, REM sleep, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) in women. The percentage of nocturnal caloric intake correlated with sleep latency and efficiency in women. We conclude that food intake during the nocturnal period is correlated with negative effects on the sleep quality of healthy individuals. Indeed, food intake near the sleeping period (dinner and late night snack) was negatively associated with sleep quality variables.

National Sleep Foundation (NSF) age-specific sleep recommendations were used to define recommended (aligned) sleep duration. The balanced, repeated, replicate variance estimation method was applied to the ATUS data to calculate weighted estimates. Less than half of the US population had a sleep duration that mapped onto the NSF recommendations, and alignment was higher on weekdays (45%) than at weekends (33%). The proportion sleeping longer than the recommended duration was higher than those sleeping shorter on both weekdays and weekends (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Time spent on work, personal care, socialising, travel, TV watching, education, and total screen time was associated with nonalignment to the sleep recommendations. In comparison to the appropriate recommended sleep group, those with a too-short sleep duration spent more time on work, travel, socialising, relaxing, and leisure. By contrast, those who slept too long spent relatively less time on each of these activities. The findings indicate that sleep duration among the US population does not map onto the NSF sleep recommendations, mostly because of a higher proportion of long sleepers compared to short sleepers.

Age-related attenuation of sleep-spindle deceleration was evident. Estimated phases of the nadirs in sleep-spindle frequencies were advanced in children as compared to other age groups. Additionally, nap sleep spindles were faster than night sleep spindles (0.57 and 0.39 Hz difference for slow and fast types, respectively). The fine frequency resolution analysis of sleep spindles is a feasible method of measuring the assumed circadian modulation of sleep.

We show that reactivation strengthens procedural memory formation during sleep, but not during wakefulness. The improvement was restricted to those finger transitions that were cued. Thus, reactivation is a very specific process underpinning procedural memory consolidation. When comparing periods of sleep with and without reactivation, we find that it is not the time spent in a specific stage of sleep per se, but rather the occurrence of reactivation that mediates the effect of sleep on memory consolidation.

Unfortunately, diagnosis rates are low (∼20%) and current sleep monitoring options are expensive, time consuming, and uncomfortable. Toward the development of a convenient, noncontact OSA monitoring system, this paper presents a simple, computer vision-based method to monitor cardiopulmonary signals (respiratory and heart rates) during sleep. System testing was performed with 17 healthy participants in five different simulated sleep positions. To monitor cardiopulmonary rates, distinctive points are automatically detected and tracked in infrared image sequences. Blind source separation is applied to extract candidate signals of interest. The optimal respiratory and heart rates are determined using periodicity measures based on spectral analysis. Estimates were validated by comparison to polysomnography recordings. The system achieved a mean percentage error of 3.4% and 5.0% for respiratory rate and heart rate, respectively.

The ketamine-induced sleeping time was significantly prolonged by physostigmine and scopolamine, but not by mecamylamine. After the delayed injection of physostigmine, the ketamine sleeping time was longer. These results, although too preliminary for a mechanistic interpretation, suggest that multiple neurotransmitter systems, probably including the cholinergic system, are involved in the mechanism of action of ketamine-induced narcosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/108720/"}

The glycosides 2S-neohesperidin, 2S-naringin, diosmin, gossipyn and rutin exerted a depressant action on the CNS of mice following i.p. injection, similar to that found with 2S-hesperidin and linarin. We demonstrate in this work that these behavioural actions, as measured in the hole board, thiopental induced sleeping time and locomotor activity tests, are unlikely to involve a direct action on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. The corresponding aglycones were inactive, pointing to the importance of the sugar moieties in the glycosides in their CNS depressant action following systemic administration. The pharmacological properties of the flavonoid glycosides studied here, in addition to our previous results with hesperidin and linarin, opens a promising new avenue of research in the field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16698011/"}

Rhythmic breathing during sleep requires that P(CO2) be maintained above a sensitive hypocapnic apnoeic threshold. Hypoxia causes periodic breathing during sleep that can be prevented or eliminated with supplemental CO(2). The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hypoxia in changing the difference between the eupnoeic P(CO2) and the P(CO2) required to produce hypopnoea or apnoea (hypopnoea/apnoeic threshold) in sleeping humans. 2. The effect of hypoxia on eupnoeic end-tidal partial pressure of CO(2) (P(ET,CO2)) and hypopnoea/apnoeic threshold P(ET,CO2) was examined in seven healthy, sleeping human subjects. A bilevel pressure support ventilator in a spontaneous mode was used to reduce P(ET,CO2) in small decrements by increasing the inspiratory pressure level by 2 cmH2O every 2 min until hypopnoea (failure to trigger the ventilator) or apnoea (no breathing effort) occurred. Multiple trials were performed during both normoxia and hypoxia (arterial O(2) saturation, S(a,O2) = 80 %) in a random order. The hypopnoea/apnoeic threshold was determined by averaging P(ET,CO2) of the last three breaths prior to each hypopnoea or apnoea. 3. Hypopnoeas and apnoeas were induced in all subjects during both normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced the eupnoeic P(ET,CO2) compared to normoxia (42.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 45.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg, P < 0.001). However, no change was observed in either the hypopnoeic threshold P(ET,CO2) (42.1 +/- 1.4 vs. 43.0 +/- 1.2 mmHg, P > 0.05) or the apnoeic threshold P(ET,CO2) (41.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 41.6 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P > 0.05). Thus, the difference in P(ET,CO2) between the eupnoeic and threshold levels was much smaller during hypoxia than during normoxia (-0.2 +/- 0.2 vs. -2.0 +/- 0.3 mmHg, P < 0.01 for the hypopnoea threshold and -1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. -3.4 +/- 0.3 mmHg, P < 0.01 for the apnoeic threshold). We concluded that hypoxia causes a narrowing of the difference between the baseline P(ET,CO2) and the hypopnoea/apnoeic threshold P(ET,CO2), which could increase the likelihood of ventilatory instability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11507176/"}

A semi-structured clinician-administered interview designed to index the content of pre-sleep cognition was completed by individuals diagnosed with sleep-onset insomnia (N = 30) and good sleepers (N = 30). The pre-sleep cognitive activity of insomniacs could be distinguished from that of good sleepers by being more focused on worries, problems and noises in the environment, and less focused on 'nothing in particular'. In terms of content, the insomnia group were more likely to think about not sleeping or about something that had happened during the day. Insomniacs experienced their pre-sleep cognitive activity as more occupying, less intentional, for a longer duration, and as causing more difficulty with sleep onset compared to good sleepers. Pre-sleep imagery was reported at similar rates across diagnosis, but was more distressing and more likely to be associated with strong physical sensations for the insomniac group compared with the good sleeper group.

Taichung Community Health Study for Elders (TCHS-E) is a retrospective, population-based cohort that started in 2009 (wave 1) with a total of 912 elders aged 65 years or above. Follow up was conducted in 2010 (wave 2), 2018 (wave 3), and 2020 (wave 4). Sleep duration and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) forms were executed at baseline and three visits during follow-up. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During about 12 years (9,396 person-years) follow-up, 329 deaths from all causes were documented, including 102 deaths due to expanded cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the multivariable-adjusted, time-varying Cox proportional hazard model, the adjusted HR values of all-cause mortality were 1.47 (1.02-2.12) for sleep duration > 9 h/day (vs. 7 h/day) and 1.81 (1.26-2.59) for MMSE < 27 (vs. 30).

The main purpose of the study was to quantify the physical activity and sleeping behaviour of anorexia nervosa patients. Another purpose was to increase result reproducibility and generalisability of the study. Accelerometer data were collected from the first week of treatment of anorexia nervosa at an inpatient ward. Raw data from the Axivity AX3© accelerometer was used with the open-source package GGIR for analysis, in the free statistical software R. Accelerometer measurements were transformed into euclidean norm minus one with negative values rounded to zero (ENMO). Physical activity measurements of interest were 24h average ENMO, daytime average ENMO, inactivity, light activity, moderate activity, and vigorous activity. Sleep parameters of interest were sleep duration, sleep efficiency, awakenings, and wake after sleep onset. The sleep duration of different age groups was compared to recommendations by the National Sleep Foundation using a Fisher's exact test.

Mean self-reported alcohol consumption among the drinkers was 84.6 ml ethanol/night.

Anomalies in these mechanisms may predispose to circulatory failure during sleep. We analysed the development of two key reflexes involved by undertaking a longitudinal (birth–1 year) comparison of instantaneous HR and BP changes evoked by abrupt upright, sideways or horizontal repositioning. Each manoeuvre triggered an identical rise in HR (tachycardia) followed by a slower rise in diastolic blood pressure (DBP)/systolic blood pressure (SBP) and variable pulse pressure (PP) change. We show that tachycardia is triggered by acceleration (vestibular) sensors located in the inner ear and slight changes in the pulsatile component of BP then signal to the arterial baroreceptors to reinforce or oppose these actions as needed. We also identified a PP anomaly in sleeping 1-year-olds of smokers that prematurely slows HR and is associated with mild positional hypotension. We conclude that positional circulatory compensation is initiated pre-emptively in a feed-forward manner and that feedback changes in vago-sympathetic drive to the heart (and perhaps blood vessels) by PP exert a slower but powerful modulating effect.

Bouts of sleep and wakefulness are random; from P2-P10, sleep and wake bout lengths are exponentially distributed with increasing means, while during P10-P21, the sleep bout distribution remains exponential while the distribution of wake bouts gradually transforms to power law. The locus coeruleus (LC), via an undeciphered interaction with sleep and wake populations, has been shown experimentally to be responsible for the exponential to power law transition. Concurrently during P10-P21, the LC undergoes striking physiological changes - the LC exhibits strong global 0.3 Hz oscillations up to P10, but the oscillation frequency gradually rises and synchrony diminishes from P10-P21, with oscillations and synchrony vanishing at P21 and beyond. In this work, we construct a biologically plausible Wilson Cowan-style model consisting of the LC along with sleep and wake populations. We show that external noise and strong reciprocal inhibition can lead to switching between sleep and wake populations and exponentially distributed sleep and wake bout durations as during P2-P10, with the parameters of inhibition between the sleep and wake populations controlling mean bout lengths. Furthermore, we show that the changing physiology of the LC from P10-P21, coupled with reciprocal excitation between the LC and wake population, can explain the shift from exponential to power law of the wake bout distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first study that proposes a plausible biological mechanism, which incorporates the known changing physiology of the LC, for tying the developing sleep-wake circuit and its interaction with the LC to the transformation of sleep and wake bout dynamics from P2-P21.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28552556/"}

EMGdia (surface), end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2), esophageal pressure (Pe), and ventilation were measured with a flow-through hood (NPV) or a mask (PPV). The following results were obtained during steady-state (3 to 22 min) mechanical ventilation. (1) A decrease in PETCO2 of 2 to 6 mm Hg resulted in elimination of phasic EMGdia in all subjects. Inhibition of respiratory muscle EMG (and a positive shift in Pe) occurred coincident with the breath-by-breath reduction in PETCO2, so that EMGdia was usually eliminated after the initial 4 to 6 breaths while using the ventilator. (2) Returning PETCO2 to the spontaneous sleeping level by adding CO2 to the inspired air (isocapnic mechanical ventilation) caused significant increases in EMGdia. During this isocapnic mechanical ventilation, however, EMGdia usually remained less than during eucapnic control.

The Rosenberg Scale was used to measure global self-esteem and the Pope Scale for estimation of family-related self-esteem. Social skills were assessed using the scale developed by Shimada et al., which consists of subscales for pro-social skills, withdrawal behavior, and aggressive behavior. The main results were as follows: (1) The percentages of children who ate breakfast everyday in the last week were 78.3% for boys and 70.2% for girls, who no significant difference between the sexes. (2) The children who ate breakfast everyday in the last week (everyday-eating group) had more appetite for breakfast and went to bed earlier than the children who one or more days without eating (lack-of-eating group).

The persistence of a differential response to the subject's own name, relative to any other proper name, during stage 2 (S2) and paradoxical (REM) sleep (PS) suggests that the brain remains able to discriminate an intrinsically relevant word during these sleep stages. The similarities and the differences between these sleep cognitive responses and the waking P300 are stressed, and the functional significance of this component discussed especially in relation with consciousness and memory of the stimulus. Recent studies of the 'N400' potential evoked by semantically incongruous words, have shown that this component may be also elicited during S2 and PS, indicating preserved detection of semantic discordance during these sleep stages. However, linguistic incongruity appears to be processed in a different manner during PS than during waking, since words devoid of meaning (pseudo-words), which are detected as anomalous and evoke N400 during waking, yielded responses similar to those of congruous words in PS. All these data support the view that some semantic analysis of auditory stimuli remains possible in the human sleeping brain, and warrant further studies to elucidate the extent and limits of these capabilities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12445951/"}
{"id": "9391765", "title": "Development of cardiopulmonary integration and the role of arousability from sleep.", "text": "The recent literature on cardiopulmonary integration in infants is surveyed here, focusing on arousals from sleep. Recent studies reported that the ontogenicity of cardiopulmonary integration cannot be evaluated independently from that of sleep-wake cycles. The issue is of importance for researchers and clinicians evaluating cardiorespiratory characteristics in infants. It also has significant implications in the understanding of clinical conditions, such as parasomnias, obstructive sleep apneas, or some cases of sudden infant death syndrome. The propensity to arouse can be evaluated by exposing the sleeper to awakening challenges. Arousal thresholds are determined by measuring the intensity of the stimulus needed to induce arousals. However, these studies are complicated by factors such as the scoring of the arousal responses. Another difficulty lies in the choice and modality of the arousal stimulus. Noise, gases, light, and nociceptive, mechanical, chemical, or temperature stimuli have all been used to induce arousals. Confounding factors modify the sleeper's responses to a given stimulus. Prenatal drug, alcohol, or cigarette use and the infant's age or, previous sleep deprivation also modify thresholds. Other confounding factors include time of the night, sleep stages, the sleeper's body position, and sleeping conditions. Arousal can also occur spontaneously because of endogenous stimuli. The literature surveyed here also covers such unresolved issues as the clinical significance of aborted arousals, or the mechanisms responsible for the arousal reactions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9391765/"}

Thirty seven healthy infants aged 2-4 months were studied. HRV was measured for 500 beats while they were in a horizontal position. Subjects were then tilted 60 degrees head-up, and heart rate recorded over 1 minute and arousal responses observed. Data were collected during both quiet and active sleep for both prone and supine sleep positions. HRV, as assessed by the point dispersion of Poincaré plots, was significantly reduced in the prone position for both sleep states. Sleep position did not influence the changes in heart rate seen during a head-up tilt. Full awakening to the tilt was common in active sleep but significantly less so in the prone position (15% of prone tests vs 54% supine). Full awakening to the tilt rarely occurred during quiet sleep in either sleep position. This study provides some evidence that blunted arousal responses and/or altered autonomic function are a feature of the prone sleeping position. Decreased HRV may be a sign of autonomic impairment. It is seen in many disease states and in infants who later die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9713030/"}

While the regulation of energy metabolism varies widely among individuals, identifying those who are metabolically prone to weight gain and intervening accordingly is a key challenge for reversing the course of the obesity epidemic. Indirect calorimetry is the most commonly used method to measure energy expenditure in the research setting. By measuring oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, indirect calorimetry provides minute-by-minute energy expenditure data that makes it the most valuable tool to distinguish the various components of energy expenditure, that is, sleeping and resting metabolic rate, thermic effect of food and the energy cost of activity. Importantly, such measures also provide information on energy substrate utilization. Here we summarized some of the research that revealed resting metabolic rate, spontaneous physical activity and respiratory quotient as key metabolic predictors of weight gain and obesity. Recent studies using indirect calorimetry in response to mid-term fasting or overfeeding have identified 'thrifty' and 'spendthrift' phenotypes in people who differ in propensity to weight gain. We propose the use of indirect calorimetry data as a basis for personalized interventions that may be efficacious in slowing down the rise of global obesity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848941/"}

Our study found that the initiation of benzodiazepine use was often at a time of stress for the patient. Long-term use was not in-tended, and patients conveyed poor awareness of the side effects and addictive potential of benzodiazepines. Patients' perceived attitudes of their general practitioner (GP) to prescribing benzodiazepines and lack of awareness of alternative therapies were key to continuation. Confounding factors such as pain often contributed to sleep disturbance. Many patients expressed a willingness to cease nocturnal benzodiazepine use.

Yet fractured sleep is disturbingly prevalent in our society, partly due to insults from a variety of noises [1]. Common experience suggests that this fragility of sleep is highly variable between people, but it is unclear what mechanisms drive these differences. Here we show that it is possible to predict an individual's ability to maintain sleep in the face of sound using spontaneous brain rhythms from electroencephalography (EEG). The sleep spindle is a thalamocortical rhythm manifested on the EEG as a brief 11-15 Hz oscillation and is thought to be capable of modulating the influence of external stimuli [2]. Its rate of occurrence, while variable across people, is stable across nights [3]. We found that individuals who generated more sleep spindles during a quiet night of sleep went on to exhibit higher tolerance for noise during a subsequent, noisy night of sleep. This result shows that the sleeping brain's spontaneous activity heralds individual resilience to disruptive stimuli. Our finding sets the stage for future studies that attempt to augment spindle production to enhance sleep continuity when confronted with noise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20692606/"}

Such differences may provide insight on the frequent occurrence of SIDS in the early morning hours, when most babies are asleep. This is the only study in which R and C infants were continuously monitored for long periods of time (24-48 h) and then followed and recorded at monthly intervals until the age of 4-6 months. Data analyses indicate that ultradian REM/NREM cyclicity becomes stabilized into a regular pattern at three months of age. Infants at this age convert from a polyphasic sleep/wakefulness pattern to a circadian one. Among the changes that occur is a lengthening of short sleep periods that consolidate at night and wake periods that consolidate in the daytime. The most striking effects are related to sleep state and vary according to age and sex. The lengthening of single sleep and wakeful periods is coupled with the maturation of the brain. The development of the central nervous system facilitates the synchronization of sleeping patterns with external light input and social entrainment. One or more biological clocks or oscillators may be responsible for these REM/NREM patterns and circadian cycles. These differences during the early morning hours, when the occurrence of SIDS peaks, may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of SIDS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17050210/"}

Morning arterial blood gases and overnight polysomnography were performed in 14 subjects at altitudes: 0, 1400, 3500, 3900, 4200 and 5000 m above sea level. Subjects became progressively more hypoxic, hypocapnic and alkalinic with increasing altitude. As expected, sleep architecture was affected by increasing altitude. While time spent in Stage 1 non-rapid eye movement sleep increased at 3500 m and higher (P < 0.001), time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) decreased as altitude increased. Time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was well preserved. In subjects who developed periodic breathing during sleep at one or more altitudes (16 of 19), arousals because of periodic breathing predominated, contributing to an increase in the total arousal index. However, there were no differences in sleep architecture or sleeping oxyhaemoglobin saturation between subjects who developed periodic breathing and those who did not. As altitude increased, sleep architecture became progressively more disturbed, with Stage 1 and SWS being affected from 3500 m, while REM sleep was well preserved.

Nasal occlusion at end expiration was achieved by inflating balloon-tipped catheters located within the portals of a nose mask. No seal was placed over the mouth. During nose breathing in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, nasal airway occlusion resulted in multiple respiratory efforts before arousal. Mouth breathing was not initiated until arousal. Phasic inspiratory genioglossus activity was present in eight subjects during NREM sleep. In these subjects, comparison of peak genioglossus inspiratory activity on the first three occluded efforts to the value just before occlusion showed an increase of 4.7, 16.1, and 28.0%, respectively. The relative increases in peak genioglossus activity were very similar to respective increases in peak diaphragm activity. Arousal was associated with a large burst in genioglossus activity. During airway occlusion in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, mouth breathing could occur without a change in sleep state. In general, genioglossus responses to airway occlusion in REM sleep were similar in pattern to those in NREM sleep.

Mild degrees of tracheobronchia irritation, produced by squirting 0.1--1.0 ml of water into the lower trachea, or by having the dogs inhale one breath of acetic acid vapor (concentration 17 ppm), generally caused arousal from slow-wave sleep (SWS), but not from rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. During wakefulness the irritant stimuli caused coughing and TSM constriction; during SWS or REM sleep, these responses occurred only if the stimulus first produced arousal. In contrast, stimulation of pulmonary stretch receptors by lung inflation did not cause arousal, but readily produced apnea and TSM relaxation during SWS.

This period of quiescence was termed 'No Eye Movement Period' or 'N.E.M.

In the latter part of 1951, the first continuous all-night recording of ocular motility in sleep using a combined EEG and EOG technique was conducted on the author's eight year old son. Instead of N.E.M. Periods, what he found were aproximately twenty minute periods of vigorous ocular activity including saccadic-like eye movements. Although he ultimately termed these epochs as 'REM Periods', his initial intent was to name them 'Jerky Eye Movement Periods' or \"JEM Periods'. Ironically, some three decades later he found that a mathematical measure of jerkiness was a better discriminator than velocity in distinguishing REMs from waking saccades. Kleitman, who was the thesis advisor, played the role of skeptic during the REM discovery and demanded unassailable proof of the existence of REM.

All functional connectivity measures changed significantly between vigilance states and matured rapidly after normal birth. The observed changes were frequency-specific, most salient in AAC coupling, and their development was compatible with the known development of structural cortico-cortical connectivity.

In the human brain, neuronal synchronization and de-synchronization occur during sleep, with the greatest degree of neuronal synchronization during slow wave sleep (SWS). The current sleep classification schema is based on electroencephalography and provides common criteria for clinicians and researchers to describe stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These sleep stage classifications have been based on convenient heuristic criteria, with little consideration of the accompanying normal physiological changes across those same sleep stages. To begin to resolve those inconsistencies, first focusing only on NREM sleep, we propose a simple cluster synchronization model to explain the emergence of SWS in healthy people without sleep disorders. We apply the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis to quantify slow wave activity in electroencephalograms, and provide quantitative evidence to support our model. Based on this synchronization model, NREM sleep can be classified as SWS and non-SWS, such that NREM sleep can be considered as an intrinsically bistable process. Finally, we develop an automated algorithm for SWS classification.

Felbamate was administered at a single dose (200 mg/kg i.p.) or as daily injections dose (50 mg/kg for 10 days). At a single dose, felbamate prolonged ethanol-sleeping time, increased ethanol-induced disturbances of motor coordination and ethanol-induced hypothermia as well as prevented increased locomotor activity observed after ethanol intake. Felbamate administered for 10 days reduced ethanol sleeping time, did not effect ethanol on locomotor activity of mice, but augmented ethanol-induced changes in motor coordination and ethanol hypothermia. These interactions may be of pharmacodynamic character, but pharmacokinetic nature cannot be excluded, felbamate and ethanol are substrates for the cytochrome CYP2E1.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15481247/"}

Here, we take a genetics-first approach to study the complex role of sleep in psychopathology. Specifically, we examine severity of sleep disturbance in individuals with a reciprocal copy number variant (CNV) at the 22q11.2 locus and determine sleep's effect on psychiatric symptoms. CNVs (deletion or duplication) at this locus confer some of the greatest known risks of neuropsychiatric disorders; recent studies suggest the 22q11.2 deletion negatively impacts sleep, but sleep disruption associated with 22q11.2 duplication has not been investigated. We compared subjective sleep disturbance and its relationship to psychiatric symptoms cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 1 year in 107 22q11.2 deletion (22qDel) carriers (14.56±8.0 years; 50% male), 42 22q11.2 duplication (22qDup) carriers (16.26±13.1 years; 54.8% male), and 88 age- and sex-matched controls (14.65±7.4 years; 47.1% male). Linear mixed models were used to compare sleep disturbance, assessed via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS), across groups. Next, CNV carriers were categorized as good or poor sleepers to investigate sleep effects on multiple neurobehavioral traits: psychosis-risk symptoms (SIPS), autism-related behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale (RBS) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)), real-world executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)), and emotional/behavioral problems (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)). Linear mixed models tested the effect of sleep category and a group-by-sleep interaction on each measure, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. 22qDel and 22qDup carriers both reported poorer sleep than controls, but did not differ from each other. Cross-sectionally and longitudinally, poor sleepers scored higher on positive symptoms, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, thought problems, and aggressive behavior, as well as RBS and SRS total scores. There were significant group-by-sleep interactions for positive symptoms and the majority of CBCL subdomains, in which the difference between good and poor sleepers was larger in 22qDel compared to 22qDup. Our findings indicate that CNVs at the 22q11.2 locus impact sleep which, in turn, influences psychopathology. Sleep disturbances can differentially impact psychopathology, depending on 22q11.2 gene dosage. Our findings serve as a starting point for exploring a genetic basis for sleep disturbance in developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35820809/"}

However, the evidence for increasing sleep deprivation comes from surveys using habitual sleep questions. An alternative source of information regarding sleep behaviour is time-use studies. This paper investigates changes in sleep time in the UK using the two British time-use studies that allow measuring \"time in bed not asleep\" separately from \"actual sleep time\". Based upon the studies presented here, people in the UK sleep today 43 min more than they did in the 1970s because they go to bed earlier (~30 min) and they wake up later (~15 min). The change in sleep duration is driven by night sleep and it is homogeneously distributed across the week. The former results apply to men and women alike, and to individuals of all ages and employment status, including employed individuals, the presumed major victims of the sleep deprivation epidemic and the 24/7 society. In fact, employed individuals have experienced a reduction in short sleeping of almost 4 percentage points, from 14.9% to 11.0%. There has also been a reduction of 15 percentage points in the amount of conflict between workers work time and their sleep time, as measured by the proportion of workers that do some work within their \"ideal sleep window\" (as defined by their own chronotype).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30198095/"}

An unresolved puzzle is how the sleeping brain, in the absence of external stimulation or conscious effort, coordinates neuronal firing rates (FRs) and communication within and across circuits to support synaptic and systems consolidation. Using intracranial electroencephalography combined with multiunit activity recordings from the human hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, we show that, governed by slow oscillation (SO) up-states, sleep spindles set a timeframe for ripples to occur. This sequential coupling leads to a stepwise increase in (1) neuronal FRs, (2) short-latency cross-correlations among local neuronal assemblies and (3) cross-regional MTL interactions. Triggered by SOs and spindles, ripples thus establish optimal conditions for spike-timing-dependent plasticity and systems consolidation.

This study looked at the effect of theophylline on the metabolic and ventilatory response to hypoxemia in piglets. We studied two groups of piglets during normoxia and hypoxemia: first during a baseline period; and second, after the infusion of either theophylline or a placebo. All studies were done in quiet sleep, 2 d after instrumentation was performed to place vascular catheters and electroencephalographic electrodes. O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were measured in a metabolic chamber, and alveolar ventilation (VA) was then derived from VCO2 and PaCO2. We found that theophylline did not abolish the small decrease in oxygen consumption brought about by hypoxemia. Nor did theophylline augment the ventilatory response to hypoxemia. In fact, the percent change in alveolar ventilation decreased slightly: going from 17 +/- 8% during the baseline period to 9 +/- 6% (p < 0.005) after theophylline administration. We found a significant increase in respiratory exchange ratio (R) in response to hypoxemia (from 0.87 +/- 0.05 to 0.97 +/- 0.04, p < 0.001). However, after the administration of theophylline, additional exposure to hypoxemia did not result in a change in R.

Of the 21 studies selected, 13 used both subjective and objective measurement methods. Six studies used only subjective and two studies only objective methods. For subjective assessment, 12 different questionnaires could be identified as well as activity and sleeping logs. Actigraphy and reaction time tests (RTT) were the most common objective methods. In single cases, electrooculography (EOG), pupillometry and ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) were used. Measurement-related limitations due to vessel-related impacts were less often reported than expected. No restrictions of daily routines on board were described, and only single-measurement disturbances due to ship movements were mentioned. The present literature review reveals that there are various routines to measure fatigue, sleepiness, and sleep behaviour on board. A combination of subjective and objective methods often appears to be beneficial. The frequent use of actigraphy and RTT on board suggests good feasibility and reliable measurements with these methods. The use of ambulatory PSG in maritime-like contexts suggests that this method would also be feasible on board.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35010383/"}

Spindle and SO \"nesting,\" or the temporal overlap between the two events, is believed to modulate consolidation. However, the neurophysiological processes modified by nesting remain poorly understood. We thus recorded activity from the primary motor cortex of 4 male sleeping rats to investigate how SO and spindles interact to modulate the correlation structure of neural firing. During spindles, primary motor cortex neurons fired at a preferred phase, with neural pairs demonstrating greater neural synchrony, or correlated firing, during spindle peaks. We found a direct relationship between the temporal proximity between SO and spindles, and changes to the distribution of neural correlations; nesting was associated with narrowing of the distribution, with a reduction in low- and high-correlation pairs. Such narrowing may be consistent with greater exploration of neural states. Interestingly, after animals practiced a novel motor task, pairwise correlations increased during nested spindles, consistent with targeted strengthening of functional interactions. These findings may be key mechanisms through which spindle nesting supports memory consolidation.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our analysis revealed changes in cortical spiking structure that followed the waxing and waning of spindles; firing rates increased, spikes were more phase-locked to spindle-band local field potential, and synchrony across units peaked during spindles. Moreover, we showed that the degree of nesting between spindles and slow oscillations modified the correlation structure across units by narrowing the distribution of pairwise correlations. Finally, we demonstrated that engaging in a novel motor task increased pairwise correlations during nested spindles. These phenomena suggest key mechanisms through which the interaction of spindles and slow oscillations may support sensorimotor learning. More broadly, this work helps link large-scale measures of population activity to changes in spiking structure, a critical step in understanding neuroplasticity across multiple scales.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371605/"}

Arc entry in the synapse is followed by the endocytosis of glutamatergic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), and its nuclear accumulation has been shown <i>in vitro</i> to result in a small decline in the transcription of the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs. Since these effects result in a decline in synaptic strength, we asked whether a change in Arc dynamics may temporally correlate with sleep-dependent GluA1 down-regulation. We measured the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic Arc expression (Arc Nuc/Cyto) in the cerebral cortex of EGFP-Arc transgenic mice that were awake most of the night and then perfused immediately before lights on (W mice), or were awake most of the night and then allowed to sleep (S mice) or sleep deprived (SD mice) for the first 2 h of the light phase. In primary motor cortex (M1), neurons with high levels of nuclear Arc (High Arc cells) were present in all mice, but in these cells Arc Nuc/Cyto was higher in S mice than in W mice and, importantly, ~15% higher in S mice than in SD mice collected at the same time of day, ruling out circadian effects. Greater Arc Nuc/Cyto with sleep was observed in the superficial layers of M1, but not in the deep layers. In High Arc cells, Arc Nuc/Cyto was also ~15%-30% higher in S mice than in W and SD mice in the superficial layers of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and cingulate cortex area 1 (Cg1). In High Arc Cells of Cg1, Arc Nuc/Cyto and cytoplasmic levels of GluA1 immunoreactivities in the soma were also negatively correlated, independent of behavioral state. Thus, Arc moves to the nucleus during both sleep and wake, but its nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio increases with sleep in the superficial layers of several cortical areas. It remains to be determined whether the relative increase in nuclear Arc contributes significantly to the overall decline in the strength of excitatory synapses that occurs during sleep. Similarly, it remains to be determined whether the entry of Arc into specific synapses is gated by sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878629/"}

The homeostatic approach assumes that the sleep substance accumulates during waking and dissipates during sleep. Sleep deprivation has been the principal tool for enhancing the level of a sleep substance in a donor animal before testing its hypnogenic effect in a recipient animal. Among the two sleep factors isolated by this approach, Factor S has been identified as a muramyl peptide, whereas the composition of Sleep Promoting Substance (SPS) has not yet been fully clarified. Recently, factors have been obtained from REM sleep deprived donors which are able to antagonize drug-induced REM sleep suppression in recipients. The homeostatic approach can be related to physiological processes underlying sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythms. The non-homeostatic approach to sleep substances is based on the serendipitous discovery of a hypnogenic action. While a number of such substances have been described, their relationship to physiological sleep regulation is unknown. Melatonin has been reported to induce or enhance sleep in animals and man. However, the doses used in human studies raise the plasma level far beyond the physiological range. Melatonin may influence circadian processes regulating sleep propensity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3462334/"}

Energy drink (ED) consumption has been linked to later bedtime in adolescents. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential association between ED consumption and sleep duration, and shuteye latency among adolescents in Norway. This study was based on data from 15- to 16-year-old adolescents living in Oppland County in 2017. In total, 1353 adolescents were included in the analysis. Multiple regression models were used to estimate the associations between the frequency of ED consumption with sleep duration, shuteye latency, and getting 8 h of sleep. Forty-six point five percent of the adolescents reported sleeping more than 8 h at night. Those who reported ED consumption at any frequency had significantly shorter sleep duration than those who did not. On average, high consumers of ED (consuming ED ≥ 4 times a week) had 0.95 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.28) hours (i.e., 57 min) less sleep than those who never consumed ED. In addition, high consumers had more than 25 min (95% CI: 13.95, 36.92) longer shuteye period than those who never consumed ED. Most ED consumers fail to obtain the recommended 8 h of sleep at night, which could be a consequence of shorter sleep duration and longer shuteye latency. We found a dose-response relationship between frequency of ED consumption and reduced sleep. Yet, the potential long-term effects of both ED consumption and insufficient sleep among adolescents remain unclear.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35303832/"}

The clinician must be prepared to gather information from many disparate aspects of the patient's history and present circumstances. Diagnostic considerations are complicated further by the significant night-to-night variation in the manifestations of the insomnia. Too often, the result of this hidden complexity is a tendency either to prescribe hypnotic drugs as a first intervention or to give signals to patients with insomnia that not much can be done and that difficulty sleeping is simply a fact of life. The sleep log can help to bring order to the jumble of insomniac experiences. It leads both the clinician and patient away from assigning too much weight to a specific instance, instead allowing more general patterns to be discerned. As order is created out of the factors contributing to the insomnia, a treatment plan can be designed that goes beyond mere symptomatic treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8871975/"}

We found that permeability of the BBB (blood-brain barrier)-the organ required for the maintenance of homeostatic levels of nutrients, ions, and other molecules in the brain-is modulated by sleep deprivation (SD) and can cell-autonomously effect sleep changes. We observed increased BBB permeability in known sleep mutants as well as in acutely sleep-deprived animals. In addition to molecular tracers, SD-induced BBB changes also increased the penetration of drugs used in the treatment of brain pathologies. After chronic/genetic or acute SD, rebound sleep or administration of the sleeping aid gaboxadol normalized BBB permeability, showing that SD effects on the BBB are reversible. Along with BBB permeability, RNA levels of the BBB master regulator <i>moody</i> are modulated by sleep. Conversely, altering BBB permeability alone through glia-specific modulation of <i>moody, gαo, loco, lachesin</i>, or <i>neuroglian</i>-each a well-studied regulator of BBB function-was sufficient to induce robust sleep phenotypes. These studies demonstrate a tight link between BBB permeability and sleep and indicate a unique role for the BBB in the regulation of sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37831742/"}

Children with analysable sleep data for at least one wave. At every wave, parents prospectively completed 24-h time-use diaries for a randomly selected week or weekend day. 'Sleeping, napping' was one of the 26 precoded activities recorded in 15-min time intervals. From 0 to 9 years of age, 24-h sleep duration fell from a mean peak of 14 (SD 2.2) h at 4-6 months to 10 (SD 1.9) h at 9 years, mainly due to progressively later mean sleep onset time from 20:00 (SD 75 min) to 21:00 (SD 60 min) and declining length of day sleep from 3.0 (SD 1.7) h to 0.03 (SD 0.2) h. Number and duration of night wakings also fell. By primary school, wake and sleep onset times were markedly later on weekend days. The most striking feature of the centile charts is the huge variation at all ages in sleep duration, sleep onset time and, especially, wake time in this normal population.

However, developmental questions still remain about whether children of various ages benefit similarly or differentially from night- and day-time sleeping. The likely circadian effects (time-of-day) and the possible between-test-interference (order effects) associated with children's off-line motor learning are currently unknown. Therefore, this study examines the contributions of over-night sleeping and mid-day napping to procedural skill learning. One hundred and eight children were instructed to practice a finger sequence task using computer keyboards. After an equivalent 11-h interval in one of the three states (sleep, nap, wakefulness), children performed the same sequence in retention tests and a novel sequence in transfer tests. Changes in the movement time and sequence accuracy were evaluated between ages (6-7, 8-9, 10-11years) during practice, and from skill training to retrievals across three states. Results suggest that night-time sleeping and day-time napping improved the tapping speed, especially for the 6-year-olds. The circadian factor did not affect off-line motor learning in children. The interference between the two counter-balanced retrieval tests was not found for the off-line motor learning. This research offers possible evidence about the age-related motor learning characteristics in children and a potential means for enhancing developmental motor skills.

Multivariate analysis reveals that individual perceptions of sleep quality can be misleading when analyzed in isolation. Through hierarchical models, we identify specific predictors of sleep quality.

Night shifts, female gender, and co-sleeping with pets (OR = 3.68) increased risk of sleep problems. Medical predictors (e.g., STOP-Bang) were not significantly associated.

Presented here is a 3D-printable implant for rats, named TD Drive, capable of symmetric, bilateral wire electrode recordings, currently in up to ten distributed brain areas simultaneously. The open-source design was created employing parametric design principles, allowing prospective users to easily adapt the drive design to their needs by simply adjusting high-level parameters, such as anterior-posterior and mediolateral coordinates of the recording electrode locations.

Sleep was not prolonged equally for different workers; those sleeping shorter in the previous phase of the shift cycle prolonged their sleep more while those sleeping longer in the previous phase prolonged their sleep less.

Moderate day time hyperventilation from a pressure-limited ventilator is necessary in these patients to avoid hypoxia during sleep due to the variable insufflation leak. This study sought to confirm whether a dead space of 3 ml.kg-1 could help to provide normocapnic hyperventilation during waking time without causing hypercapnia and hypoxaemia during sleep. Transcutaneous blood gas studies were performed on 11 patients with high tetraplegia undergoing pressure-limited pulmonary ventilation with room air. Recordings were made for 120 min each when awake and asleep, with and without dead space. The mean derived arterial PCO2 without the dead space was 2.95 kPa awake and 3.21 kPa asleep, whilst the corresponding tensions with dead space were 3.39 kPa and 3.79 kPa. These small increases associated with the dead space, both awake and asleep, were statistically significant. There was a statistically, though not clinically significant decrease in oxygen tension when the patients without dead space went to sleep. The fact that the carbon dioxide tension was higher during sleep when dead space was in situ indicates that, despite the insufflation leak in these patients, there is significant rebreathing back through the dead space.

Motor delays were documented in 22% of babies sleeping supine. Prone sleep-positioned infants were more likely to sit and roll. Daily exposure to awake prone positioning was predictive of motor performance in infants sleeping supine. At 15 months, sleep position continued to predict motor performance.

The time course of the EEG spectral power and NREM vs REM differences was assessed. Sleep spindles were automatically detected. To assess homeostatic dynamics, we considered the first vs second half of the night ratio in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) and the rise rate of delta activity during the first sleep cycle. While the parietal area showed the classically described NREM and REM sleep hallmarks, the calcarine cortex exhibited a distinctive pattern characterized by: (1) the absence of sleep spindles; (2) a large similarity between EEG power spectra of NREM and REM; and (3) reduced signs of homeostatic dynamics, with a decreased delta ratio between the first and the second half of the night, a reduced rise rate of delta activity during the first NREM sleep cycle, and lack of correlation between these measures. Besides describing for the first time the peculiar sleep EEG pattern in the human calcarine cortex, our findings provide evidence that different cortical areas may exhibit specific sleep EEG pattern, supporting the view of sleep as a local process and promoting the idea that the functional role of sleep EEG features should be considered at a regional level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33556162/"}

First, a narrow-band oscillatory mode is extracted from a broadband background. Second, it is tested whether the extracted mode is significantly different from linearly filtered noise, modelled as a linear stochastic process possibly passed through a static nonlinear transformation. If a nonlinear oscillatory mode is positively detected, further analysis using nonlinear approaches such as the phase synchronization analysis can potentially bring new information. For linear processes, however, standard approaches such as the coherence analysis are more appropriate and provide sufficient description of underlying interactions with smaller computational effort.

Fifty healthy, normally sleeping adults from the community completed the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and slept uninterrupted for one night in the laboratory while polysomnography was conducted. Various measures of sleep latency, sleep stages, and REM sleep-related variables were obtained, and analyses correlated these sleep measures with alexithymia, controlling for age, sex, and level of depressed affect. Higher alexithymia scores were significantly related to increased stage 1 (light) sleep and decreased stage 3/4 (deep) sleep. Alexithymia was unrelated to overall sleep efficiency or percentage of stage 2 sleep. Alexithymia was related to more frequent REM episodes and more stage 1 sleep during and immediately after REM episodes but was unrelated to the absolute amount of REM sleep. Alexithymia was also related to an earlier onset of the first REM episode. Alexithymia is associated with more light sleep and less deep sleep, which may contribute to subjective reports of poor sleep and increased sleepiness, fatigue, and somatic symptoms. Although alexithymia is not associated with an overall reduction of REM sleep, the increased frequency of episodes of REM that are interrupted and followed by light sleep rather than complete awakenings may contribute to limited dream recall.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11211065/"}

Impact of sleeping altitude on symptoms of acute mountain sickness on Mt. Fuji. High Alt Med Biol. 19:193-200, 2018. We sought to investigate the factors influencing acute mountain sickness (AMS) on Mt. Fuji in Japan, in particular, to assess the effects of sleeping altitude, by means of a questionnaire survey. This study involved 1932 participants who climbed Mt. Fuji, and obtained information regarding sex, age, and whether participants stayed at the mountain lodges. The AMS survey excluded the perceived sleep difficulties assessed with the Lake Louise Scoring (LLS) system for all climbers. The overall prevalence of AMS was 31.6% for all participants (LLS score ≥3 with headache, excluding sleep difficulties). A univariate analysis revealed that overnight stay at Mt. Fuji was associated with an increased prevalence of AMS, but that sex and age were not. For overnight lodgers, the mean sleeping altitude in participants with AMS was slightly higher than that in participants without AMS (p < 0.05). Moreover, participants who stayed above 2870 m were more likely to experience AMS than those who stayed below 2815 m (p < 0.001), but sex and age were not significantly associated with the probability of experiencing AMS. Staying overnight at a mountain lodge, especially one above 2870 m, may be associated with an increased prevalence of AMS on Mt. Fuji.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29741971/"}

These very first representations of object-word pairings in infant memory are considered as non-symbolic proto-words comprising specific visual-auditory associations that can already be formed in the first months of life [2-5]. Genuine words that refer to semantic long-term memory have not been evidenced prior to 9 months of age [6-9]. Sleep is known to facilitate the reorganization of memories [9-14], but its impact on the perceptual-to-semantic trend in early development is unknown. Here we explored the formation of word meanings in 6- to 8-month-old infants and its reorganization during the course of sleep. Infants were exposed to new words as labels for new object categories. In the memory test about an hour later, generalization to novel category exemplars was tested. In infants who took a short nap during the retention period, a brain response of 3-month-olds [1] was observed, indicating generalizations based on early developing perceptual-associative memory. In those infants who napped longer, a semantic priming effect [15, 16] usually found later in development [17-19] revealed the formation of genuine words. The perceptual-to-semantic shift in memory was related to the duration of sleep stage 2 and to locally increased sleep spindle activity. The finding that, after the massed presentation of several labeled category exemplars, sleep enabled even 6-month-olds to create semantic long-term memory clearly challenges the notion that immature brain structures are responsible for the typically slower lexical development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28756948/"}

Thereafter subjects were submitted to a 32 h bed rest protocol in a sound- and light-attenuated room. The EEG was recorded and processed by a Fast Fourier Transform. Narcoleptics did not differ from controls in total sleep time over the whole 32 h, but spent more time sleeping during the daytime (DT). In both groups slow wave activity (SWA) showed an exponential decaying trend during the first night (N1); a similar exponential trend during the second night (N2) was evident only in controls. In controls SWA showed a circadian-circasemidian distribution that was hardly detectable in nacroleptics. Narcoleptics showed an ultradian distribution of SWA with periodic emergence every 4 h during DT and N2. Our data confirm that a homeostatic mechanism is evident in narcolpetics when stimulated by diurnal sleep deprivation, while circadian and circasemidian mechanisms are less evident during DT and N2. These findings suggest a different coupling between homeostatic sleep regulating and circadian drives to sleep in narcoleptics. Ultradian drives to sleep seem to be predominant in these patients, thus probably acting as a means for the avoidance of stressful attempts to counteract a weaker waking state maintenance mechanism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8536570/"}

However, traditional methods in recording physiological change amidst sleep is difficult without being intrusive. The smart pillow is developed to provide a relatively easy way to observe one's sleep condition, employing temperature and humidity sensors by implanting them inside the pillow in strategic positions. With the patient's head on the pillow, the roles of sensors are identified as main, auxiliary or environmental temperature, based on the differences of value from three temperature sensors, thus the pattern of sleep can be extracted by statistical analysis, and the body temperature is inferred by a specially designed Fuzzy Logic System if the head-on position is stable for more than 15 min. Night sweat is reported on data from the humidity sensor. Therefore, a cloud-based health-sensing system is built in the smart pillow to collect and analyze data. Experiments from various individuals prove that statistical and inferred results reflect normal and abnormal conditions of sleep accurately. The daily sleeping information of patients from the pillow is helpful in the decision-making of diagnoses and treatment, and users can change their habits of sleep gradually by observing the data with their health professional.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30380614/"}

Improving sleep is increasingly emphasized in clinical T2D treatment guidance, highlighting the need for effective, scalable sleep interventions that can affordably serve large populations through mobile health (mHealth). This study aims to pilot an intervention that extends sleep duration by modifying bedtime behavior, assessing its efficacy among short-sleeping (≤6 hours per night) patients with T2D, and establishing robust evidence that extending sleep improves glycemic control. This randomized, single-blinded, multicenter study targets 70 patients with T2D from 9 institutions in Japan over a 12-week intervention period. The sleep extension intervention, BedTime, is developed using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and focuses on TPB's constructs of perceived and actual behavioral control (ABC). The pilot intervention combines wearable actigraphy devices with SMS text messaging managed by human operators. Both the intervention and control groups will use an actigraphy device to record bedtime, sleep duration, and step count, while time in bed (TIB) will be assessed via sleep diaries. In addition, the intervention group will receive weekly bedtime goals, daily feedback on their bedtime performance relative to those goals, identify personal barriers to an earlier bedtime, and select strategies to overcome these barriers. The 12-week intervention period will be followed by a 12-week observational period to assess the sustainability of the intervention's effects. The primary outcome is the between-group difference in the change in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include other health measures, sleep metrics (bedtime, TIB, sleep duration, total sleep time, and sleep quality), behavioral changes, and assessments of the intervention's usability. The trial commenced on February 8, 2024, and is expected to conclude in February 2025. Patient recruitment ended on August 29, 2024, with 70 participants enrolled. The intervention period concluded on December 6, 2024, and the observation period ended on February 26, 2025, with 70 participants completing the observation period. The data analysis is currently underway, and results are expected to be published in July 2025. This trial will provide important evidence on the causal link between increased sleep duration and improved glycemic control in short-sleeping patients with T2D. It will also evaluate the efficacy of our bedtime behavior change intervention in extending sleep duration, initially piloted with human operators, with the goal of future implementation via an mHealth smartphone app. If proven effective, this intervention could be a key step toward integrating sleep-focused mHealth into the standard treatment for patients with T2D in Japan.

On the assumption that brain molecules synthesized during the acquisition step undergo a comparable sleep processing, we have designed an experiment aimed at the verification of the sequential hypothesis. Groups of adult female Wistar rats received [3H-methyl] thymidine by intraventricular injection 30 min before being exposed to a 4 hr session of a two-way active avoidance training. Animals failing to achieve the learning criterion were further allowed a period of 3 hr during which they were left free to sleep, or were deprived of PS or of total sleep. Control rats were similarly treated, but were left in their home cages in the same training room during the period of acquisition. The results of correlative study among behavioral, sleep and biochemical variables demonstrate that the specific radioactivity of DNA in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and brainstem is correlated with several variables of postacquisition sleep, mostly SS parameters. The correlations depend on the previous waking experience of the rats. The data substantiate the two main consequences of the hypothesis, i.e., (1) the involvement of SS in brain information processing; and (2) the dependence of the operations performed by the sleeping brain on the nature of the previous waking experience. The results also provide some insight into the kind of processing which occurs in the sleeping brain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3174846/"}

While awake, acid clearance times of the two groups were equivalent. While asleep, mean acid clearance time increased in subjects with pathologic reflux greater than 500% while remaining essentially unchanged in symptomatic controls. No difference in minimum pH attained during sleep reflux, in percentage of swallows resulting in esophageal peristalsis, or in the frequency of secondary peristaltic waves was found to explain the difference in sleeping acid clearance times in the two groups. However, there was a significant difference between the groups with respect to swallowing rate (p less than 0.01). During sleeping reflux episodes, subjects with pathologic reflux swallowed 0.5 +/- 0.1 times per minute (mean +/- SEM), whereas controls who refluxed swallowed 3.5 +/- 1.3 times per minute. During awake reflux episodes the swallowing rates were equivalent in the two groups, 4.1 +/- 0.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.7 per minute, respectively.

We systematically reviewed associations between infant sleeping positions and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), explored sources of heterogeneity, and compared findings with published recommendations. By 1970, there was a statistically significantly increased risk of SIDS for front sleeping compared with back (pooled odds ratio (OR) 2.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15, 7.47), and by 1986, for front compared with other positions (five studies, pooled OR 3.00; 1.69-5.31). The OR for front vs the back position was reduced as the prevalence of the front position in controls increased. The pooled OR for studies conducted before advice changed to avoid front sleeping was 2.95 (95% CI 1.69-5.15), and after was 6.91 (4.63-10.32). Sleeping on the front was recommended in books between 1943 and 1988 based on extrapolation from untested theory. Advice to put infants to sleep on the front for nearly a half century was contrary to evidence available from 1970 that this was likely to be harmful. Systematic review of preventable risk factors for SIDS from 1970 would have led to earlier recognition of the risks of sleeping on the front and might have prevented over 10 000 infant deaths in the UK and at least 50 000 in Europe, the USA, and Australasia. Attenuation of the observed harm with increased adoption of the front position probably reflects a \"healthy adopter\" phenomenon in that families at low risk of SIDS were more likely to adhere to prevailing health advice. This phenomenon is likely to be a general problem in the use of observational studies for assessing the safety of health promotion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15843394/"}

Warming of the POAH increased local brain temperature by 1.4-3.7 degrees C and elicited thermal tachypnea (panting) during quiet sleep (QS). Following transition to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the tachypnea, initially induced by warming during QS, diminished, but respiratory rates remained above baseline REM levels, and an intermittent pattern of faster and slower breathing rates developed. In QS, tachypnea resulted primarily from a decline in inspiratory time (TI), whereas in REM sleep, reduction in expiratory time (TE) was more prominent. Although diaphragmatic electromyographic amplitude decreased by 40% during panting in QS, the much higher respiratory rates (+350%) resulted in apparent increases in relative ventilation and inspiratory drive. A less pronounced respiratory rate change (+46%) emerged during REM sleep, resulting in no significant changes in ventilation and inspiratory drive in response to warming in that state. The results suggest that descending thermal influences on respiratory patterning differ between QS and REM states in both overall respiratory rate and on relative TI and TE, and thus do not affect inspiratory drive exclusively.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7701176/"}

When the evoked alpha activity lasted for less than 30 sec and the subject slept again, the longer the evoked alpha activity, the longer the sleeping time span with the memory retention of the preceding stimulation. With equal durations of evoked alpha activity, retention of the stimulus was better when the sleep following was REM stage than when it was NREM stage (stage 2).

Normocapnia (end-tidal PCO2 = 44 +/- 1.2 Torr) was maintained throughout the trials. Inspiratory effort was completely inhibited during the period of sustained high VT and f, and apnea occurred immediately after cessation of the passive mechanical ventilation. The duration of the apnea preceding the first inspiratory effort was 20.3 +/- 2.3 s or 7.1 times the eupneic expiratory duration and 5 times the expiratory duration chosen by the subject during assist-control mechanical ventilation.

The most significant difference between working days and days off in terms of the mid-point of sleep (1.5 h) was observed in group I, where there was the greatest variability in the form of work performance. The participants who worked most of their time remotely (group III) shifted their bedtime to midnight, both on working days and on days off. The study highlights that increased remote computer use leads to a shift in sleeping patterns towards midnight. The participants with later midpoint of sleep hours were found to have a higher incidence of sleep disorders. The prevalence of sleep disorders was significantly impacted by prolonged mobile phone use before bedtime and long hours of computer use.

Defined as inactivity periods spanning 5 or more min, amounts of this sleep-like state are, as in mammals, sensitive to prior amounts of waking activity, time of day, and pharmacological intervention. Clearly recognizable changes in the pattern and amount of brain electrical activity accompany changes in motor activity and arousal thresholds originally used to identify mammalian sleeping behavior. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and/or local field potentials (LFPs) are now widely used to quantify sleep state amounts and define types of sleep. Thus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by EEG spindles and large-amplitude delta-frequency (0-3.5 Hz) waves. Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by irregular gamma-frequency cortical EEG patterns and rhythmic theta-frequency (5-9 Hz) hippocampal EEG activity. It is unknown whether rest and activity in Drosophila are associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates. To address this issue, we monitored motor activity levels and recorded LFPs in the medial brain between the mushroom bodies, structures implicated in the modulation of locomotor activity, of Drosophila. The results indicate that LFPs can be reliably recorded from the brains of awake, moving fruit flies, that targeted genetic manipulations can be used to localize sources of LFP activity, and that brain electrical activity of Drosophila is reliably correlated with activity state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12445387/"}

In hospital mothers put their children to bed later than at home. Indeed, the number of individuals going to bed between 9 and 10 p.m. decreased by 9.8% in hospital, while the number of children going to bed between 10 and 11 p.m. increased by 10.1%.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 538 school-going adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years, from 8 schools in 3 districts of Thiruvallur, Thiruppur and Namakkal selected through multistage sampling. A questionnaire with items focusing on demographic details, sleep patterns, sleep hygiene behaviour and daytime sleepiness was given to the students for self-administration after obtaining informed consent from their parents and school authorities. Over 64% of adolescents sleep <8 hours at night with 5.6% sleeping <6 hours. About 48% of adolescents suffered from prolonged sleep-onset latency and about 43% had interrupted sleep. Over 64% of adolescents watched television (TV) in bed and >23% reported use of mobile phone in bed. About 64% of adolescents had at least one form of poor sleep hygiene behaviour. Decreasing age (0.7; 95% CI 0.582-0.843), studying while lying in bed (1.72; 95% CI 1.009-2.942), greater time gap between dinner and bedtime (0.795; 95% CI 0.650-0.972), staying awake late in the night and chatting on mobile phone (2.24; 95% CI 1.266-3.978) and watching TV (3.41; 95% CI 2.037- 5.722) significantly influenced excessive daytime sleepiness.

Through convenience sampling, ICU nurses from three tertiary A-level hospitals in China were selected as research subjects from March to May 2024. A survey was conducted using a demographic data questionnaire, the PSQI scale, the DASS-21 scale, and the BPS scale, and the data on the sleep quality of ICU nurses was collected via electronic questionnaires. This research also utilized latent class analysis to examine the symptomatic traits of sleep quality in ICU nurses. Additionally, it applied univariate analysis and unordered multinomial logistic regression models to determine the factors influencing the various categories of their sleep quality. A total of 545 questionnaires were distributed, of which 522 were validly returned, yielding an effective response rate of 95.7%. Four potential sleep quality profiles were identified, including \"high sleep quality - no sleeping pills,\" \"medium sleep quality - low sleeping pills,\" \"medium sleep quality - medium sleeping pills,\" and \"low sleep quality - high sleeping pills,\" with proportions of 43.7%, 40.6%, 10.5%, and 5.2%, respectively. Unordered multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that the number of night shifts per week, marital status, BPS scores, FSS scores, and DASS-21 scores were key factors affecting the sleep quality classification of ICU nurses(P < 0.05). The sleep quality characteristics of ICU nurses are diverse and can be divided into four different categories. Therefore, nursing managers should be aware of this heterogeneity and take corresponding intervention measures based on the classification of nurses to ensure their sleep quality and promote psychological health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40355608/"}

Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as IVF and ICSI, provide hope for many, yet clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer remains around 35 %. Modifiable lifestyle factors, including sleep, may influence ART outcomes. However, the relationship between specific sleep characteristics and IVF/ICSI success is unclear. This study aims to explore the associations between sleep characteristics and various IVF/ICSI outcomes. Additionally, we investigated if perceived stress mediates these relationships. This prospective cohort study enrolled 174 women undergoing IVF/ICSI at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from December 2021 to December 2023. Prior to initial ART treatment, participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). IVF/ICSI outcomes such as the number of retrieved oocytes, matured oocytes, number of fertilized oocytes, fertilization rate, good-quality embryos, blastocyst formation rate and early pregnancy outcome (implantation and clinical pregnancy) were obtained from medical records. We employed multivariate generalized linear models to assess the associations between sleep characteristics and IVF/ICSI outcomes. Dose-response relationships between napping duration and maturation rate were analyzed using generalized additive models. Mediation analysis was used to assess the role of stress in the relationship between sleep characteristics and IVF/ICSI outcomes. Women reporting poor sleep quality had significantly fewer retrieved oocytes (-22.89 %, 95%CI: 37.82 %, -4.00 %) and matured oocytes (-22.01 %, 95%CI: 37.54 %, -2.62 %). Those sleeping ≥10 h per night had fewer retrieved oocytes (-30.68 %, 95%CI: 48.88 %, -6.00 %), matured oocytes (-27.17 %, 95%CI: 46.57 %, -0.73 %), and good-quality embryos (-45.64 %, 95%CI: 65.43 %, -14.51 %). Women experiencing difficulty falling asleep more than three times a week had a significant reduction in blastocyst rates (-64.40 %, 95 % CI: 85.55 %, -12.30 %). Those reporting difficulty falling asleep less than once a week had fewer retrieved oocytes (-28.89 %, 95%CI: 47.34 %, -3.98 %), and matured oocytes (-27.77 %, 95%CI: 46.90 %, -1.73 %). Napping exceeding 1 h daily was associated with a significantly lower oocyte maturation rate (-73.8 %, 95%CI: 88.91 %, -38.06 %). A significant non-linear dose-response relationship was observed between napping duration and maturation rate (p < 0.001), with maturation rates initially increasing slightly with short naps but declining significantly with longer naps, particularly beyond 1 h. This relationship was significant among women with good sleep quality (PSQI ≤5) (p < 0.001) and those with normal BMI (p = 0.0005). Perceived stress did not significantly mediate these associations. Our findings suggest that sleep characteristics, particularly poor quality, difficulty falling asleep, long sleep durations, negatively impact various IVF/ICSI outcomes. Longer daytime napping is inversely associated with oocyte maturation rates, especially among women with good sleep quality and normal BMI. Perceived stress did not appear to influence the relationship between sleep and IVF outcome. While optimizing sleep patterns may hold promise for improving IVF/ICSI success rates, it is essential to approach lifestyle guidance with caution, given the current limitations in confirming causative roles.

Adapting shift work schedules may reduce adverse occupational outcomes. To assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and eight other databases on 13 December 2020, and again on 20 April 2022, applying no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, including controlled before-after (CBA) trials, interrupted time series, and cross-over trials. Eligible trials evaluated any of the following shift schedule components. • Permanency of shifts • Regularity of shift changes • Direction of shift rotation • Speed of rotation • Shift duration • Timing of start of shifts • Distribution of shift schedule • Time off between shifts • Split shifts • Protected sleep • Worker participation We included studies that assessed sleep quality off-shift, sleep duration off-shift, or sleepiness during shifts. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the records recovered by the search, read through the full-text articles of potentially eligible studies, and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, with specific additional domains for non-randomised and cluster-randomised studies. For all stages, we resolved any disagreements by consulting a third review author. We presented the results by study design and combined clinically homogeneous studies in meta-analyses using random-effects models. We assessed the certainty of the evidence with GRADE. We included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. One study was conducted in a laboratory setting and was not considered for drawing conclusions on intervention effects. The included studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedule, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. Forward versus backward rotation Three CBA trials (561 participants) investigated the effects of forward rotation versus backward rotation. Only one CBA trial provided sufficient data for the quantitative analysis; it provided very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation compared with backward rotation did not affect sleep quality measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ; mean difference (MD) -0.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.28 to 1.89; 62 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (MD -0.21 hours, 95% CI -3.29 to 2.88; 62 participants). However, there was also very low-certainty evidence that forward rotation reduced sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Faster versus slower rotation Two CBA trials and one non-randomised cross-over trial (341 participants) evaluated faster versus slower shift rotation. We were able to meta-analyse data from two studies. There was low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality off-shift (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.23) and very low-certainty evidence that faster shift rotation reduced sleep duration off-shift (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.01; 2 studies, 282 participants). The SMD for sleep duration translated to an MD of 0.38 hours' less sleep per day (95% CI -0.74 to -0.01). One study provided very low-certainty evidence that faster rotations decreased sleepiness during shifts measured with the BNSQ (MD -1.24 points, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.24; 62 participants). Limited shift duration (16 hours) versus unlimited shift duration Two RCTs (760 participants) evaluated 80-hour workweeks with maximum daily shift duration of 16 hours versus workweeks without any daily shift duration limits. There was low-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit increased sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78; which translated to an MD of 0.73 hours' more sleep per day, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 760 participants) and moderate-certainty evidence that the 16-hour limit reduced sleepiness during shifts, measured with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.14; which translated to an MD of 0.37 fewer points, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.17; 2 RCTs, 716 participants). Shorter versus longer shifts One RCT, one CBA trial, and one non-randomised cross-over trial (692 participants) evaluated shorter shift duration (eight to 10 hours) versus longer shift duration (two to three hours longer). There was very low-certainty evidence of no difference in sleep quality (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.15; which translated to an MD of 0.13 points lower on a scale of 1 to 5; 2 studies, 111 participants) or sleep duration off-shift (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.54; which translated to an MD of 0.26 hours' less sleep per day; 2 studies, 121 participants). The RCT and the non-randomised cross-over study found that shorter shifts reduced sleepiness during shifts, while the CBA study found no effect on sleepiness. More compressed versus more spread out shift schedules One RCT and one CBA trial (346 participants) evaluated more compressed versus more spread out shift schedules. The CBA trial provided very low-certainty evidence of no difference between the groups in sleep quality off-shift (MD 0.31 points, 95% CI -0.53 to 1.15) and sleep duration off-shift (MD 0.52 hours, 95% CI -0.52 to 1.56). Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks had no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence was of very low-certainty. No evidence is available for other shift schedule changes. There is a need for more high-quality studies (preferably RCTs) for all shift schedule interventions to draw conclusions on the effects of shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37694838/"}

This oscillatory activity is believed to engage in memory consolidation although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Recently, it has been shown that UP-DOWN state transitions exhibit significantly different temporal profiles in different cortical regions, presumably reflecting differences in the underlying network structure. Here, we studied in computational models whether and how the connection configurations of cortical circuits determine the macroscopic network behavior during the slow-wave oscillation. Inspired by cortical neurobiology, we modeled three types of synaptic weight distributions, namely, log-normal, sparse log-normal and sparse Gaussian. Both analytic and numerical results suggest that a larger variance of weight distribution results in a larger chance of having significantly prolonged UP states. However, the different weight distributions only produce similar macroscopic behavior. We further confirmed that prolonged UP states enrich the variety of cell assemblies activated during these states. Our results suggest the role of persistent UP states for the prolonged repetition of a selected set of cell assemblies during memory consolidation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30013083/"}

Heart rate and peripheral skin temperature were higher in the prone position during both sleep states at both ages.

We analyzed sleep-wake transition probabilities, EEG spectra, and sleep spindle properties including density, dispersion, and slow oscillation phase coupling. The wake EEG similarity index (WESI) was determined using a machine learning algorithm analyzing the spectral profile of the EEG.

Based on the patterns of spontaneous brain and muscle activities, three characteristic vigilance states could be classified: awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). Spontaneous gamma activities prominently appeared under awake and PS states, but less under SWS. SEP was filtered out via a zero-phase highpass filter (20 Hz) to extract the gamma activity of the SEP (gammaSEP). Gamma oscillations of SEPs were clearly observed and were reset by extrinsic electrical stimulation under awake and PS, but not under SWS state. Dynamic changes of gammaSEPs during wake-sleep states were also confirmed by multiple single-trial spectral analyses. Moreover, gamma oscillations were initiated at the parietal site, and the speed of its propagation in both frontal and occipital directions was significantly different. In addition, a clear two-component architecture of SEPs was observed under awake and PS states, and the gamma rhythmic activity was associated with the second component. Because gamma oscillations are related to feature binding in the waking state, evoked gammaSEPs in PS may be related to sensory integration analogous to the awake ones. By contrast, a long-lasting biphasic component of SEPs, which might be associated with augmenting response, was observed during SWS. Based on these results, the sleeping brain continuously monitors and selectively processes incoming flow. Our results also strongly support a two-stage information processing taking place in the cortex during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12914976/"}

MAP and HR data were expressed as the percentage change from baseline, and responses were divided into initial, middle and late phases. In the supine position HUT usually resulted in an initial increase (P < 0.05) in HR and MAP, followed by decreases (P < 0.05) in HR and MAP in the middle phase; subsequently HR and MAP returned to baseline in the late phase. By contrast, in the prone position the initial HUT-induced rises in HR and MAP were usually absent, and at 2-3 mo MAP actually decreased (P < 0.05); subsequently HR but not MAP returned to baseline. At 2-3 mo, MAP was lower (P < 0.05) in prone than supine sleeping throughout the HUT. Prone sleeping alters MAP responses to a HUT during QS at 2-3 mo PNA.

Participants from the greater Boston area were recruited to participate in a 4-week walking intervention on a rolling basis between October 2015 and August 2016. Fifty-nine participants (72% female) were enrolled in the study, with an average age of 49.43 (±8.40) years.

Steps and active minutes were measured daily using a Fitbit Zip. Self-reports of sleep quality and duration were assessed daily, along with before and after the intervention. Averaged across the month, daily active minutes were positively related to sleep quality but not duration. Sex moderated this relationship; women who took more steps and were more active reported sleeping better than those less active. Within persons, on days that participants were more active than average, they reported better sleep quality and duration in both sexes. Results suggest that low-impact PA is positively related to sleep, more so in women than men.

In all infants, DC-EEG demonstrated that the typical delta frequency bursts are consistently embedded in very large amplitude (200-700 microV) and long lasting (1-5s) occipitally negative transients, which are not seen in conventional EEG. Our study demonstrates that (i) the most prominent spontaneous EEG activity of a sleeping preterm infant consists of very slow, large amplitude transients, and (ii) the most salient features of these transients are not seen in conventional EEG.

We then assessed creative performance using a set of three theme-related creativity tasks. Our findings show enhanced creative performance and greater semantic distance in task responses following a period of N1 sleep as compared to wake, corroborating recent work identifying N1 as a creative sweet spot and offering novel evidence for N1 enabling a cognitive state with greater associative divergence.

Pre-frailty and frailty were assessed using the modified version of the frailty phenotype developed by Fried and colleagues. Sleep was assessed by self-reported quality and duration. Multinomial and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between sleep quality, sleep duration, and physical frailty (including its components), as well as to explore the moderating effect of gender. 66.8% of older Indians were pre-frail, while 25.2% were frail. Relative to those with good sleep quality, older adults with poor sleep quality had significantly higher odds of frailty [AOR: 2.79; CI: 1.37-5.66]. Compared to those receiving the recommended age-appropriate 7-8 h of sleep, older adults sleeping ≥ 9 h reported a significantly lower likelihood of both pre-frailty [AOR: 0.73; CI: 0.57-0.93] and frailty [AOR: 0.68; CI: 0.51-0.91]. Analysis of specific components of frailty showed that older adults with long sleep had lower odds of exhaustion [AOR: 0.86; CI: 0.73-1.00] compared to those with age-appropriate sleep duration. Moreover, frailty was more pronounced in older men with poor sleep quality and short sleep duration (< 7 h/night) than in older women with similar sleep patterns. Poor sleep quality was not linked to any of the frailty components in older women; however, in older men, it was associated with exhaustion [AOR: 4.28; CI: 2.28-8.06], weak grip strength [AOR: 2.31; CI: 1.46-3.67], and low physical activity [AOR: 2.81; CI: 1.10-7.21]. The findings indicate potential associations between sleep quality, sleep quantity, and physical frailty among older Indians. Poor sleep quality was associated with frailty, yet long sleep duration was associated with a lower prevalence of frailty, independent of sleep quality. Moreover, the prevalence of frailty associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration was more pronounced among older Indian men than women, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to address sleep-related concerns in this demographic.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39529114/"}

Yet, for some animals, our ability to identify sleep can be masked by behaviors otherwise associated with being awake, such as for some sharks that must swim continuously to push oxygenated seawater over their gills to breathe. We know that sleep in buccal pumping sharks with clear rest/activity cycles, such as draughtsboard sharks (Cephaloscyllium isabellum, Bonnaterre, 1788), manifests as a behavioral shutdown, postural relaxation, reduced responsiveness, and a lowered metabolic rate. However, these features of sleep do not lend themselves well to animals that swim nonstop. In addition to video and accelerometry recordings, we tried to explore the electrophysiological correlates of sleep in draughtsboard sharks using electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography, and electrooculography, while monitoring brain temperature. The seven channels of EEG activity had a surprising level of (apparent) instability when animals were swimming, but also when sleeping. The amount of stable EEG signals was too low for replication within- and across individuals. Eye movements were not measurable, owing to instability of the reference electrode. Based on an established behavioral characterization of sleep in draughtsboard sharks, we offer the original finding that muscle tone was strongest during active wakefulness, lower in quietly awake sharks, and lowest in sleeping sharks. We also offer several critical suggestions on how to improve techniques for characterizing sleep electrophysiology in future studies on elasmobranchs, particularly for those that swim continuously. Ultimately, these approaches will provide important insights into the evolutionary confluence of behaviors typically associated with wakefulness and sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38957102/"}

Data on sociodemographic characteristics, past medical history, and pharmacological treatment were collected. Dementia was diagnosed using a comprehensive neurological and neuroradiological assessment. Older adults were interviewed by neuropsychologists trained in sleep disturbances in order to assess the presence of sleep complaints. Vital status was followed over 20 years until March 2020. Older male adults affected by insomnia and EDS were significantly more likely to die over the follow-up period. Indeed, males reporting poor sleep and daytime somnolence had a 60% and 48% higher chance of dying than subjects who were not affected by these sleep complaints, respectively. The HR was attenuated after adjusting for confounding variables among insomniacs, whereas that of somnolent men strengthened. Differently from men, insomnia and EDS did not have any impact on mortality in older women. In conclusion, older male adults affected by insomnia and EDS had a significant increased risk of mortality, which is independent of cancer, depression, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and sleeping pill use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32858331/"}

Sometimes, references to new learning occur relatively quickly, 1 day post-learning (day-residue effect); at other times there may be a substantive delay, 5-7 days, before such references appear (dream-lag effect). We studied temporal delays in dream reactivation following the learning of a virtual reality (VR) flying task using 10-day home sleep/dream logs, and how these might be influenced by targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Participants were exposed twice to a VR task in the sleep laboratory; once before and once after a 2-hr opportunity to nap (n = 65) or to read (n = 32). Auditory cues associated with the VR task were replayed in either wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS) or were not replayed. Although we previously showed that TMR cueing did not have an immediate effect on dream content, in the present study we extend these results by showing that TMR in sleep has instead a delayed effect on task-dream reactivations: participants dreamed more about the task 1-2 days later when TMR was applied in REM sleep and 5-6 days later when it was applied in SWS sleep, compared to participants with no cueing. Findings may help explain the temporal relationships between dream and memory reactivations and clarify the occurrence of day-residue and dream-lag phenomena.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34018262/"}

Due to the increasing number of elderly people in a hospital population, more data on energy requirements in this age-group are needed. In this study resting energy expenditure (REE) of 40 healthy men and women, aged 51-82 years, was measured using a ventilated hood system. The results showed that some commonly used prediction equations underestimated REE by approximately 6 per cent. REE was highly correlated with fat free mass (FFM) (r = 0.88; P less than 0.001) and body weight (r = 0.85; P less than 0.001). A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the combination of body weight, sex and age resulted in the best prediction for REE; REE (kcal) = 1641 + 10.7 weight (kg)--9.0 age (years)--203 sex (1 = male, 2 = female) (r = 0.92). However, REE of an individual may be over- or underestimated by +/- 225 kcal (10-20 per cent) due to large between-subject variations. We suggest therefore that the energy requirements of elderly people should be measured rather than predicted. Due to small within-subject variations (including measurement error) a single REE measurement would suffice. Sleeping energy expenditure (SEE) was 7 per cent lower than REE.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2269253/"}

A previous study suggested that the social isolation stress-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleep in mice was partly due to endogenous substances with an inverse BZD receptor agonist-like property. In this study, we examined the effects of DBI and ODN on pentobarbital sleep in group-housed and socially isolated mice to test the possible involvement of DBI and ODN in a social isolation-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleep. The socially isolated mice showed significantly shorter durations of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i. p.) sleep compared to the group-housed animals. When injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), DBI and ODN (3 and 10 nmol) dose-dependently shortened the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in group-housed mice at the same dose range, but these peptides had no effect on the sleeping time in socially isolated animals. In contrast, flumazenil (16.5-33 nmol, i.c.v.), a BZD receptor antagonist, reversed the pentobarbital sleeping time in socially isolated mice to the level of group-housed animals without affecting the sleeping time in group-housed animals. The effects of DBI and ODN in group-housed mice were significantly blocked by flumazenil (33 nmol, i.c.v.). Moreover, the effect of flumazenil in socially isolated mice was significantly attenuated by DBI and ODN (10 nmol, i.c.v.). These results suggest that the changes in the activity of DBI and/or ODN are partly involved in the social isolation-induced decrease in the hypnotic action of pentobarbital in mice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10353632/"}

While, the benefits of sleep both in terms of quantity and quality is widely recognized across species, sleep has a cost for organismal survival and reproduction. Here we focus on how sleep duration, sleep depth and sleep pressure affect the ability of animals to engage in courtship and egg-laying behaviors critical for reproductive success. Using isogenic lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel with variable sleep phenotypes we investigated the relationship between sleep and reproductive behaviors, courtship and oviposition. We found that three out of five lines with decreased sleep and increased arousal phenotypes, showed increased courtship and decreased latency to court as compared to normal and long sleeping lines. However, the male courtship phenotype is dependent on context and genotype as some but not all long sleeping-low courting lines elevate their courtship in the presence of short sleeping-high courting flies. We also find that unlike courtship, sleep phenotypes were less variable and minimally susceptible to social experience. In addition to male courtship, we also investigated egg-laying phenotype, a readout of female reproductive output and find oviposition to be less sensitive to sleep length and parameters that are indicative of switch between sleep and wake states. Taken together our extensive behavioral analysis here shows complex bidirectional interactions between genotype and environment and add to the growing evidence linking sleep duration and sleep-wake switch parameters to behavioral decision making critical to reproductive output.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34785379/"}

Additionally, extending sleep (eg, increasing nocturnal sleep time or adding a mid-day nap) has been shown to restore pain sensitivity to baseline levels in sleep deprived/restricted individuals. Whether sleep extension can reduce pain sensitivity beyond baseline levels in non-sleep restricted/deprived individuals remains unknown. In a sample of 27 healthy, pain-free, normally-sleeping individuals (17 males, mean age ∼24 yrs), we examined the impact of five nights of sleep extension on pain sensitivity. Pain threshold (elapsed time until the participant reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the participant kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured using the Cold Pressor Task. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which self-reported sleep amount in relation to the minimal subjective sleep requirement for adequate performance (sleep credit) was associated with pain sensitivity changes. On average individuals slept almost 2 extra hours per night. Our results indicate that sleep extension increases pain tolerance beyond baseline levels. However, sleep extension did not impact pain threshold. We also found that individuals with a smaller sleep credit (ie, those who habitually obtain less sleep than they feel they need) experienced greater increases in pain tolerance after extending sleep. The present findings suggest that sleep extension may increase pain tolerance but not pain threshold in healthy individuals who normally sleep the recommended amount. Our findings also support the idea that sleep credit may be a strong indicator of sleep debt in the context of pain sensitivity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30580190/"}

Sleep reduction as currently occurs in our 24/7 society has had a profound impact on sleep quality; the habitual sleep period should fit within what is a limited nighttime window and may not be sufficient to satisfy the whole sleep process; moreover, the use of artificial light during the evening and early night hours can delay and disturb the circadian rhythms, especially affecting REM sleep. The correct phase relationship of the sleep period with the circadian pacemaker is an important factor to guarantee adequate restorative sleep duration and sleep continuity, thus providing the necessary background for a good night's sleep. Due to the fact that REM sleep is controlled by the circadian clock, it can provide a window-like mechanism that defines the termination of the sleep period when there is still the necessity to complete the sleep process (not only wake-related homeostasis) and to meet the circadian end of sleep timing. An adequate amount of REM sleep appears necessary to guarantee sleep continuity, while periodically activating the brain and preparing it for the return to consciousness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948586/"}

The overlap of sleep with peak sensitivity to the phase-shifting effects of light minimizes the effectiveness of using light as a countermeasure to circadian misalignment in humans. Most current light exposure treatments for such misalignment are mostly ineffective due to poor compliance and secondary changes that cause sleep deprivation. Using a 16-day, parallel group design, we examined whether a novel sequence of light flashes delivered during sleep could evoke phase changes in the circadian system without disrupting sleep. Healthy volunteers participated in a 2-week circadian stabilization protocol followed by a 2-night laboratory stay. During the laboratory session, they were exposed during sleep to either darkness (n = 7) or a sequence of 2-msec light flashes given every 30 sec (n = 6) from hours 2 to 3 after habitual bedtime. Changes in circadian timing (phase) and micro- and macroarchitecture of sleep were assessed. Subjects exposed to the flash sequence during sleep exhibited a delay in the timing of their circadian salivary melatonin rhythm compared with the control dark condition (p < 0.05). Confirmation that the flashes penetrated the eyelids is presented by the occurrence of an evoked response in the EEG. Despite the robust effect on circadian timing, there were no large changes in either the amount or spectral content of sleep (p values > 0.30) during the flash stimulus. Exposing sleeping individuals to 0.24 sec of light spread over an hour shifted the timing of the circadian clock and did so without major alterations to sleep itself. While a greater number of matched subjects and more research will be necessary to ascertain whether these light flashes affect sleep, our data suggest that this type of passive phototherapy might be developed as a useful treatment for circadian misalignment in humans.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25227334/"}

Light is the strongest zeitgeber of circadian timing and, in adults, evening light produces circadian phase delay in an intensity-dependent manner. The intensity-dependent circadian phase-shifting response to evening light in children, however, is currently unknown. In the present study, 33 healthy, good-sleeping children aged 3.0 to 4.9 years (M = 4.14 years, 39% male) completed a 10-day between-subjects protocol. Following 7 days of a stable sleep schedule, an in-home dim-light circadian assessment was performed. Children remained in dim-light across 3 days (55 h), with salivary melatonin collected in regular intervals throughout each evening. Phase-shifting effects of light exposure were determined via changes in the timing of the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) prior to (Day 8) and following (Day 10) a light exposure stimulus. On Day 9, children were exposed to a 1 h light stimulus in the hour before their habitual bedtime. Each child was randomly assigned to one intensity between 5 and 5000 lux (4.5-3276 melanopic EDI). Across light intensities, children showed significant circadian phase delays, with an average phase delay of 56.1 min (SD = 33.6 min), and large inter-individual variability. No relationship between light intensity and magnitude of the phase shift was observed. However, a greater percentage of melatonin suppression during the light exposure was associated with a greater phase delay (<i>r</i> = -0.73, <i>p</i> < 0.01).

Data on sleep was gathered at 7 y and, considering bedtime and get-up time, total mean sleep duration was calculated and further categorized according to the 10th and 90th percentiles. Appetitive traits were assessed at 7 and 10 y using the parent-reported Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. Associations were tested through Generalized Linear Models (co-variates: child's sex; maternal age, education and pre-pregnancy body mass index at 7 y). At 10 y, associations were further adjusted for the respective appetitive trait at 7 y. Children slept a mean of 10.2 h/night, and 13% and 9% slept ≤9.5 and ≥ 11.0 h/night at 7 y, respectively. For each additional hour in sleep duration, children scored 0.078 (99%CI: -0.145; -0.011) lower on Food Responsiveness, 0.065 (99%CI: -0.129; -0.002) lower on Emotional Undereating and 0.096 (99%CI: -0.161; -0.032) lower on Food Fussiness. Lastly, children sleeping ≤9.5 h/night scored higher on Food Responsiveness (β = 0.145 99%CI: 0.020; 0.271); while those sleeping ≥11.0 h/night scored lower on Food Fussiness (β = -0.255 99%CI: -0.370; -0.079). No significant prospective associations were found. In conclusion, in 7 y children, sleep duration was cross-sectionally associated with lower scores on food approach (Food Responsiveness) and avoidant traits (Emotional Undereating and Food Fussiness). However, the magnitude of the associations was small and further studies are warranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38688409/"}

The anesthetic requirement of the recently identified Drosophila mutant minisleeper and other Drosophila mutants was investigated. Sleep and wakefulness were determined by measuring activity of individual wild-type and mutant flies. Based on the response of the flies at different concentrations of the volatile anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane, concentration-response curves were generated and EC50 values were calculated. The average amount of daily sleep in wild-type Drosophila (n = 64) was 965 +/- 15 min, and 1,022 +/- 29 in Na[har](P > 0.05; n = 32) (mean +/- SEM, all P compared to wild-type and other shaker alleles). Sh flies slept 584 +/- 13 min (n = 64, P < 0.01), Sh flies 412 +/- 22 min (n = 32, P < 0.01), and Sh flies 782 +/- 25 min (n = 32, P < 0.01). The EC50 values for isoflurane were 0.706 (95% CI 0.649 to 0.764, n = 661) and for sevoflurane 1.298 (1.180 to 1.416, n = 522) in wild-type Drosophila; 1.599 (1.527 to 1.671, n = 308) and 2.329 (2.177 to 2.482, n = 282) in Sh, 1.306 (1.212 to 1.400, n = 393) and 2.013 (1.868 to 2.158, n = 550) in Sh, 0.957 (0.860 to 1.054, n = 297) and 1.619 (1.508 to 1.731, n = 386) in Sh, and 0.6154 (0.581 to 0.649, n = 360; P < 0.05) and 0.9339 (0.823 to 1.041, n = 274) in Na[har], respectively (all P < 0.01).

In contrast, there is little information for genioglossus (GG) responses to a range of CO(2) stimuli across all sleep-wake states. Given the notion that sleep, especially rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, may cause greater suppression of muscles with both respiratory and nonrespiratory functions, this study tests the hypothesis that GG activity will be differentially affected by sleep-wake states with major suppression in REM sleep despite excitation by CO(2). Seven rats were chronically implanted with electroencephalogram, neck, GG, and diaphragm electrodes, and responses to 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9% CO(2) were recorded. Diaphragm activity and respiratory rate increased with CO(2) (P < 0.001) across sleep-wake states with significant increases at 3-5% CO(2) compared with 0% CO(2) controls (P < 0.05). Phasic GG activity also increased in hypercapnia but required higher CO(2) (7-9%) for significant activation (P < 0.05). Further studies in 15 urethane-anesthetized rats with the vagi intact (n = 6) and cut (n = 9) showed that intact vagi delayed GG recruitment with hypercapnia but did not affect diaphragm responses. In the naturally sleeping rats, we also showed that GG activity was significantly reduced in non-REM and REM sleep (P < 0.04) and was almost abolished in REM even with stimulation by 9% CO(2) (decrease = 80.4% vs. wakefulness). Such major suppression of GG activity in REM, even with significant respiratory stimulation, may explain why obstructive apneas are more common in REM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11796705/"}

Daily sleep and affect were measured over two school weeks and two vacation weeks (N = 205, 54.1% females, M ± SDage = 16.9 ± 0.87 years). Each day, participants wore actigraphs and self-reported the amount of sleep needed to function well the next day (i.e. perceived sleep need), sleep duration, and high- and low-arousal positive and negative affect (PA, NA). Cumulative perceived sleep debt was calculated as the weighted average of the difference between perceived sleep need and sleep duration over the past 3 days. Cross-lagged, multilevel models were used to test cumulative sleep debt as a predictor of next-day affect. Lagged affect, day of the week, study day, and sociodemographics were controlled. Perceived sleep need was lower early in the school week, before increasing in the second half of the week. Adolescents accumulated perceived sleep debt across school days and reduced it during weekends. On weekends and vacations, adolescents self-reported meeting their sleep need, sleeping the amount, or more than the amount of sleep they perceived as needing. Higher cumulative actigraphy sleep debt predicted higher next-day high arousal NA; higher cumulative diary sleep debt predicted higher NA (regardless of arousal), and lower low arousal PA the following day. Adolescents experienced sustained, cumulative perceived sleep debt across school days. Weekends and vacations appeared to be opportunities for reducing sleep debt. Trajectories of sleep debt during vacation suggested recovery from school-related sleep restriction. Cumulative sleep debt was related to affect on a daily basis, highlighting the value of this measure for future research and interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34323993/"}

Humans spend a third of their life sleeping, and the quality of sleep has been related to co-morbidity, Alzheimer disease, etc. Excessive wakefulness induces rapid changes in cognitive performances, and it is claimed that one could die of sleep deprivation as quickly as by absence of water. In this context, the fact that a few people are able to go without sleep for months, even years, without displaying any cognitive troubles requires explanations. Theories ascribing sleep to memory consolidation are unable to explain such observations. It is not the case of the theory of sleep as the hebbian reinforcement of the inhibitory synapses (ToS-HRIS). Hebbian learning (Long Term Depression - LTD) guarantees that an efficient inhibitory synapse will lose its efficiency just because it is efficient at avoiding the activation of the post-synaptic neuron. This erosion of the inhibition is replenished by hebbian learning (Long Term Potentiation - LTP) when pre and post-synaptic neurons are active together - which is exactly what happens with the travelling depolarization waves of the slow-wave sleep (SWS). The best documented cases of months-long insomnia are reports of patients with Morvan's syndrome. This syndrome has an autoimmune cause that impedes - among many things - the potassium channels of the post-synaptic neurons, increasing LTP and decreasing LTD. We hypothesize that the absence of inhibitory efficiency erosion during wakefulness (thanks to a decrease of inhibitory LTD) is the cause for an absence of slow-wave sleep (SWS), which results also in the absence of REM sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27515199/"}

Thus this study investigated the effect of three prevalent mother-infant sleeping arrangements, co-sleeping (CS), sleeping beyond arm's length from their mother (BAL), and solitary sleeping (SS), on infants' physiological calming through self-regulation during a nap session in 24 infants (50% female, M = 1.85 months SD = 0.93 months), who were identified as either regular co-sleepers with their mothers, infants who slept in the BAL sleeping arrangement from their mother, and infants who are solitary sleepers (SS). The effect of all three sleeping conditions amongst all the three types of infants with different habitual sleeping arrangements was assessed. All infants spent 10 min (2 × 5 min sessions) in each sleeping condition (CS, BAL, SS) during which electrocardiographic recordings were collected to obtain interbeat intervals (IBI) and rMSSD, a measure of heart rate variability (HRV) an index of physiological calming, maintained by the parasympathetic pathway involved in self-regulation. Infants who regularly co-slept with their mothers had the highest IBI, indicating greater physiological calming and self-regulation across all sleeping arrangement conditions (CS, BAL, SS), followed by infants who regularly slept in the BAL sleeping arrangement from their mothers. IBI was lowest amongst regular solitary sleepers, potentially indicating physiological stress due to mother-infant separation. However, HRV indices during the sleeping arrangements (especially across regular solitary sleepers) were inconclusive as to whether the lack of change in HRV across all sleeping conditions was due to physiological stress responses or greater physiological regulation. This study is the first to investigate the effect of manipulated and habitual mother-infant sleeping arrangements on infant physiological calming.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32199276/"}

Here we delineate neural and behavioural correlates of two stages of sleep in octopuses, marine invertebrates that evolutionarily diverged from vertebrates roughly 550 million years ago (ref. <sup>5</sup>) and have independently evolved large brains and behavioural sophistication. 'Quiet' sleep in octopuses is rhythmically interrupted by approximately 60-s bouts of pronounced body movements and rapid changes in skin patterning and texture<sup>6</sup>. We show that these bouts are homeostatically regulated, rapidly reversible and come with increased arousal threshold, representing a distinct 'active' sleep stage. Computational analysis of active sleep skin patterning reveals diverse dynamics through a set of patterns conserved across octopuses and strongly resembling those seen while awake. High-density electrophysiological recordings from the central brain reveal that the local field potential (LFP) activity during active sleep resembles that of waking. LFP activity differs across brain regions, with the strongest activity during active sleep seen in the superior frontal and vertical lobes, anatomically connected regions associated with learning and memory function<sup>7-10</sup>. During quiet sleep, these regions are relatively silent but generate LFP oscillations resembling mammalian sleep spindles<sup>11,12</sup> in frequency and duration.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of vigorous morning and evening exercise on objective and subjective sleep features in an ecological context. A total of 13 recreational runners (mean [SD] age 27.7 [7.2] years, four females) performed a 45-60 min run (70% maximal aerobic velocity) either in the MORNING (30 min to 2 h after waking-up) or in the EVENING (2 h to 30 min before sleep). The two exercise conditions were separated by a REST day. After each condition, sleep was objectively assessed using an electroencephalographic headband and subjectively using the Spiegel Sleep Inventory. Compared with REST, both MORNING and EVENING exercise increased the time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM, +24.9 min and +22.7 min; p = 0.01, η<sup>2</sup>  = 0.11, respectively).

No other effect of exercise on either objective or subjective sleep could be observed. Exercise, independently of the time at which it takes place, leads to extended NREM sleep without other effects on sleep quality.

As the rat ages during this early period, mean sleep and wake bout lengths gradually increase, though sleep and wake bouts remain exponentially distributed. Additionally, sleep and wake bouts are regulated independently of each other - alterations in the development of sleep (wake) bouts has no impact on the regulation wake (sleep) bouts. Sleep and wake bout behavior is associated with the activity of mutually inhibitory sleep-active and wake-active brainstem populations. In this work, I employ a simplified biophysical model of two mutually inhibitory populations consisting of ten integrate-and-fire neurons each and a noise-based switching mechanism. I show that such a noise-based switching mechanism naturally accounts for the experimentally observed features of sleep-wake switching during early infancy - random alternating activity bouts occur as a consequence of noise (provided inhibition is strong relative to excitation), bout durations are exponential (due to a lack of memory within the system), and cross-population inhibition or intrapopulation excitatory coupling provide mechanisms for changing and independently regulated sleep and wake bout means.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26802484/"}

Data were obtained from 29,818 black and white Americans (age range: 18-85 years) who participated in the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS uses a multistage area probability design sampling of non-institutionalized representatives of the US civilian population. Of the sample, 85% were white and 56% were women. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that individuals sleeping < 6 h were 3.55 times more likely than those sleeping 6-8 h to be functionally impaired (34% vs 13%; p < 0.001). Likewise, those sleeping > 8 h were 3.77 times more likely to be functionally impaired (36% vs 13%; p < 0.001). Individuals of the black race/ethnicity were more likely to be functionally impaired than their white counterparts (23% vs 19%; p < 0.001). Multivariate-adjusted regression analyses showed significant interactions between individuals' race/ethnicity and short sleep with respect to functional capacity (black: OR = 2.78, p < 0.0001; white: OR = 2.30, p < 0.0001). Significant interactions between race/ethnicity and long sleep were also observed (black: OR = 2.43, p < 0.001; white: OR = 2.63, p < 0.001).

Against this backdrop, we embarked on this study to determine the Pattern of Sleep Health among patients attending the Adult Neurology clinic in a Federal Teaching Hospital, in Abakaliki, Nigeria. This is a cross-sectional observational hospital-based study undertaken at the Adult Neurology clinic of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, Nigeria from July to September 2022. Out of the 267 patients recruited for the study, 19% had good sleep health with SATED scores of 8 to 10 while 81% had poor sleep health. The absence of alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking, and neurological diagnosis were statistically associated with poor sleep health with no sex and age predilection. The mean sleep duration was 7.5± 1.5 hours (male = 7.6 hours, female = 7.3 hours, 18- 64 years= 7.4 hours, ≥ 65 years =7.9 hours). Timing of sleep (mean= 0.97) was the least rated while sleep satisfaction (mean= 1.54) was the best-rated sleep dimension.

{"id": "39018188", "title": "Memory's gatekeeper: The role of PFC in the encoding of congruent events.", "text": "Theoretical models conventionally portray the consolidation of memories as a slow process that unfolds during sleep. According to the classical Complementary Learning Systems theory, the hippocampus (HPC) rapidly changes its connectivity during wakefulness to encode ongoing events and create memory ensembles that are later transferred to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during sleep. However, recent experimental studies challenge this notion by showing that new information consistent with prior knowledge can be rapidly consolidated in PFC during wakefulness and that PFC lesions disrupt the encoding of congruent events in the HPC. The contributions of the PFC to memory encoding have therefore largely been overlooked. Moreover, most theoretical frameworks assume random and uncorrelated patterns representing memories, disregarding the correlations between our experiences. To address these shortcomings, we developed a HPC-PFC network model that simulates interactions between the HPC and PFC during the encoding of a memory (awake stage), and subsequent consolidation (sleeping stage) to examine the contributions of each region to the consolidation of novel and congruent memories. Our results show that the PFC network uses stored memory \"schemas\" consolidated during previous experiences to identify inputs that evoke congruent patterns of activity, quickly integrate it into its network, and gate which components are encoded in the HPC. More specifically, the PFC uses GABAergic long-range projections to inhibit HPC neurons representing input components correlated with a previously stored memory \"schema,\" eliciting sparse hippocampal activity during exposure to congruent events, as it has been experimentally observed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39018188/"}

They have direct connections to the main circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and modulate a variety of physiological processes, pineal melatonin secretion, autonomic functions, cognitive processes such as attention, and behavior, including sleep and wakefulness. This is because efferent projections from the SCN reach other hypothalamic nuclei, the pineal gland, thalamus, basal forebrain, and the brainstem. The ipRGCs also directly impact the prefrontal cortex and the perihabenular nucleus (mood). In particular, light suppresses the secretion of melatonin in a dose-dependent manner, mainly depending on irradiance and spectral composition of light. There is evidence that exposure to light-emitting devices from luminaires and screens before bedtime can impact on sleep onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep quality. Likewise, light exposure during daytime modulates sleep architecture, duration, and sleep quality during the subsequent night. Therefore, the integration of acute, circadian, and long-term effects of light together influence sleep-wake quality and behavior in healthy individuals, as well as in patients with psychiatric or medical disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39864930/"}

Sleep impairment is a frequent condition in patients with epilepsy (PWE), and the relation between sleep and epilepsy has been considered bidirectional, as one can significantly influence the other, and vice versa. The orexin system was described more than 20 years ago and is implicated in several neurobiological functions other than in controlling the sleep-wake cycle. Considering the relation between epilepsy and sleep, and the significant contribution of the orexin system in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, it is conceivable that the orexin system may be affected in PWE. Preclinical studies investigated the impact of the orexin system on epileptogenesis and the effect of orexin antagonism on seizures in animal models. Conversely, clinical studies are few and propose heterogeneous results also considering the different methodological approaches to orexin levels quantification (cerebrospinal-fluid or blood samples). Because orexin system activity can be modulated by sleep, and considering the sleep impairment documented in PWE, the recently approved dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) have been suggested for treating sleep impairment and insomnia in PWE. Accordingly, sleep improvement can be a therapeutic strategy for reducing seizures and better managing epilepsy. The present review analyzes the preclinical and clinical evidence linking the orexin system to epilepsy, and hypothesizes a model in which the antagonism to the orexin system by DORAs can improve epilepsy by both a direct and a sleep-mediated (indirect) effect.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37212716/"}

Thematic analysis was used to identify conceptual themes. Three main themes were identified. First, patient education is necessary but not sufficient. Patients recommended multiple outreach attempts through multiple channels to motivate tired and overwhelmed insomnia patients to engage with CBT-I. Second, patients gravitated toward a stepped-care approach. Most would start with self-management CBT-I tools, moving on to provider-delivered CBT-I if needed.

As ventilation increased during progressive chemoreceptor stimulation, inspiratory activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, a laryngeal abductor, and of the cricothyroid muscle were augmented. When expiratory flow rates reached 2-3 times resting levels, both of these muscles were also active during expiration and recruitment of the internal intercostal muscles was observed. The thyroarytenoid muscle, a laryngeal adductor, was active only rarely and no consistent activation of this muscle was observed with either hypercapnia or hypoxia. The patterns of muscle activation in response to respiratory stimulation were not different during wakefulness, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. The results indicate that the laryngeal muscles are activated during hypercapnia and hypoxia in a manner which reduces both inspiratory and expiratory airflow resistance regardless of sleep-wakefulness state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3797847/"}

Because humans spend about one-third of their life sleeping, we hypothesized that distinct shoulder positions while sleeping may considerably influence nocturnal subacromial pressures. Consequently, atrophy and rupture can affect tendon healing after rotator cuff repair, thus potentially discrediting the outcome of surgery. We determined the subacromial pressures acting on the rotator cuff in the 4 most common sleep positions and related these pressures to the mean arterial blood pressure and physical examination findings in 20 healthy volunteers. Subacromial pressures were significantly lower in participants sleeping preferably in a supine position than in participants sleeping in side or prone positions (P < .005). As tendon perfusion is crucial for tendon-to-bone healing during postoperative physical therapy after rotator cuff reconstruction and for prevention of additional damage to healthy or already torn cuffs, potential clinical relevance may emerge from the present study. Distinct shoulder positions considerably influence subacromial pressures. Our findings may be considered in physiotherapeutic concepts after rotator cuff surgery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20656524/"}

Basic research on sleep apnea using experimental animals may help further understanding and prevention of SIDS because the syndrome is thought as inability to wake up from respiratory arrest (apnea) during sleep. Although several animal models of sleep apnea have been described previously, mice would be useful experimental animals in that these animals are frequently used in genetic engineering. Those considerations prompted us to establish a method for measuring ventilation of mice concomitantly with electroencephalography and electromyography for assessing sleep-wake states. Normal wild-type mice developed two types of central sleep apneas (CSA), that is, post-sigh and spontaneous apneas, as normal humans do. Moreover, post-sigh apneas in mice were observed exclusively during slow-wave sleep (SWS) while spontaneous apneas were seen in both SWS and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These characteristics are very similar to those of sleep apneas in healthy human infants and children. Therefore, mice seem to be a promising experimental animal model for studying the genetic and molecular basis of respiratory regulation and dysregulation during sleep in humans, especially infants and children. However, we should keep in mind limitations in studying mice as an animal model of SIDS, since they are nocturnal rodents and they sleep in the prone position.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14693402/"}

Patients were evaluated in a sleep laboratory on 2 separate nights, lying flat 1 night and lying on a wedge pillow at a 20-degree head-up position another night. Baseline IOP was measured during the awake period (10 PM), then measured at 2-hour intervals during the sleep period (12, 2, 4, and 6 AM). IOP measurements during the 10 PM awake period did not significantly differ between the 2 positions (P=0.55). During the sleep period (12 to 6 AM), the mean IOP was 1.51 mm Hg lower in the 20-degree head-up position when compared with the flat position (95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 2.04 mm Hg), with an average drop of 1.56 and 1.47 mm Hg in glaucoma and nonglaucoma patients, respectively. This corresponds to a 9.33% and 8.67% IOP reduction in glaucoma and nonglaucoma patients, respectively. Twenty-five of 30 patients (83.3%) had lower mean IOPs in the 20-degree head-up position.

The response, which is widespread in birds and mammals, is characterized by apnea and bradycardia with circulatory changes as seen during the forced diving response. Upon stimulation, two respiratory responses were elicited: apnea preceded by irregular respiration or simple irregular respiration. Apnea was elicited in 58% of stimulations at ages 8-16 weeks compared to 14% at 28-50 weeks. The mean duration of apnea decreased from 7.8 s (+/- 1.8 s) at 8-13 weeks to 4.7 s (+/- 1.1 s) at 17-20 weeks. The preceding irregular respiration increased from 5.3 s (+/- 4.4 s) to 10.6 s (+/- 5.4 s) at the same ages. The heart rate response was biphasic and were interpreted as the orienting response. The mean deceleration in relation to apnea was 16% at 8-16 weeks and was reduced to 8% at 28-50 weeks. Infants of smoking mothers were more prone to respond with apnea than infants of non-smoking mothers (73% versus 38%). REM sleep and long postprandial sleep time increased the probability of apnea response (62% versus 38% and 66% versus 35%).

It is known that EEPV consists of many active components including triterpenoid (ursolic acid and oleanolic acid), which have many biological activities. Therefore, we evaluated which EEPV components induced sleep extension in pentobarbital-mediated sleeping model in mice. Surprisingly, despite their structural similarity and other common functions such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and tissue protection, only ursolic acid enhanced sleep duration in pentobarbital-treated mice.

Participants were continuously recorded with polysomnography and allowed to sleep for a maximum of 2 hr. Mentation reports were classified according to both their complexity (1-6 scale) and their perceived timing of occurrence (Recent or Previous Mentation with respect to the final awakening). The results showed a good level of mentation recall, including different types of mentation with lab-related stimuli. N1 + N2 duration was positively related to the complexity of Previous Mentation recall, while rapid eye movement sleep duration was negatively related. This suggests that the recall of complex mentation, such as dreaming with a plot, occurring far from awakening may depend on the length of N1 + N2. However, the duration of sleep stages did not predict the complexity of Recent Mentation recall. Nevertheless, 80% of participants who recalled Recent Mentation had a rapid eye movement sleep episode. Half of the participants reported incorporating lab-related stimuli in their mentation, which positively correlated with both N1 + N2 and rapid eye movement duration. In conclusion, nap sleep architecture is informative about the complexity of dreams perceived as having occurred early during the sleep episode, but not about those perceived as recent.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37139546/"}

Participants were randomized to receive 3 consecutive nights of sleep continuity disruption via forced nocturnal awakenings (FA, n = 21), or one of two control conditions: restricted sleep opportunity (RSO, n = 17) or uninterrupted sleep (US, n = 24). The study was set in an inpatient clinical research suite. Healthy, good-sleeping men and women were included. Polysomnography was used to measure sleep architecture, and mood was assessed via self-report each day. Compared to restricted sleep opportunity controls, forced awakenings subjects had significantly less slow wave sleep (P < 0.05) after the first night of sleep deprivation, and significantly lower positive mood (P < 0.05) after the second night of sleep deprivation. The differential change in slow wave sleep statistically mediated the observed group differences in positive mood (P = 0.002). To our knowledge, this is the first human experimental study to demonstrate that, despite comparable reductions in total sleep time, partial sleep loss from sleep continuity disruption is more detrimental to positive mood than partial sleep loss from delaying bedtime, even when controlling for concomitant increases in negative mood.

Whilst the etiology of preterm brain injury is complex, impairments in the cardio- and cerebro-vascular function have been implicated. During infancy, sleep is vital for brain development. However, instabilities in cardio- and cerebro-vascular function are most marked during sleep. Sleeping position is an important part of a safe sleeping environment. Prone sleeping increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and is associated with reduced blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation and impaired autonomic cardiovascular control in infants born at term. Importantly, these effects are amplified by preterm birth. Hospitalized preterm infants are often slept in the prone position to improve respiratory function. However, there is little consensus regarding the sustained benefits of prone sleeping in this population. In light of the impaired cardio- and cerebro-vascular function during prone sleeping in term and preterm infants after hospital discharge, the likely adverse effects of prone sleeping in hospitalized preterm infants are concerning.

Modifiable risk factors such as prone sleeping position, nicotine exposure and thermal stress and non-avoidable risk factors like male gender and some risky socio-economic conditions could be detected, but the etiology of SIDS remains unknown. In many SIDS cases histopathological findings suggest an involvement of vital autonomic control functions and unidentified trigger factors seem to play a role. From a hypothetical point of view, a developmental sympatheticovagal imbalance of the cardiovascular reflex control could cause a predisposition for SIDS. An assumed gastroesophageal trigger impulse is possibly developed during the first weeks of life and could lead to the infant's vagal reflex death. Air swallowed during feeding escapes through the esophagus while the infant is sleeping. The temporarily bloated esophagus exerts pressure on neighboring mediastinal baroreceptors, which is potentially misinterpreted as a rise in arterial pressure. The following cardiodepressoric baroreceptor reflex could lead to arterial hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Sleeping in prone position may create an increased thoracic pressure on mediastinal baroreceptors, causing a more pronounced vagal reflex and an increased likelihood of SIDS. Prone position in connection with soft objects in the infant's sleeping environment potentially generates an increased oculobulbar pressure, resulting in an additional cardiodepressoric condition (Aschner-Dagnini phenomenon). From the sixth month of life onwards the sympatheticovagal balance seems to have matured sufficiently to compensate the life-threatening challenges in most infants. Insufficient postprandial burping could either create another independent modifiable risk factor or present the missing link to a common trigger mechanism for SIDS. Further investigations may possibly lead to the explicit recommendation to burp all infants sufficiently and repeatedly before sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17145140/"}

A lack of ventilatory response to systemic boluses of sodium cyanide during carotid body perfusion demonstrated isolation of the perfused carotid body and lack of other significant peripheral chemosensitivity. Four additional dogs were carotid body denervated and exposed to whole body hypoxia for comparison. In the sleeping dog with an intact and perfused carotid body exposed to specific CNS hypoxia, we found the following. 1) CNS hypoxia for 5-25 min resulted in modest but significant hyperventilation and hypocapnia (minute ventilation increased 29 +/- 7% at arterial PO(2) = 38 Torr); carotid body-denervated dogs showed no ventilatory response to hypoxia. 2) The hyperventilation was caused by increased breathing frequency. 3) The hyperventilatory response developed rapidly (<30 s). 4) Most dogs maintained hyperventilation for up to 25 min of hypoxic exposure. 5) There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. We conclude that specific CNS hypoxia, in the presence of an intact carotid body maintained normoxic and normocapnic, does not depress and usually stimulates breathing during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

Out of the five applied experimental situations, two (psychostimulant application and sensory stimulation) resulted in a shift of the balance between the systems of sleep and arousal towards an increased activity of the arousal system, while an other condition (rebound following partial sleep deprivation) led to an opposite change to a rise in \"sleep pressure\". An inverse correlation has been found between the frequency of MA and the depth of sleep, a finding consistently observed in every subject and in every experimental situation. During the process of sleep periodic changes in the dispersity of MA could be seen; the number of MA-s decreased and increased according to the descending and ascending slope of the sleep cycles. During the ascending slope of cycles there was a coupling between the occurence of MA-s and the changes of phases. Increases in the level of activation and in sleep pressure did not influence the occurrence of MA-s. Increasing the tone of the arousal system in chemical way, or by means of enhancing the phasic sensory input resulted in a reduction of the difference between the number of MA on the descending and ascending slopes of cycles. During the phases of sleep, the spontaneous occurrence of MA-s went parallel with the possibility to evoke MA-s by sensory stimuli. These data show that MA is a regular phenomenon of nocturnal sleep; MA manifests itself as a result of phasic functioning of the reticular arousal system and plays a role in the organization of those periods of the sleep cycle, which tend toward arousal. It is suggested that MA-phenomenon is considered a standard measure of sleep and that it could represent an indicator of the function of the arousal system controlled by external or internal mechanisms during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/232612/"}

The nonverbal nature of the olfactory sniff response, in which pleasant odors drive stronger sniffs and unpleasant odors drive weaker sniffs, allowed us to test learning in humans during sleep. Using partial-reinforcement trace conditioning, we paired pleasant and unpleasant odors with different tones during sleep and then measured the sniff response to tones alone during the same nights' sleep and during ensuing wake. We found that sleeping subjects learned novel associations between tones and odors such that they then sniffed in response to tones alone. Moreover, these newly learned tone-induced sniffs differed according to the odor pleasantness that was previously associated with the tone during sleep. This acquired behavior persisted throughout the night and into ensuing wake, without later awareness of the learning process. Thus, humans learned new information during sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22922782/"}

In all three groups the numbers failing to arouse after 240 s (FTA-240) in QS were significantly greater than those in AS. After 2 months of age all groups showed a decrease in the number FTA-240 in AS, whereas in QS the number did not change significantly. Subsequent siblings of SIDS had a significantly higher number FTA-240 in QS than controls. There was no significant difference in FTA-240 in QS between controls and infant apnoeas, although there was a trend for this to be higher in subsequent siblings of SIDS than infant apnoeas. It was concluded that arousal from AS is more marked than from QS, that after 2 months of age the ability to arouse from AS increases, and that in relation to SIDS, QS is the sleep state in which the infant is less able to arouse. Furthermore, subsequent siblings of SIDS differ from normal infants in their ability to arouse from QS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3729822/"}

We present the technique of sleep nasendoscopy which allows direct visualization of the site or sites of obstruction in a sleeping patient. Our study has shown that there are patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in whom the only site of pharyngeal obstruction is at the velopharynx. These patients should do well with the relatively simple procedure of UVPP. This is not true for many other OSAS patients in whom we found that obstruction was multisegmental.

Throughout the night a specific number of sleep stages that are repeatedly changing in various periods of time take place. These specific time intervals and specific sleep stages are very important for the wake up event. It is far more difficult to wake up during the deep NREM (2-4) stage of sleep because the rest of the body is still sleeping. On the other hand if we wake up during the mild (REM, NREM1) sleep stage it is a much more pleasant experience for us and for our bodies. This problem led the authors to undertake this study and develop a Windows Mobile-based device application called wakeNsmile. The wakeNsmile application records and monitors the sleep stages for specific amounts of time before a desired alarm time set by users. It uses a built-in microphone and determines the optimal time to wake the user up. Hence, if the user sets an alarm in wakeNsmile to 7:00 and wakeNsmile detects that a more appropriate time to wake up (REM stage) is at 6:50, the alarm will start at 6:50. The current availability and low price of mobile devices is yet another reason to use and develop such an application that will hopefully help someone to wakeNsmile in the morning. So far, the wakeNsmile application has been tested on four individuals introduced in the final section.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22163941/"}

Participants who completed sleep questionnaires were examined by dentists using standardized clinical criteria. Analysis was limited to Individuals aged ≥ 16 years with complete clinical oral examination data and who completed the sleep questionnaire (N = 5,205). The data were weighted to provide a national estimate, and multiple potential covariates were included in the analysis to account for the complex sample design. The main outcomes of the study were untreated dental caries and dental caries experience. The main predictor variables were average sleep hours/night and a binary variable with 7 h/night as a cut off. Multiple weighted Poisson and logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that people with short sleep duration are more likely to exhibit dental caries. This study showed a statistically significant negative relationship between sleep duration and dental caries amongst all weighted adjusted analyses conducted. For a one hour increase in average sleep hours, the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) of having a dental caries experience might decrease by 0.86 (AOR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75-0.98, P < 0.05).

The survey items of the questionnaire concerned living environment, sleep status, subjective mental health (depressive mood, anxiety, low motivation, irritability) and sleep-related lifestyle. At first, we compared these items between primiparas and multiparas. Next, multiple regression analysis by a general linear model was used to investigate the association between sleep status and mental health. The dependent variables were sleep satisfaction, total sleep time, the existence of sleep problems (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early), irregularity of bedtime, and five kinds of sleep-related lifestyle. The independent variables were the four mental health indices according to a visual analog scale.Results　In primiparas, total sleep time was shorter, bedtime and sleeping time were later, two kinds of sleep-related lifestyle were worse, and the symptoms of tinnitus and tired feeling were higher than in multiparas. In multiparas, sleep onset latency was longer, the number of times of night awakening was higher, irritability was stronger, and the prevalence of headache was higher than in primiparas. Sleep satisfaction was related to all four indices of mental health for both primiparas and multiparas. In primiparas, the existence of sleep problems was related to depressive mood and anxiety, and the irregularity of bedtime was related to anxiety. \"Getting up immediately after awakening\" was related to irritability, as well as low motivation, in multiparas. \"A nap shorter than 30 minutes before 3 PM\" was related to anxiety and low motivation in primiparas. The irregularity of bedtime was negatively related to anxiety, low motivation, and irritability in multiparas.Conclusion　It is suggested that sleep problems, which tend to be overlooked, are related to subjective mental health at one month postpartum. Thus, we conclude that sleep education during pregnancy and sleep evaluations at postpartum check-ups are necessary for postpartum women's mental health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30518703/"}

Saliva samples from six healthy male volunteers were analysed for concentrations of CA VI throughout the 24 h period by means of a specific time-resolved immunofluorometric assay and the levels were compared with amylase activity. The sleeping period was from 00.10 h to 07.30 h and the subjects had breakfast at 07.30 h and regular meals at 13.30 h and 19.30 h. Saliva secretion decreased markedly during the sleeping period in all the subjects except one. The levels of both CA VI and amylase activity varied greatly among the subjects, but in a parallel manner, and declined to a very low level during the sleeping period. Dexamethasone intake at midnight had no effect on the morning rise in either enzyme. When the sleeping period was postponed from 06.10 h to 11.30 h both enzyme concentrations declined during the night and continued to be low until the subjects awoke at 11.30 h, whereas salivary secretion was low only during the sleeping period. Our results suggest that CA VI secretion follows a circadian periodicity that is comparable to amylase secretion but independent of salivary secretion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7572216/"}

This effect is mediated in part by a modulation of the hippocampus by the amygdala. Sleep plays a role in the consolidation of declarative memory. We examined the impact of sleep and lack of sleep on the consolidation of emotional (negative and positive) memories at the macroscopic systems level. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we compared the neural correlates of successful recollection by humans of emotional and neutral stimuli, 72 h after encoding, with or without total sleep deprivation during the first post-encoding night. In contrast to recollection of neutral and positive stimuli, which was deteriorated by sleep deprivation, similar recollection levels were achieved for negative stimuli in both groups. Successful recollection of emotional stimuli elicited larger responses in the hippocampus and various cortical areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, in the sleep group than in the sleep deprived group. This effect was consistent across subjects for negative items but depended linearly on individual memory performance for positive items. In addition, the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex were functionally more connected during recollection of either negative or positive than neutral items, and more so in sleeping than in sleep-deprived subjects. In the sleep-deprived group, recollection of negative items elicited larger responses in the amygdala and an occipital area than in the sleep group. In contrast, no such difference in brain responses between groups was associated with recollection of positive stimuli. The results suggest that the emotional significance of memories influences their sleep-dependent systems-level consolidation. The recruitment of hippocampo-neocortical networks during recollection is enhanced after sleep and is hindered by sleep deprivation. After sleep deprivation, recollection of negative, potentially dangerous, memories recruits an alternate amygdalo-cortical network, which would keep track of emotional information despite sleep deprivation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17958471/"}

Mapping the occurrence of sleep across individuals within a society could offer clues as to functional aspects of sleep. In spite of this, a detailed spatial analysis of sleep has never been conducted on an invertebrate society. We introduce the concept of mapping sleep across an insect society, and provide an empirical example, mapping sleep patterns within colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Honey bees face variables such as temperature and position of resources within their colony's nest that may impact their sleep. We mapped sleep behavior and temperature of worker bees and produced maps of their nest's comb contents as the colony grew and contents changed. By following marked bees, we discovered that individuals slept in many locations, but bees of different worker castes slept in different areas of the nest relative to position of the brood and surrounding temperature. Older worker bees generally slept outside cells, closer to the perimeter of the nest, in colder regions, and away from uncapped brood. Younger worker bees generally slept inside cells and closer to the center of the nest, and spent more time asleep than awake when surrounded by uncapped brood. The average surface temperature of sleeping foragers was lower than the surface temperature of their surroundings, offering a possible indicator of sleep for this caste. We propose mechanisms that could generate caste-dependent sleep patterns and discuss functional significance of these patterns.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25029445/"}

Studies of disease mechanisms in females therefore lack critical information regarding estrous cycle influences on relevant sleep characteristics. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from multiple brain regions to assess sleep states as well as sleep traits such as spectral power and interregional spectral coherence in freely cycling females across the estrous cycle and compared with males. Our findings show that the high hormone phase of proestrus decreases the amount of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increases the amount of time spent awake compared with other estrous phases and to males. This spontaneous sleep deprivation of proestrus was followed by a sleep rebound in estrus which increased NREM and REM sleep. In proestrus, spectral power increased in the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and the gamma (30-60 Hz) ranges during NREM sleep, and increased in the theta range (5-9 Hz) during REM sleep during both proestrus and estrus. Slow-wave activity (SWA) and cortical sleep spindle density also increased in NREM sleep during proestrus. Finally, interregional NREM and REM spectral coherence increased during proestrus. This work demonstrates that the estrous cycle affects more facets of sleep than previously thought and reveals both sex differences in features of the sleep-wake cycle related to estrous phase that likely impact the myriad physiological processes influenced by sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31784755/"}

An investigation in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris).", "text": "Studies with humans and some other animal species have shown that sleep is compromised when the presence of external factors such as light, sound, and temperature surpass normal levels. This study investigated the effects of these environmental conditions on 13 kennelled laboratory dogs, assessing whether each variable interfered with their sleep behaviour and/or increased stress responses, which could further compromise sleep quality. The behaviour of dogs was video recorded for eight months. Diurnal and nocturnal behaviour were recorded, along with naturally occurring levels of temperature, light and sound in the dogs' kennel environment. Faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM), from samples collected every morning, were used to monitor the dogs' adrenocortical activity. GLMM models and non-parametric tests were conducted to evaluate the relationship between sleeping patterns, environmental variables, and stress on the studied dogs. Nocturnal sleep decreased in response to increases in temperature and in day light duration. No effects of sound and FCM levels on dogs' sleep were observed. However, diurnal sleep was affected by sound and FCM levels, decreasing when both factors increased. Additionally, noisier days increased stress responses, especially in male dogs. Increased FCM levels were associated with changes in the diurnal behaviour of dogs; for example, decreased activity. The decrease in daily activities and increased physiological stress responses could be associated with maladaptation to the environment, which could indicate poor welfare. Our study suggests that mitigating the impact of environmental conditions in the kennels could improve sleep quality and the overall quality of life of the dogs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35644428/"}

Research suggests that short sleep duration and poor sleep quality lead to poor female sexual response. However, prior research consists of cross-sectional studies, and the influence of sleep on sexual functioning and behavior has not been prospectively examined. We sought to examine the influence of nightly sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep onset latency on daily female sexual response and activity. This study used a longitudinal design to study 171 women free of antidepressants and with reliable Internet access who were recruited from a university setting in the United States. Participants first completed baseline measures in a laboratory, and then completed web-delivered surveys at their habitual wake time for 14 consecutive days. All outcome measures were modified for daily recall. Participants completed the Profile of Female Sexual Function's desire, subjective arousal, and orgasmic functioning scales and the Female Sexual Function Index's genital arousal scale, and indicated whether they engaged in partnered sexual activity or self-stimulation in response to dichotomous items. Analyses revealed that longer sleep duration was related to greater next-day sexual desire (b = 0.32, P = 0.02), and that a 1-hour increase in sleep length corresponded to a 14% increase in odds of engaging in partnered sexual activity (odds ratio = 1.14, P < 0.05). In contrast, sleeping longer predicted poorer next-day genital arousal (b = -0.19, P < 0.01). However, results showed that women with longer average sleep duration reported better genital arousal than women with shorter average sleep length (b = 0.54, P = 0.03). Obtaining sufficient sleep is important to the promotion of healthy sexual desire and genital response, as well as the likelihood of engaging in partnered sexual activity. These relationships were independent of daytime affect and fatigue.

Physical activity intensity and energy expenditure were assessed during a 500-nautical-mile double-handed offshore competition in eight male sailors (46.3±3.4 years; 180±13 cm; 85.4±12.5 kg). During the whole regatta, they wore an activity monitor that estimated energy expenditure and minutes spent at each level of intensity (sedentary, <1.5 METs; light physical activity, 1.5-2.9 METs; moderate physical activity, 3.0-6.0 METs; vigorous physical activity, >6.0 METs). The sailors spent longer periods (P<0.0001) of time in sedentary (823±193 min/day) and light physical activities (516±177 min/day) than in moderate (95±34 min/day) or vigorous (6±4 min/day) physical activities.

Pulse oximetry revealed that sleeping at simulated altitude significantly increased heart rate (3 +/- 1 beats/min; means +/- SE) and decreased SpO2 (-6 +/- 1%) compared with baseline data collected near sea level. In response to simulated altitude, 15 of the 17 subjects increased the combined frequency of apneas plus hypopneas from baseline levels. On exposure to simulated altitude, the increase in apnea was significant from baseline for both sleep states (2.0 +/- 1.3 events/h for REM, 9.9 +/- 6.2 events/h for NREM), but the difference between the two states was not significantly different. Hypopnea frequency was significantly elevated from baseline to simulated altitude exposure in both sleep states, and under hypoxic conditions it was greater in REM than in NREM sleep (7.9 +/- 1.8 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.3 events/h, respectively). Periodic breathing episodes during sleep were identified in four subjects, making this the first study to show periodic breathing in healthy adults at a level of hypoxia equivalent to 2,650-m altitude.

The association between sleep duration and healthy dietary patterns with the risk of T2D was investigated during a median (IQR) follow-up of 12.5 (11.8-13.2) years (end of follow-up, September 30, 2021). For the analysis, 247 867 participants were categorized into 4 sleep duration groups: normal (7-8 hours per day), mild short (6 hours per day), moderate short (5 hours per day), and extreme short (3-4 hours per day). Their dietary habits were evaluated based on population-specific consumption of red meat, processed meat, fruits, vegetables, and fish, resulting in a healthy diet score ranging from 0 (unhealthiest) to 5 (healthiest). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the development of T2D across various sleep duration groups and healthy diet scores. The cohort comprised 247 867 participants with a mean [SD] age of 55.9 [8.1] years, of whom 52.3% were female. During the follow-up, 3.2% of participants were diagnosed with T2D based on hospital registry data. Cox regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables, indicated a significant increase in the risk of T2D among participants with 5 hours or less of daily sleep. Individuals sleeping 5 hours per day exhibited a 1.16 adjusted HR (95% CI, 1.05-1.28), and individuals sleeping 3 to 4 hours per day exhibited a 1.41 adjusted HR (95% CI, 1.19-1.68) compared with individuals with normal sleep duration.

A new electromyographic technique was developed to implant hooked-wire electrodes into the PCA by using a nasopharyngoscope. A previously described technique was used to induce upper airway occlusions during NREM sleep (Kuna and Smickley, J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 347-353, 1988). The PCA exhibited phasic inspiratory activity during quiet breathing in wakefulness and sleep in all subjects. Discounting changes in tonic activity, peak amplitude of PCA inspiratory activity during stage 3-4 NREM sleep decreased to 77% of its value in wakefulness. Tonic activity throughout the respiratory cycle was present in all subjects during wakefulness but was absent during state 3-4 NREM sleep. In this sleep stage, PCA phasic activity abruptly terminated near the end of inspiration. During nasal airway occlusions in NREM sleep, PCA phasic activity did not increase significantly during the first or second occluded effort. The results, in combination with recent findings for vocal cord adductors in awake and sleeping adults, suggest that vocal cord position during quiet breathing in wakefulness is actively controlled by simultaneously acting antagonistic intrinsic laryngeal muscles.

The aim of this scoping review is to investigate how various physiological signals recorded during sleep or wakefulness relate to objective measures of cognitive or physical performance and subjectively perceived sleep quality to inform conceptual understanding of the elusive, amorphous, and multi-dimensional construct of sleep quality. We also aimed to suggest priorities for future areas of research in sleep quality and performance. We searched six databases ultimately yielding 439 studies after duplicate removal. Sixty-five studies were selected for full review. In general, correlations between objectively measured sleep and objective performance or subjectively assessed sleep quality were weak to moderate. Slow wave sleep was moderately correlated with better performance on tasks of vigilance, motor speed, and executive function as well as better subjective sleep quality and feeling well-rested, suggesting that slow wave sleep may be important for sleep quality and optimal daytime performance. However, these findings were inconsistent across studies. Increased sleep fragmentation was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality in both polysomnographic and actigraphic studies. Studies which simultaneously assessed physiologic sleep measures, performance measures and subjective sleep perception were few, limiting the ability to evaluate correlations between subjective and objective outcomes concurrently in the same individuals. Factors influencing the relationship between sleep quality and performance include circadian variability, sleep inertia, and mismatch between sleep stages studied and outcome measures of choice. Ultimately, the determination of \"quality sleep\" remains largely subjective and inconsistently quantifiable by current measures. Methods evaluating sleep as a continuous measure rather than traditional sleep stages may provide an intriguing approach to future studies of sleep and performance. Future well-designed studies using novel measures of sleep or multimodal ambulatory wearables assessing the three domains of sleep and performance (objective sleep physiology, objective performance, and subjective sleep quality) are needed to better define quality sleep.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35753151/"}

Oral administration of a sub-lethal dose of paracetamol (640 mg/kg) produced liver damage in rats as manifested by the rise in serum level of transaminases (AST and ALT). Pre-treatment of rats with rutin (20 mg/kg) prevented the paracetamol-induced rise in serum enzymes. The hepatotoxic dose of CCl(4) (1.5 ml/kg; orally) also raised the serum AST and ALT levels. The same dose of rutin (20 mg/kg) was able to prevent the CCl(4)-induced rise in serum enzymes.

These results indicate that rutin possesses hepatoprotective activity and the presence of this compound in Artemisia scoparia may explain the folkloric use of the plant in liver damage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12490212/"}

No significant sex differences were observed. Pretreatment of male mice for 3 days using doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg hymenoxon failed to alter significantly pentobarbital sleeping time. Hymenoxon was found to be a direct-acting mutagen in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome test. Urine samples obtained from hymenoxon-treated mice were found to be negative activity when tested directly and when incubated with beta-glucuronidase. Hymenoxon did not produce lethal DNA damage as measured in the Escherichia coli polA or Bacillus subtilis recombinational assays.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7330900/"}
{"id": "7676162", "title": "A method for simultaneous physiological and radiographic recordings from sleeping neonatal piglets.", "text": "A healthy neonatal piglet model was developed to investigate the effects of simulated gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) on airway protective mechanisms in different sleep states. Piglets were chosen for the model because there are similarities in esophageal morphology, development of the cardiorespiratory system and sleep-wakefulness cycle between the piglet and the human infant. Unanesthetized piglets were instrumented and trained to sleep in a radiolucent, temperature-controlled box. Physiologic recordings of sleep (electroencephalogram, 'ear-o-gram', behavioral observations), cardiorespiratory function (end-tidal CO2, O2 saturation, heart rate, respiratory movements), swallowing (pharyngeal or esophageal pressures) and GER (signaled by a fall in esophageal pH) were displayed and stored on a computer. An image intensifier was used for radiographic observations. The outputs from the computer and image intensifier were synchronized and recorded on videotape. The method enabled simultaneous physiologic and radiographic observations to be made during the simulation of GER by the injection of normal NaCl, distilled water or HCl (pH 2 and 3) into either the pharynx or different sites in the esophagus. The piglet model appears to accurately reflect the normal physiologic responses of the healthy sleeping neonate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7676162/"}
{"id": "21357341", "title": "Cerebral oxygenation is depressed during sleep in healthy term infants when they sleep prone.", "text": "Prone sleeping is a major risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome and is associated with lower blood pressure and impaired arousability from sleep, both of which may be signs of cerebral hypoxia. However, the impact of sleep position on cerebral oxygenation during infancy remains unknown. We assessed the effects of sleeping position, sleep state, and postnatal age on cerebral oxygenation by measuring tissue oxygenation index (TOI) during the first 6 months of infancy. Seventeen healthy term infants (8 girls and 9 boys) were recruited as study participants. Infants were studied at ages 2 to 4 weeks, 2 to 3 months, and 5 to 6 months by use of daytime polysomnography, with additional measurements of blood pressure (Finometer, FMS Finometer Medical Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and tissue oxygenation index (TOI) (NIRO 200 spectrophotometer, Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Tokyo, Japan). In infants who slept in the prone position, TOI was lower in both quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) at age 2 to 4 weeks and in QS at age 2 to 3 months (P < .05). TOI was lower in AS compared with QS in infants aged 2 to 4 weeks (P < .05). When the infants reached 5 to 6 months of age, TOI was greater in AS (P < .05), as there was a profound decrease in TOI during QS (P < .05) over this period. No relationship was identified between blood pressure and TOI at any age. In healthy infants cerebral oxygenation is reduced during sleep in the prone position. This reduction may underpin the reduced arousability from sleep exhibited by healthy infants who sleep prone, a finding that provides new insight into potential risks of prone sleeping and mechanisms of sudden infant death syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21357341/"}
