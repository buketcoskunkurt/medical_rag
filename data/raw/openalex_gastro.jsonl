The prevalence and incidence of GORD was estimated from 15 studies which defined GORD as at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation and met criteria concerning sample size, response rate, and recall period. Data on factors associated with GORD were also evaluated. An approximate prevalence of 10-20% was identified for GORD, defined by at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation in the Western world while in Asia this was lower, at less than 5%. The incidence in the Western world was approximately 5 per 1000 person years. A number of potential risk factors (for example, an immediate family history and obesity) and comorbidities (for example, respiratory diseases and chest pain) associated with GORD were identified. Data reported in this systematic review can be interpreted with confidence as reflecting the epidemiology of \"true\" GORD. The disease is more common in the Western world than in Asia, and the low rate of incidence relative to prevalence reflects its chronicity. The small number of studies eligible for inclusion in this review highlights the need for global consensus on a symptom based definition of GORD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2004.051821", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099999179", "source": "openalex"}

Studies were required to be population-based, to include ≥200 individuals, to have response rates ≥50% and recall periods &lt;12 months. GERD was defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation on at least 1 day a week, or according to the Montreal definition, or diagnosed by a clinician. Temporal and geographic trends in disease prevalence were examined using a Poisson regression model. <h3>Results</h3> 16 studies of GERD epidemiology published since the original review were found to be suitable for inclusion (15 reporting prevalence and one reporting incidence), and were added to the 13 prevalence and two incidence studies found previously. The range of GERD prevalence estimates was 18.1%–27.8% in North America, 8.8%–25.9% in Europe, 2.5%–7.8% in East Asia, 8.7%–33.1% in the Middle East, 11.6% in Australia and 23.0% in South America. Incidence per 1000 person-years was approximately 5 in the overall UK and US populations, and 0.84 in paediatric patients aged 1–17 years in the UK. Evidence suggests an increase in GERD prevalence since 1995 (p&lt;0.0001), particularly in North America and East Asia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> GERD is prevalent worldwide, and disease burden may be increasing.

Sixty-five consecutive patients with well-defined IPF were subjected to 24-h pH monitoring and oesophageal manometry. A total of 133 consecutive patients with intractable asthma and symptoms of GER were used as comparisons. The prevalence of abnormal acid GER in IPF patients was 87%, with 76% and 63% demonstrating abnormal distal and proximal oesophageal acid exposures, respectively. Abnormal acid GER was significantly more common in IPF patients than asthma patients. Only 47% of IPF patients experienced classic GER symptoms. Despite treatment with standard doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), 12 out of 19 patients receiving PPIs during the 24-h pH monitoring had abnormal oesophageal acid exposures by pH probe. There was no correlation between IPF severity and acid GER severity. In conclusion, abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux is highly prevalent, but often clinically occult in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Standard doses of proton pump inhibitors may not suppress the acid gastro-oesophageal reflux in this population. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine if acid abnormal gastro-oesophageal reflux represents an important risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis development or progression, and if optimal suppression of acid gastro-oesophageal reflux slows the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or decreases episodic exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.06.00037005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144469870", "source": "openalex"}

Although GORD is primarily a motor disorder, the injurious effects of gastric acid are central to the pathogenic process of oesophagitis, and the severity of disease correlates with the degree and duration of oesophageal acid exposure. In the majority of patients with mild disease, oesophageal acid exposure occurs predominantly during post-prandial periods. Conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists cannot overcome the integrated stimulus to acid secretion resulting from a meal, and are thus relatively ineffective in preventing daytime, post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure. In patients with more severe grades of oesophagitis, there are abnormally high levels of nocturnal acid exposure, with the intra-oesophageal pH being less than 4.0 for 36% of the time, compared with 5% of the time in patients with mild GORD. Control of nocturnal acid secretion thus becomes increasingly important. This may be made worse by relative gastric acid hypersecretion in some patients with severe GORD. The long duration of action and effective inhibition of meal-stimulated acid secretion probably explains the superiority of omeprazole in treating GORD. Preliminary meta-analysis shows that the healing rate of erosive oesophagitis at 8 weeks by antisecretory agents is directly related to the duration of suppression of gastric acid secretion achieved over a 24-hour period (r = 0.87; p < 0.05).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000200917", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027852470", "source": "openalex"}

On the basis of these results, nivolumab plus chemotherapy is now approved as a first-line treatment for these patients in many countries 6 . Nivolumab and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab have distinct but complementary mechanisms of action that contribute to the restoration of anti-tumour T-cell function and induction of de novo anti-tumour T-cell responses, respectively 7–11 .

In Western countries, 20-40% of the adult population experience heartburn, which is the cardinal symptom of GORD, but only some 2% of adults have objective evidence of reflux oesophagitis. The incidence of GORD increases with age, rising dramatically after 40 years of age. There is also wide geographical variation in prevalence. Complications, including oesophageal ulcer and stricture, and Barrett's oesophagus, are found in up to 20% of patients with verified reflux oesophagitis. The signs and symptoms of GORD often wax and wane in intensity, and spontaneous remissions have been reported. In most cases, however, GORD is a chronic condition that returns shortly after discontinuing therapy. Although GORD causes substantial morbidity, the annual mortality rate due to GORD is very low (approximately 1 death per 100,000 patients), and even severe GORD has no apparent effect on longevity, although the quality of life can be significantly impaired. There are data to suggest that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contributes to oesophagitis and stricture formation in patients with GORD. Although these data are not conclusive, it seems prudent, if possible, to avoid the use of NSAIDs in patients with GORD, particularly those with oesophageal stricture.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000200911", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072166021", "source": "openalex"}

AIMS To examine the interaction between hiatus hernia and lower oesophageal sphincter hypotension. METHODS In seven normal subjects and seven patients with hiatus hernia, the squamocolumnar junction and intragastric margin of the gastro-oesophageal junction were marked with endoscopically placed clips. Axial and radial characteristics of the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone were mapped relative to the hiatus and clips during concurrent fluoroscopy and manometry. Responses to inspiration and abdominal compression were also analysed. RESULTS In normal individuals the squamocolumnar junction was 0.5 cm below the hiatus and the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone extended 1.1 cm distal to that. In those with hiatus hernia, the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone had two discrete segments, one proximal to the squamocolumnar junction and one distal, attributable to the extrinsic compression within the hiatal canal. Inspiration and abdominal compression mainly augmented the distal one. Simulation of hernia reduction by algebraically summing the proximal segment pressures with the hiatal canal pressures restored normal maximal pressure, radial asymmetry, and dynamic responses of the gastro-oesophageal junction. CONCLUSIONS Hiatus hernia reduces lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and alters its dynamic responsiveness by spatially separating pressure components derived from the intrinsic lower oesophageal sphincter and the extrinsic compression of the oesophagus within the hiatal canal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.44.4.476", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156425129", "source": "openalex"}

SOURCE Published and unpublished English language literature, 1981–1996. METHODS Data on the staging performance of EUS were retrieved and evaluated. Summary receiver operator characteristic methodology was used for synthesis, and a summary estimate of performance, Q*, obtained. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess study validity and investigate reasons for differences in performance. RESULTS Twenty seven primary articles were assessed in detail. Thirteen supplied results for staging oesophageal cancer, 13 for gastric cancer, and four for cancers at the gastro-oesophageal junction. For gastric T staging, Q*=0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.95) and for oesophageal T staging, Q*=0.89 (95% CI 0.88–0.92). For gastro-oesophageal T staging, including cancers at the gastro-oesophageal junction, Q*=0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.93). Inclusion of cases with non-traversable stenosis was found to slightly reduce staging performance. For N staging, Q*=0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.83). In articles that compared EUS directly with incremental computed tomography, EUS performed better. None of the variables assessed in the regression analysis was significant using a Bonferroni correction.

Host genetic polymorphisms that lead to high-level pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to infection increase cancer risk. Pathogenesis is dependent upon inflammation, a Th-1 acquired immune response and hormonal changes including hypergastrinaemia. Antral-predominant inflammation leads to increased acid production from the uninflamed corpus and predisposes to duodenal ulceration; corpus-predominant gastritis leads to hypochlorhydria and predisposes to gastric ulceration and adenocarcinoma.

This study aimed to evaluate typical symptoms and complications of GORD, and their associated risk factors, in a representative sample of the Italian population. <h3>Methods:</h3> 1533 adults from two Italian villages were approached to undergo symptom assessment using a validated questionnaire and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Data were obtained from 1033 individuals (67.4% response rate). <h3>Results:</h3> The prevalence of reflux symptoms was 44.3%; 23.7% of the population experienced such symptoms on at least 2 days per week (frequent symptoms).

Both frequent (relative risk (RR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.9) and infrequent (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0) reflux symptoms were associated with the presence of oesophagitis. No reflux symptoms were reported by 32.8% of individuals with oesophagitis and 46.2% of those with Barrett’s oesophagus. Hiatus hernia was associated with frequent reflux symptoms and oesophagitis, and was present in 76.9% of those with Barrett’s oesophagus. We found no association between body mass index and reflux symptoms or oesophagitis. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> GORD is common in Italy, but the prevalence of Barrett’s oesophagus in the community is lower than has been reported in selected populations. Both frequent and infrequent reflux symptoms are associated with an increased risk of oesophagitis.

Methods : A telephone survey of 2500 subjects was performed using a validated questionnaire. The association of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (defined as the presence of heartburn or acid regurgitation) and their clinical characteristics with potential risk factors was summarized using the odds ratios (OR) obtained by multiple logistic regression. Results : The response rate was 71.2%. The annual prevalence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms was 31.6%[95% confidence interval (CI), 29.8–33.4] and the weekly prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI, 8.6–10.9). Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms were associated with excess weight (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.92), obesity (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.30–2.32), the psychosomatic symptom score (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.41–3.67) and the presence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms in a direct family member (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.17–2.23). Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms of ≥ 10 years' duration were more frequent in obese subjects (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14–3.22) and those with a direct family member with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.44–4.06). Factors associated with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms of ≤ 1 year duration were a spouse with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.39–3.9) and the consumption of 1–5 aspirins/week (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.01–2.86).

In order to assess the validity of this suggestion, we examined the risk of oesophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's and with GORD compared with the general population in a community based cohort study.Cohorts of patients with Barrett's (n = 1677), oesophagitis (n = 6392), and simple reflux (n = 6328), and a reference cohort (n = 13416) were selected from the General Practice Research Database. The last three cohorts were matched to the Barrett's cohort by general practitioner practice, age, and sex. Cox's regression analysis was used to calculate relative risks for oesophageal cancer. Standardised incidence ratio methodology was used to estimate the relative risks for oesophageal adenocarcinoma.A total of 137 oesophageal cancers were identified, of which 94 prevalent cases were excluded. The hazard ratios for oesophageal cancer were 10.6 (5.1-22.0), 2.2 (0.9-5.2), and 1.7 (0.7-4.5) in the Barrett's, oesophagitis, and reflux cohorts compared with the reference cohort, respectively. The corresponding relative risks for oesophageal adenocarcinoma were 29.8 (9.6-106), 4.5 (1.04-19.6), and 3.1 (0.6-14.2).Barrett's oesophagus increases the risk of oesophageal cancer approximately 10 times and oesophageal adenocarcinoma approximately 30 times compared with the general population. There is only a modestly increased risk of oesophageal cancer in patients with reflux who have no record of Barrett's oesophagus. Our findings therefore do not support the suggestion that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease itself predisposes to cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2003.028076", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100503989", "source": "openalex"}

Since recent studies in animals suggest that nitric oxide (NO) is implicated physiologically in the inhibitory responses of the lower oesophageal sphincter, we have investigated whether the synthesis of NO is altered in the gastro-oesophageal junction of patients with achalasia. NO synthase activity was investigated in samples of tissue from the gastro-oesophageal junction obtained during surgery in eight patients with typical achalasia and six non-achalasic controls who underwent oesophagectomy for reasons other than sphincter dysfunction. The NO synthase activity was determined by the transformation of 14C-L-arginine into 14C-L-citrulline in tissue homogenates. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of the tissues was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide sequence of rat brain NO synthase. Furthermore, the relaxant response to an exogenous NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) was measured in vitro in muscle strips obtained from two patients with achalasia and in two non-achalasic controls. NO synthase activity was detected in each of the samples obtained from six control patients (0.59 +/- 0.21 pmol mg-1 min-1; mean +/- SE). By contrast, none of the samples obtained from the eight patients with achalasia had any detectable NO synthase activity. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of NO synthase in the myenteric plexus of the gastro-oesophageal junction of control patients and its absence in achalasia.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether an inflammation-based prognostic score (Glasgow Prognostic score, GPS) was associated with survival, in patients with inoperable gastro-oesophageal cancer. Patients diagnosed with inoperable gastro-oesophageal carcinoma and who had measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein concentrations, at the time of diagnosis, were studied (n=258). Clinical information was obtained from a gastro-oesophageal cancer database and analysis of the case notes. Patients with both an elevated C-reactive protein (>10 mg l−1) and hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g l−1) were allocated a GPS score of 2. Patients in whom only one of these biochemical abnormalities was present were allocated a GPS score of 1, and patients with a normal C-reactive protein and albumin were allocated a score of 0. On multivariate survival analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.02–1.46, P<0.05), stage (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30–1.83, P<0.001), the GPS (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.22–1.86, P<0.001) and treatment (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.80–3.56, P<0.001) were significant independent predictors of cancer survival.

The symptom‐based management of GERD in primary care may be further optimised with the use of a questionnaire. Aim To assess the diagnostic validity of the GerdQ questionnaire in patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD . Methods Patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD without alarm features, underwent upper endoscopy, and if normal, pH‐metry. Patients were followed for 4 weeks and GerdQ was completed blinded to the investigator at both visits. Reflux oesophagitis or pathological acid exposure was used as diagnostic references for GERD . The diagnostic accuracy for GERD on symptom response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was assessed. Results Among the 169 patients, a GerdQ cutoff ≥9 gave the best balance with regard to sensitivity, 66% (95% CI: 58–74), and specificity, 64% (95% CI: 41–83), for GERD . The high prevalence of reflux oesophagitis (81%) resulted in a high proportion of true positives, but at the same time a high proportion of false‐negatives. Consequently, GerdQ had a high positive predictive value, 92% (95% CI: 86–97), but a low negative predictive value, 22% (95% CI: 13–34), for GERD . Symptom resolution on PPI therapy had high sensitivity, 76% (95% CI: 66–84), but low specificity, 33% (95% CI: 17–53), for GERD . Conclusions GerdQ is a useful complementary tool for the diagnosis of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in primary care. The implementation of GerdQ could reduce the need for upper endoscopy and improve resource utilisation.

The gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor type B agonist, baclofen, is a potent inhibitor of TLOSRs in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of baclofen on TLOSRs and postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux disease. Methods: In 20 patients with reflux disease, oesophageal motility and pH were measured, with patients in the sitting position, for three hours after a 3000 kJ mixed nutrient meal. On separate days at least one week apart, 40 mg oral baclofen or placebo was given 90 minutes before the meal. Results: Baclofen reduced the rate of TLOSRs by 40% from 15 (13.8–18.3) to 9 (5.8–13.3) per three hours (p&lt;0.0002) and increased basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Baclofen also significantly reduced the rate of reflux episodes by 43% from 7.0 (4.0–12.0) to 4.0 (1.5–9) per three hours (median (interquartile range); p&lt;0.02).

Different innovative approaches like magnetic field assisted gastro-retention, plug type swelling system, muco-adhesion technique, floating system with or without effervescence are being applied to fabricate GRDDS.

The normal non-anemic dog absorbs little iron but chronic anemia due to blood loss brings about considerable absorption-perhaps 5 to 15 times normal. In general the same differences are observed in man (1). Sudden change from normal to severe anemia within 24 hours does not significantly increase iron absorption. As the days pass new hemoglobin is formed. The body iron stores are depleted and within 7 days iron absorption is active, even when the red cell hematocrit is rising. Anoxemia of 50 per cent normal oxygen concentration for 48 hours does not significantly enhance iron absorption. In this respect it resembles acute anemia. Ordinary doses of iron given 1 to 6 hours before radio-iron will cause some \"mucosa block\"-that is an intake of radio-iron less than anticipated. Many variables which modify peristalsis come into this reaction. Iron given by vein some days before the dose of radio-iron does not appear to inhibit iron absorption. Plasma radio-iron absorption curves vary greatly. The curves may show sharp peaks in 1 to 2 hours when the iron is given in an empty stomach but after 6 hours when the radio-iron is given with food. Duration time of curves also varies widely, the plasma iron returning to normal in 6 to 12 hours. Gastric, duodenal, or jejunal pouches all show very active absorption of iron. The plasma concentration peak may reach a maximum before the solution of iron is removed from the gastric pouch-another example of \"mucosa block.\" Absorption and distribution of radio-iron in the body of growing pups give very suggestive experimental data. The spleen, heart, upper gastro-intestinal tract, marrow, and pancreas show more radio-iron than was expected. The term \"physiological saturation\" with iron may be applied to the gastro-intestinal mucosal epithelium and explain one phase of acceptance or refusal of ingested iron. Desaturation is a matter of days not hours, whereas saturation may take place within 1 to 2 hours.

It reduces lower oesophageal sphincter length and pressure, and impairs the augmenting effects of the diaphragmatic crus. It is associated with decreased oesophageal peristalsis, increases the cross‐sectional area of the oesophago‐gastric junction, and acts as a reservoir allowing reflux from the hernia sac into the oesophagus during swallowing. The overall effect is that of increased oesophageal acid exposure. The presence of a hiatus hernia is associated with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux, increased prevalence and severity of reflux oesophagitis, as well as Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of treatment with proton pump inhibitors is reduced. Our view on the significance of the sliding hiatus hernia in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease has changed enormously in recent decades. It was initially thought that a hiatus hernia had to be present for reflux oesophagitis to occur. Subsequently, the hiatus hernia was considered an incidental finding of little consequence. We now appreciate that the hiatus hernia has major patho‐physiological effects favouring gastro‐oesophageal reflux and hence contributing to oesophageal mucosal injury, particularly in patients with severe gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02149.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2004830815", "source": "openalex"}

One suggestion is that gastric juice is aspirated into the tracheal and upper airways but detection of these events is difficult and involves radioisotopic studies. A new method of making direct measurements of tracheal and oesophageal pH over a 24 hour period is described, together with its application to patients with asthma. METHODS--The technique involves insertion of simultaneous tracheal and oesophageal pH probes under general anaesthesia. Continuous monitoring of pH over a 24 hour period is possible, permitting comparison with peak flow readings during wakefulness and at night should the patient be disturbed. Representative data from four patients with asthma (mean FEV1 62% predicted) and symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, together with data from three non-asthmatics, is presented. RESULTS--Thirty seven episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux lasting more than five minutes were recorded. Of these, five were closely followed by a fall in tracheal pH from a mean (SE) of 7.1 (0.2) to 4.1 (0.4) and a fall in peak expiratory flow (PEFR) of 84 (16) l/min. When gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred without tracheal aspiration the fall in PEFR was 8 (4) l/min. CONCLUSIONS--This new technique was well tolerated and allowed quantitation of the number, duration, and timing of episodes of tracheal micro-aspiration. Unlike acid reflux without aspiration, these events appear to be related to significant acute changes in lung function in asthmatic patients. Further studies with this new method may elucidate the role of gastro-oesophageal reflux in asthma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.50.2.201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963799705", "source": "openalex"}

Interactions that include learning about regional foods and kitchen cultures and that foster relationships between the gastro-tourist and the gastro-host are more important to them than fancy amenities. Research that identifies characteristics and attributes of gastro-tourism experiences considered memorable is sparse. This inductive qualitative research study triangulated three data sources and two data collection methods (in-depth interviews and online surveys). Seven attributes linked to memorability are identified: (1) deliberate and incidental gastro-tourists, (2) travel stages, (3) foodie risk-taking, (4) interdependent co-created tourist–host relationships, (5) authenticity, (6) sociability, and (7) emotions. The attributes provide insights into the prevalent shift from product/service-dominant tourism to co-created experiential tourism opportunities and highlight the motivations that drive this emerging gastro-tourism market segment. By uncovering triggering moments that gastro-tourists value and find memorable, this study adds to the knowledge base of sustainable tourism development, destination branding promises, co-creation, and stakeholder theories.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1096348018804621", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2897894821", "source": "openalex"}

Design and setting Cross-sectional population-based study, as part of a randomized controlled trial of eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, in Southwest England. Subjects In all, 10 537 subjects, aged 20–59 years, were recruited from seven general practices. Subjects provided data on frequency and severity of dyspeptic symptoms and anthropometric measurements were taken. Main outcome measure Relationship between overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m2 and ≤30 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and frequency and severity of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Results Body mass index was strongly positively related to the frequency of symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of heartburn and acid regurgitation occurring at least once a week in overweight participants compared with those of normal weight were 1.82 (95% CI: 1.33–2.50) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.13–1.99) respectively. Corresponding OR (95% CI) relating to obese patients were 2.91 (95% CI: 2.07–4.08) and 2.23 (95% CI: 1.44–3.45) respectively. The OR for moderate to severe reflux symptoms were raised in overweight and obese subjects but not to the same extent as frequency of symptoms and only the relationship between obesity and severity of heartburn reached conventional statistical significance: OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.07–1.33.

Apart from the physical discomfort and the economic burden, GERD may increase morbidity and mortality through its association with oesophageal carcinoma. The pathophysiology of GERD differs between obese and lean subjects. First, obese subjects are more sensitive to the presence of acid in the oesophagus. Second, hiatal hernia, capable of promoting GERD by several mechanisms, is more prevalent among the obese. Third, obese subjects have increased intra‐abdominal pressure that displaces the lower oesophageal sphincter and increases the gastro‐oesophageal gradient. Finally, vagal abnormalities associated with obesity may cause a higher output of bile and pancreatic enzymes, which makes the refluxate more toxic to the oesophageal mucosa. The altered body composition associated with obesity affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. There are no data regarding the efficacy of any of the drugs used for GERD treatment. The dosages of cimetidine and ranitidine should be calculated according to the patient’s ideal body weight, not their actual weight. Of the operative procedures used for weight loss, Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass was found to be most effective for GERD, while gastric banding was associated with a high prevalence of reflux. This review outlines the pathophysiology and the treatment of GERD in obesity with emphasis on the therapeutic considerations in this population of patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2002.00049.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143090957", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Literature search was focused on indications and technical recommendations for GERD testing and phenotypes definitions. Statements were proposed and discussed during several structured meetings. Key Results Reflux testing should be performed after cessation of acid suppressive medication in patients with a low likelihood of GERD . In this setting, testing can be either catheter‐based or wireless pH ‐monitoring or pH ‐impedance monitoring. In patients with a high probability of GERD (esophagitis grade C and D, histology proven Barrett's mucosa &gt;1 cm, peptic stricture, previous positive pH monitoring) and persistent symptoms, pH ‐impedance monitoring should be performed on treatment. Recommendations are provided for data acquisition and analysis. Esophageal acid exposure is considered as pathological if acid exposure time ( AET ) is greater than 6% on pH testing. Number of reflux episodes and baseline impedance are exploratory metrics that may complement AET . Positive symptom reflux association is defined as symptom index ( SI ) &gt;50% or symptom association probability ( SAP ) &gt;95%. A positive symptom‐reflux association in the absence of pathological AET defines hypersensitivity to reflux. Conclusions and Inferences The consensus group determined that grade C or D esophagitis, peptic stricture, histology proven Barrett's mucosa &gt;1 cm, and esophageal acid exposure greater &gt;6% are sufficient to define pathological GERD . Further testing should be considered when none of these criteria are fulfilled.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13067", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2601059298", "source": "openalex"}

The importance of dietary nitrosamines in relation to human cancer development is, however, uncertain. We studied the relationship between intake of nitrates, nitrites and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and risk of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract in a cohort of 9,985 adult Finnish men and women. During a follow-up period of up to 24 years, 189 gastro-intestinal cancer cases were diagnosed in the cohort, initially free from cancer. Intake of nitrate, nitrite and NDMA were estimated, based on food-consumption data from a 1-year dietary history interview covering the total diet of the participants. A significant positive association was observed between intake of NDMA and subsequent occurrence of colorectal cancer with a relative risk (RR) between the highest and lowest quartiles of intake of 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–4.33]. Of various sources of N-nitroso compounds, intake of smoked and salted fish was significantly (RR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.21 − 5.51) and intake of cured meat was non-significantly (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 0.98– 3.47) associated with risk of colorectal cancer.

In men and women the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) for IBS and gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms was 2.6 (2.1-3.1; p<0.001) and for IBS and BHR 2.1 (1.7-2.7; p<0.001). These associations held on stratifying for sex and consultation behaviour. IBS, gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness occurred more frequently together than expected, 2.5% (95% CI 2.41-2.57) of the sample having all three conditions compared with an expected prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI 0.66-0.71).

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on GORD prevalence and risk factors at a global level. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were systematically searched, without language restrictions, for studies on the prevalence and risk factors of GORD. Data were pooled using a random effects model (95% confidence interval), and the odds ratio and relative risk for each risk factor were calculated. Out of 34,355 search results, 96 records reporting the results from 102 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, representing 37 countries and all regions of the UN geoscheme. The global pooled prevalence of GORD was 13.98% and varied greatly according to region (12.88% in Latin America and the Caribbean to 19.55% in North America) and country (4.16% in China to 22.40% in Turkey). Using the United Nations 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects, the estimated number of individuals suffering from GORD globally is 1.03 billion. Multiple risk factors associated with a significant increase in the risk of GORD were also identified. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that although a substantial proportion (13.98%) of the global population suffers from GORD, there are significant variations between regions and countries.

We examined associations of GORD symptoms with intakes of specific dietary components. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a cross sectional study in a sample of employees (non-patients) at the Houston VAMC. The Gastro Esophageal Reflux Questionnaire was used to identify the onset, frequency, and severity of GORD symptoms. Dietary intake (usual frequency of consumption of various foods and portion sizes) over the preceding year was assessed using the Block 98 food frequency questionnaire. Upper endoscopy was offered to all participants and oesophageal erosions recorded according to the LA classification. We compared the dietary intake (macronutrients, micronutrients, food groups) of participants with or without GORD symptoms, or erosive oesophagitis. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between nutrients and GORD symptoms or oesophageal erosions, adjusting for demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI), and total energy intake. <b>Results:</b> A total of 371 of 915 respondents (41%) had complete and interpretable answers to both heartburn and regurgitation questions and met validity criteria for the Block 98 FFQ. Mean age was 43 years, 260 (70%) were women, and 103 (28%) reported at least weekly occurrences of heartburn or regurgitation. Of the 164 respondents on whom endoscopies were performed, erosive oesophagitis was detected in 40 (24%). Compared to participants without GORD symptoms, daily intakes of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, percentage of energy from dietary fat, and average fat servings were significantly higher in participants with GORD symptoms. In addition, there was a dose-response relationship between GORD and saturated fat and cholesterol. The effect of dietary fat became non-significant when adjusted for BMI.

Aim To estimate precisely the association between symptoms of GERD and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Methods Systematic review and meta‐analysis of population‐based studies with strict ascertainment of exposure and outcomes. Results Five eligible studies were identified. At least weekly symptoms of GERD increased the odds of oesophageal adenocarcinoma fivefold (odds ratio = 4.92; 95% confidence interval = 3.90, 6.22), and daily symptoms increased the odds sevenfold (random effects summary odds ratio = 7.40, 95% confidence interval = 4.94, 11.1), each compared with individuals without symptoms or less frequent symptoms. Duration of symptoms was also associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma, but with very heterogeneous results, and unclear thresholds.

Pepsin detection in saliva has been proposed as an ‘office-based’ method for GORD diagnosis. The aims of this study were to establish normal values of salivary pepsin in healthy asymptomatic subjects and to determine its value to discriminate patients with reflux-related symptoms (GORD, hypersensitive oesophagus (HO)) from functional heartburn (FH). <h3>Design</h3> 100 asymptomatic controls and 111 patients with heartburn underwent MII-pH monitoring and simultaneous salivary pepsin determination on waking, after lunch and dinner. Cut-off value for pepsin positivity was 16 ng/mL. Patients were divided into GORD (increased acid exposure time (AET), n=58); HO (normal AET and + Symptom Association Probability (SAP), n=26) and FH (normal AET and—SAP, n=27). <h3>Results</h3> 1/3 of asymptomatic subjects had pepsin in saliva at low concentration (0(0–59)ng/mL). Patients with GORD and HO had higher prevalence and pepsin concentration than controls (HO, 237(52–311)ng/mL and GORD, 121(29–252)ng/mL)(p&lt;0.05).

Many reasons have been given for the lower prevalence of GORD in Asia. Low dietary fat and genetically determined factors, such as body mass index and maximal acid output, may be important. Other dietary factors appear to be less relevant. Increased intake of carbonated drinks or aggravating medicines may influence the increasing rates of GORD in some Asian countries but no strong evidence links other factors, such as the age of the population, smoking or alcohol consumption, to GORD. The management of GORD in Asia is similar to that in Europe and North America but the lower incidence of severe oesophagitis in Asia may alter the approach slightly. Also, because Asians tend to develop stomach cancer at an earlier age, endoscopy is used routinely at an earlier stage of investigation. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease is essentially a motility disorder, so short‐term management of the disease can usually be achieved using prokinetic agents (or histamine (H 2 )‐receptor antagonists). More severe and recurrent GORD may require proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or a combination of prokinetic agents and PPI. The choice of long‐term treatment may be influenced by the relative costs of prokinetic agents and PPI. © 2000 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1746.2000.02148.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2008180072", "source": "openalex"}

One rate‐limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis is mediated by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS), the target enzyme of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Two isoforms of PGHS exist: a constitutive (PGHS‐1) and an inducible (PGHS‐2) enzyme. PGHS‐1 is the major source of gastric prostaglandins under physiological conditions. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by traditional NSAIDs such as indomethacin and diclofenac which non‐selectively inhibit both PGHS‐1 and PGHS‐2, causes gastric and intestinal ulceration and delays gastric ulcer healing in chronic models. It has been shown that selective PGHS‐2 inhibitors such as L ‐745,337 (5‐methanesulphonamide‐6‐(2,4‐difluorothio‐phenyl)‐1‐indanone) are not ulcerogenic and do not inhibit gastro‐intestinal prostaglandin synthesis. However, minimal information is available on the long‐term effects of PGHS‐2 inhibitors on the healing of previously established gastric injuries. We assessed the cellular localization and expression of PGHS‐1 and PGHS‐2 during gastric ulcer healing and assessed the effects of L ‐745,337 on previously established cryoulcers in the rat gastric stomach. PGHS‐1 and PGHS‐2 were located and quantified by immunohistochemistry during experimental gastric ulcer healing. PGHS‐2 immunoreactivity was only negligible in the normal gastric wall, but after gastric ulcerations, it was strongly detected in monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells below and between the regenerative glands. PGHS‐1 immunoreactivity detected in normal gastric mucosa, disappeared after gastric ulceration in the mucosa adjacent to the ulcer crater. However, it reappeared in the regenerative glands from day 5 onwards. Thus, PGHS‐1 and PGHS‐2 were located at different sites and their maximal expression followed a different time‐sequence. We assessed the effects of L ‐745,337, indomethacin and diclofenac on gastric ulcer healing and histological healing parameters in rats. L ‐745,337, indomethacin and diclofenac dose‐dependently decreased the healing of gastric ulcers. L ‐745,337, indomethacin and diclofenac decreased epithelial cell proliferation in the ulcer margin and microvessel density in the ulcer bed on day 8 and increased the thickness of the granulation tissue below the ulcer crater and the gap between both edges of the muscularis mucosae on day 15. Indomethacin and diclofenac, but not L ‐745,337, decreased synthesis of 6‐keto‐PGF 1α and PGE 2 in tissue fragments from the stomach and terminal ileum and decreased platelet thromboxane B 2 synthesis in clotting whole blood. Dose‐response curves for the inhibition of chronic gastric ulcer healing by L ‐745,337 (administered twice daily intragastrically) showed an ID 50 value of 1.7 mg (4.3 μmol) kg −1 . Dose‐response curves for the inhibition of PGE2 synthesis in inflammatory exudates in the acute carrageenin sponge rat model, showed ID50 values of 1.1 mg (3.1 μmol) kg −1 and 1.3 (3.3 μmol) mg kg−1 for indomethacin and L ‐745,337, respectively. Thus, inhibition of chronic gastric ulcer healing by L ‐745,337 occurs within a potentially therapeutic dose‐range. In summary, PGHS‐2 is markedly accumulated after gastric ulceration in monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in regions of maximal repair activity. Selective inhibition of PGHS‐2 by L ‐745,337 delayed gastric ulcer healing though interference with epithelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis and maturation of granulation tissue in a potentially therapeutic dose range. PGHS‐2‐derived prostaglandins seem to have an important role in gastric ulcer healing.

Aims: To assess the impact of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease on reduced work productivity and to identify the predictors of reduced productivity. Methods: A sample of employed individuals reporting chronic heartburn was selected from US household mail survey respondents. Heartburn severity and frequency were recorded using a diary, and work productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Patients with Symptoms of Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease. Predictors of reduced productivity were evaluated. Results: Over 30% of heartburn sufferers reported reduced productivity. Individuals with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ( n = 1003) reported 6.0% reduced productivity attributable to symptoms. Over 48% of respondents with severe symptoms reported reduced productivity, compared with 40% and 12% of respondents with moderate and mild symptoms, respectively. Using logistic regression, severity, a younger age and nocturnal symptoms were associated with increased odds of reduced productivity. In those reporting nocturnal heartburn, medication use and sleep interference increased the odds of reduced productivity. Conclusions: Reduced work productivity is seen in a large proportion of subjects on prescription medication for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.

This study tested the hypothesis by measuring the sensory thresholds for oesophageal balloon distension and discomfort in 20 patients with symptoms of GORD, in whom ambulatory pH monitoring had shown normal acid exposure times, but in whom the symptom index for reflux events was 50% or greater, and compared these with 15 healthy volunteer controls, and with control groups with confirmed excess reflux.

Mature collagen is broken down by the action of specific enzyme collagenase. This has been estimated by a tissue-culture method and is produced by viable explants of mucosa. There is a significant increase in the amount of this enzyme produced post-operatively and it is suggested that this is responsible for the decrease in collagen and weakness of the colon. An increased amount of enzyme is produced by explants from the colon than from those of other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. This is regarded as an important reason for the high incidence of colonic and rectal anastomotic breakdown compared with breakdown of anastomoses in other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. Following colonic anastomosis there is increased collagenase production not only locally but throughout the gastro-intestinal tract, suggesting that wound healing is not only under local control.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800571206", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2012147690", "source": "openalex"}

The impact of new HRM motor paradigms on reflux burden needs further definition, leading to a modern approach to motor testing in GERD . Methods Focused literature searches were conducted, evaluating pathophysiology of GERD with emphasis on HRM . The results were discussed with an international group of experts to develop a consensus on the role of HRM in GERD . A proposed classification system for esophageal motor abnormalities associated with GERD was generated. Key Results Physiologic gastro‐esophageal reflux is inherent in all humans, resulting from transient lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) relaxations that allow venting of gastric air in the form of a belch. In pathological gastro‐esophageal reflux, transient LES relaxations are accompanied by reflux of gastric contents. Structural disruption of the esophagogastric junction ( EGJ ) barrier, and incomplete clearance of the refluxate can contribute to abnormally high esophageal reflux burden that defines GERD . Esophageal HRM localizes the LES for pH and pH ‐impedance probe placement, and assesses esophageal body peristaltic performance prior to invasive antireflux therapies and antireflux surgery. Furthermore, HRM can assess EGJ and esophageal body mechanisms contributing to reflux, and exclude conditions that mimic GERD.

When restricting analysis to GER+ patients, bronchial reactivity was closely correlated to the number of reflux episodes (NRE) (r=0.983; p=0.001). When comparing patients with more than 15 reflux episodes x day(-1) (n=50), with those having less (n=43), no differences were found in lung function and GER parameters. However, there was a positive correlation between the provocative dose of methacholine causing forced expiration volume to fall 20% from the baseline and NRE in patients with NRE&gt;15 (r=0.561; p=0.05). In conclusion, gastro-oesophageal reflux was observed in a third of the asthma patients studied. These data do not support a firm aetiological relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux and asthma, but do suggest an association between the number of reflux episodes and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.97.10102255", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102708593", "source": "openalex"}

Aim : To explore the racial differences in the frequency of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and its complications. Methods : We reviewed endoscopy reports and medical records for data on race and complications of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in 2477 consecutive patients who had endoscopic examinations at the general endoscopy unit of an academic hospital. In addition, we prospectively interviewed 129 out‐patients attending general medical clinics in the hospital and in an Asian community health centre in Boston to obtain data on race and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Results : One or more gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease complications (peptic oesophageal ulcer, stricture or Barrett's oesophagus) were observed in 267 of 2174 white patients (12.3%), seven of 249 black patients (2.8%), one of 21 West Asian patients (4.8%) and none of 33 East Asian patients seen at the general endoscopy unit ( P &lt; 0.001); 34.6% of whites, 46.1% of blacks and 2.6% of East Asian patients interviewed claimed that they had heartburn ( P &lt; 0.01), but the term ‘heartburn’ was understood by only 34.6%, 53.8% and 13.2% of whites, blacks and East Asians, respectively ( P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions : Asian patients in Boston infrequently complain of heartburn, whereas heartburn is commonly reported by both white and black patients. Many patients do not understand the meaning of the term heartburn, however, and so physicians should be cautious when using the term during patient interviews.

Despite the spectrum of abnormalities, gastric acid has a central role in mucosal damage, and the mainstay of medical treatment is suppression of gastric acid secretion. The results of antisecretory treatment as assessed by endoscopic healing are reviewed. H2 receptor antagonists give more rapid symptom relief than placebo and can produce endoscopic improvement in 31-88% of cases depending on the severity of oesophagitis. Complete healing, however, is seen only in 27-45% of patients and these have mainly grades I-II disease. Improved healing rates can be obtained by increasing the degree of acid suppression or the length of treatment. The addition of a prokinetic agent may be beneficial. Omeprazole heals 67-92% of patients overall and although most successful in the lower grades of oesophagitis, can also heal 48-62% of patients with grade IV disease. The degree and rate of healing seem to be related to the reduction in oesophageal acid exposure and thus may correlate with the degree and duration of acid suppression over 24 hours obtained by the various treatments. The underlying pathophysiology is unchanged, however, and long term treatment may be needed to maintain remission.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.33.1.118", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112774005", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.46.7.479", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167382039", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore we collected blood samples from 29 athletes before, immediately after, and 1, 2 and 16 h after a long-distance triathlon for measurement of LPS, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6). As the cytokine response would trigger an acute-phase response, characteristic variables of these responses were also measured, along with creatine kinase (CK) to obtain an indicator of muscle damage. There was a high incidence (93% of all participants) of GI symptoms; 45% reported severe complaints and 7% of the participants abandoned the race because of severe GI distress. Mild endotoxaemia (5–15 pg/ml) was evident in 68% of the athletes immediately after the race, as also indicated by a reduction in IgG anti-LPS levels. In addition, we observed production of IL-6 (27–fold increase immediately after the race), leading to an acute-phase response (20-fold increase in C-reactive protein and 12% decrease in pre-albumin 16 h after the race). The extent of endotoxaemia was not correlated with the GI complaints or the IL-6 response, but did show a correlation with the elevation in C-reactive protein (rs 0.389; P = 0.037). Creatine kinase levels were increased significantly immediately post-race, and increased further in the follow-up period. Creatine kinase levels did not correlate with those of either IL-6 or C-reactive protein. It is therefore concluded that LPS does enter the circulation after ultra-endurance exercise and may, together with muscle damage, be responsible for the increased cytokine response and hence GI complaints in these athletes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1042/cs0980047", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2003774123", "source": "openalex"}

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed to compare LNF and LTF. Methods Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and ISI Web of Knowledge CPCI-S) were searched and the methodological quality of included trials was evaluated. Outcomes included recurrent pathological acid exposure, oesophagitis, dysphagia, dilatation for dysphagia and reoperation rate. Results were pooled in meta-analyses as risk ratios (RRs) and weighted mean differences. Results Seven eligible RCTs comparing LNF (n = 404) with LTF (n = 388) were identified. LNF was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of postoperative dysphagia (RR 1·61 (95 per cent confidence interval 1·06 to 2·44); P = 0·02) and dilatation for dysphagia (RR 2·45 (1·06 to 5·68); P = 0·04).

Aim To review systematically the effects of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease on work productivity. Methods Studies of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and work productivity were identified in a systematic literature search and their results were valued in US dollars using the human capital method. Work productivity loss was defined as absence from work (absenteeism) plus reduced effectiveness while working (presenteeism). Results Eight eligible studies were included. Reported work productivity loss among individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ranged from 6% to 42% and was primarily because of presenteeism (6–40%) rather than absenteeism (&lt;1% to 7%). Reported losses were greatest in patients experiencing sleep disturbance because of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, and lowest in individuals from the general population taking appropriate prescription medication. Work productivity impairment correlated with symptom severity and responded to acid‐suppressive therapy.

Of 137 consecutive patients with GORD, 72 were allocated to a semifundoplication (180–200°, Toupet) and 65 to a total fundoplication (360°, Nissen–Rossetti). Dysphagia was more common in the early postoperative period after a total fundic wrap, a difference which disappeared with time. This corresponded to a higher resting tone in the lower oesophageal sphincter area. Seven patients (5 per cent) experienced relapse of GORD during follow-up of more than 3 years. Although no difference in the cumulative relapse rate (5 per cent for Nissen–Rossetti versus 6 per cent for Toupet) was found between the two study groups, the total failure rate was higher (P&amp;lt;0·05) among patients who had a Nissen-Rossetti procedure because of a procedure-specific complication: intrathoracic herniation of the fundoplication in five patients caused obstructive symptoms without reflux (four had no posterior crural repair). In addition, symptoms in the form of flatulence were more frequently seen after Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication (P&amp;lt;0·05 at 2 years and P&amp;lt;0·01 at 3 years). Both Nissen–Rossetti and Toupet fundoplication equally well and durably controlled GORD. Fewer symptoms occurred in those having a semifundoplication, both in the early and late postoperative period.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800830633", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078645396", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To review the current knowledge on the underlying factors contributing to GERD, with particular emphasis on the most recent research. Methods Literature searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE. The abstracts from recent large congresses were also reviewed to ensure coverage of the latest findings. Results The pathophysiological factors causing GERD can be split into those inducing greater exposure of the oesophagus to stomach contents, and those that provide increased perception of reflux or increased mucosal damage. Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, which are likely to be triggered by gastric distension, appear to be a key physiological cause of GERD. Excessive reflux may also be provoked by impaired oesophageal or gastric clearance mechanisms. Pre‐epithelial, epithelial and post‐epithelial defences all normally protect the oesophagus from injury, and may be compromised in individuals with GERD. Heartburn could also be caused by oesophageal hypersensitivity as a result of visceral neural pathway dysfunction.

GERD may be overlooked as the underlying mechanism for these symptoms because typical GERD symptoms may be absent, despite abnormal oesophageal acid exposure. Two basic mechanisms linking GERD with laryngeal symptoms have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway, in some cases due to micro‐aspiration, and a vagovagal reflex triggered by acidification of the distal portion of the oesophagus. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GER) during sleep is believed to be an important mechanism for the development of supra‐oesophageal complications of GERD, such as asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Several physiological changes during sleep, including prolonged oesophageal acid contact time, decreased upper oesophageal sphincter pressure, increased gastric acid secretion, decreased salivation, decreased swallowing and a decrease in conscious perception of acid, render an individual more susceptible to reflux‐induced injury. Supra‐oesophageal symptoms often improve in response to aggressive acid‐suppressive therapy. However, many unanswered questions remain regarding the appropriate approach to diagnosis and treatment of patients with GERD‐related supra‐oesophageal symptoms. In this article we review the relationship between supra‐oesophageal symptoms and GERD and, where possible, highlight the evidence supporting the role of night‐time reflux as a contributing factor to these symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02253.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096251450", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the independent effect of weight loss on reflux symptoms in overweight individuals with either normal endoscopic findings or grade-I oesophagitis. Methods: Thirty-four patients were recruited on the basis of a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 23 and symptoms of GORD for at least 6 months. All patients were advised to lose weight. Symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) were scored, using a modified DeMeester questionnaire at 0, 6, and 26 weeks. Patients who were unable to stop taking all medication for control of symptoms were excluded from the study. Changes in weight and symptom score were analysed by using a paired t test. Correlation between change in weight and symptom score was assessed with the Pearson correlation test. Results: Thirty-four patients were studied (18 men and 16 women) with a mean age of 65 years (range, 24-70 years). The mean weight at recruitment was 83.4 kg (standard deviation (s), 4.5 kg; BMI, 23.5 kg/m2 (s, 2.3 kg/m2).

The fundamental concern is that reflux is a risk factor for recurrent microaspiration, which may cause lung injury. For example, in lung transplant patients, a molecular marker of aspiration was a risk factor for the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in one study. To date, however, there are no large prospective studies measuring the impact of aspiration on clinical outcomes. The major obstacle limiting the study of reflux and aspiration in patients with advanced lung disease is the absence of a reliable diagnostic tool. Proximal oesophageal acid detection by pH monitoring is the only widely available measure of aspiration risk. Impedance monitoring may be a superior measure of aspiration risk as it measures both acid and non-acid reflux episodes. Molecular markers of aspiration, such as pepsin or bile salts in the bronchoalveolar lavage or exhaled breath condensate, may be the optimal diagnostic tests, but they are not currently available outside the research setting. Larger observational studies are needed to determine the following: (1) the clinical significance of aspiration in patients with advanced lung disease and in patients who have had lung transplantation and (2) the diagnostic test that best predicts adverse outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.2007.082719", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170106910", "source": "openalex"}

Typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are heartburn and regurgitation but gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis. The pathogenesis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease can be considered as the result of a complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W61329766", "source": "openalex"}

Outcomes assessed included GERD symptoms; gross oesophageal injury; Barrett's oesophagus and related neoplasia; and intermediate markers of inflammation, proliferation or neoplasia.

In in vivo studies, bile acids concentrations were higher in the oesophageal aspirates of patients with GERD than controls, and bile acids infusions triggered GERD symptoms, especially in high concentrations or in combination with acid. In ex vivo/in vitro studies, bile acids stimulated squamous oesophageal cells and Barrett's epithelial cells to produce inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-8 and COX-2) and caused oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. They also induced squamous cells to change their gene expression pattern to resemble intestinal-type cells and caused Barrett's cells to increase expression of intestinal-type genes.

The aim of this study was to prospectively determine the clinical utility of 68 Ga-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in detecting unknown primary and metastatic GEPNETs. Patients and Methods One hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in a prospective study of patients undergoing 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 111 In-pentetreotide single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT and multiphasic CT scan, and/or magnetic resonance imaging in a blinded fashion with comprehensive biochemical testing. The primary outcome measure was the detection of lesions by each imaging study. Results 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging detected 95.1% of lesions (95% CI, 92.4% to 96.8%) with an average maximum standardized uptake value of 65.4 ± 47 (range, 6.9 to 244), anatomic imaging detected 45.3% of lesions (95% CI, 37.9% to 52.9%), and 111 In-pentetreotide SPECT/CT detected 30.9% of lesions (95% CI, 25.0% to 37.5%), with a significant difference between imaging modalities (P &lt; .001). In four of 14 patients (28.6%), 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT found a previously unknown primary tumor, and detected primary GEPNET, lymph node, and distant metastases correctly in 72 of 113 lesions (63.7%) when compared with histopathology, with 22.1% and 38.9% detected by using 111 In-pentetreotide SPECT/CT and anatomic imaging, respectively. On the basis of findings with 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 43 of 131 patients (32.8%) had a change in management recommendation. In patients with carcinoid symptoms but negative biochemical testing, 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT detected lesions in 65.2% of patients, 40% of which were detected neither by anatomic imaging nor by 111 In-pentetreotide SPECT/CT. Conclusion 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging provides important information for accurate staging of GEPNETs and selection of appropriate treatment interventions even in the absence of biochemical evidence of disease in symptomatic patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2015.64.0987", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2211232874", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2042958565", "title": "Review article: the pathophysiology of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease − oesophageal manifestations", "text": "Summary The pathogenesis of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) as well as other lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure abnormalities. GERD is associated with a decrease in LES pressure, which can be provoked by factors such as foods (fat, chocolate, etc.), alcohol, smoking and medications. These factors have also been shown to increase TLESRs. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury, which can potentially progress to oesophageal adenocarcinoma in a minority of patients with Barrett's metaplasia. In addition, duodenogastric contents can also contribute to oesophageal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of GERD include hiatal hernia, poor oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia has a permissive role in the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis by promoting LES dysfunction. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of TLESRs, contributing to postprandial GER. The mucosal defensive factors have an important role in GERD. When excessive acid causes a breakdown in oesophageal epithelial defenses, epithelial resistance may be reduced. Nocturnal GERD is associated with prolonged acid exposure and proximal extent of acid contact, which elevates the risk for oesophageal damage and GERD‐related complications. In sum, GERD is a complex problem caused by many factors that are exacerbated when the patient is in the supine position.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02238.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042958565", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are less responsive than patients with oesophagitis to acid‐suppressive therapy. Aim: To assess the role of acid reflux in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Methods: The spatio‐temporal characteristics of reflux events were analysed and related to reflux perception in 45 patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and 20 patients with erosive oesophagitis. Results: Compared with healthy controls, all patients showed a higher intra‐oesophageal proximal spread of acid, which was prominent in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (&gt; 50% of events lasting for 1–2 min). Irrespective of mucosal injury, the risk of reflux perception was very high when acid reached proximal sensors (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.6–12.5), being maximal in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease with normal acid exposure time (odds ratio, 11; 95% confidence interval, 5.2–22.3). Conclusions: Patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are characterized by a significantly higher proportion of proximal acid refluxes and a higher sensitivity to short‐lasting refluxes when compared with patients with oesophagitis. The highest proximal acid exposure and highest perception occurred in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease presenting with a normal pH‐metric profile. The assessment of acid distribution and its perception in the oesophageal body can better identify reflux patients who should benefit from acid‐suppressive treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.01702.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046430423", "source": "openalex"}

These Gastro Retentive Systems have been quite investigated because they can improve the in-vivo performance of many drugs. Areas covered: This paper summarizes current approaches in the research and development of gastro retentive dosage forms from recent literature. Apart from the numerous mechanisms of action involved, a short review of different key parameters is proposed, taking into account the stomach physiology. Most of the current technologies published, patented or marketed are presented. Promising drugs to develop in the near future are mentioned, and the importance of such systems in fixed Dose Combinations is also discussed. The importance of food effect is mentioned, and the impact of the multiple unit systems versus monolithic approach is discussed, especially regarding the dose intake. Expert opinion: In conclusion, numerous mechanisms like floating, sinking, effervescence, swelling, bioadhesion, magnetic, etc. have been proposed over the years. While most of the proposed systems show promising dissolution profiles and in-vitro retention, only few of them have also shown success in-vivo. Currently, the polymeric swelling monolithic systems are the most prominent marketed forms. The possibility to combine different mechanisms in order to ensure true gastric retention even in the fasted state should be further investigated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2011.592828", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164547260", "source": "openalex"}

In infants and children it is particularly difficult to differentiate between the two conditions because of the wide variety of potential symptoms and the lack of a simple, reliable, and widely available diagnostic test. The true burden of the problem is therefore difficult to quantify, and it is accepted that clinical practice varies greatly. Children affected by the disease include premature and term neonates, otherwise well infants and children, and those with known risk factors, such as repaired diaphragmatic hernia and other congenital anomalies or severe neurodisabilities. This last group of children may have complex comorbidities and the underlying pathophysiology may have important differences.

This updated consensus focuses on proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease and Barrett9s oesophagus. <h3>Methods</h3> A steering committee identified three areas to address: (1) burden of disease and diagnosis of reflux disease; (2) proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease; (3) Barrett9s oesophagus. Three working groups formulated draft statements with supporting evidence. Discussions were done via email before a final face-to-face discussion. We used a Delphi consensus process, with a 70% agreement threshold, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to categorise the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 32 statements were proposed and 31 were accepted by consensus. A rise in the prevalence rates of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Asia was noted, with the majority being non-erosive reflux disease. Overweight and obesity contributed to the rise. Proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease was recognised to be common. A distinction was made between refractory symptoms and refractory reflux disease, with clarification of the roles of endoscopy and functional testing summarised in two algorithms. The definition of Barrett9s oesophagus was revised such that a minimum length of 1 cm was required and the presence of intestinal metaplasia no longer necessary.

Age-standardized cancer death rates in migrrants, by country of origin, sex, age, and duration of residence in Australia (less than or equal to 16 years and greater than 16 years), have been calculated for 1962-76, and compared with those of the Australian-born population. All seven migrant source countries, in 1970, had higher rates of stomach cancer than Australia, and the corresponding migrants groups, which initially reflected those higher rates, experienced an approximately 25% risk reduction with increased duration of residence. For cancer of the pancreas, migrants initially had rates well above their \"native\" rates; with longer stay, the risks generally converged upon that of the Australian-born population. The four \"continental\" (European) migrant groups, whose native risk of colon cancer is about half that of the Australian population, showed an increased risk with increasing duration of stay. The increase was greater in men than in women, perhaps reflecting their greater dietary acculturation. By contrast, Scottish migrants, with an initially high risk of cigrants showed even larger increases than colon cancer, while in British migrants there was a marked decline towards the \"Australian-borne\" risk. These various changes in cancer risk are discussed with reference to inter-country dietary differences.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910250402", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2037948309", "source": "openalex"}

Conditions such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa, chronic alcoholism and gastric disturbances cause palatal dental erosion. The common factor in these conditions is the role played by the stomach and oesophagus in the acid movement. Acid moving through the lower oesophageal sphincter into the oesophagus is described as gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR). In some patients the acid movement becomes chronic, painful and requires treatment and is termed gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). It is felt by many gastroenterologists that GORD is a failure of the anti‐reflux mechanism, which is predominantly controlled by the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). Regurgitation is the reflux of gastric juice through the upper oesophageal sphincter and into the oral cavity. Once the acid has reached the mouth the potential exists for damage to the teeth.

The integrity of the gut wall is sustained by transcellular proteins forming tight junctions between the epithelial cells. Protected by three layers of mucin, the gut wall forms a non-permeable barrier, keeping digestive enzymes and microorganisms within the luminal space, separate from the blood stream. Microorganisms colonizing the gut may produce bacteriocins in an attempt to outcompete pathogens. Production of bacteriocins in a harsh and complex environment such as the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) may be below minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels. At such low levels, the stability of bacteriocins may be compromised. Despite this, most bacteria in the gut has the ability to produce bacteriocins, distributed throughout the GIT. With most antimicrobial studies being performed in vitro, we know little about the migration of bacteriocins across epithelial barriers. The behaviour of bacteriocins in the GIT is studied ex vivo, using models, flow cells, or membranes resembling the gut wall. Furthermore, little is known about the effect bacteriocins have on the immune system. It is generally believed that the peptides will be destroyed by macrophages once they cross the gut wall. Studies done on the survival of neurotherapeutic peptides and their crossing of the brain-blood barrier, along with other studies on small peptides intravenously injected, may provide some answers. In this review the stability of bacteriocins in the GIT, their effect on gut epithelial cells and their ability to cross epithelial cells are discussed. These are important questions to address in the light of recent papers advocating the use of bacteriocins as possible alternatives to, or used in combination with, antibiotics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02297", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2894068917", "source": "openalex"}

The results of the laparoscopic group were disappointing with a conversion rate of 9%, a perioperative complication rate of 10·5%, dysphagia requiring dilatation or reoperation in 12·3% of the patients, and a reoperation rate of 5·3%. These findings are at variance with the results of many larger published series on laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. When compared with the collective review by Perdikis and colleagues of 23 early reports on laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in 2453 patients,2Perdikis G Hinder RA Lund RJ Raiser F Katada N Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication: where do we stand?.Surg Laparosc Endosc. 1997; 7: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar the conversion rate in the study by Bais and colleagues is roughly double, the wrap hernia rate is quadruple, the dysphagia rate is triple, and the reoperating rate is five times higher. The fact that these data are taken from a randomised study is not likely to explain the differences. The only other randomised trial3Laine S Rantala A Gullischsen R Ovaska J Laparoscopic versus conventional Nissen fundoplication.Surg Endosc. 1997; 11: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar showed similar low rates of preoperative complications, including dysphagia, for laparoscopic and open Nissen fundoplication. In the latter study the follow-up was completed in 90% of the patients at 3 months. Bais and colleagues rule out limited laparoscopic experience as an explanation of the high rate of adverse outcomes. The investigators stated that the supervisors of the laparoscopic Nissen procedures had gone through the learning curve as defined by Watson and colleagues.4Watson DI Baigri RJ Jamieson GG A learning curve: definable, avoidable, or waste of time.Ann Surg. 1996; 2: 198-203Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar Watson and colleagues clearly indicated that the risk of adverse outcomes was increased when less than 50 laparoscopic fundoplications had been done by any one institution. In the trial by Bais and colleagues 11 hospitals carried out a mean of 5·2 laparoscopic fundoplications during 18 months. In only one of these 11 institutions more than 50 fundoplications were done, and this institution contributed five patients for laparoscopic fundoplication to the study. Limited surgical experience with the laparoscopic fundoplication seems, at least in part, responsible for the results. Dysphagia accompanying the Nissen procedure is most probably related to making the fundoplication or crural repair too tight. This complication occurs more easily with the laparoscopic procedure, since the tactile dimension is lost. Ninety percent of the experienced centres report circumventing this complication by standard insertion of a bougie of 40–60 French during the creation of a wrap. The study by Bais and colleagues does not give the answer to which is the best operative therapy for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Rather, it shows that good results are obtained by surgeons experienced in open surgery, whereas disappointing results are produced by surgeons learning how to do the more difficult laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

We investigated acid and weakly acidic reflux, aspiration and respiratory symptoms/function in adult CF patients. <h3>Methods:</h3> Thirty-three CF patients [19 men; 29 (18–55) years, [10 post-lung transplant (LTx)] underwent impedance–pH monitoring for detection of acid (pH&lt;4) and weakly acid GOR (pH 4–7). In 16 patients cough was objectively recorded with oesophageal manometry, and the symptom association probability (SAP) was calculated. Saliva and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were tested for bile acids. <h3>Results:</h3> Twenty-eight patients had increased GOR (21 acid, 5 weakly acidic and 2 acid+weakly acidic) and 10 had a positive SAP for reflux cough. GOR parameters were similar in non-LTx and post-LTx CF patients. The sequence reflux cough was significantly more common than cough reflux. Sixteen of 38 patients had bile acids in saliva and 6/10 in BALF and this was almost exclusively observed in patients with genotype DF508/DF508. Only 12/28 with increased GOR and 9/22 with bile acids in saliva/BALF had typical reflux symptoms. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.53, p = 0.03) between oesophageal acid exposure and cough. SAP-positive patients with for reflux cough had a lower lung function than SAP-negative patients. <h3>Conclusion:</h3> Increased GOR is prevalent in CF and not secondary to cough. Acid GOR is common, but weakly acidic GOR may also occur. CF patients have a high risk of aspiration and reflux seems to be associated with more cough and poorer lung function. Outcome studies with intense anti-reflux therapy are needed to confirm the deleterious role of reflux in CF progression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2007.146134", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152843103", "source": "openalex"}

Two hundred and twenty patients diagnosed with gastric/oesophageal cancer were studied. Patients underwent nutritional assessment consisting of calculation of body mass index, measurement of weight loss, dysphagia scoring and estimation of dietary intake. Serum acute-phase protein concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In all, 182 (83%) patients had lost weight at diagnosis (median loss, 7% body weight). Weight loss was associated with poor performance status, advanced disease stage, dysphagia, reduced dietary intake and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Multiple regression identified dietary intake (estimate of effect, 38%), serum CRP concentrations (estimate of effect, 34%) and stage of disease (estimate of effect, 28%) as independent variables in determining degree of weight loss. Mechanisms other than reduced dietary intake or mechanical obstruction by the tumour appear to be involved in the nutritional decline in patients with gastro-oesophageal malignancy. Recognition that systemic inflammation plays a role in nutritional depletion may inform the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies to ameliorate weight loss, making patients more tolerant of cancer-modifying treatments such as chemotherapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjc.6604828", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986511685", "source": "openalex"}

The interfacial activity of lipase and surfactants are assessed with the pendant drop technique, a commonly used tensiometry instrument. A mathematical model is adopted which enables quantitative determination of the composition of the water-oil interface as a function of bulk surfactant concentration in the water-oil mixtures. Our results show a decrease in gastric lipolysis when interfacially active molecules are incorporated into a food matrix. However, only the Sn-2 monopalmitin caused a systematic decrease in triglyceride hydrolysis throughout the gastro-intestinal tract. This effect is most likely due to exclusion of both lipase and triglyceride from the water-oil interface together with a probable saturation of the solubilization capacity of bile with monoglycerides. Addition of beta-lactoglobulin or lysophopholipids increased the hydrolysis of fat after the gastric phase. These results can be attributed to an increasing interfacial area with lipase and substrate present at the interface. Otherwise, beta-lactoglobulin, or lysophopholipids reduced fat hydrolysis in the stomach. From the mathematical modeling of the interface composition, we can conclude that Sn-2 monopalmitin can desorb lipase from the interface, which, together with exclusion of substrate from the interface, explains the gradually decreased triglyceride hydrolysis that occurs during the digestion. Our results provide a biophysics approach on lipolysis that can bring new insights into the problem of fat uptake.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11483-008-9091-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2034644440", "source": "openalex"}

This method, however, is invasive, time consuming, expensive, and not generally available. AIMS: As histological changes have been described in GORD, this study looked at the possibility of whether the diagnosis of non-erosive reflux disease could be made by histological examination routinely during endoscopy. SUBJECTS: A total of 24 prospectively selected patients with symptoms suggestive of GORD and seven healthy volunteers. METHODS: Oesophageal erosions and other peptic lesions were excluded by oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy. Oesophageal pinch biopsy specimens were taken 2 cm and 5 cm above the oesophagogastric junction and evaluated blindly for the histological parameters cellular infiltration, basal zone hyperplasia, and papillary length. Twenty four hour pH monitoring was used as gold standard for the definition of reflux disease. It was abnormal in 13 patients (reflux patients) and normal in 11 patients (symptomatic controls) and in seven healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Sparse infiltration of the epithelium with lymphocytes in at least one biopsy specimen was found in all patients and volunteers, with neutrophils in three reflux patients, and with eosinophils in two reflux patients and in two healthy volunteers. The basal zone thickness was increased in three reflux patients, in one symptomatic control, and in one healthy volunteer. The papillary length was greater than two thirds of total epithelium in six of 13 reflux patients in contrast with none in 11 symptomatic controls (p &lt; 0.05) and to one healthy volunteer. The sensitivity of the parameter papillary length hence was only 46%. CONCLUSIONS: Although gastro-oesophageal reflux produces slight histological changes apart from oesophageal erosions in a few subjects, none of the established histological parameters can fulfil the for the diagnosis of GORD in patients without visible oesophageal erosions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.39.2.151", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118107519", "source": "openalex"}

This study assessed 20 mg omeprazole daily (OM20), 10 mg omeprazole daily (OM10), and 150 mg ranitidine (RAN) twice daily for symptom relief in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Methods: Patients (n = 994) presenting with heartburn to their general practitioner underwent endoscopy to exclude peptic ulcer disease and were randomized into a UK, multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind comparison of the three treatments for 4 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at clinic visits after 2 and 4 weeks.

In addition to a remarkable lack of supporting clinical evidence, whether GERD patients have shorter dinner-to-bed time is unknown. This study was designed to determine a possible association between dinner-to-bed time and GERD, compared with healthy adults. METHODS In a matched case-control study, we enrolled 147 GERD patients, and age- and sex-matched 294 controls without GERD symptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation during the previous year. Dinner-to-bed time, defined as the time intervals until going to bed after finishing eating dinner, was examined by a self-report questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for GERD. RESULTS After adjustment for smoking habits, drinking habits, and body mass index, shorter dinner-to-bed time was significantly associated with an increased OR of GERD (p < 0.0001) and the OR for patients whose dinner-to-bed time was less than 3 h was 7.45 (95% CI 3.38–16.4) compared with patients whose dinner-to-bed time was 4 h or more. These observations were consistent in both patients with nonerosive GERD and erosive esophagitis, and there was no significant difference in dinner-to-bed time intervals between nonerosive GERD and erosive esophagitis.

Methods —Retrospective cohort study involving all 172 hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs. A total of 194 527 patients with GORD were followed between 1981 and 1994. Distribution of oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcer, oesophageal stricture, strictured hiatus hernia, hiatus hernia, and pyrosis by age, sex, and ethnicity were determined. The comorbid occurrence of various forms of GORD in identical patients was analysed by an age and race standardised morbidity ratio. The population of all hospitalised veterans was used for comparison. Results —Severe forms of GORD associated with oesophageal erosions, ulcers, or strictures, affected elderly, white, male patients more often than their corresponding opposite demographic group. All forms of GORD clustered in the same patient population; on average, any form of GORD was 10 times more likely to occur in a patient with another form of GORD than without. The highest morbidity ratio (22) was found in oesophageal ulcer and stricture. About one third of all patients with oesophageal erosions, ulcers, or strictures also had hiatus hernia; 46% of patients with hiatus hernia were diagnosed as having other forms of GORD. While one third of all oesophageal strictures appeared in patients without other forms of GORD diagnosed at any time, oesophageal ulcers were always associated with some other form of GORD. No clear cut progression in different forms of GORD was found. Conclusions —Older age, male sex, and white ethnicity are risk factors in the development of severe forms of GORD.

Methods A panel of international experts met to discuss the principles and practice of treating GERD. Results The updated algorithm for the management of GERD can be followed by pharmacists, for over‐the‐counter medications, primary care physicians, or secondary care gastroenterologists. The algorithm emphasizes the importance of life style changes to help control the triggers for heartburn and adjuvant therapies for rapid and adequate symptom relief. Proton pump inhibitors will remain a prominent treatment for GERD; however, the use of antacids and alginate‐antacids (either alone or in combination with acid suppressants) is likely to increase.

It is unclear whether medical or surgical (laparoscopic fundoplication) management is the most clinically and cost-effective treatment for controlling GORD.To compare the effects of medical management versus laparoscopic fundoplication surgery on health-related and GORD-specific quality of life (QOL) in adults with GORD.We searched CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to May 2009). We handsearched conference abstracts and reference lists from published trials to identify further trials. We contacted experts in the field for relevant unpublished material.All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing medical management with laparoscopic fundoplication surgery.Two authors independently extracted data from articles identified for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials. Primary outcomes were: health-related and GORD-specific QOL, heartburn, regurgitation and dysphagia.Four trials were included with a total of 1232 randomised participants. Health-related QOL was reported by four studies although data were combined using fixed-effect models for two studies (Anvari 2006; REFLUX Trial 2008). There were statistically significant improvements in health-related QOL at three months and one year after surgery compared to medical therapy (mean difference (MD) SF36 general health score -5.23, 95% CI -6.83 to -3.62; I(2) = 0%). All four studies reported significant improvements in GORD-specific QOL after surgery compared to medical therapy although data were not combined. There is evidence to suggest that symptoms of heartburn, reflux and bloating are improved after surgery compared to medical therapy, but a small proportion of participants have persistent postoperative dysphagia. Overall rates of postoperative complications were low but surgery is not without risk and postoperative adverse events occurred although they were uncommon. The costs of surgery are considerably higher than the cost of medical management although data are based on the first year of treatment therefore the cost and side effects associated with long-term treatment of chronic GORD need to be considered.There is evidence that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery is more effective than medical management for the treatment of GORD at least in the short to medium term. Surgery does carry some risk and whether the benefits of surgery are sustained in the long term remains uncertain.

Evidence exists that both posture and physical activity may influence reflux. The aim of this study was to investigate reflux mechanisms in ambulant patients with reflux oesophagitis. Concurrent ambulatory oesophageal manometry and pH monitoring were performed in 11 ambulant patients with erosive oesophagitis. Lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure was monitored with a perfused sleeve sensor. Recordings were made for 90 min before and 180 min after a meal. At set times patients sat in a chair or walked. LOS pressure was ≤2 mmHg at the time of reflux for 98% of reflux episodes. Transient LOS relaxation was the most common pattern overall and the predominant pattern in seven patients, whilst persistently absent basal LOS pressure was the most common pattern in four patients. The pattern of LOS pressure was not altered by the presence of hiatus hernia or by walking. Straining occurred at the onset of 31% of acid reflux episodes but often followed the development of an oesophageal common cavity. The occurrence of straining was not influenced by walking. In ambulant patients with reflux oesophagitis: (1) LOS pressure is almost always absent at the time of reflux, usually because of transient LOS relaxation, (2) persistently absent basal LOS pressure is an important mechanism of reflux in a few patients, (3) straining may help to induce acid reflux in a variable proportion of occasions and may in some instances be a response to gas reflux, and (4) walking does not influence the occurrence of reflux or its mechanisms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.1996.tb00253.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140796835", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Infants with GORD (defined by 24‐h pH monitoring, n = 20), and age, gender, gestation, and socio‐economic matched healthy infants ( n = 20) had standardised assessments of dietary intake, oromotor function by videoanalysis (Feeding Assessment Schedule, FAS), and infant feeding behaviour by Testers and Maternal Ratings (TRIB and MRIB). Videofluoroscopic analyses of swallowing was undertaken in 11/20 GORD infants and analysed by standardised paediatric check list. Results: Compared with control data: GORD infants had significantly lower energy intakes; the FAS showed GORD infants to have significantly fewer adaptive skills and readiness behaviour for solids, significantly more food refusal and food loss; the TRIB showed GORD infants to be significantly more demanding and difficult with feeds; and the MRIB revealed that mothers of GORD infants had significantly more negative feelings, significantly less enjoyment of feeds, and reported significantly more crying behaviour. On videofluoroscopy, oral‐preparatory and oral phase problems predominated, particularly with solids, silent aspiration occurred during the pharyngeal phase in 2/11, and delayed oesophageal transit occurred in 4/11. Conclusions: Feeding problems affecting behaviour, swallowing, food intake, and mother–child interaction occur in infants with GORD, who displayed a lack of development of age‐appropriate feeding skills. The contribution of feeding problems to morbidity in GORD in infants has been underestimated in the past.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1754.1999.t01-1-00334.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1526215896", "source": "openalex"}

Patients underwent oesophageal manometry, 24 hour oesophageal pH testing, and symptom score evaluation by an independent observer before and six months after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. <h3>RESULTS</h3> One hundred and thirty three patients presented with reflux symptoms and 62 with respiratory symptoms; 68% of patients complained of cough before surgery (86% with respiratory symptoms, 60% with gastrointestinal symptoms). The percentage reflux time in 24 hours fell significantly (p&lt;0.0001) from a mean (SD) of 9.38 (10.99)% to 1.22 (2.92)%, lower oesophageal sphincter tone rose significantly (p&lt;0.0001) from a mean (SD) of 7.71 (5.90) mm Hg to 21.74 (10.84) mm Hg, and the cough score fell from a median value of 8.0 (IQR 12.0) to 0 (IQR 3) following surgery.

Design : Randomised, multicentre, double blind, controlled study. Patients with heartburn and normal endoscopy results or mild erosive changes received omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Patients remaining symptomatic had omeprazole 10 mg or ranitidine dose doubled for another 2 weeks while omeprazole 20 mg was continued for 2 weeks. Patients who were symptomatic or mildly symptomatic were followed up for 12 months. Recurrences of moderate or severe heartburn during follow up were treated with the dose which was successful for initial symptom control. Setting : Hospitals and primary care practices between 1994 and 1996. Subjects : 677 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Main outcome measures : Total time off active treatment, time to failure of intermittent treatment, and outcomes ranked from best to worst. Results : 704 patients were randomised, 677 were eligible for analyses; 318 reached the end of the study with intermittent treatment without recourse to maintenance antisecretory drugs. The median number of days off active treatment during follow up was 142 for the entire study (281 for the 526 patients who reached a treatment related end point). Thus, about half the patients did not require treatment for at least 6 months, and this was similar in all three treatment groups. According to outcome, 378 (72%) patients were in the best outcome ranks (no relapse or one (or more) relapse but in remission until 12 months); 630 (93%) had three or fewer relapses in the intermittent treatment phase. Omeprazole 20 mg provided faster relief of heartburn. The results were similar in patients with erosive and non-erosive disease.

Aim To assess the importance of non‐acid reflux mechanisms. Methods This review is based on presentations and discussion at a workshop, where specialists in the field analysed data relating to these mechanisms. Results Weakly acidic reflux, pH (4–7), detected with impedance–pHmetry is associated with regurgitation and atypical gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. It is not clear whether pepsin and trypsin can elicit symptoms, but bile can elicit heartburn. The magnitude of reflux‐induced oesophageal distension can be determined by high frequency ultrasonography and is not reduced by proton pump inhibition, suggesting that persisting symptoms ‘on’ a proton pump inhibitor may still be due to oesophageal distension by non‐acidic reflux. Exaggerated longitudinal muscle contraction can induce non‐acid‐related heartburn. Preliminary studies showed a positive effect of baclofen, surgery or endoscopic procedures to reduce weakly acidic reflux.

Recent findings have unveiled the role of components of the esophageal mucosa in the pathogenesis of GERD including sensory nociceptive nerves and inflammatory mediators. Erosive esophagitis was long believed to develop as a result of acid injury at the esophageal lumen, but novel concepts suggest the generation of reflux‐induced esophageal injury as a result of cytokine‐mediated inflammation. Moreover, the localization and characterization of mucosal afferent nerves vary between GERD phenotypes and could explain the heterogeneity of symptom perception between patients who experience similar levels of acid reflux. Purpose The purpose of this review is to consider the crosstalk of different factors of the esophageal mucosa in the pathogenesis of GERD, with a particular focus on mucosal innervation and molecular basis of acid‐induced cytokine response. We discuss the current understanding of the mucosal response to acid injury, the nociceptive role of acid‐sensitive receptors expressed in the esophageal mucosa, and the role of esophageal epithelial cells in initiating the onset of erosive esophagitis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14022", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3096315061", "source": "openalex"}

However, the mucosal changes of reflux oesophagitis and intestinal metaplasia tend to affect the segment of oesophagus distal to this and close to the squamocolumnar junction. This study set out to investigate oesophageal acid exposure of squamous mucosa close to the squamocolumnar junction.Dual channel 24 hour pH monitoring was carried out in 11 patients with endoscopy negative dyspepsia and no evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux by conventional oesophageal pH metry. Oesophageal pH was recorded from electrodes positioned 5 mm and 55 mm proximal to the squamocolumnar junction. A novel technique was developed using metal clips to secure the pH catheter to the oesophageal mucosa and maintain these electrode positions. Oesophageal manometry indicated that the distal electrode was within the high pressure zone of the lower oesophageal sphincter.We found that 24 hour oesophageal acid exposure (per cent time pH <4) was greater 5 mm above the squamocolumnar junction compared with the conventional position 5 cm more proximal (11.7% v 1.8%; p<0.001). The greater acid exposure at the distal versus the conventional site was apparent in both the upright (12.7% v 2.3%) and supine (10.5% v 1.3%) positions, as well as during preprandial (14.2% v 1.6%) and postprandial (21.8% v 2.8%) periods (p<0.001 for each). The number of reflux events recorded close to the squamocolumnar junction was also higher than at the conventional position (168 v 33; p<0.001). There was no correlation between acid exposure at the two sites.The squamous mucosa of the most distal oesophagus is exposed to substantial acidic reflux, even in patients without evidence of conventional reflux disease. This short segment reflux may explain the high incidence of metaplasia and neoplasia at the gastro-oesophageal junction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2003.022160", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142210203", "source": "openalex"}

These patients underwent combined recording of distal oesophageal motility and intraluminal pH in order to investigate mechanisms of GOR. Inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation was the most common mechanism of reflux in all patients. Other mechanisms (appropriate relaxation or lowered pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter, increased intragastric pressure) were detected less frequently. Frequency of inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations was significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis than in other study groups (symptomatic GOR, GOR disease complicated by respiratory complaints). Inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations occurred with the same frequency in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a group of children with GOR disease complicated by oesophagitis. Abnormalities of distal oesophageal contractions such as decreased amplitude or uncoordinated waves were also recorded in cystic fibrosis patients. Seven patients with cystic fibrosis completed a therapeutic trial for eight weeks consisting of postural treatment and oral cisapride, a new prokinetic drug. The oesophageal acid exposure improved in only three patients. We conclude that pathologic GOR is commonly associated with cystic fibrosis. The predominant reflux mechanism in these patients is a transient inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation rather than a low steady state basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/adc.66.5.617", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013287276", "source": "openalex"}

Aim : To analyse the presence of dilated intercellular spaces and to quantify the scores in controls and in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease or duodenal gastro‐oesophageal reflux accompanied by erosive or non‐erosive reflux disease. Methods : Thirty‐eight symptomatic patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease or duodenal gastro‐oesophageal reflux and 12 asymptomatic controls, classified on the basis of pH‐metry and bilimetry, underwent endoscopy. Six tissue biopsies were taken from the normal mucosa for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy evaluation. Dilated intercellular spaces were measured on photomicrographs of the specimens (at least 100 transects were measured for each patient). Results : Twenty‐two patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease had normal macroscopic mucosa but, at histology, five patients with erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease had mild oesophagitis and one had moderate oesophagitis. Seven patients with duodenal gastro‐oesophageal reflux had normal mucosa, whilst three with erosive duodenal gastro‐oesophageal reflux had mild oesophagitis at histology. At transmission electron microscopy, all controls had dilated intercellular spaces of less than 1.69 µm. Each symptomatic patient had a mean dilated intercellular space value and a mean value of the maximum dilated intercellular space at least three or more times greater than that in controls ( P &lt; 0.001). No statistical differences were observed between erosive and non‐erosive oesophagitis. Conclusions : The dilated intercellular space is an extremely sensitive marker of damage in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, duodenal gastro‐oesophageal reflux and non‐erosive reflux disease, and serves as the most appropriate marker of damage evaluation in non‐erosive reflux disease reported to date. A mean dilated intercellular space of 0.74 µm provides a cut‐off score for damage.

Aim To examine the association between psychiatric and psychological factors and reflux symptoms. Methods Population‐based, cross‐sectional, case–control study based on two health surveys conducted in the Norwegian county Nord‐Trondelag in 1984–1986 and 1995–1997. Reflux symptoms were assessed in the second survey, including 65 333 participants (70% of the county’s adult population). 3153 subjects reporting severe reflux symptoms were defined as cases and 40 210 subjects without symptoms were defined as controls. Data were collected in questionnaires. Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, in adjusted models. Results Subjects reporting anxiety without depression had a 3.2‐fold (95% CI: 2.7–3.8) increased risk of reflux, subjects with depression without anxiety had a 1.7‐fold (95% CI: 1.4–2.1) increased risk and subjects with both anxiety and depression had a 2.8‐fold (95% CI: 2.4–3.2) increased risk, compared to subjects without anxiety/depression.

For most symptomatic patients, reflux events occur during both daytime and night‐time hours. Whereas daytime reflux events tend to be frequent but brief, reflux events that occur during sleep are comparatively less frequent but significantly longer. Longer oesophageal acid‐clearance and acid‐mucosal contact times during sleep are at least partly due to several physiological changes associated with sleep, including dramatic declines in saliva production and frequency of swallowing, decreased conscious perception of heartburn and consequent arousal and clearance behaviours, and slower gastric emptying. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and obesity seem to predispose some patients to nocturnal GERD, and the presence of either of these conditions may help to identify patients with symptoms consistent with GERD. Recognition and treatment of night‐time GERD are important because it can be associated with decreased quality of life (including sleep disruption) and increased risk of serious oesophageal and respiratory complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02239.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964759577", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the study was to evaluate the integrity and characteristics of secondary peristalsis in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Studies were performed in 22 patients with reflux disease and 20 age matched controls. Oesophageal motility was recorded at 3 cm intervals along the oesophageal body. Primary peristalsis was tested with 5 ml water swallows. Secondary peristalsis was stimulated with 10 ml boluses of air and water injected in the mid-oesophagus and by 5 second distensions with a 3 cm balloon at the same level. It was found that primary peristalsis was normal in 19 of 20 control subjects and in 14 of 22 patients with reflux disease. In patients with reflux disease, intact secondary peristalsis was triggered infrequently by air and water distension (median success rate of 0% for both stimuli) and occurred significantly less frequently than in control subjects (50% and 30% respectively). The frequency of balloon induced secondary peristalsis, however, was similar in the two groups (0% controls, 20% reflux disease). The major pattern of failure of secondary peristalsis was the complete absence of any oesophageal secondary peristaltic response. The amplitudes of the intact secondary peristaltic responses were not significantly different for the two groups. Peristaltic velocity for air and balloon induced secondary peristalsis was also similar in control subjects and patients with reflux disease whereas water induced secondary peristalsis was slower in the reflux patients. In conclusion, patients with reflux disease exhibit a pronounced defect in the triggering of secondary peristalsis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.36.4.499", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1970017149", "source": "openalex"}

Design Population-based multi-centre prospective survey. Setting 29 public hospitals and 96 private specialists in gastroenterology in four administrative areas in France during 1996. Subjects A total of 2133 AUGIH patients 18 years and over were included in the six-month study. Outcome measures Incidence and mortality. Results The overall incidence in France was 143 cases per 100 000 persons per year, classified as out-patients (16%), emergency admissions (59%) and in-patients (25%). The incidence rates increased with age except for in-patients, and were higher in males. Peptic ulcer (36.6%), varices (13.7%) and erosive disease (12.3%) were the most frequent diagnoses. In 677 patients (31.7%), aspirin, antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids were taken on the 7 days before bleeding. The overall mortality (out-patients excluded) was 14.3% (10.7% for emergency patients and 23% for in-patients). Mortality was associated with comorbidities (especially malignancies, cirrhosis, asthma or respiratory deficiency), was lower in emergency patients using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and higher in in-patients using corticosteroids. Conclusions In France, patients with AUGIH are frequently managed as out-patients. Gastrotoxic drug use is frequently associated with AUGIH and constitutes a strategic opportunity for preventive treatment. Discrepancies between countries are not clearly explained either by demographic factors or by drug use, but this may be related to the emphasis on AUGIH in in-patients.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol12:175-181 © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology 2000, 12:175-181", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200012020-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048106278", "source": "openalex"}

The diagnosis and classification of reflux oesophagitis was based on the Los Angeles classification. Patients with predominant symptoms of heartburn or acid regurgitation of at least one per month for the past 6 months in the absence of reflux oesophagitis were diagnosed as having NERD. The prevalence of GORD, reflux oesophagitis and NERD were analysed in relation to age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), presence of hiatus hernia, Helicobacter pylori status, alcohol intake, smoking and level of education.One thousand patients were studied prospectively. Three hundred and eighty-eight patients (38.8%) were diagnosed as having GORD based on either predominant symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation and/or findings of reflux oesophagitis. One hundred and thirty-four patients (13.4%) had endoscopic evidence of reflux oesophagitis. Two hundred and fifty-four (65.5%) were diagnosed as having NERD. Hiatus hernia was found in 6.7% and Barrett's oesophagus in 2% of patients. Of our patients with reflux oesophagitis 20.1% had grade C and D oesophagitis. No patients had strictures.

Reflux is followed by volume clearance and chemical clearance, elicited by secondary and swallow‐induced peristalsis, respectively. We aimed to assess whether chemical clearance is impaired in gastro‐esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ). Methods Blinded retrospective review of impedance‐pH tracings from patients with erosive reflux disease ( ERD ) and non‐erosive reflux disease ( NERD ), and from proton pump inhibitor ( PPI )‐refractory patients before and after laparoscopic fundoplication. The number of refluxes followed within 30 s by swallow‐induced peristaltic waves was divided by the number of total refluxes to obtain a parameter representing chemical clearance namely the postreflux swallow‐induced peristaltic wave ( PSPW ) index. Key Results The PSPW index was significantly lower in 31 ERD (15%) and in 44 NERD (33%) off‐ PPI patients than in 30 controls (75%), as well as in 18 ERD (16%) and in 48 NERD (31%) on‐ PPI patients than in 26 on‐ PPI functional heartburn ( FH ) cases (67%) ( P &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). In 29 PPI ‐refractory patients, the median PSPW index was unaltered by otherwise effective antireflux surgery (20% postoperatively, 21% preoperatively).

The natural history of well-differentiated tumours is often favourable without treatment and GEP endocrine tumours may remain indolent for many years. Chemotherapy may however be indicated in the presence of symptomatic non-progressive disease (progression evaluated over 3–6 months). In contrast, poorly differentiated GEP endocrine tumours are frequently aggressive and early treatment is required. Accurate staging is mandatory and where surgery is possible (even in the event of limited metastatic disease), this option should be re-evaluated in a multidisciplinary approach. Approximately 2/3 of malignant GEP tumours are metastatic at discovery and surgery is possible in a minority of patients; therefore, chemotherapy, with/without other strategies (e.g. local ablation), is frequently indicated in patients with symptomatic, bulky or progressive disease. For well-differentiated pancreatic tumours, the reference association is Adriamycin with streptozotocin yielding objective responses (OR) in 40–60% of patients. Prolonged treatment is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity of Adriamycin and standard 2nd-line regimens are not of proven efficacy; thus, other treatment modalities are usually additionally required (e.g. chemo-embolisation). A significant OR may render a small number of patients secondarily amenable to surgery. Published series evaluating chemotherapy for midgut endocrine tumours are outdated and disappointing. Objective response rates with combined associations (including either 5-fluorouracil and/or streptozotocin) rarely exceed 20% and where possible, chemo-embolisation for hepatic metastases combined with somatostatin analogues (± interferon) should be preferred. Poorly differentiated GEP tumours are generally aggressive tumours with metastases at diagnosis and tend to progress rapidly. Surgery is rarely possible and ineffective even in locally advanced disease due to a high risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy, using cisplatin and etoposide, is the reference treatment and frequently yields OR rates &gt;50%. However, despite being chemosensitive, disease control is limited (8–10 months). Overall, advances in therapeutic chemotherapeutic options are required in the management of all types of advanced GEP endocrine tumours and evaluation of new drugs (e.g. irinotecan) and combination strategies (chemotherapy with local ablative therapies) are required in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000080747", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054968877", "source": "openalex"}

LARS was completed according to a standardised protocol, comprising a total fundoplication and a crural repair. Medical treatment comprised ESO 20 mg once daily, which could be increased stepwise to 40 mg once daily and then 20 mg twice daily in the case of incomplete GORD control. The primary outcome variable was time to treatment failure (Kaplan–Meier analysis).

Self‐assessed symptom questionnaires are now key instruments in clinicaltrials. Aim : To evaluate the validity of available GERD measurement tools. Methods : An ideal GERD symptom assessment instrument, suitable as a primary end‐point for clinical trials, should possess the following characteristics: (i) be sensitive in patients with GERD; (ii) cover the frequency and intensity of typical and atypical GERD symptoms; (iii) be multidimensional (cover all symptom dimensions); (iv) have proven psychometric properties (validity, reliability and responsiveness); (v) be practical and economical; (vi) be self‐assessed; (vii) use ‘word pictures’ which are easy to understand for patients; (viii) respond rapidly to changes (responsiveness over short time intervals); (ix) be used daily to assess changes during and after therapy; and (x) be valid in different languages for international use.

To assess the performance of the procedure in the hands of five 'experienced' surgeons, the first 20 procedures performed by each surgeon or surgical trainee were excluded, providing a group of 174 patients for review. A short loose 360 degrees fundoplication was performed in all instances, with short gastric vessel division performed in 35.0 per cent of patients and hiatal repair in 66.7 per cent. Median operating time was 80 (range 30-210) min and median postoperative stay was 3 (range 1-19) days. Sixteen procedures (9.2 per cent) could not be completed laparoscopically and required conversion to open surgery. Some 144 patients were reviewed by a scientific officer 3 months after surgery, 85 at 12 months, and 32 at 2 years, using a standard clinical questionnaire. All but one were free from reflux symptoms, although 20.1 per cent reported some dysphagia at 3 months' follow-up; this figure declined to 11 per cent at 12 months and 6 per cent (two of 34 patients) at 2 years. At each follow-up interval, 91 per cent of patients were satisfied with the outcome of the surgery.

Methods: Among 65,363 adult participants in a public health survey in Nord-Trondelag, Norway, 58,596 (90%) responded concerning occurrence and severity of heartburn or regurgitation during the past 12 months. The prevalence of minor, severe and any reflux symptoms was calculated, including stratification for age and sex. In order to examine whether the relative risk of reflux symptoms between sexes, in different age groups, was affected by other potential risk factors for reflux, confounding effects were tested using multivariate logistic regression. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate relative risks. Results: Total prevalence of reflux symptoms was 31.4%, whereof 26.0% were minor symptoms and 5.4% severe symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms occurring at least weekly was 11.6%.

That the antigen recovered from the blood and tissues was derived from this specific strain of bacteria was demonstrated by the use of the hemagglutination inhibition reaction, by the absence of cross-reacting antigens in appropriate control animals, and by agreement in the amount of antigen as estimated by two different technics. Transport of bacterial endotoxin across the intestinal membrane appears to be achieved primarily by passive diffusion. The accumulation of biologically active endotoxin in the blood and tissues of the shocked animal appears to be due to a reduction in the detoxifying potential of the reticulo-endothelial system, and not to a greater than normal absorption of endotoxin from the intestine. The absence of toxicity in the specific antigen extracted from normal liver demonstrates that the degradation of endotoxic potency can be achieved without altering the chemical integrity of the polysaccharide moiety of the molecule. The implications of the hypothesis that there is a continuous but fluctuating absorption of bacterial endotoxin from the intestine are briefly discussed, and the contribution of free circulating bacterial endotoxin of intestinal origin to the fate of the shocked animal is noted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.112.5.783", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086786702", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to clarify whether total (Nissen) or partial (Toupet) fundoplication is preferable, and whether preoperative oesophageal manometry should be used to determine the degree of fundoplication performed. Methods Preoperative oesophageal manometry was used to stratify 127 patients with established gastro-oesophageal reflux disease into effective (75) and ineffective (52) oesophageal motility groups. Patients in each group were randomized to Nissen (64) or Toupet (63) fundoplication. Results No significant differences between the operative groups were seen in heartburn, regurgitation or other reflux-related symptoms up to 1 year after surgery. Dysphagia of any degree (27 versus 9 per cent; P = 0·018) and chest pain on eating (22 versus 5 per cent; P = 0·018) were more prevalent at 1 year in the Nissen group. There were no differences in postoperative symptoms between the effective and ineffective motility groups. Surgery failed in eight patients on postoperative pH criteria, three in the Nissen group and five in the Toupet group.

Two experiments were carried out to investigate the addition of 1.3 kg water per kg air-dry mash diets containing high proportions (600 to 700 g/kg) of ground cereal grains (wheat, barley or oats) on broiler performance and the structure and function of the gastro-intestinal tract. 2. Chicks at the age of 7 d were fed on the wheat-, barley- or oats-based diets in the dry or wet forms for 35 d. Food and water intakes were recorded daily while body weight was measured weekly. Two birds from each treatment were killed each week to measure gut size and the viscosity of gut contents. Tissue samples from various digestive segments were histo-morphologically examined to determine the thickness of tissue layers, size of tissue glands, villa heights, crypt depths and thickness of tunica muscularis . Crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) for each segment was also determined using a metaphase arrest technique. 3. The results from both experiments showed that wetting food significantly ( P <0.05) increased food intake, total water intake and body weight gain of broiler chickens. The body weight gains of birds were proportional to their food intakes so that the efficiency of food utilisation was similar for all treatments. Dry matter retention of food tended to increase in birds given wet food from 7 to 21 d but not thereafter, compared to the dry-fed birds. Although water intake from the water bottle was significantly ( P <0.05) reduced in birds given wet food, total water intakes from the water bottle plus that from food were significantly ( P <0.05) higher in the wet-fed birds than in the dry-fed birds. The ratio of total water to dry food intake was, however, similar in both feeding regimens. 4. The fresh empty weight of the gut was increased by wet-feeding while its relative weight to body weight and the length of gut was not affected by dietary treatments. Significantly greater development of the tissue glands in the proventriculus and gizzard was observed in the birds given wet food; this was associated with the reduced thickness of the muscular layer of these segments. An increase in villus height was also observed in duodenum, small intestine, caeca and colon of birds given wet food, compared to those given dry food. CCPR was significantly ( P <0.05) reduced by wet-feeding throughout the digestive tract. This was associated with a significant decrease in the mean viscosity of the gut contents and the concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the caeca. 5. Wetting diets based on cereal grains caused a significant improvement in the performance of broiler chickens. The mechanism of the beneficial effects of wet feeding could be attributed to the decreased viscosity of gut contents; the greater development of the layer of villi in the digestive segments and the reduced CCPR in the crypts of the epithelium.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00071669987854", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086976107", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Three precisely definable columnar epithelial types – cardiac, oxyntocardiac and intestinal – may be interposed between esophageal squamous epithelium and gastric oxyntic (acid secreting) mucosa. This enables definition of a new histologic concept: the squamo-oxyntic gap. The squamo-oxyntic gap is zero or very small in autopsies performed on patients without evidence of GERD. The gap progressively increases in length with the severity of GERD, indicating that the squamo-oxyntic gap is a marker for chronic GERD. The distal part of the gap lines gastric-type rugal folds and, therefore, is distal to the present endoscopic definition of the gastro-esophageal junction. I contend that this distal gap segment (which has esophageal submucosal glands) is actually the dilated distal esophagus; this is the pathologic correlate of destruction of the abdominal segment of the lower esophageal sphincter. The dilated distal esophagus is mistaken for 'gastric cardia' by present endoscopic definitions. Summary I believe that these data support the adoption of novel histologic definitions of GERD as follows: the presence of any squamo-oxyntic gap defines GERD; the length of the gap is a measure of severity of chronic GERD; and the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the gap defines Barrett esophagus and cancer risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mog.0b013e32836228fa", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022380232", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that Stretta alters GEJ resistance. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind randomized cross-over study of Stretta and sham treatment. Consecutive GERD patients were included in the study. The study was conducted in a tertiary care center. Patients underwent two upper gastrointestinal endoscopies with 3 months interval, during which active or sham Stretta treatment was performed in a randomized double-blind manner. Symptom assessment, endoscopy, manometry, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, and a distensibility test of the GEJ were done before the start of the study and after 3 months. RESULTS: Barostat distensibility test of the GEJ before and after administration of sildenafil was the main outcome measure. In all, 22 GERD patients (17 females, mean age 47±12 years) participated in the study; 11 in each group. Initial sham treatment did not affect any of the parameters studied. Three months after initial Stretta procedure, no changes were observed in esophageal acid exposure and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. In contrast, symptom score was significantly improved and GEJ compliance was significantly decreased. Administration of sildenafil, an esophageal smooth muscle relaxant, normalized GEJ compliance again to pre-Stretta level, arguing against GEJ fibrosis as the underlying mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: The limitation of this study was reflux evaluation did not include impedance monitoring. In this sham-controlled study, Stretta improved GERD symptoms and decreased GEJ compliance. Decreased GEJ compliance, which reflects altered LES neuromuscular function, may contribute to symptomatic benefit by decreasing refluxate volume.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2011.395", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982528814", "source": "openalex"}

It is generally assumed that acid suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors improves or eliminates symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease by normalizing intra‐oesophageal pH. However, the degree of acid suppression induced by proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and/or Barrett's oesophagus has not been adequately studied. Aim : To assess the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in normalizing intra‐oesophageal and intra‐gastric pH in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease with and without Barrett's oesophagus who have been rendered symptom‐free by acid‐suppressive therapy. Methods : Patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's oesophagus were prospectively evaluated by dual sensor 24‐h pH monitoring while receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy for complete control of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Analyses and comparisons of intra‐oesophageal and intra‐gastric pH profiles on therapy were then made. Results : One hundred and ten patients, 98 men and 12 women, with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ( n = 62) and/or Barrett's oesophagus ( n = 48), were studied. All tolerated proton pump inhibitors well and were asymptomatic at the time of the study. Thirty‐six (58%) patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and 24 (50%) patients with Barrett's oesophagus ( P = 0.4) normalized their intra‐oesophageal pH profiles on proton pump inhibitors. Compared with patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, patients with Barrett's oesophagus were more likely to have higher degree of pathologic acid reflux despite proton pump inhibitor therapy (DeMeester score 50.5 ± 8.2 vs. 31.4 ± 4.6, P = 0.03) and exhibited less intra‐gastric acid suppression (% total pH&lt;4.0: 53.9 ± 2.7 vs. 39.9 ± 2.6, P =0.0004), particularly supine (% pH&lt;4.0: 62.1 ± 3.4 vs. 44.8 ± 3.4, P =0.0006). Conclusions : Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients with or without Barrett's oesophagus continue to exhibit pathologic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and low intra‐gastric pH despite proton pump inhibitor therapy that accomplishes complete reflux symptom control. Further, intra‐oesophageal and intra‐gastric pH control is significantly more difficult to achieve in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.

These symptoms are widespread in the community and range from 2.5% to more than 25%.

The aim of this review is to provide current information regarding the natural history of GERD, taking into account the evolution of its definition and the worldwide gradual change of its epidemiology. Present knowledge shows that there are two main forms of GERD, that is erosive reflux disease (ERD) and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and the latter comprises the majority of patients (up to 70%). The major complication of GERD is the development of Barrett esophagus, which is considered as a pre-cancerous lesion. Although data from medical literature on the natural history of this disease are limited and mainly retrospective, they seem to indicate that both NERD and mild esophagitis tend to remain as such with time and the progression from NERD to ERD, from mild to severe ERD and from ERD to Barrett's esophagus may occur in a small proportion of patients, ranging from 0 to 30%, 10 to 22% and 1 to 13% of cases, respectively. It is necessary to stress that these data are strongly influenced by the use of powerful antisecretory drugs (PPIs).

Gastric emptying was therefore measured in 19 healthy preterm infants (median gestational age 32 weeks) while concurrently measuring 24 hour lower oesophageal pH, using an antimony pH electrode, positioned manometrically. Real time ultrasonic images of the gastric antrum were obtained, and measurements of antral cross-sectional area (ACSA) were made immediately before a nasogastric feed and then during subsequent gastric emptying until ACSA returned to its pre-feed value. Half emptying time (50% delta ACSA) was calculated as the time taken for the ACSA to fall to half the maximal postprandial increment. Mean (SEM) reflux index for the group was 11.9 (2.0)%; number of reflux episodes per 24 hours: 15.4 (1.7); and number of reflux episodes longer than five minutes 5.5 (0.8). Average half emptying times for an individual infant were: median (range) 46 (18-105) minutes. There was no association between gastric emptying rates and any of the indices of gastro-oesophageal reflux, either during the entire 24 hour period for which the lower oesophageal pH was recorded, or in the postprandial periods after the feeds which were studied ultrasonically. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was also unrelated to feed volume and feed type. Asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in preterm infants, but gastric emptying time is not a determinant of it.

The aim of this review was to critically assess the relationship between H. pylori and GERD and its potential implications for the management of GERD. Data for this review were gathered from the following sources up to April 1998—the biomedical database M EDLINE , a detailed review of medical journals, and a review of abstracts submitted to relevant international meetings. On average, 40% of GERD patients carry H. pylori infection, with a reported infection prevalence ranging from 16% to 88%. To date, there has been no reported controlled trial of effective H. pylori therapy in GERD. GERD has been reported to develop de novo following the cure of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease. In the presence of H. pylori , proton pump inhibitor therapy appears to accelerate the development of atrophic corpus gastritis, a potentially precancerous condition. Conversely, proton pump inhibitor therapy seems to become less effective after cure of H. pylori . The mechanisms underlying these important contrasting phenomena are poorly understood. The relationship between H. pylori and GERD is complex, and it is difficult to give definitive guidelines on the management of H. pylori infection in GERD. Controlled trials of H. pylori therapy in GERD are urgently needed, as well as further long‐term data on both the natural history of gastric histopathological changes in the H. pylori ‐positive GERD patient treated with proton pump inhibitors, and the impact of H. pylori status on the clinical efficacy of antisecretory therapy. Pending these data, it is perhaps advisable to advocate cure of H. pylori in young patients with proton pump inhibitor‐dependent GERD who, in the absence of anti‐reflux surgery, are faced with the likelihood of long‐term medical therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00460.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125992095", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To investigate whether gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease progresses endoscopically. Methods Systematic review of the literature. Results Well‐designed prospective studies are few, diagnostic criteria were not always standardized, management strategies varied and various sources of bias could not be excluded. Whilst most patients do not progress to more severe forms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, and some cases actually regress, progression is seen in a small proportion of patients. Annual progression rates for non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease developing erosive oesophagitis ranged from 0% to 30%. About 1–22% of patients with mild erosive oesophagitis developed more severe inflammation annually, while 1–13% of patients with erosive oesophagitis developed Barrett's oesophagus each year.

Gluten is notoriously difficult to digest by mammalian proteolytic enzymes and the protease-resistant domains contain multiple immunogenic epitopes. The aim of this study was to identify novel sources of gluten-digesting microbial enzymes from the upper gastro-intestinal tract with the potential to neutralize gluten epitopes. Methodology/Principal Findings Oral microorganisms with gluten-degrading capacity were obtained by a selective plating strategy using gluten agar. Microbial speciations were carried out by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Enzyme activities were assessed using gliadin-derived enzymatic substrates, gliadins in solution, gliadin zymography, and 33-mer α-gliadin and 26-mer γ-gliadin immunogenic peptides. Fragments of the gliadin peptides were separated by RP-HPLC and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry. Strains with high activity towards gluten were typed as Rothia mucilaginosa and Rothia aeria. Gliadins (250 µg/ml) added to Rothia cell suspensions (OD620 1.2) were degraded by 50% after ∼30 min of incubation. Importantly, the 33-mer and 26-mer immunogenic peptides were also cleaved, primarily C-terminal to Xaa-Pro-Gln (XPQ) and Xaa-Pro-Tyr (XPY). The major gliadin-degrading enzymes produced by the Rothia strains were ∼70–75 kDa in size, and the enzyme expressed by Rothia aeria was active over a wide pH range (pH 3–10). Conclusion/Significance While the human digestive enzyme system lacks the capacity to cleave immunogenic gluten, such activities are naturally present in the oral microbial enzyme repertoire. The identified bacteria may be exploited for physiologic degradation of harmful gluten peptides.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024455", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984457607", "source": "openalex"}

The disease encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical disorders from heartburn without oesophagitis to severe complications such as strictures, deep ulcers, and intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's oesophagus).1 The prevalence of heartburn, the most typical symptom of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, is extremely high,2 but most people with reflux do not seek medical help for this condition and treat themselves with over the counter preparations. Oesophagitis (defined by mucosal breaks) is less frequent, occurring in less than half of patients undergoing endoscopy for reflux symptoms. Symptoms and severity of oesophagitis are poorly correlated. Although reflux may remain silent in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, heartburn can severely affect the quality of life of patients with negative endoscopy results. The natural course of the disease also varies considerably.2 Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease seen by gastroenterologists usually have a chronic condition with frequent relapses, whereas those who rely on general practitioners' help usually have less severe disease, consisting of intermittent attacks with prolonged periods of remission. #### Summary points Most patients with dominant heartburn have no signs of oesophagitis at endoscopy.

Mechanistically, reflux disease is caused by excessive oesophageal acid exposure, which is potentially attributable to excessive reflux events and/or prolonged acid clearance. Currently, the best available pH monitoring data confirm that smoking increases oesophageal acid exposure. Smoking reduces lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure and predisposes to strain-induced reflux. Consistent with this, smoking has been shown to cause an increased number of reflux events that are not attributable to increased transient LOS relaxations, but rather are associated with deep inspiration and coughing. Once reflux occurs, acid is cleared from the oesophagus by a two-step process consisting of oesophageal peristalsis followed by neutralization of the residual acid by swallowed saliva. Smoking prolongs acid clearance by decreasing salivation. The effects of smoking on LOS tone and acid clearance are most likely mainly due to nicotine but are incompletely understood. Transdermal nicotine has similar effects to smoking on LOS pressure and salivation. Thus, although perhaps not a dominant risk factor, smoking and nicotine impact on pathophysiological variables of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. In itself, smoking cessation is unlikely to cure severe gastrooesophageal reflux disease, but, along with appropriate pharmacological therapy, it may be beneficial.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200012080-00002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078441747", "source": "openalex"}

These individuals were followed for 5 years with regard to medically treated COPD exacerbations, which we defined as a short course treatment with oral corticosteroids alone or in combination with antibiotics. We applied a multivariable Cox regression analysis with adjustment for well-established risk factors associated with COPD exacerbations or gastro-esophageal reflux disease, including COPD severity, and symptoms. Results Individuals with COPD and gastro-esophageal reflux disease had more chronic bronchitis (31 vs 21%, P-=-0.004), more breathlessness (39 vs 22%, P-<-0.001), and more of them had a history of respiratory infections (6.8 vs 1.4%, P-<-0.001) than individuals with COPD but without gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

Aged Cheddar cheese showed rapid degradation during the gastric phase, but was more resistant to the duodenal environment. Light Cheddar showed the opposite behavior, being highly resistant to the gastric environment; however, it underwent extensive degradation at the end of the duodenal phase. The extent of matrix degradation for mild Cheddar was similar to that of Mozzarella in the gastric phase but was much lower than that of other cheeses in the duodenal phase. The cheeses under study exhibited very different digestion patterns, and these differences are discussed in relation to cheese matrix composition, microstructure and rheological properties.

They are often used in treating disorders of gastrointestinal motility including gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The most widely studied agents include bethanechol, metoclopramide, domperidone and cisapride. These drugs act either by enhancing the effect of acetylcholine or by blocking the effect of an inhibitory neurotransmitter such as dopamine. With the exception of cisapride, the clinical efficacy of the various prokinetic agents in treating GERD has not been confirmed consistently. These agents have variable effects on oesophageal and gastric motor function and are fraught with side‐effects. They are effective in relieving mild reflux symptoms but do not predictably heal oesophagitis. On the other hand, cisapride is thus far the most effective prokinetic agent studied for the treatment of GERD. It relieves reflux symptoms and promotes healing of grade I–II oesophagitis, with few side‐effects or tachyphylaxis. Its most important role may be in the maintenance treatment of GERD either as a single agent or in combination therapy with an H 2 ‐antagonist after oesophagitis healing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.1993.tb00064.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165558477", "source": "openalex"}

Aim : To investigate the effect of baclofen on reflux symptoms, oesophageal pH and lower oesophageal sphincter manometry in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Methods : A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way crossover design was used to study the effect of baclofen on heartburn and regurgitation 3 h after a provocation test meal in 37 patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Additionally, in 20 of these patients, the effect of baclofen on oesophageal pH, transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was studied. Results : Baclofen significantly decreased the acid reflux time and the incidence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux episodes (8.3 ± 8.8% vs. 12.4 ± 12.0%, P = 0.03 and 10.9 ± 7.3 per 3 h vs. 18.7 ± 12.4 per 3 h).

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2112375659", "title": "The relationship between the control of pH and healing and symptom relief in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease", "text": "SUMMARY Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is generally considered to be the result of a motility disorder which permits the abnormal and prolonged exposure of the lumen of the oesophagus to the acidic gastric contents. This view is supported by experimental data, intraoesophageal pH measurement, and the dramatic results of symptom relief and healing seen with effective antisecretory treatment. Oesophageal mucosal injury is determined by the pH of the refluxate and duration of acid exposure. Most patients experience meal‐stimulated reflux during the day and the more severe cases experience 24‐h acid exposure. In contrast to the H 2 ‐receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs), the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective at controlling meal‐stimulated acid secretion when each is given in standard doses. Therefore, the degree and duration of acid suppression throughout 24 h is greater. Treatments which maintain intra‐oesophageal pH &gt; 4 for 96% or more of the 24 h normalize acid exposure and are associated with the highest healing rates. Peptic activity is minimized at or above pH 4. The time above pH 4 is significantly longer with the PPIs than with the H 2 RAs. Thus, the healing‐time curves for GERD (grades II‐IV) are shifted to the left for the PPIs which heal a significantly greater proportion of patients earlier than the H 2 RAs or sucralfate. Symptoms in GERD are related to the degree and duration of oesophageal acid exposure. Symptom relief is more rapid and complete with the PPIs than with the H 2 RAs or other treatments in standard doses.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.1995.tb00777.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112375659", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To assess systematically how age affects the prevalence of GERD and its oesophageal complications. Methods Systematic PubMed searches were used to identify population-based studies on the age-related prevalence and incidence of GERD, and clinical studies on age-related changes in oesophageal complications in GERD. Results Nine population-based studies and seven clinical studies met the inclusion criteria. Four of seven prevalence studies observed no significant effect of age on GERD symptom prevalence, two did not report on statistical significance and one observed a significant age-related increase in symptom prevalence. The two population-based endoscopic surveys showed no significant effect of age on reflux oesophagitis prevalence. Clinical studies in patients with GERD showed an increase in reflux oesophagitis severity and a decrease in heartburn severity with age, and age-related increases in oesophageal acid exposure and anatomical disruption of the gastro-oesophageal junction. Conclusions Epidemiological studies do not show an increase in GERD symptom prevalence with age. However, in individuals with GERD, ageing is associated with more severe patterns of acid reflux and reflux oesophagitis; despite this, symptoms associated with GERD become less severe and more nonspecific with ageing.

In patients who received prior treatment for advanced disease, pembrolizumab has been associated with a response rate of 20% in programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors, and nivolumab with a response rate of 12% in unselected tumors. Both agents yielded a median duration of response lasting ~6–7 months. PD-L1 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) have emerged as potential predictive markers for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment has been detected in 14–24% and ~35% of patients with gastro-esophageal cancer, respectively. PD-L1 tumor cell expression appears to be more common in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancers (GCs) and has been associated with an increased density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). To date, data are too sparse to determine whether PD-L1 expression predicts efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in gastro-esophageal cancer, but data from other tumor types have not been consistent regarding its predictive value. MSI occurs in 10–20% of gastro-esophageal cancers and arises from deficient mismatch repair (MMR). MSI is highly correlated with non-synonymous mutation burden, as well as a dense accumulation of TILs. MSI has been associated with improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy in gastrointestinal cancers. Multiple studies are ongoing which examine therapeutic blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in unselected patients with gastro-esophageal cancer, as well as patients whose tumors express PD-L1 or exhibit MSI. These studies will clarify their activity in this disease and potentially can determine whether identify a strong predictive biomarker can be identified.

The aim of this study was to determine whether any symptom profile or reflux pattern was associated with refractoriness to PPI therapy. <h3>Design</h3> Patients with typical GORD symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation) were included and had 24 h pH-impedance monitoring off therapy. Patients were considered to be responders if they had fewer than 2 days of mild symptoms per week while receiving a standard or double dose of PPI treatment for at least 4 weeks. Both clinical and reflux parameters were taken into account for multivariate analysis (logistic regression). <h3>Results</h3> One hundred patients were included (median age 50 years, 42 male), 43 responders and 57 non-responders. Overall, multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with the absence of response were absence of oesophagitis (p=0.050), body mass index (BMI) ≤25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (p=0.002) and functional dyspepsia (FD) (p=0.001).

Asthma and gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GER) are both characterized by airway inflammation. Design. The purposes of this work were (i) to study airway inflammation in patients troubled by gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GER) and GER associated with asthma, (ii) to ascertain whether GER can aggravate asthma by exacerbating the pre‐existing airway inflammation and oxidative stress and (iii) to establish the validity of analysing breath condensate and induced sputum when studying the airways of subjects affected by GER. Patient s and methods. We enrolled 14 patients affected by mild asthma associated with GER (40 ±12 years), nine with mild but persistent asthma (39 ± 13 years), eight with GER (35 ± 11 years) and 17 healthy subjects (37 ± 9 years). Sputum cell counts and concentrations of interleukin‐4 (IL‐4), IL‐6 and 8‐isoprostane were measured in breath condensate and supernatant. Measurements and results. GER‐related asthma is characterized by an eosinophilic inflammation, as determined by elevated concentrations of IL‐4 in breath condensate and sputum supernatant, and by sputum cell analysis. GER alone presents a neutrophilic pattern of inflammation when determined by elevated concentrations of IL‐6 in sputum cell analysis. A concomitant increase has been found in 8‐isoprostane in GER associated (or not associated) with asthma. Conclusions. We conclude that GER is characterized by a neutrophilic airway inflammation and by increased oxidative stress. GER does not however aggravate pre‐existing airway inflammation in asthma patients. Determinations of inflammatory and oxidant markers in the breath condensate of subjects with GER reflect these measured in the induced sputum.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2005.01611.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066139712", "source": "openalex"}

A new method of ambulatory bile monitoring may help to define this role. AIMS: To establish the relationship between symptom events and acid and bile reflux episodes. PATIENTS: 59 consecutive patients presenting for further investigation of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: All patients underwent combined ambulatory pH and bile monitoring. For each patient, a symptom index (SI) was calculated in relation to both acid reflux and bile reflux episodes. RESULTS: Patients were divided into those without (group 1, n = 21) and those with (group 2, n = 38) acid reflux. A total of 394 symptoms were identified in 59 patients. In group 1, there were fewer symptom events per patient (mean 4.1) than group 2 (mean 8.1). Twenty three per cent of symptom events were associated with acid reflux in group 1 and 41% in group 2. Only 6% of symptom events in both groups were related to bile reflux. In group 1 both the acid and bile related SI score were low.

However, in vivo studies have led others to argue for two overlapping components proximally displaced from the OCJ: an extrinsic crural sphincter of skeletal muscle and an intrinsic physiological sphincter of circular smooth‐muscle fibres within the abdominal oesophagus. Our aims were to separate and quantify in vivo the skeletal and smooth muscle sphincteric components pharmacologically and clarify the description of the LOS. In two protocols an endoluminal ultrasound‐manometry assembly was drawn through the human gastro‐oesophageal segment to correlate sphincteric pressure with the anatomic crus. In protocol I, fifteen normal subjects maintained the costal diaphragm at inferior/superior positions by full inspiration/expiration (FI/FE) during pull‐throughs. These were repeated after administering atropine to suppress the cholinergic smooth‐muscle sphincter. The cholinergic component was reconstructed by subtracting the atropine‐resistant pressures from the full pressures, referenced to the anatomic crus. To evaluate the extent to which the cholinergic contribution approximated the full smooth‐muscle sphincter, in protocol II seven patients undergoing general anaesthesia for non‐oesophageal pathology were administered cisatracurium to paralyse the crus. The smooth‐muscle sphincter pressures were measured after lung inflation to approximate FI. The cholinergic smooth‐muscle pressure profile in protocol I (FI) matched closely the post‐cisatracurium smooth‐muscle pressure profile in protocol II, and the atropine‐resistant pressure profiles correlated spatially with the crural sling during diaphragmatic displacement. Thus, the atropine‐resistant and cholinergic pressure contributions in protocol I approximated the skeletal and smooth muscle sphincteric components. The smooth‐muscle pressures had well‐defined upper and lower peaks. The upper peak overlapped and displaced rigidly with the crural sling, while the distal peak separated from the crus/upper‐peak by 1.1 cm between FI and FE. These results suggest the existence of separate upper and lower intrinsic smooth‐muscle components. The ‘upper LOS’ overlaps and displaces with the crural sling consistent with a physiological LOS. The distal smooth‐muscle pressure peak defines a ‘lower LOS’ that likely reflects the gastric sling/clasp muscle fibres at the OCJ. The distinct physiology of these three components may underlie aspects of normal sphincteric function, and complexity of sphincter dysfunction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2006.124032", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1750829963", "source": "openalex"}

The results of the operation were determined by endoscopy, oesophageal manometry, ambulatory 24-h pH recording and symptom evaluation 6 months and 5 years after operation. These results were compared with findings in healthy controls. The median pressure in the lower oesophageal high-pressure zone was 13.3 (interquartile range (i.q.r.) 11.3-21.3) mmHg after 5 years, which did not differ significantly from the value at 6 months' follow-up or from that in controls. It was, however, significantly higher than the preoperative pressure. The median intra-abdominal length of the high-pressure zone was 1.7 (i.q.r. 1.3-2.3) cm after 5 years, significantly less than at 6 months but equal to control length. Measurement of the proportion of total time at pH < 4 at 5 years (median 0.2 (i.q.r. 0.0-0.6) per cent) and 6 months after operation revealed a significant reduction in acid reflux compared with preoperative values and normal controls. There was no significant difference in acid exposure between the two postoperative investigations. Endoscopy showed that 27 patients had no oesophagitis, three had erythema and three persistent Barrett's oesophagus 5 years after operation. Normal belching was possible in 22 patients and 18 experienced increased flatulence 5 years after fundoplication. An independent gastroenterologist found that the result was excellent in 16 patients, good in 16 and fair in four; two patients had a poor overall outcome of the operation.

Prolonged intragastric balloon distension might oppose this. The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux in untreated obese subjects and to study the consequences of weight loss with or without intragastric balloon treatment. Methods: Patients participating in a randomized double-blind, sham-controlled trial received balloon or sham treatment for the first 13 weeks. Thereafter, all subjects received a balloon for the remaining year. Twenty-four-hour pH recordings were made at the start, after 13 weeks of balloon or sham treatment, after 26 and 52 weeks of balloon treatment and 13 weeks after balloon removal. Results: Group-wise, pH data of 42 untreated patients (BMI 43.4 kg/m 2 ) were highly abnormal. On an individual level, 22 subjects (52%) had some evidence of reflux, 17 patients (40%) showed pathological total reflux times and 8 (19%) had combined total, upright and supine reflux with grade B reflux oesophagitis in only one patient. Albeit poorly, oesophageal acid exposure was related to body weight and visceral fat distribution. A reduction in acid reflux was observed in sham-treated weight-losing subjects, whereas in balloon-treated subjects supine reflux and duration of the longest reflux increased. In the second 13-week period, the initially improved pH values worsened by balloon placement in sham-treated subjects. Values in balloon-balloon-treated subjects stabilized. After 52 weeks, acid reflux levelled off at pretreatment values and further improved after balloon removal. At these times, decreased visceral fat masses correlated significantly with diminished oesophageal exposure to acid. Conclusions: Obesity predisposed to gastro-oesophageal reflux.

The model incorporates between-animal variation for pasture intake, the proportion of larvae ingested from the pasture which survive to become adults, the fecundity of the mature worm, along with density-dependent control of this trait and the mortality rate of the worms. The between-animal variation for each component is partitioned into genetic, permanent and temporary environmental components which vary with age. Infection rates are estimated from existing pasture larval contamination and new contamination from infected animals. Using this framework, selection for reduced mean faecal egg count was practised, in silico, for a period of 10 years. Several general patterns emerged. First, a curvilinear response to selection was observed, with responses initially being large then declining over time. Mean faecal egg count declined from approximately 500 to 140 eggs per gin 10 years and worm burdens and pasture larval contamination showed similar patterns of response. The initial responses to selection were approximately 1·7 times that predicted by quantitative genetic theory because the epidemiology of the disease changed as the animals' genetic resistance improved. A method of partitioning selection responses into components due to the altered genotypes of the animals and components due to altered disease epidemiology is outlined. Secondly, the faecal egg count distribution became more aggregated, or skewed, as selection progressed. Thirdly, correlating pasture contamination levels across years (carry-over effects) resulted in even greater apparent responses to selection. Finally, regular anihelmintic treatment reduced mean faecal egg counts but did not alter the patterns of response to selection, indicating that selective breeding should be feasible under a variety of anthelmintic regimes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1357729800016088", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1974614840", "source": "openalex"}

Acupuncture is widely used as a complementary and alternative treatment for patients with GORD. Objective To explore the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of GORD. Methods Four English and four Chinese databases were searched through June 2016. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture (MA/EA) for GORD versus or as an adjunct to Western medicine (WM) were selected. Data extraction and quality evaluation were performed by two authors independently and RevMan 5.2.0 was used to analyse data. Results A total of 12 trials involving 1235 patients were included. Meta-analyses demonstrated that patients receiving MA/EA combined with WM had a superior global symptom improvement compared with those receiving WM alone (relative risk (RR) 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26; p=0.03; six studies) with no significant heterogeneity (I 2 =0%, p=0.41). Recurrence rates of those receiving MA/EA alone were lower than those receiving WM (RR 0.42,95% CI 0.29 to 0.61; p&lt;0.001; three studies) with low heterogeneity (I 2 =7%, p=0.34), while global symptom improvement (six studies) and symptom scores (three studies) were similar (both p&gt;0.05). Descriptive analyses suggested that acupuncture also improves quality of life in patients with GORD. Conclusion This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for GORD.

Gastro-oral transmission via contaminated vomitus has been proposed as an important mode of transmitting H. pylori, especially in children. This pilot study attempted to isolate H. pylori from the vomitus of children. Methods: Children presenting for evaluation with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting were studied. Fresh vomitus samples were collected for detection of H. pylori by bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A rapid, whole blood test was used to determine the H. pylori status of patients. Results: A total of 18 children with mean age of 6 yr were studied; four had a positive serology test. Among these four children, H. pylori was isolated from vomitus by culture in one child and by PCR in two. An 18-month-old girl with negative serology had H. pylori detected in vomitus by PCR. Six months later, she had seroconversion confirmed, suggesting that she had an acute H. pylori infection on initial presentation. Conclusion: This is the first study reporting successful isolation of H. pylori from naturally produced vomitus. The result implies that transmission of H. pylori infection by vomitus, especially in children, is possible.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01431.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1997204293", "source": "openalex"}

However, such approaches have yet to be applied to parasitic helminth communities. We recently described the first example of such a method - nemabiome sequencing - based on deep-amplicon sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) rDNA, and validated its ability to quantitatively assess the species composition of cattle gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) communities. Here, we present the first application of this approach to explore GIN species diversity and the impact of anthelmintic drug treatments. First, we investigated GIN species diversity in cow-calf beef cattle herds in several different regions, using coproculture derived L3s. A screen of 50 Canadian beef herds revealed parasite species diversity to be low overall. The majority of parasite communities were comprised of just two species; Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. Cooperia punctata was present at much lower levels overall, but nevertheless comprised a substantive part of the parasite community of several herds in eastern Canada. In contrast, nemabiome sequencing revealed higher GIN species diversity in beef calves sampled from central/south-eastern USA and Sao Paulo State, Brazil. In these regions C. punctata predominated in most herds with Haemonchus placei predominating in a few cases. Ostertagia ostertagi and C. oncophora were relatively minor species in these regions in contrast to the Canadian herds. We also examined the impact of routine macrocyclic lactone pour-on treatments on GIN communities in the Canadian beef herds. Low treatment effectiveness was observed in many cases, and nemabiome sequencing revealed an overall increase in the proportion of Cooperia spp. relative to O. ostertagi post-treatment. This work demonstrates the power of nemabiome metabarcoding to provide a detailed picture of GIN parasite community structure in large sample sets and illustrates its potential use in research, diagnostics and surveillance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.06.006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2742621197", "source": "openalex"}

Failure of this anti‐reflux barrier results in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, and may lead to complications such as oesophagitis, Barrett’s oesophagus and eventually oesophageal carcinoma. Recent studies have suggested that transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation is the main mechanism underlying gastro‐oesophageal reflux. It involves a prolonged relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter, mediated by a vago‐vagal neural pathway, synapsing in the brainstem. Several drugs, such as atropine, baclofen and loxiglumide, have been shown to reduce the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and concomitantly the number of reflux episodes. These findings illustrate that transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations may represent a potential new target for the pharmacological treatment of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. It is possible that the reduction in the number of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations may also contribute to the beneficial effect of fundoplication and new endoscopic anti‐reflux procedures. It should be emphasized, however, that other factors, such as low lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, the presence of a hiatal hernia and impaired oesophageal peristalsis, are also of great importance. Therefore, whether the targeting of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations is the ‘golden bullet’ in anti‐reflux therapy remains to be proven, as evidence of an effective control of gastro‐oesophageal reflux in reflux patients is still lacking.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2002.01153.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978560184", "source": "openalex"}

Preliminary assessment of the first 100 patients with a mean follow-up of 3–5 years showed symptomatic improvement in 96 per cent and complete relief in 85 per cent. A further 100 patients were studied using formal symptom scoring, endoscopy, manometry and pH monitoring performed before operation and 3 months after operation. Similar clinical results were accompanied by improvement in endoscopic oesophagitis in 95 per cent, complete healing in 74 per cent and restoration of the pH profile to physiological levels in 84 per cent. Troublesome mechanical complications comprised a 2 per cent incidence of dysphagia, but there was no gas bloat or inability to belch or vomit, which may relate to the restoration of lower oesophageal sphincter characteristics close to those of 30 asymptomatic controls. The procedure is simpler to perform than total fundoplication, is well tolerated and is applicable to patients with reflux stricture and impaired oesophageal body motility. The results of this study support the hypotheses that effective reflux control can be achieved without total fundoplication by attention to several factors of known relevance to the anti-reflux mechanism, and that restoration of characteristics of the lower oesophageal sphincter close to physiological levels results in a lower incidence of mechanical complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800780918", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019102089", "source": "openalex"}

Erosion severity is predictive of a patient's response to therapy and of the likelihood of relapse after therapy. It is, therefore, important to grade the severity of erosive reflux esophagitis, particularly in the context of clinical trials. The Savary-Miller endoscopic classification system is used widely but usage and interpretation are very variable. The \"MUSE\" (metaplasia [M], ulceration [U], stricturing [S] and erosions [E]) classification provides clear definitions of the relevant endoscopic features, and it is based on a standardized report form, which allows the endoscopist to make a clear record of esophagitis severity. Recent studies confirm that endoscopists can identify erosions or mucosal breaks, ulcers, strictures, and metaplasia reproducibly. The \"L.A.\" (Los Angeles) classification describes four grades of esophagitis severity (A to D), based on the extent of esophageal lesions known as \"mucosal breaks,\" but it does not record the presence or severity of other GERD lesions. Thus, for patients with \"complicated\" reflux disease, the \"MUSE\" classification offers a more comprehensive description of esophagitis severity. Endoscopy is not universally applicable: 40 to 60 percent of patients with typical reflux symptoms do not have esophageal erosions and are now considered to have \"endoscopy negative reflux disease\" (ENRD). Thus, endoscopy is not the final arbiter as to a diagnosis of reflux disease, and it is not, therefore, a necessary prerequisite to therapy. Endoscopy is indicated at first presentation for patients with alarm symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract. It has also been proposed that all patients with chronic GERD should have a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" endoscopy; in the absence of Barrett's esophagus or other complications, no follow-up is required unless the patient's symptoms change significantly. A surveillance program with multiple biopsies should be instituted if there is evidence of Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopic evaluation should document the presence and extent of esophageal erosions using the L.A. or MUSE classification systems; complications should also be documented and may be recorded using the MUSE classification. Non-erosive changes such as erythema may be ignored on the basis of present evidence, and there are no clear data to support the use of endoscopic biopsies for the diagnosis of GERD.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W12841604", "source": "openalex"}

The 1-year prevalence of reflux-like dyspepsia is in the region of 30%, with many patients experiencing a range of other symptoms in addition to the principal complaint of retrosternal pain or burning. Although only a minority, about one-quarter, of these patients consult general practitioners about their problems, many of them have had symptoms for several years, and experience symptoms on a frequent, often daily, basis. The decision to consult a general practitioner often depends more upon patients' anxieties about the possibility of heart disease and cancer than on symptom severity. General practitioners need to address these issues, as well as attempting to make a safe, clinical diagnosis; this is aided by the findings that, at least in patients under the age of about 45, a reasonably confident clinical diagnosis can be made on the basis of symptoms alone, although older patients and those in whom alarm symptoms are present require timely investigation. The increasing availability of open-access endoscopy means that many of these patients can be managed entirely in general practice without the need for specialist referral. Management in general practice begins with a clear explanation of the mechanisms and significance of GORD and a direct response to patients' anxieties. Lifestyle factors may require modification before drug therapy begins. At present it appears that, because of the relatively low frequency of complications and severe morbidity of GORD seen by general practitioners, many patients do not go on to receive optimal therapy, in terms of potent acid-suppressing agents, with a substantial number of patients continuing to experience significant symptoms after consultation with their general practitioner.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2034729644", "title": "The Pathophysiology of Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease: An Overview", "text": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a multifactorial disease. Although it is primarily a motility disorder, several other disturbances can interfere and contribute to determine the severity of symptoms and the degree of lesions. In normal subjects, as in patients with pathological reflux, nearly all the episodes of reflux obey one of the following three mechanisms: (a) a transient complete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (TLOSR), (b) a transient increase in intra-abdominal pressure which overcomes the resistance of the antireflux barrier ('stress reflux') and, (c) a spontaneous reflux through a permanently hypotonic sphincter. Gastric distension is the major factor that can induce TLOSRs. Whereas, at rest, the diaphragm probably plays little role in cardial competence, diaphragmatic contraction may help prevent reflux in conditions resulting in increased abdominal pressure such as during physical activity and abdominal staining. The presence of a hiatal hernia increases susceptibility to reflux. A delayed gastric emptying may also facilitate reflux and represents a factor of resistance to antireflux therapy. Most studies in humans have shown that motor abnormalities remain unchanged after healing of oesophagitis. Acid and pepsin are the most noxious agents of the upper gastrointestinal secretions that can participate in the pathogenesis of oesophagitis. However, there is no evidence that patients with reflux have greater acid secretion than subjects without reflux. The clearance function is a two-stage phenomenon requiring first a reduction in volume by peristalsis and then chemical neutralization by saliva. Primary peristalsis is mainly responsible for the clearance of acid in both the upright and the supine positions. It takes longer to clear acid in patients with non-reducing hiatal hernia. The layer of mucus which carpets the mucosa comes from the saliva and also from the submucosal glands of the oesophagus. The paracellular pathway is the major route by which mucosal HCl enters and then damages the oesophageal epithelium. Only a minority of acid reflux episodes are accompanied by symptoms. The acid exposure during the time period that precedes a reflux episode (i.e. the acid burden) is a key factor determining whether that reflux episode will be symptomatic or asymptomatic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529509090286", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2034729644", "source": "openalex"}

Those biological and biophysico-chemical factors operating in the Gl tract are the main determinants of Pb bioavailability. They include sites of Pb uptake, the physiology of uptake/transport to blood, the stage of development, interactions of Pb with nutrients, and Gl biochemical transformations of ingested material. Lead uptake occurs as ion or complex, from micelles and perhaps by pinocytosis in the infant. Uptake is mainly via the duodenum but other sites can participate, e.g. ileum (pinocytosis) and colon. Transport to blood is by active, carrier-mediated transport and passive diffusion. Uptake may include movement through intercellular tight junctions.Lead uptake is affected by nutrients in the Gl tract, operating synergistically or antagonistically. Iron and calcium interactions are most important and augment those also occurring in vivo in tissues.Liberation of lead from diverse ingested media, e.g. food, paint, soil and dust, mining waste, is affected by their chemical/physical forms, hydrolytic and oxidative processes in gastric fluid and other Gl sites. Such changes in vivo are poorly simulated by in vitro tests. The downward revision of blood lead (Pb-B) levels considered 'safe', to about 0.5 μmol L−1 (10μg dL−1) or lower, causes even sources of moderately bioavailable Pb to become important.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09542299.1991.11083160", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2195464900", "source": "openalex"}

However, no causative relation has been proven. Aim: To assess whether acid suppression would lead to reduced asthma symptoms in children with concomitant asthma and GORD. Methods: Thirty eight children (mean age 10.8 years, range 7.2–16.8; 29 males) with asthma and a reflux index ⩾5.0 assessed by 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring were randomised to 12 weeks of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily or placebo. The groups were similar in age, gender, mean reflux index, and asthma severity. Primary endpoints were asthma symptoms (daytime wheeze, symptoms at night, in the morning, and during exercise) and quality of life (PAQLQ). Secondary endpoints were changes in lung function and the use of short acting bronchodilators. At the end of the study a repeated pH study was performed to confirm the efficacy of acid suppression. Results: The change in total symptom score did not differ significantly between the omeprazole and the placebo group, and decreased by 1.28 (95% CI −0.1 to 2.65) and 1.28 (95% CI −0.72 to 3.27) respectively.

Both are burdened, however, by toxicity that could contribute to perioperative morbidity and mortality. Methods MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched to capture the incidence of any postoperative complications, cardiac complications, respiratory complications, anastomotic leakage, postoperative 30-day mortality, total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality in randomized clinical trials comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, or NACversus NACR. Meta-analyses comparing NAC and NACR were conducted by using adjusted indirect comparison. Results Twenty-three relevant studies were identified. Comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, there was no increase in morbidity or mortality attributable to neoadjuvant therapy. Subgroup analysis of NACR for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) suggested an increased risk of total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality compared with surgery alone: risk ratio 1·95 (95 per cent confidence interval 1·06 to 3·60; P = 0·032) and 1·97 (1·07 to 3·64; P = 0·030) respectively.

GERD can manifest itself through typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) or may lead to extra-oesophageal symptoms. Extra-oesophageal manifestations of GERD gained increasing attention over the last decade, especially respiratory disorders, because of the prevalent co-occurrence with GERD. The role of GERD in the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders has become a topic of intense discussion.To provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of GERD in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).PubMed was searched for relevant articles using the keywords: GERD, asthma, COPD, prevalence, treatment. Case reports were excluded, only English language articles were considered.Estimates for the prevalence of GERD in asthma range from 30% to 90%, compared to an average of 24% in controls. In COPD patients, the prevalence of GERD ranges from 19% to 78% compared to an average of 18% in controls. These data indicate an increased prevalence of GERD in patients with asthma and COPD, although causality is not established and GERD treatment yielded inconsistent effects. Literature supports GERD as a risk factor for COPD-exacerbations and a predictor of the 'frequent-exacerbator'-phenotype.Despite the high prevalence of GERD in asthma and COPD, a causal link is lacking. The results of anti-reflux therapy on pulmonary outcome are inconsistent and contradictory.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1979995226", "title": "Symptoms and Disease Severity in Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease", "text": "AbstractThe definition of criteria relevant to disease severity assessments should be considered in parallel with the long-term aims of treatment in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). There is no doubt that the resolution of symptoms is the major management aim. Heartburn and regurgitation are specific for GORD when they are the predominant symptoms, but prove to be insensitive when the diagnosis of GORD is based on the measurement of oesophageal acid exposure. A relationship between the frequency of heartburn and the degree of acid exposure has been reported in GORD patients both with and without oesophagitis. GORD may also, however, cause a wide spectrum of atypical symptoms (e.g. non-cardiac chest pain or respiratory symptoms). To the extent that a causal relationship between these symptoms and reflux episodes has been established, evaluation of symptom severity should also encompass these atypical presentations. The role of symptoms in the prediction of relapse of oesophagitis is controversial, but in several studies the presence of residual symptoms of GORD at the time of healing has indicated a greater probability of relapse. Endoscopy is a useful technique for the evaluation of disease severity. Indeed, even typical symptoms may not predict the presence and severity of oesophagitis in an individual patient. Despite the fact that the interpretation of therapeutic trials is often impeded by differences in the grading systems used, healing rates of oesophageal lesions are inversely proportional to the initial severity of oesophagitis when drugs such as H2-receptor antagonists are used. Differences are less evident with highly effective drugs such as omeprazole. Although complete healing of oesophageal mucosal lesions is an ideal treatment end-point, there is no definite evidence that mild, patchy erosions either worsen with time or lead to complications. Therefore, in routine practice, endoscopic monitoring should be limited to patients with severe oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus. In most patients, GORD is a chronic relapsing disease and the factors that may affect the natural history of the disease are not as clearly understood as those in peptic ulcer. Although some studies indicate a higher risk of unfavourable outcome in patients with severe supine reflux, there is no definite evidence that the pre-treatment pH profile, as measured by 24-hour pH-monitoring, can actually be used to predict the evolution of GORD in an individual. Similarly, age, sex, weight, smoking and alcohol consumption do not seem to be important prognostic factors for the long-term outcome.Key Words: Gastro-oesophageal reflux diseaselong-term outcomeoesophageal acid exposureoesophageal pH-monitoringoesophagitissymptom severity", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529409105366", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979995226", "source": "openalex"}

The proportion of unselected patients with laryngeal symptoms who have gastro‐oesophageal reflux as the primary aetiology may be overestimated in some series. The symptom that has been most evaluated is hoarseness, but even for this symptom the proportion of patients who have significant reflux varies widely. There is even less agreement for other symptoms, and the data on globus sensation remains confused. It is likely that these patients present to ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinics because of the relative insensitivity of the oesophageal mucosa to acid exposure. Given the lack of specificity for routine diagnostic tests for gastro‐oesophageal reflux, it is necessary to perform ambulatory pH monitoring for a secure diagnosis in these patients.

Methods Retrospective assessment of patients with erosive reflux disease (ERD; n = 20) and endoscopy negative reflux disease (ENRD; n = 20) with pathologic acid exposure on pH studies (>4.2% time/24 h) and also healthy controls (n = 20) studied by high resolution manometry. Esophageal motility in response to liquid and solid bolus swallows and multiple water swallows (MWS) was analyzed. Peristaltic dysfunction was defined as failed peristalsis, spasm, weak or poorly coordinated esophageal contraction (>3 cm break in 30 mmHg isocontour). Key Results Peristaltic dysfunction was present in 33% of water swallows in controls, 56% ENRD and 76% ERD respectively (P < 0.023 vs controls, P = 0.185 vs ENRD). The proportion of effective peristaltic contractions improved with solid compared to liquid bolus in controls (18%vs 33%, P = 0.082) and ENRD (22%vs 54%, P = 0.046) but not ERD (62%vs 76%, P = 0.438).

Atropine also reduced the rate of reflux episodes from 5.0 (2.0–8.75) to 1.0 (0–6.25) per hour (median (interquartile range)) largely because of a decrease in the rate of transient LOS relaxations from 2.0 (0–4.75) to 0 (0–0) per hour and abolition of reflux during swallow induced LOS relaxation.

Endoscopic studies show that the overall prevalence of reflux oesophagitis among the adult population in Japan is in the region of 14–16%. This is similar to the figure reported in Western countries. The increasing prevalence in Japan may be due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of the condition and improved diagnostic techniques. The majority of the diagnosed cases in Japan are mild and these account for the increase in prevalence of the condition. In contrast to the West, where the condition is more prevalent in male members of the population, there is a high incidence of GERD in elderly females in Japan. The increased incidence of kyphosis and osteoporosis in this population may lead to the development of hiatus hernia, a condition known to exacerbate the development of reflux disease. Furthermore, Japanese patients with endoscopically diagnosed GERD appear to be less likely to complain of typical reflux symptoms, such as heartburn and acid reflux than their Western counterparts.

We address the hypothesis that acidification of oesophagus acutely increases the cough reflex sensitivity in patients with GORD and chronic cough. Nine patients with GORD with chronic cough and 16 patients with GORD without cough were recruited. In a randomized double blind study, saline and acid (HCl, 0.1 mol L(-1)) were separately infused into oesophagus via naso-oesophageal catheter. Cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin was determined immediately after completion of each infusion. Infusion of acid into oesophagus increased capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity in patients with GORD and chronic cough. In contrast, acid had no effect on the cough sensitivity in patients with GORD without cough. In a separate study, acid infusion into oesophagus did not affect the cough sensitivity in 18 healthy subjects.

Prevalence studies of GERD are hampered by whether any heartburn symptom is included, or just predominant or even ‘sole’ heartburn, and also by the time frame over which the symptoms have been evaluated. A systematic search of Medline using the keywords ‘GERD’‘prevalence’ and ‘community’ yielded three papers, two original articles and one systematic review of studies that surveyed symptoms in unselected subjects. Heartburn is a common symptom in Europe ranging from a prevalence of 38% in Northern Europe to 9% in Italy. Comparable 6‐month data from the USA suggest an even higher prevalence with a rate of 42%. GERD is also a long‐term, relapsing disorder. A population survey in Sweden found GERD symptoms over time at 18% of the population surveyed. In summary, although symptoms and quality of life improve with acid suppression therapy, costs are high and the potential benefit of long‐term treatment is rare, but serious complications of GERD are unknown.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02219.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980816542", "source": "openalex"}

The natural course of IPF is well known: the majority of patients with IPF display steady decline in lung function, some patients remain stable for prolonged periods of time, a subgroup of patients rapidly decline, and a subset of patients manifest acute exacerbations of IPF preceding death [1]. While several key cellular and molecular events that are thought to follow “injury” have been identified in the pathogenesis of IPF [2], the ultimate cause of IPF and the triggering factor(s) that injure the lung remain elusive, and none of the currently available pharmacological agents have demonstrated improved outcomes and survival in patients with IPF. The incidence and prevalence of IPF is highly linked to advanced age with an estimated incidence and prevalence of 71 and 271 per 100,000 per year for males and 67 and 266 per 100,000 per year for females aged 75 yrs or greater versus an overall incidence and prevalence of 16.3 and 42.7 per 100,000 per year using broad diagnostic criteria [3]. Interestingly, many observations suggest that the aged lung is more susceptible to injury and fibrosis induced by a variety of stimuli, and this susceptibility may be linked to age-associated changes in gene expression or genetic polymorphisms such as age-associated telomerase dysfunction [4–7]. Advanced age is also accompanied by a decline in oesophageal and gastric motility, diminished upper oesophageal sphincter pressure, and an increase in oesophageal acid exposure [8].

Nevertheless, pathophysiology is complex and not well‐understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed: decreased salivation, impaired esophageal clearance, decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure resting tone, presence of hiatal hernia, increased number of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations ( TLESR s), increased acid, and pepsin secretion, pyloric incompetence provoking duodeno‐gastro‐esophageal reflux of bile acids and trypsin. Independent of the relevance of each mechanism, the ultimate phenomenon is that mucosal epithelium is exposed for a longer time to agents as acid and pepsin or is in contact to luminal agents not commonly present in gastric refluxate as trypsin or bile acids. This leads to a visible damage of the epithelium (erosive esophagitis ‐ EE ) or impairing mucosal integrity without any sign of macroscopic alteration as occurs in non‐erosive reflux disease ( NERD ). Luminal factors are not the only responsible for such impairment; more recent data indicate that endogenous factors may also play a role. Purpose This review will update the most recent findings on the putative pathophysiological mechanisms and specially will focus on the role of esophageal mucosal integrity in GERD . Methodologies used for the evaluation of mucosal integrity, its relevance in EE and NERD , its involvement in symptoms perception and the effect of luminal and endogenous factors will be discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2093650978", "source": "openalex"}

A hiatus hernia is associated with GORD symptoms, increased oesophageal acid exposure, and oesophagitis and its severity. In patients with hiatus hernia, the incidence of reflux episodes is increased during periods with low LOS pressure, straining and swallowing.

Proteins with higher digestibility have been linked with better health outcomes. Animal proteins are generally considered to be of better nutritional value than plant proteins not only because they are a good source of essential amino acids but also due to their higher digestibility in the human gastro-intestinal tract. With the recent emergence of alternative food protein sources, which are now processed in a completely new way to design new foods or new versions of the conventional foods, it has become extremely important to understand their digestion characteristics. This review discusses the factors that affect protein digestibility, including protein source, structure, type of processing, and modification, with a particular focus on the effects of non-protein components present in food matrix. To obtain the desired functionality, particularly for alternate proteins, numerous physical, chemical, and enzymatic methods for modification have been reported. These modifications may alter structural characteristics of proteins by inducing structural modifications such as protein unfolding, crosslinking, and aggregation. Depending upon the protein reactivity during processing, the susceptibility of proteins towards hydrolysis by digestive enzymes might change, affecting not only the overall protein digestibility but also the rates of release of polypeptides and amino acids. The faster rates of protein digestion have been linked with muscle anabolism, suggesting the need and importance of classifying the new, emerging and alternative protein sources according to their rates of digestion into rapidly (RDP), slowly digestible (SDP) and resistant (RP) proteins. More research needs to be focussed on converting, through processing, the undigestible or RP into RDP or SDP to achieve better health outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2022.02.021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4212869815", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to report the burden of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.MethodsWe did a systematic review to identify measurements of the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in geographically defined populations worldwide between 1990 and 2017. These estimates were analysed with DisMod-MR, a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression tool that incorporates predictive covariates and adjustments for differences in study design in a geographical cascade of models. Fitted values for broader geographical units inform prior distributions for finer geographical units. Prevalence was estimated for 195 countries and territories. Reports of the frequency and severity of symptoms among individuals with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were used to estimate the prevalence of cases with no, mild to moderate, or severe to very severe symptoms at a given time; these estimates were multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLD).FindingsData to estimate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease burden were scant, totalling 144 location-years (unique measurements from a year and location, regardless of whether a study reported them alongside measurements for other locations or years) of prevalence data. These came from six (86%) of seven GBD super-regions, 11 (52%) of 21 GBD regions, and 39 (20%) of 195 countries and territories. Mean estimates of age-standardised prevalence for all locations in 2017 ranged from 4408 cases per 100 000 population to 14 035 cases per 100 000 population. Age-standardised prevalence was highest (>11 000 cases per 100 000 population) in the USA, Italy, Greece, New Zealand, and several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern Europe; it was lowest (<7000 cases per 100 000 population) in the high-income Asia Pacific, east Asia, Iceland, France, Denmark, and Switzerland. Global prevalence peaked at ages 75–79 years, at 18 820 (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 13 770–24 000) cases per 100 000 population. Global age-standardised prevalence was stable between 1990 and 2017 (8791 [95% UI 7772–9834] cases per 100 000 population in 1990 and 8819 [7781–9863] cases per 100 000 population in 2017, percentage change 0·3% [–0·3 to 0·9]), but all-age prevalence increased by 18·1% (15·6–20·4) between 1990 and 2017, from 7859 (6905–8851) cases per 100 000 population in 1990 to 9283 (8189–10 400) cases per 100 000 population in 2017.

The major cellular fatty acids of strain CRIB T were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain C 12 –C 19 fatty acids, with C 16 : 0 being the predominant fatty acid. The polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the specific spray reagents used. The only quinone was MK-6.

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CRIB T was most closely related to a number of species of the genus Clostridium , including Clostridium lituseburense (97.2 %), Clostridium glycolicum (96.2 %), Clostridium mayombei (96.2 %), Clostridium bartlettii (96.0 %) and Clostridium irregulare (95.5 %). All these species show very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (&lt;85 %) to the type strain of Clostridium butyricum , the type species of the genus Clostridium .

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS • This large study was able to compare the effects of different classes of antidepressant as well as to test for drug–drug interactions with warfarin. • The discovery of alcohol abuse as a strong confounder may partially explain the very high risks of bleed seen in previous studies that did not adjust for this confounder. AIMS (i) To determine the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other classes of antidepressants on upper gastro‐intestinal (GI) haemorrhage and (ii) to assess the drug–drug interaction effects of antidepressants and warfarin or clopidogrel on the risk of GI haemorrhage. METHODS This was a population‐based case control study in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Cases with a first episode of upper GI haemorrhage between 2000 and 2005 were matched with up to 10 controls. Exposure to the study drugs was defined by a prescription issued in the 90 days before the index date. Rate ratios were estimated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS Four thousand and twenty‐eight cases of GI haemorrhage and 40 171 controls were identified. The excess risk of GI haemorrhage with SSRI use was small (Rate Ratio [RR]: 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 1.6) and null with exposure to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (RR 1.0; 95% CI: 0.8, 1.3). The risk of GI haemorrhage was highest with venlafaxine use (RR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6). There was no drug–drug interaction between warfarin anticoagulation and antidepressant use. CONCLUSIONS This study supports a small increased risk of upper GI haemorrhage with the use of SSRI antidepressants compared with the older TCA drugs, but to a lesser extent than previously reported due to confounding by alcohol use. The small elevation in risk of GI haemorrhage with SSRI and venlafaxine should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit of their use.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03154.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2033887363", "source": "openalex"}

The relationship between HIF-1α expression and prognosis was assessed in resection specimens from 177 patients with gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression was not observed in normal gastric mucosa but increased in density (P<0.01) and intensity (P<0.01) with progression from H. pylori-associated gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. The pattern of staining in the resection specimens was focally positive in 49 (28%) and at the invasive tumour edge in 41 (23%). Invasive edge expression was associated with lymph node metastases (P=0.034), advanced TNM stage (P=0.001) and was an adverse prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival (P=0.019). In univariate analysis and in comparison with tumours not expressing HIF-1α, invasive edge staining was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.0−2.5) and focally positive staining a hazard ratio of 0.7 (95% CI 0.5−1.2). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α lost prognostic significance in multivariate analysis.

Many drugs are used for the treatment of GERD such as omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) which is a widely used antiulcer drug demonstrated to protect against esophageal mucosal injury. Melatonin has been found to protect the gastrointestinal mucosa from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species in different experimental ulcer models. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of exogenous melatonin in the treatment of reflux disease in humans either alone or in combination with omeprazole therapy. 36 persons were divided into 4 groups (control subjects, patients with reflux disease treated with melatonin alone, omeprazole alone and a combination of melatonin and omeprazole for 4 and 8 weeks) Each group consisted of 9 persons. Persons were subjected to thorough history taking, clinical examination, and investigations including laboratory, endoscopic, record of esophageal motility, pH-metry, basal acid output and serum gastrin. Melatonin has a role in the improvement of Gastro-esophageal reflux disease when used alone or in combination with omeprazole. Meanwhile, omeprazole alone is better used in the treatment of GERD than melatonin alone. The present study showed that oral melatonin is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of GERD. It is an effective line of treatment in relieving epigastric pain and heartburn. However, further studies are required to confirm the efficacy and long-term safety of melatonin before being recommended for routine clinical use.

The accuracy of diagnostic tests (ie, pH or pH-impedance monitoring, laryngoscopy, endoscopy) for patients with suspected extraoesophageal manifestations of GORD is suboptimal and therefore whether there is a causal relationship between these conditions remains largely undetermined. An empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors can help individual children with undiagnosed respiratory symptoms and suspicion of GORD, but the response to therapy is unpredictable, and in any case what may be being observed is spontaneous improvement. Furthermore, the safety of these agents has been called into question.

The relationship between persistent reflux symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unclear. Aim To assess the relationship between persistent reflux symptoms on PPI therapy and HRQoL in patients with GERD. Methods Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase. Eligible studies had to have used psychometrically evaluated patient reported outcome instruments to assess HRQoL. Results Nine studies were included; supplementary data were obtained for four of these. The effect of persistent reflux symptoms despite PPI therapy on physical HRQoL was assessed in seven studies and that on mental HRQoL in five studies. Compared with patients whose reflux symptoms responded to PPIs, those with persistent symptoms had, on average, 8–16% lower scores for physical health (five studies) and 2–12% lower scores for mental health (three studies). Three studies included data on the effect of baseline HRQoL on subsequent symptomatic response to PPI therapy. Patients with persistent symptoms had clinically relevant lower psychological well-being at baseline compared with those whose symptoms responded to PPIs (average score difference: 7%; two studies). High anxiety levels at baseline seemed to be an important aspect of persistent symptoms. Conclusions Persistent reflux symptoms on PPI therapy are associated with reduced physical and mental HRQoL, while reduced mental HRQoL at baseline seems to impair symptomatic response to PPIs.

The term “refractory GERD” has been used loosely in the literature. A distinction should be made between refractory symptoms (ie, symptoms may or may not be GERD‐related), refractory GERD symptoms (ie, persisting symptoms in patients with proven GERD, regardless of relationship to ongoing reflux), and refractory GERD (ie, objective evidence of GERD despite adequate medical management). The present ESNM/ANMS consensus paper proposes use the term “refractory GERD symptoms” only in patients with persisting symptoms and previously proven GERD by either endoscopy or esophageal pH monitoring. Even in this context, symptoms may or may not be reflux related. Objective evaluation, including endoscopy and esophageal physiologic testing, is requisite to provide insights into mechanisms of symptom generation and evidence of true refractory GERD. Some patients may have true ongoing refractory acid or weakly acidic reflux despite PPIs, while others have no evidence of ongoing reflux, and yet others have functional esophageal disorders (overlapping with proven GERD confirmed off therapy). In this context, attention should also be paid to supragastric belching and rumination syndrome, which may be important contributors to refractory symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14075", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3114191788", "source": "openalex"}

Efficacy : Mean healing rates pooled from clinical trials are as follows: on omeprazole (OME) 20 mg vs. H 2 ‐receptor antagonist, H 2 RA (cimetidine (CIM) 1.6 g or ranitidine (RAN) 300 mg) (eight studies) at 4 weeks, 67% vs. 37%; at 8 weeks, 81% vs. 49%; on lansoprazole (LAN) 30 mg vs. H 2 RA (three studies), 83% vs. 47% and 91% vs. 63% at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. The benefit is greatest in severe disease because the H 2 RAs are disproportionately less effective. Heartburn is more rapidly relieved and in a higher proportion: at 4 weeks, on OME 20 mg vs. H 2 RA, 77% vs. 47% and on LAN 30 mg vs. H 2 RA, 81% vs. 46%. Both PPIs are effective in H 2 RA‐refractory disease, approximately 80% healing occurring in 8 weeks. Relapse rates after healing vary from 2 5 % to 8 5 % at 6 months. Maintenance therapy sustains remissions: relapse at 1 year is, on OME 20 mg vs. RAN 300 mg (2 studies), 12% vs. 79% and 28% vs. 55% (and 38% on OME 10 mg); on LAN 30 mg vs. 10 mg vs. RAN 600 mg, 20% vs. 31% vs. 68%. The effectiveness of the lower dose allows for dose titration. Cost effectiveness : The higher drug costs for the PPIs are offset by their higher efficacy, making their use cost effective, particularly in severe disease. Efficacy and cost effectiveness are likely to further expand the use of PPIs at the expense of H 2 RAs as increasing numbers of patients with milder disease are treated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.1995.tb00779.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987866479", "source": "openalex"}

In this study the hypothesis that fat provokes reflux by stimulating transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations via small intestinal receptors was investigated. METHODS: In 12 healthy volunteers and 11 patients with reflux oesophagitis, oesophageal motility and pH were measured over 30 minute periods during which saline or fat (10% Intralipid) were infused in random order into the duodenum. The infusion periods were separated by a 30 minute washout. The stomach was loaded with 200 ml 10% dextrose, maintained by an intragastric infusion. RESULTS: Fat decreased basal LOS pressure from 16.9 (SEM 2.1) to 12.4 (SEM 1.5) mm Hg in normal subjects but had no effect in patients with oesophagitis (18.8 (SEM 4.3) v 18.2 (SEM 3.0) mm Hg). During saline infusion, the rates of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation and reflux episodes were greater in patients (4.5 (interquartile range 2-11)/30 min and 5 (2-14)/30 min respectively) than in controls (3 (2-4)/30 min and 3 (2-3.5)/30 min respectively). Fat increased the rate of reflux episodes in the reflux patients to 6.5 (3-25)/30 min. This effect was due to an increase in the incidence of reflux during transient LOS relaxations (65% v 91%), the rate of transient relaxations remaining unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Instillation of fat directly into the duodenum aggravates reflux in patients with reflux disease, by increasing the proportion of transient LOS relaxations accompanied by reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.40.4.449", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2122005296", "source": "openalex"}

The response was not blocked by atropine, guanethidine or cervical spinal cord transection but was abolished by cervical vagotomy, showing that the vagal “relaxatory” fibres to the stomach mediate this reflex effect. Transient distension of the stomach produced a long‐lasting gastric relaxation with similar characteristics as that obtained by the mentioned afferent electric stimulation. By vagal blockade in atropinized cats it was shown that the vagal nerves exerted no or only slight relaxatory effects if the stomach was only slightly filled, hut then had a profound relaxatory effect when the stomach was moderately or greatly filled. It is concluded that a vago‐vagal gastro‐gastric relaxatory reflex exists where the vagal non‐adrenergic relaxatory fibres serve as the efferent link. The reflex can be activated from gastric mechanoreceptors responding to distension and is suggested to be involved in the regulation of receptive relaxation in gastric filling.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.1973.tb05457.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1974471078", "source": "openalex"}

Still, there is controversy on the role of weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux in BE. To compare characteristics of reflux episodes patients with BE, erosive esophagitis (EE), and healthy volunteers (HV).One hundred consecutive patients with BE (75 short-segment BE, 25 long-segment BE), 50 with EE and 48 HV underwent multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH off-therapy. We quantified esophageal acid exposure, characteristics, and proximal extension of reflux episodes.Total and acid reflux episodes gradually increased from HV [28 (17.5-43) and 18 (8-31)] to EE [73.5 (54-96) and 52 (39-68)], short-segment BE (SSBE) [83 (73.2-131) and 65 (43.3-95)] and long-segment BE (LSBE) [105 (102-187) and 77 (75-107)]. Weakly acidic reflux episodes were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in LSBE [36 (27.5-50.5)] and SSBE [34 (18.5-41)] compared to EE [21.5 (15-37)] and HV [19 (14-25)].

In LSBE, a higher percentage of reflux episodes (P < 0.05) reached the proximal esophagus (59%) compared with SSBE (43%). Barrett esophagus patients have more severe reflux as shown by the number of acid and weakly acidic reflux episodes, re-reflux episodes and proximal migration.

In this study, whey proteins were used for this purpose by carrying out the Ca2+-induced gelation of pre-heated whey protein isolate (WPI). A Lactobacillus rhamnosus cell suspension was added in a denatured WPI solution in a 30 : 70 volume ratio. Gelation was carried out by extrusion of the cell suspension in a CaCl2 solution. Beads of ∼3 mm diameter were formed. The population in the beads was 8.0 × 108 cells g−1. Entrapment efficiency in gel beads was 96%, with a survival level of 23%. Scanning electron microscopy of beads before freeze-drying showed a tight protein network containing encapsulated Lb. rhamnosus cells homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix. The survival to freeze-drying of the bead-entrapped cells was 41%. Viability of microentrapped cells in a dynamic gastro-intestinal (GI) model was studied and the results were compared to free cells freeze-dried in a milk-based cryoprotective solution, as well as in a pre-denatured WPI solution. Results showed that protein gelation provided protection against acidic conditions in the stomach after 90 min, as well as against bile after 30, 60 and 90 min in the duodenum. Moreover, the milk-based cryoprotective solution was equally effective after 90 min in the duodenum. It is concluded that the gelation of whey proteins induced by Ca2+ ions can protect the cells against adverse conditions of the GI system. However, certain stages in the entrapment process, particularly extrusion in the solution of CaCl2, still need to be optimized in order to reduce the mortality of the cells during gelation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02652040500162840", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2085026550", "source": "openalex"}

This is surprising for a disease that affects 50% of the world's population. Attempts to culture H. pylori from faecal material and saliva have met with difficulty, casting some doubt on the likelihood of a faeco‐oral or oro‐oral route of transfer. The infection is easily passed from person to person by gastric intubation. The hypothesis advanced in this paper is that the natural route of transmission is by gastric juice, specifically as a result of epidemic vomiting in childhood. This theory is supported by literature indicating that acute infection with H . is characterized by vomiting of achlorhydric mucus that may serve as a vehicle for transmission. The hypothesis is consistent with most of the epidemiological data that have been published on H. pylori infection, including its association with childhood overcrowding, the lack of a fixed hot water supply and disadvantaged social conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.1995.tb00426.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1995740221", "source": "openalex"}

Data were analysed using a three-state Markov model to estimate transition rates (according to the Los Angeles classification) regarding the natural course of the disease. Individual risk score together with the kinetic curve was derived by identifying significant factors responsible for the net force between progression and regression.During three consecutive study periods, 12.2, 14.9 and 17.9% of subjects, respectively, progressed from non-erosive to erosive disease, whereas 42.5, 37.3 and 34.6%, respectively, regressed to the non-erosive stage. The annual transition rate from non-erosive to class A-B disease was 0.151 per person year (95% CI 0.136 to 0.165) and from class A-B to C-D was 0.079 per person year (95% CI 0.063 to 0.094). The regression rate from class A-B to non-erosive disease was 0.481 per person year (95% CI 0.425 to 0.536). Class C-D, however, appeared to be an absorbing state when not properly treated. Being male (relative risk (RR) 4.31; 95% CI 3.22 to 5.75), smoking (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.39) or having metabolic syndrome (RR 1.75; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.38) independently increased the likelihood of progressing from a non-erosive to an erosive stage of disease and/or lowered the likelihood of disease regression.

However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0953-0673.2004.01832.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049213418", "source": "openalex"}

In the light microscope, they display microvilli longer than in nearby cells; the cytoplasm is usually pale and contains an apical group of parallel fibrils, next to which are minute light spaces which may correspond to the caveolae. In the electron microscope, each fibril is found to be composed of a bundle of straight filaments, extending from the core of a microvillus down into the deeper portion of the supranuclear region; microtubules are often associated with these filaments. Filaments of a different type are arranged in bundles which go from desmosome to desmosome around the apical region of the cell. The caveolae are long and tortuous channels opening at the cell surface between the microvilli and extending deep into the cytoplasm. From the walls of caveolae, polyp‐like structures project into the lumen. The heads of the polyps are believed to be released into this lumen where they appear as small spheres. These in turn may come out of the caveolae to appear between and next to the microvilli. Caveolated cells are not numerous, e.g., they make up less than 1% of the epithelial cells in the crypts of descending colon. They may be found in the intestinal crypts among poorly differentiated cells, and at the surface of stomach and intestine among fully differentiated cells. They appear to undergo renewal, but since they have not been seen in mitosis, they probably arise from the differentiation of some other epithelial cells.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1001400203", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046237843", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: One hundred Chinese patients with GERD and 101 healthy Chinese controls were presented with a 20‐item GERD questionnaire in the Chinese language (Chinese GERDQ). Quality of life in GERD patients was assessed by SF‐36. A standard dose of proton pump inhibitors for 4 weeks was prescribed to 35 patients with newly diagnosed GERD. The Chinese GERDQ was performed before, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after treatment. Concept, content, construct, discriminant validity and reliability of the questionnaire were assessed. Results: Seven items were selected by logistic regression to account for most of the differences between controls and GERD patients with a good reproducibility and internal consistency. A cut‐off score of equal or greater than 12 was determined to discriminate between controls and GERD patients with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 84%. The Chinese GERDQ correlated negatively with five domains of the SF‐36 and discriminated between GERD patients who reported symptomatic improvement during proton pump inhibitor treatment and symptoms deterioration upon withdrawal of proton pump inhibitor treatment.

Methods House‐to‐house survey was undertaken by trained interviewers using translated‐validated Rome III and hospital anxiety and depression questionnaires. Result Among 3426 subjects ≥ 18 years old from 3 villages in Uttar Pradesh, 84% participated, of whom 80% were finally analyzed. Of these 2774 subjects (age 38.4 ± 16.5 years, 1573 [56.7%] male), 2654 [95.7%] were vegetarian and 120 [4.3%] non‐vegetarian. Socioeconomic classes were upper (16.7%), upper middle (15.1%), lower middle (22%), upper lower (22.2%), and lower (24%) using Prasad's Classification; 603 (21.7%) had FGIDs (413 [14.9%] dyspepsia, 75 [2.7%] irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 115 [4.1%] dyspepsia‐IBS overlap), by Rome III criteria. In subjects with dyspepsia, 49/528 (9%) had epigastric pain, 141 (27%) postprandial distress syndromes (EPS, PDS) and 338 (64%) EPS‐PDS overlap. IBS was more often diarrhea than constipation‐predominant subtype. On univariate analysis, chewing tobacco, aerated drink, tea/coffee, disturbed sleep, vegetarianism, and anxiety parameters and presence of dyspepsia predicting occurrence of IBS were associated with FGIDs. On multivariate analysis, chewing tobacco, aerated soft drink, tea/coffee, vegetarianism, anxiety parameters, and presence of dyspepsia predicting IBS were significant.

The purpose of this trial was to compare standard LNF with robot-assisted Nissen fundoplication (RNF). Methods Between 2003 and 2005, 50 patients with confirmed refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were assigned to LNF (25) or RNF (25). Patients who had undergone previous antireflux surgery were excluded. Independent assessment of dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn and general well-being was performed before and 6 months after surgery using questionnaires. Objective outcome was studied 6 months after surgery by oesophageal manometry, 24-h pH monitoring, barium oesophagram series and upper endoscopy. Results Operating time, blood loss, postoperative pain scores, hospital stay and complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. Reoperation rates were the same (one incisional hernia after LNF and one patient with repeat Nissen after RNF because of persistent dysphagia). Postoperative self-rated change in reflux symptoms and quality of life improved equally in both groups. The reduction in oesophageal acid exposure, increase in lower oesophageal sphincter tone and mucosal healing were comparable in both groups at follow-up.

Histamine‐2 receptor antagonists are the most commonly prescribed medications for this disorder, but few controlled studies support this practice. Aim : To evaluate the safety and efficacy of famotidine for infant gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Methods : Thirty‐five infants, 1.3–10.5 months of age, entered an 8‐week, multi‐centre, randomized, placebo‐controlled, two‐phase trial: first 4 weeks, observer‐blind comparison of famotidine 0.5 mg/kg and famotidine 1.0 mg/kg; second 4 weeks, double‐blind withdrawal comparison (safety and efficacy) of each dose with placebo. Results : No serious adverse events were reported. Eleven patients had 16 non‐serious, possibly drug‐related adverse experiences: 6 patients with agitation or irritability (manifested as head‐rubbing in two), 3 patients with somnolence, 2 patients with anorexia, 2 with headache, 1 patient with vomiting, 1 patient with hiccups, and 1 patient with candidiasis. Of the 35 infants, 27 completed Part I. There were significant score improvements for famotidine 0.5 mg/kg in regurgitation frequency ( P = 0.04), and for famotidine 1.0 mg/kg in crying time ( P = 0.027) and regurgitation frequency ( P = 0.004) and volume ( P = 0.01). Eight infants completed Part II on double‐blind treatment, which was insufficient for meaningful comparisons. Conclusions : Histamine‐2 receptor antagonists may cause agitation and headache in infants. A possibly efficacious famotidine dose for infants is 0.5 mg/kg (frequency adjusted for age). As 1.0 mg/kg may be more efficacious in some, the dosage may require individualization based on response.

Inflammation was assessed using the updated Sydney System. <h3>RESULTS</h3> For the 126 patients with a normally located Z-line, biopsies of the GOJ revealed cardiac mucosa in 96, fundic mucosa in 29, and squamous mucosa in one. Inflammation in glandular mucosa at the GOJ was present in 99/125 specimens (79%), including 87/96 (91%) with cardiac mucosa and 12/29 (41%) with fundic mucosa. Inflammation in fundic mucosa was closely related to<i>H pylori</i> and active inflammation was only seen in its presence. Inflammation in cardiac mucosa was less closely linked to <i>H pylori</i>.

This is linked to the immaturity of the oesophagus and stomach and the higher liquid intake of infants. Genetic factors could also be contributory in some families. Clinical symptoms in infants are mainly regurgitation and vomiting, which usually disappear between 1 and 3 years of age. Symptoms in children are similar to those in adults. Treatment in children depends on age and GORD severity. With GOR or mild GORD, particularly in infants, explanation and reassurance together with thickening of formula feed and lifestyle changes are usually effective. Prokinetics either have unproven efficacy (metoclopramide, domperidone) or have been withdrawn (cisapride). Chronic antacid therapy is not recommended. In moderate to severe GORD, histamine-2-receptor antagonists and particularly proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective, especially when oesophagitis is present. PPIs, in particular omeprazole and lansoprazole, have proven efficacy in infants and children. They are well tolerated, with pharmacokinetics similar to those in adults.

Electrical activity was recorded in single afferent C fibres dissected from the cervical vagus of the cat. The receptors were distension‐sensitive endings in the œsophagus, stomach or small intestines. The latency of the response to distension was largely due to the time taken for the impulses to travel from the receptor to the recording electrodes. 2. The rate of discharge of impulses was much higher when distension with the same volume of fluid was rapid than when distension was slow. This was seen most clearly when only short lengths of the intestine were distended. It is suggested that the effect is partly due to smooth muscle tone. 3. Contraction of smooth muscle at the site of the receptor set up a discharge of impulses in the afferent fibre, and this response was not dependent on changes in intraluminal pressure. It was concluded that the receptors were tension‐signalling devices “in series” with the contractile elements in the smooth muscle. 4. The receptors were unaffected by removal of the mucosa and submucosa, and probably lay in the muscularis externa of the stomach or intestines. 5. The receptors were excited by intravenous injection of phenyl‐diguanide and adrenaline and by acetylcholine poured over the opened viscus. They were unaffected by 0·1N HCl.

Methods and results: Eighty consecutive patients with a GEJ carcinoma (43 from mainland China, and 37 from the USA) were evaluated for association with Barrett oesophagus (BO), chronic Helicobacter pylori gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and outcome. GEJ carcinomas were defined as tumours that were located within 20 mm of, and crossed, the GEJ. Overall, GEJ carcinomas from Chinese patients revealed significantly more frequent location in the proximal stomach, higher pathological stage, larger size, younger patient age, and association with chronic H. pylori gastritis. In contrast, GEJ cancers from American patients showed a strong association with distal oesophageal location, BO, and associated intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. Pathologically, GEJ carcinomas from American patients were predominantly adenocarcinomas, whereas Chinese patients showed a higher proportion of mucinous, adenosquamous, acinar or neuroendocrine tumours.

Results from trials in patients with advanced-stage gastro-oesophageal cancer have raised hopes that ICIs will be successful as adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments in early-stage disease, when the majority of patients relapse after potential curative treatments, and several trials are ongoing. Unfortunately, however, ICI-responding patients appear to constitute a minority subgroup within gastro-oesophageal cancer, and resistance to ICI therapy (whether primary or acquired) is common.

Aim To evaluate the effects of ADX10059 monotherapy for 2 weeks on symptom control in patients with GERD. Methods This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial in GERD patients who were responders to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Following PPIs withdrawal, a 2-week baseline washout period was followed by 2-week treatment with either ADX10059 120 mg or placebo b.d. The primary clinical efficacy endpoint was the number of GERD symptom-free days in treatment week 2 compared with the last 7 days of baseline. The effect on reflux events using 24-h impedance–pH monitoring was also determined in a subset of 24 patients. Results The full analysis set comprised 103 patients ADX10059 (N = 50), Placebo (N = 53). In treatment week 2, ADX10059 significantly increased GERD symptom-free days (P = 0.045) and heartburn-free days (P = 0.037), reduced antacid use (P = 0.017), improved total symptom score (P = 0.048) including subscale heartburn/regurgitation (P = 0.007) and sleep disturbance because of GERD (P = 0.022). ADX10059 significantly reduced total (P = 0.034) and acidic reflux events (P = 0.003). ADX10059 was well tolerated. Most common adverse events for ADX10059 were mild to moderate dizziness 16% and vertigo 12% (placebo 4% and 2%). Conclusions Inhibition of mGluR5 with ADX10059 monotherapy reduces reflux events and improves symptoms in GERD patients. This mechanism has promise for the management of GERD (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00820079).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04596.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1847350811", "source": "openalex"}

The number of acid and weakly acidic reflux episodes increased from 25.9 ± 3.9 to 17.9 ± 1.5 in the controls, 39.9 ± 6.3 to 33.4 ± 5.7 in the patients with NERD, 46.6 ± 6.2 to 40.4 ± 9.2 in grade A, 68.2 ± 9.2 to 49.2 ± 12.3 in grade B, 79.8 ± 15.6 to 47.4 ± 4.6 in grade C/D and 75.1 ± 7.9 to 37.3 ± 8.5 in the patients with Barrett. The proportion of reflux episodes that is acidic or alkaline was similar all groups. Comparison with normal values revealed that none of the controls, 40% of the patients with NERD, 50% of the patients with grade A, 80% of the patients with grade B and all patients with grade C/D or Barrett’s oesophagus had an abnormally high total number of reflux episodes. In the patients with severe oesophagitis a significantly higher percentage of reflux episodes reached the proximal oesophagus (43.8%) compared to the patients with Barrett’s oesophagus (19.2%). With increasing degrees of oesophagitis, patients have more reflux episodes but a large overlap between the groups exists making comparison with normal values of limited relevance.

Results Of the 2500 questionnaires, 2057 were analysed (mean age: 34.8 ± 13.0 years, 55.1% female). Frequent GERD was seen in 18.2%. Minor symptoms increased prevalence. Female gender (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.01–2.41), BMI &gt;30 kg/m 2 (OR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.03–3.12), less education (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.02–2.27), smoking (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.12–2.99), NSAID use (OR: 4.23, 95% CI: 1.66–10.74) and GERD in spouse (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.18–2.82) were associated with frequent GERD on multivariable analysis. GERD in first‐degree relatives (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.23–2.43) and asthma (OR: 4.09, 95% CI: 1.27–13.15) correlated with infrequent GERD. Minor symptoms correlated with GERD history in first‐degree relatives, coffee consumption and NSAID use. Prevalence in the past 3 months was similar to that in the past 12 months ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease is common in Tehran. The association of ‘infrequent symptoms’ with GERD history in first‐degree relatives and ‘frequent symptoms’ with GERD history in spouse may point to the presence of yet unknown precipitating environmental factors inducing GERD in a genetically susceptible host. Minor GERD symptoms seem to have independent contribution to GERD.

The progressive development of a piglet’s gut and the associated microbiota and immune system offers a unique window of opportunity for supporting gut health through dietary modulation. This is particularly relevant for large litters, for which sow colostrum and milk are insufficient. The authors have therefore proposed the use of supplemental milk and creep feed with a dual purpose. In addition to providing nutrients to piglets, supplemental milk can also serve as a gut modulator in early life by incorporating functional ingredients with potential long-term benefits. To prepare piglets for weaning, it is important to stimulate the intake of solid feed before weaning, in addition to stimulating the number of piglets eating. The use of functional ingredients in creep feed and a transition diet around the time of weaning helps to habituate piglets to solid feed in general, while also preparing the gut for the digestion and fermentation of specific ingredients. In the first days after weaning (i.e., the acute phase), it is important to maintain high levels of feed intake and focus on nutritional strategies that support good gastric (barrier) function and that avoid overloading the impaired digestion and fermentation capacity of the piglets. In the subsequent maturation phase, the ratio of lysine to energy can be increased gradually in order to stimulate piglet growth. This is because the digestive and fermentation capacity of the piglets is more mature at this stage, thus allowing the inclusion of more fermentable fibres. Taken together, the nutritional strategies addressed in this review provide a structured approach to preparing piglets for success during weaning and the period that follows. The implementation of this approach and the insights to be developed through future research can help to achieve some of the most important goals in pig production: reducing piglet mortality, morbidity and antimicrobial use.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020402", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3126971630", "source": "openalex"}

Oesophageal pH monitoring is also recommended to document gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in children with unusual presentations such as chronic respiratory disease. Today, cisapride is the drug of choice because it has the best efficacy and safety profile. In infants and children presenting with symptoms suggesting oesophagitis, endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract is recommended. If there is severe oesophagitis, acid suppression with histamine H 2 ‐receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in combination with prokinetics, are recommended.

Infants receive frequent milk feeds, and because milk is a potent buffer of gastric acidity, oesophageal impedance should detect more reflux than pH recording. Indeed, impedance has the advantage over pH monitoring of being independent of pH, and as a consequence, of being better adapted to measure reflux during postprandial periods when reflux is buffered and to detect symptoms associated with non‐acid or weakly acid reflux episodes. Numerous episodes are detected by one of these techniques (pH monitoring or impedance) in children. Most studies using the impedance technique consider very small numbers of patients, and there are few reports linking data from diagnostic impedance procedures to clinical outcome in symptomatic patients. Data suggesting that impedance does offer a clear‐cut benefit in paediatric clinical practice are missing. The high cost of the material and the investment in time necessary for interpretation of the recording, remains a handicap. It is mandatory, despite ethical difficulties, to obtain normal ranges for intraluminal impedance monitoring. Conclusion: As pH monitoring is part of impedance technology, it is likely that the latter will replace pH monitoring despite the current lack of scientific evidence demonstrating a relation between symptoms, oesophageal damage or response to reflux treatment and impedance‐pH results.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00306.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1587985646", "source": "openalex"}

There have been few studies examining these parameters in oesophageal or gastro‐oesophageal cancers. This study aims to address that deficiency. Methods and results: A two‐centre, retrospective study was carried out on 356 patients. Tumour budding and host inflammatory response at the invasive front were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the prognostic significance of these factors. The median number of tumour buds was four (range 0–50) with 172 of 356 cases having five or more buds at the invasive front. The presence of five or more buds was associated with a poor prognosis on univariate analysis ( P = 0.0001), as was a sparse or moderate host inflammatory response ( P = 0.001). Tumour budding retained prognostic significance when tumours were separated into adenocarcinomas ( n = 287) and squamous cell carcinomas ( n = 69), but host inflammatory response was a significant prognostic factor only for adenocarcinomas. On multivariate analysis the presence of five or more buds retained significance ( P = 0.002). Conclusions: Tumour budding and host inflammatory response are important prognostic factors in patients with oesophageal/gastro‐oesophageal cancer and can be used to identify high‐risk patients who would benefit from closer follow‐up and adjuvant therapies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03559.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2113155618", "source": "openalex"}

GERD genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown strong genetic overlaps with established risk factors such as obesity and depression. We hypothesised that the shared genetic architecture between GERD and these risk factors can be leveraged to (1) identify new GERD and Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) risk loci and (2) explore potentially heterogeneous pathways leading to GERD and oesophageal complications. Design We applied multitrait GWAS models combining GERD (78 707 cases; 288 734 controls) and genetically correlated traits including education attainment, depression and body mass index. We also used multitrait analysis to identify BE risk loci. Top hits were replicated in 23andMe (462 753 GERD cases, 24 099 BE cases, 1 484 025 controls). We additionally dissected the GERD loci into obesity-driven and depression-driven subgroups. These subgroups were investigated to determine how they relate to tissue-specific gene expression and to risk of serious oesophageal disease (BE and/or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, EA). Results We identified 88 loci associated with GERD, with 59 replicating in 23andMe after multiple testing corrections. Our BE analysis identified seven novel loci. Additionally we showed that only the obesity-driven GERD loci (but not the depression-driven loci) were associated with genes enriched in oesophageal tissues and successfully predicted BE/EA. Conclusion Our multitrait model identified many novel risk loci for GERD and BE. We present strong evidence for a genetic underpinning of disease heterogeneity in GERD and show that GERD loci associated with depressive symptoms are not strong predictors of BE/EA relative to obesity-driven GERD loci.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-323906", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3173683558", "source": "openalex"}

Three per cent of parents of 10 to 12 month old infants view this as a problem. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of thickened feeds, positioning, and metoclopramide as compared to placebo in improving the outcome of GER in developmentally normal infants aged one month to two years. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 23 January 2003), EMBASE (January 1985 to 27 January 2003), and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised studies (parallel or cross over) which evaluated thickened feeds, positional alternations or meoclopramide for the treatment of GER in children between the age of one month and two years who were developmentally normal. Data collection and analysis All three reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. Main results Twenty trials involving 771 children met the inclusion criteria: eight dealt with thickened feeds, five with positioning, and seven with metoclopramide. Few comparisons could be made, and so summary measures were often made with two or three studies. Thickened feeds reduce the regurgitation severity score (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐0.94;95% confidence interval ‐1.35 to ‐0.52), as well as the frequency of emesis (SMD ‐0.91; confidence interval ‐1.22 to ‐0.61). The reflux index was not reduced (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.48%; 95% confidence interval‐3.27 to 4.23). All five positioning studies utilized esophageal pH monitoring as their outcome measure. Elevating the head of the crib for treating reflux in the supine position is not justifiable. The seven metoclopramide studies used a variety of outcomes. Compared to placebo, metoclopramide appears to reduce daily symptoms ( SMD ‐0.73; 95% confidence interval ‐1.16 to ‐0.30), and reduce the reflux index (WMD ‐2.80%; 95% confidence interval ‐5.58 to ‐0.01). It does increase side effects. Authors' conclusions Thickened feeds are helpful in reducing the symptoms of GER. Elevating the head of the crib in the supine position does not have any effect.

Compared with baseline, significant increases in time to heartburn was found with famotidine at weeks 4 (383 (102), p &lt; 0.01) and 5 (344 (92), p &lt; 0.01) but not week 8 (336 (90) seconds). No significant effects were found with placebo (219 (41), 146 (23), and 144 (25) seconds for weeks 4, 5, and 8). Heartburn symptom score decreased significantly with famotidine (mean scores 3.6, 1.9, 2.1, and 2.6 at weeks 0, 4, 5, and 8 (p=0.001)) and showed a significant negative correlation with time to heartburn (r(s)=-0.60; p&lt;0.0001). It is concluded that oesophageal sensitivity to acid is reduced by famotidine independent of and effect on oesophagitis; the effect wanes one to four weeks after the end of treatment and correlates with change in heartburn score.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.35.4.447", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020008501", "source": "openalex"}

Whereas instruments have been developed to assist researchers, there is a paucity of reliable instruments for pragmatic use in the clinical setting. The situation is complicated because there is not necessarily a direct correlation between endoscopic findings and symptom severity and non‐erosive reflux disease is now recognized as an important manifestation of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. However, quality‐of‐life instruments are useful in evaluating the impact of therapies and interventions, although these are limited, particularly in surgical interventions. Impaired quality of life now forms part of a definition of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, the impact of which goes beyond the symptoms alone. While the symptoms themselves have a negative effect on sufferers’ lives, there are secondary effects caused by impaired physical, emotional and social functioning on productivity. Non‐gastrointestinal problems caused by gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease also impair quality of life. There is an ongoing need to develop instruments which truly measure the impact of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and which are readily interpretable to the individual patient and clinician.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02608.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2000702096", "source": "openalex"}

Design: A retrospective and prospective hospital-based study. Setting: The general and paediatric surgical wards of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Main outcome measures: Demography, the systolic BP, pulse rate and haemoglobin on admission at ER, co-morbid conditions, site of perforation, surgical method and treatment outcome. Subjects: A total of 326 cases treated for peptic ulcer perforation, 267 males and 59 females; ratio 4.5:1, with mean age of 40.9, SD 16.4 and range 4-87 years, were studied. Results: The incidence of peptic ulcer perforation rose from 1.6% in 1998 to 5.3% in 2002 and stabilised at 5%, and overall accounted for 4.6% of acute abdomen. Co-morbid conditions were present in 48 (18.2%) of cases. Ulcerogenic substance intake was in 177 (67%) patients. One hundred and twenty two (46.2%) patients reported to hospital within 24 hours of perforation. There were 287 (88%) duodenal, 22 (7.1%) prepyloric, and 19(4.9%) type 1 gastric ulcer perforations. Simple closure with omental patch was performed in 299(94.3%), truncal vagotomy and drainage in 10 (3.2%), and Billroth II partial gastrectomy in seven (2.2%). Post-operative complications occurred in 62 (19%); overall mortality was 36 (11%). Logistic regression analysis of the patients clinical variables showed that age less that 60 years (p-value, OR and 95% CI; 0.002, 3.964 and 1 .668-9.420), duration of perforation of more than 24 hours before admission (p-value, OR and 95%CI; 0.011,2.471 and 1.228-4.971), alcohol intake (p-value, OR and 95%CI; 0.009, 2.543 and 1.259-5.135) and resectional surgery (p-value, OR and 95%CI; 0.000, 8.25E and 74204908.138-9162648048.1) were statistically significant in determining postoperative complications. Age 60 years and above (p-value, OR and 95%CI; 0.018,4.359 and 1.284-14.802), alcohol intake (p-value, OR and 95%CI; 0.042, 3.238 and 1.046- 10.021) and resectional surgery (p-value, OR and 95% CI; 0.000, 1.20E and 938112920.94- 1.54E+ 11) were the factors that showed statistical significance in determining post-operative mortality. Conclusion: Perforated peptic ulcer disease is emerging as a frequent cause of acute abdomen in our centre and affects the youth commonly.

Aim: To determine the temporal relationship of abnormal objective sleep parameters to gastro‐oesophageal reflux during acid suppression in patients with self diagnosed sleep disorders. Methods: Polysomnography during oesophageal pH monitoring was conducted in 16 subjects with and without gastro‐oesophageal reflux as determined by a standardized questionnaire. Subjects were studied before and after omeprazole. Results: All reflux events were followed by a sleep arousal or awakening. Nocturnal acid reflux events were not predicted by the Carlsson score. Omeprazole reduced acid reflux‐associated arousals from 11.6 ± 3.8 to 1.5 ± 0.8 ( P &lt; 0.01) and awakenings from 7.7 ± 1.2 to 3.7 ± 0.5 ( P &lt; 0.05). Sleep efficiency improved from 70.2% to 81.6% in a small subset of subjects with decreased sleep ( P &lt; 0.05); rapid eye movement sleep increased from 55.0 ± 4.5 to 94.5 ± 18.9 min ( P &lt; 0.05); total sleep time increased from 294.0 ± 15.9 to 345.6 ± 55.6 min ( P &lt; 0.05). Apnoea, hypopnoea and hypoxaemia were not associated with reflux. Conclusions: In subjects with gastro‐oesophageal reflux, sleep arousals and awakenings are closely related to acid reflux events. Reflux‐related arousals and awakenings are decreased by acid suppression. Acid suppression in selected subjects with reflux events and reduced sleep efficiency is associated with increased total sleep time, rapid eye movement sleep and sleep efficiency.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02573.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005863076", "source": "openalex"}

A regular seasonal pattern was revealed. The concentration of larvae on the herbage falls to a low level in spring. Susceptible calves turned out at this time may begin to contaminate the pasture in mid-May but it is not until July that the infestation on the herbage increases significantly. Generally the increase is to a high level which is maintained with little change until the following spring. Evidence is presented which indicates that contamination of the pasture in the first half of the grazing season is far more effective in the production of an infestation on the herbage than is contamination in the second half of the season. In a discussion of the epidemiology of parasitic gastro-enteritis the formerly accepted view, that clinical helminthiasis results from a continuous build-up of infection in the calves and on the pasture is rejected. It appears that the parasites complete little more than one generation each year.

Methods Sixty patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) were randomized to laparoscopic or open 360 ° fundoplication. Subjective evaluation using disease-specific and generic questionnaires and structured interviews, and objective evaluation by endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24-h pH monitoring, were performed before operation and 1 month, 6 months and 5 years after surgery. Results Two patients in the laparoscopic group had reoperations for hiatal stricture; one patient in the open group had repair of an incisional hernia, and one patient in each group had surgery for intestinal obstruction. There were no differences in the subjective outcomes of diet, sleep, medication, patient satisfaction and symptoms of GORD after 5 years. Nor were there any differences in objective outcomes determined by endoscopy, manometry or 24-h pH monitoring. Well-being was decreased in all patients before operation but was restored to normal or above-normal values after fundoplication, regardless of the type of surgery.

Methods Forty‐three GERD patients with abnormal 24‐h pH tests were prospectively randomised to receive baclofen or placebo in a double‐blind fashion for 2 weeks. Oesophageal manometry, 24‐h pH monitoring, and a standard questionnaire was administered, before and after treatment. Results Thirty‐four patients completed the study.

An analysis was performed with regard to lymphatic spread in T3, N+ adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and the GEJ junction, which were treated with a radical resection including a three-field lymphadenectomy. Out of 324 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ, we selected a group of 37 patients with an adenocarcinoma T3, N+ of the distal (n = 17) or GEJ junction (n = 20), treated with a radical resection and three-field lymphadenectomy ( > 25 lymph nodes resected).In total, 2240 lymph nodes were removed, with a mean of 59.5 per patient. In the GEJ group the ratio of positive nodes was 15.9, in the distal 1/3 group this ratio was 12.7%. Abdominal lymph nodes were positive in all GEJ tumors and in 70% of the distal third carcinomas. Thoracic lymph nodes were positive in 40% of GEJ tumors, and 70.6% of the distal group. Cervical lymph nodes were positive in 20% of the GEJ tumors and in 35.3% of the distal tumors.

Both doses of ranitidine significantly decreased oesophageal acid exposure and the effect was independent of baseline acid exposure. Reflux symptoms cannot be used to differentiate between presence or absence of oesophagitis and/or HH. Reflux patients without oesophagitis have less night-time reflux.

Cisapride significantly (p less than 0.01) increased the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (+124%), the amplitude (+84%) and duration (+24%) of oesophageal peristaltic waves, whereas the placebo treatment did not produce any changes. Subsequently, all 14 children underwent 24 hour oesophageal pH-monitoring before and after four weeks of treatment with oral cisapride 0.2 mg/kg tid given in addition to postural therapy and thickened feedings. The 24 hour intraoesophageal pH recordings and symptomatic scores were compared with those of 10 control patients treated only by postural therapy and thickened feedings. When compared with baseline pH data, cisapride significantly reduced the oesophageal acid exposure time, the mean duration of each reflux episode, the duration of the longest reflux episode and the number of long lasting reflux episodes; the number of reflux episodes was not influenced. The effect of cisapride was marked and consistent during fasting and sleep periods. Oesophageal acid exposure was reduced more significantly in patients given cisapride (-61%) than in controls (-24%; p less than 0.001). Symptom improvement was greater after four weeks of cisapride treatment (score reduction: 61%) than after postural and dietary therapy alone (score reduction: 42%; p less than 0.01).

Human studies are compatible with a synergistic action between acid and duodenogastric reflux in inducing lesions.

Most individuals do not seek medical help, self‐medicating with antacids. Manifestations of GERD range from symptoms without oesophagitis, which constitute the bulk of patients who self‐medicate, to active oesophagitis and then to complications such as stricture and ulceration. It is the more severe cases who tend to come to the gastroenterologist, but it must be remembered that reflux symptoms are probably around 5–10 times more common than actual oesophagitis. Since acid in the refluxate is responsible for the bulk of the symptoms and mucosal damage, antacids are often used for quick relief—which of course may not be sustained. More prolonged suppression of acid secretion, such as by a histamine H 2 ‐receptor antagonist (H 2 RA) or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is required to give long‐lasting symptomatic relief and heal any inflammatory change. H 2 ‐receptor antagonists inhibit acid secretion with an effect that lasts for 4–8 h with a single dose, decreasing stimulated acid secretion by around 70%. When treating oesophagitis, the H 2 RAs suffer from the disadvantage of their relatively short duration of action (compared with PPIs), development of tolerance, and incomplete inhibition of acid secretion in response to a meal. Therefore, it is not easy for the H 2 RAs to achieve optimum conditions for healing the more severe forms of oesophagitis—even very high doses may fail. In mild GERD the H 2 RAs have been shown to be effective in relieving symptoms. In particular, when there is no oesophagitis, relief of reflux symptoms has been obtained after 4 weeks in almost all cases with a twice daily regimen: and it would seem that the sensitivity of the oesophageal mucosa may be reduced so that symptomatic remission is often obtained for a prolonged period after stopping therapy. In the milder forms of oesophagitis (grades I or II) healing can be achieved with all the H 2 RAs in 40–60% of cases in 8 weeks. This can be increased, by a substantial increase in dosage, to around 50–70%, but seldom higher than that. This higher dose has cost and compliance considerations. Proton pump inhibitors are required for higher percentage healing and especially for more severe disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.1995.tb00778.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019557023", "source": "openalex"}

With impedance monitoring gastro-oesophageal reflux can be detected independent of its acidity by differences in electrical impedance between the mucosal surface, fluids and gas that surround the catheter. Clinically, it is used in combination with oesophageal pH monitoring, and the combination of impedance-pH monitoring allows recognition of both acidic and weakly acidic reflux episodes. Studies have shown that impedance-pH monitoring is useful in the evaluation of patients with proton pump inhibitor-resistant typical reflux symptoms, as it provides a higher yield in detecting reflux as the cause of a patient's symptoms compared to pH monitoring alone.

However, 70% of patients cannot receive the complete sequence because of a postoperative complication or a decrease in functional and nutritional reserves. Recently, a new concept appeared in digestive surgery: prehabilitation. This interventional process consists of patient preparation, between surgical consultation and surgery, and is based on 3 components: (1) physical management, (2) nutritional care and (3) psychological care. Prehabilitation should decrease postoperative complications and improve nutritional and physical status during the preoperative and postoperative periods. Therefore, it is becoming essential to evaluate the effect of prehabilitation, compared to conventional care, on the percentage of patients reaching the complete oncological treatment. <h3>Methods and analysis</h3> The PREHAB trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of prehabilitation compared to conventional care, in patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer with perioperative chemotherapy. This trial is a prospective, randomised, controlled, open-blind and interventional study in 4 centres. Patients (n=60 per group) will be randomly assigned for management with either prehabilitation or conventional care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients reaching the complete oncological treatment decided in a multidisciplinary tumour board. The secondary outcomes are the postoperative morbidity, disease-free survival, overall survival, feasibility of the protocol, length of stay, variation of the functional reserve after the preoperative chemotherapy (defined by the VO<sub>2peak</sub>, ventilatory threshold and 6-min walk test), preoperative and postoperative nutritional status, preoperative anxiety, quality of life, 30-day and 90-day mortality and cumulative dose of cytotoxic treatment received. <h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3> The study was approved by an independent medical ethics committee (IRB00008526, CPP Sud-Est VI, Clermont-Ferrand, France) and by the competent French authority (ANSM, Saint Denis, France) and registered on <i>Clinicaltrial.gov</i>.

Here, the Japan Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (JNETS) planned to investigate the recent incidence and distribution of these tumors using data from the national cancer registry started in 2016. This study examined the incidence and distribution of primary sites as well as rate of advanced disease from this population-based registry. Methods A retrospective, population-based study using data from the national cancer registry in Japan (NCR) was conducted to evaluate patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic NEN (GEP-NEN) in 2016. Associated population data were used to determine annual age-adjusted incidences. Results A total of 6735 individuals were diagnosed with GEP-NEN in Japan in 2016. Annual onset incidence was 0.70/100,000 for pancreatic NEN and 2.84/100,000 for gastrointestinal NEN. NEN in the ileum accounted for only 1% of total GEP-NENs in Japan. Most NENs in the esophagus or lungs were neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), while the majority of those in the duodenum, ileum, appendix and rectum were grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Median age at initial diagnosis was in between 60 to 65. Tumors in the duodenum, appendix and rectum were mostly limited to local, while those in the esophagus, stomach and colon tended to show distant metastasis. In Japan, initial treatment for GEP-NENs was resection even if the tumor was NEC. Conclusions This is the first report of a national registry-based incidence and distribution of GEP-NEN in Japan. These data will serve as an important first step to determining the exact etiology and trends for this pathology in Japan.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07581-y", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3100390357", "source": "openalex"}

Gene enrichment analysis (DAVID v6.7) was used on this list of 520 genes to identify pathways associated with response and identified the adipocytokine signalling pathway, with higher leptin mRNA associated with lack of radiological response (P=0.011). Similarly, in the independent cohort (n=154), higher leptin protein expression by immunohistochemistry in the tumour cells was associated with lack of histopathological response (P=0.007). Higher leptin protein expression by immunohistochemistry was also associated with improved survival in the absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and patients with low leptin protein-expressing tumours had improved survival when treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P for interaction=0.038).

Patient groups spent, on average, 50 fold more time during the upright and supine periods at acidic pH than controls. Saliva was responsible for the percentage of time the pH > 7 and contributed significantly to the percentage of time the pH > 6 in both the proximal and distal oesophagus of control subjects, as shown by an absence of pH > 7 and a significant (p < 0.001) fourfold decrease in pH > 6 during sleep. A similar pattern was seen in the proximal oesophagus of both reflux groups. The reflux and Barrett's patients, however did not show a significant decrease in the percentage of time the pH > 6 at night in the distal oesophagus suggesting a relative increase in 'alkaline' exposure from another source. This was not because of duodenogastric reflux as the corresponding pH rises in the fundus of the stomach were non-existent. Although this was not studied specifically, it is believed to be a protective meachanism, the result of alkaline secretion produced by submucosal oesophageal glands.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.34.3.309", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2133221626", "source": "openalex"}

Two choice trials, each using five animals parasitized with O. circumcincta and five parasite naive animals, were conducted to investigate cues used by sheep to avoid grazing swards contaminated with faeces. Animals were presented with pairs of artificial swards (36 × 21 cm) and allowed to graze for short periods. In the first trial, four quantities (0 g, 5 g, 15 g and 25 g), and in the second trial a control (no faeces) and three age classes (0, 10 and 21 days old), of faeces were tested against each other. Increasing amount offaeces per sward tray was associated with a reduced proportion of bites taken from the sward and reduced bite depth and mass. The minimum amount of faeces at which sheep showed significant levels of rejection was 15 g. Decreasing age of faeces was associated with a reduced proportion of bites taken from the sward, reduced bite depth and mass. This presented the paradox that grazing swards contaminated with young faeces presented least risk of parasitism, yet fresh faeces presented the strongest stimulus for sward rejection. Parasitism altered animal grazing behaviour with parasitized animals becoming more selective when avoiding contaminated swards, taking smaller bites at reduced bite rates compared with non-infected animals. The enhancement of faeces avoidance behaviours shown by parasitized animals could act to reduce further intake of parasites and suggests that grazing behaviour is affected by nematode infection.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1357729800009838", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080263009", "source": "openalex"}

Empirical treatment with antireflux medications is common practice, although on clinical grounds it may be difficult to determine whether GOR is abnormal. Aims: To examine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical predictors of pathological GOR in infants with persistent crying. Methods: One hundred and fifty‐one infants (82 male; median age 2.5 months, range 0.5–8.2 months) with persistent crying were prospectively studied. Crying and fussing were charted for 24 h, and parents completed a validated questionnaire on reflux symptoms. All infants underwent oesophageal 24‐h pH monitoring. Results: Twenty‐seven (17.9%) infants had pathological GOR with a fractional reflux time (FRT) &gt;10%. There was no significant association between total crying duration per 24 and FRT ( P = 0.84) or the number of reflux episodes ( P = 0.68). Pathological GOR was more common in infants under 3 months, compared to older infants ( P = 0.04). Feeding difficulties were significantly associated with pathological GOR ( P = 0.02). Backarching was not increased in infants with GOR ( P = 0.30). Pathological GOR was significantly associated with the frequency of regurgitation ( P = 0.04), but not with vomitus volume ( P = 0.62). Regurgitation more than 5 times daily was the most specific reflux symptom (specificity 70.9%), but was a poor predictor of pathological GOR (positive predictive value 22.2%). In the absence of frequent regurgitation or feeding difficulties, pathological GOR was unlikely (negative predictive value 87–90%).

Aim To test the hypothesis that mechanical effects of obesity on oesophageal function increase acid exposure and symptoms. Methods Height, weight and waist circumference ( WC ) were measured in patients with typical reflux symptoms referred for manometry and 24 h ambulatory pH studies. Symptom severity was assessed by questionnaire. The association between obesity [ WC , body mass index (BMI)], oesophageal function, acid exposure and reflux symptoms was assessed. Results Physiological measurements were obtained from 582 patients (median age 48, 56% female) of whom 406 (70%) completed symptom questionnaires. The prevalence of general obesity was greater in women ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ; F 23%:M 16%; P = 0.056), however more men had abdominal obesity ( WC ≥ 99 cm (M 41%:F 28%; P = 0.001)). Oesophageal acid exposure increased with obesity ( WC : R = 0.284, P &lt; 0.001) and was associated also with lower oesophageal sphincter ( LOS ) pressure, reduced abdominal LOS length and peristaltic dysfunction (all P &lt; 0.001).

However, multivariable analysis demonstrated that the effects of increasing WC on oesophageal function do not explain increased acid reflux in obese patients. Instead, independent effects of obesity and oesophageal dysfunction on acid exposure were present. Reflux symptoms increased with acid exposure ( R = 0.300; P &lt; 0.001) and this association explained increased symptom severity in obese patients.

The present study was conducted to assess the prevalence and severity of non-skeletal manifestations, especially gastrointestinal disturbances, in an area of skeletal and dental fluorosis. The subjects, numbering 1958 inhabitants belonging to 489 families residing in four endemic villages of Faridabad District of Haryana State, were interviewed on health complaints. The information was recorded in a precoded questionnaire. Every drinking water source was analysed for fluoride content. This led to the identification of safe (fluoride 1 ppm or less) and (fluoride above 1 ppm) sources of water. Results revealed that among the subjects were people affected with: 1) Dental fluorosis (58%), 2) Skeletal fluorosis (27%), 3) Non-skeletal manifestations (41%) and 4) Gastrointestinal complaints (26%). Those affected were consuming water contaminated with fluoride ranging from 0.25-8.00 ppm. Among the total of 78 sources of water, 20 were safe while the remaining 58 were more contaminated with fluoride from natural sources. It is concluded that in an endemic zone, where the inhabitants are consuming water of high floride content, the occurence of gastrointestinal complaints; viz., loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation and intermittant diarrhoea - is one of the early warning signs of flouride toxicity and fluorosis.

Salivary nitrite is derived from the entero-salivary recirculation of dietary nitrate. Our aim was to determine whether nitric oxide generated within the lumen will exert nitrosative stress on the adjacent epithelium. A benchtop model was constructed reproducing the nitrite chemistry occurring within the lumen of the upper gastrointestinal tract where saliva encounters acidic gastric juice. It incorporated an epithelial compartment maintained at pH 7.4 and separated from the lumen by a hydrophobic barrier with the properties of the epithelial lipid cell membrane. The secondary amine morpholine was used to measure N-nitroso compound formation in both the lumen and epithelial compartment. Adding 100 µM nitrite to the acidic (pH 1.5) luminal compartment depleted of ascorbic acid generated 6.2 ± 2.0 µM (mean ± SE) N -nitrosomorpholine in that compartment and 2.2 ± 0.1 µM nitrosomorpholine in the epithelial compartment at 30 min. When 100 µM nitrite was added to the acidic luminal compartment containing physiological concentrations of ascorbic acid, all the nitrite was immediately converted to nitric oxide and no N -nitrosomorpholine was formed within that compartment. However, the nitric oxide rapidly diffused from the luminal compartment into the epithelial compartment and there generated very high concentrations of N -nitrosomorpholine (137 ± 5.6 µM at 30 min). The addition of ascorbic acid or glutathione to the epithelial compartment could only reduce nitric oxide-induced nitrosation within that compartment by 40%. The nitrate-derived nitric oxide generated within the lumen where saliva encounters gastric acid is likely to exert substantial nitrosative stress on the adjacent epithelium.

We evaluated the association between complete resolution of heartburn symptoms and functioning and well‐being in three samples of patients with GERD. Methods: We analysed baseline and follow‐up assessments of heartburn symptoms and HRQL scores from three clinical trials (total n =1351) comparing omeprazole and ranitidine for acute symptomatic treatment of GERD. Heartburn symptoms were measured using patient diaries and/or patient self‐report. HRQL was assessed using the Psychological General Well‐Being Index (PGWB) in all three clinical trials and the SF‐36 Health Survey in two clinical trials. Resolution of heartburn symptoms was defined as no heartburn reported during the assessment period. Results: We observed statistically significant differences favouring patients with no heartburn symptoms on the PGWB total score ( P= 0.018 to P &lt; 0.0001) and anxiety ( P= 0.002 to P &lt; 0.0001), general health ( P= 0.05 to P &lt; 0.0001), positive well‐being ( P= 0.028 to P &lt; 0.0001) and vitality ( P= 0.05 to P &lt; 0.0001) sub‐scale scores at 4–14 weeks.

Results One hundred and eleven patients in the gabapentin group and 106 in the baclofen group completed the study. The overall success rate for cough resolution was comparable (57.3% vs 53.0%, χ 2 = 0.357, P = 0.550) between the two groups. In parallel, cough sensitivity to capsaicin and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease questionnaire score decreased after treatment with either gabapentin or baclofen.

Applying the model gave an area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve of 0·84 and 0·85 for prediction of death at 12 and 24 months respectively (both P &amp;lt; 0·001). Conclusion This model accurately estimated the probability of death within 12 and 24 months.

Central to a number of theoretical developments during this period is the assumption of additive genetic variation in resistance to parasites. However, very few studies have estimated the heritability of parasite resistance under field conditions, and those that have are mainly restricted to birds and their ectoparasites. In this paper, to our knowledge, we show for the first time in a free–ranging mammal population, Soay sheep (Ovis aries) living on the islands of St Kilda, that there is significant heritable variation in resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes. This result is consistent with earlier studies on this population which have indicated locus–specific associations with parasite resistance. We discuss our results in the context of current studies examining heritable resistance to parasites in domestic sheep and the possible mechanisms of selective maintenance of genetic variation for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes in the St Kilda Soay sheep population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1999.0776", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998609835", "source": "openalex"}

Effects of somatostatin receptor (sst) analogues are partial and of limited duration. Cell lines derived from GEP express dopaminergic receptors D(2). New chimeric analogues simultaneously recognising sst(2) and sst(5) or sst(2) and D(2) have additive effects in inhibition of GH and prolactin secretion in pituitary adenomas. Our aim was to quantify the expression of sst and D(2) mRNA in human GEP tumours.mRNA expression of sst(1), sst(2), sst(3) and sst(5) as well as D(2), was analysed using real-time PCR (TaqMan probe) in a series of 35 patients with GEP tumours (pancreas (n = 19) and intestinal (n = 16)). Levels of expression were compared with a group of 13 somatotroph adenomas.All GEP tumours express sst(1), sst(2) and D(2). Expression of sst(3) and sst(5) was observed in 89 and 76% of tumours respectively with highly variable levels. sst(2) mRNA expression was higher in nonfunctional tumours (P < 0.009) and sst5 was higher in pancreatic than in intestinal tumours (P < 0.02). Whereas sst(2) levels were similar between GEP and somatotroph tumours, levels of sst(5) and D(2) were higher in the former (394.9 +/- 156.1 x 10(-2) vs 69.7 +/- 19.5 x 10(-2) copy/copy beta-Gus (P < 0.0036) and 519.6 +/- 121.2 x 10(-2) vs 50.0 +/- 21.6 x 10(-2) copy/copy beta-Gus (P < 0.0001) respectively). In small tumours ( < 30 mm), sst(2) density appeared as a crucial parameter in somatostatin receptor scintigraphy results, whereas in big tumours, a consistent bias in SRS results was introduced by the size. In pancreatic GEP, high-level sst(3) expression was found in tumours with more active angiogenesis (higher microvessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor expression (P < 0.03)).GEP tumours co-express sst(2) and D(2) in 100% of cases and sst(5) in 89% thus supporting the testing of bi-specific agonists (sst(2)/sst(5) or sst(2)/D(2)) in these tumours.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1530/eje.1.02307", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153421801", "source": "openalex"}

Aims: To assess the relief from heartburn after 3 days of treatment with standard‐dose rabeprazole or high‐dose omeprazole (primary end‐point). Secondary end‐points included the decrease in score for other symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, healing rates and quantification of antacid use. Methods: Patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis were randomized to receive 4 weeks of double‐blind treatment with rabeprazole (20 mg) or omeprazole (40 mg). Patients who were not healed after 4 weeks received a further 4 weeks of treatment. Results: Two hundred and seventy‐four patients were screened, 251 patients were randomized and 230 patients completed the trial. The numbers of patients with relief from heartburn on day 4 were similar in the two groups (84% for rabeprazole; 95% confidence interval, 76–90%; 83% for omeprazole; 95% confidence interval, 75–89%). There were no significant differences between the treatments in the relief from other gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms or in healing rates. The number of reports of severe heartburn during the first 3 days was higher in the omeprazole group (daytime heartburn: 4.7% for rabeprazole vs. 10.3% for omeprazole, P =0.005; night‐time heartburn: 4.7% for rabeprazole vs. 9.8% for omeprazole, P =0.01; statistical comparisons defined post hoc ). Conclusions: Standard‐dose rabeprazole was as effective as high‐dose omeprazole in relieving symptoms by day 4 of treatment and in healing oesophageal lesions, but had a faster onset of action in patients with severe heartburn.

This idea is in accord with a significant step-up in serum estradiol (E2) concentration in the portal vein of rats, compared with that in the artery. Gene expression of aromatase, estrogen synthetase, was demonstrated by RT-PCR in the gastric mucosa of male and female adult rats, equivalent to that in the ovary. Aromatase activity and production of E2 in the gastric mucosa were demonstrated by (3)H(2)O assay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and they were inhibited by aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione. Conversion of (14)C-androstenedione to (14)C-E2 through (14)C-testosterone in cultured gastric mucosa was also demonstrated. Parietal cells exhibited strong signals for aromatase mRNA and immunoreactive protein by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Estrogen receptor alpha mRNA and immunoreactive protein were demonstrated in hepatocytes by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Total gastrectomy reduced portal venous E2 concentration, without changing systemic E2 concentration, together with down-regulation of estrogen receptor alpha mRNA level in the liver. These findings indicate that gastric parietal cells play a potent endocrine role in secreting estrogen that may function as a regulator of the gastro-hepatic axis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.143.8.8974", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019839375", "source": "openalex"}

This is partly due to the incomplete knowledge of the complex physical and chemical transformations that ENM undergo in the GIT, and partly to the widespread belief that GIT health effects of ENM are much less relevant than pulmonary effects. However, recent experimental findings, considering the role of new players in gut physiology (e.g. the microbiota), shed light on several outcomes of the interaction ENM/GIT. Along with this new information, there is growing direct and indirect evidence that not only ingested ENM, but also inhaled ENM may impact on the GIT. This fact, which may have relevant implications in occupational setting, has never been taken into consideration. This review paper summarizes the opinions and findings of a multidisciplinary team of experts, focusing on two main aspects of the issue: 1) ENM interactions within the GIT and their possible consequences, and 2) relevance of gastro-intestinal effects of inhaled ENMs. Under point 1, we analyzed how luminal gut-constituents, including mucus, may influence the adherence of ENM to cell surfaces in a size-dependent manner, and how intestinal permeability may be affected by different physico-chemical characteristics of ENM. Cytotoxic, oxidative, genotoxic and inflammatory effects on different GIT cells, as well as effects on microbiota, are also discussed. Concerning point 2, recent studies highlight the relevance of gastro-intestinal handling of inhaled ENM, showing significant excretion with feces of inhaled ENM and supporting the hypothesis that GIT should be considered an important target of extrapulmonary effects of inhaled ENM. In spite of recent insights on the relevance of the GIT as a target for toxic effects of nanoparticles, there is still a major gap in knowledge regarding the impact of the direct versus indirect oral exposure. This fact probably applies also to larger particles and dictates careful consideration in workers, who carry the highest risk of exposure to particulate matter.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12989-017-0226-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2770155693", "source": "openalex"}

There is controversy regarding symptom improvement after therapy. Some studies have suggested that a substantial number of patients remain symptomatic after eradication therapy. Other studies suggest that gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may develop as a result of H. pylori eradication. Aim: To determine the relationship between symptoms and H. pylori eradication and to determine whether H. pylori eradication results in symptoms or endoscopic findings of GERD. Methods: Two hundred and forty‐two patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer disease and evidence of H. pylori infection by rapid urease testing and histology were studied in four randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind trials of H. pylori eradication therapy. All patients underwent symptom assessment and endoscopy with biopsy before therapy and 1 and 6 months after completing therapy. The rapid urease test and histology were used to determine H. pylori status. Interviewers were blinded to H. pylori status after eradication and were unaware of the endoscopic findings (interviews were performed prior to repeat endoscopy). Results: The presence of epigastric pain was significantly associated with persistent H. pylori infection 1 month after therapy (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI: 1.02–5.2; P= 0.041), as was nausea (OR 7.1, 95% CI: 0.93–55.6; P= 0.029).

While pepsin was found in 33% of COPD and 26% of bronchiectasis participants, the presence of pepsin in sputum was not related to a diagnosis of GOR based on oesophageal pH monitoring in either condition. Neither a diagnosis of GOR nor the presence of pepsin was associated with increased severity of lung disease in COPD or bronchiectasis. Conclusions The prevalence of GOR in COPD or bronchiectasis is twice that of the control population, and the diagnosis could not be based on symptoms alone. Pepsin was detected in sputum in COPD and bronchiectasis, suggesting a possible role of pulmonary aspiration, which requires further exploration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12182", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1605620806", "source": "openalex"}

Diagnosing these GI diseases is quite expensive, complicated, and challenging. A computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system based on deep learning (DL) techniques could considerably lower the examination cost processes and increase the speed and quality of diagnosis. Therefore, this article proposes a CADx system called Gastro-CADx to classify several GI diseases using DL techniques. Gastro-CADx involves three progressive stages. Initially, four different CNNs are used as feature extractors to extract spatial features. Most of the related work based on DL approaches extracted spatial features only. However, in the following phase of Gastro-CADx, features extracted in the first stage are applied to the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT). DCT and DWT are used to extract temporal-frequency and spatial-frequency features. Additionally, a feature reduction procedure is performed in this stage. Finally, in the third stage of the Gastro-CADx, several combinations of features are fused in a concatenated manner to inspect the effect of feature combination on the output results of the CADx and select the best-fused feature set. Two datasets referred to as Dataset I and II are utilized to evaluate the performance of Gastro-CADx. Results indicated that Gastro-CADx has achieved an accuracy of 97.3% and 99.7% for Dataset I and II respectively. The results were compared with recent related works. The comparison showed that the proposed approach is capable of classifying GI diseases with higher accuracy compared to other work. Thus, it can be used to reduce medical complications, death-rates, in addition to the cost of treatment. It can also help gastroenterologists in producing more accurate diagnosis while lowering inspection time.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.423", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3135381462", "source": "openalex"}

Severity of reflux is much more related to complications than to the amount of reflux. Current medical reflux treatment with H2-receptor antagonists and preferably with proton pump inhibitors is efficient in controlling symptoms and healing oesophagitis. Whether early treatment of mild reflux significantly changes the incidence or severity of symptoms and complications in adulthood is uncertain.

However, recent studies have suggested that PPI s may be a potential independent risk factor for cardiovascular adverse events. The aim of our meta‐analysis was to examine the association between PPI monotherapy and cardiovascular events in patients with GERD . Methods A literature search involved examination of relevant databases up to July 2015 including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE , and ClinicalTrial.gov, as well as selected randomized controlled trials ( RCT s) reporting cardiovascular events with PPI exposure in GERD patients. In addition, the pooled risk ratio ( RR ) and heterogeneity were assessed based on a fixed effects model of the meta‐analysis and the I 2 statistic, respectively. Key Results Seventeen RCT s covering 7540 patients were selected. The pooled data suggested that the use of PPI s was associated with a 70% increased cardiovascular risk ( RR =1.70, 95% CI : [1.13–2.56], P =.01, I 2 =0%).

The aim of this study was to examine how nurses managed patients' pain and anxiety within the gastro‐surgical hospital setting. Methods. An observational design was selected to examine nurses' management of postoperative patients' pain and anxiety. Six nurses who were involved in direct patient care in one of two gastro‐surgical wards in a public teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly selected to participate. The observation period comprised a fixed 2‐hour segment, and each nurse was observed on three different occasions. Findings. Patient assessment was a major concern for participants, which was influenced by the modes of assessment used, patients' medical condition and operation procedure, and their self‐reports of pain or anxiety. Communication with health care professionals and policy and protocol concerns also affected nurses' pain and anxiety management decisions. Formal communication through the multidisciplinary ward round tended to be somewhat fragmented, as the medical consultant did not seek out the bedside nurse. Nurses had good knowledge of unit policies and protocols and, while attempting to enforce them, spent considerable time encouraging medical colleagues to abide by these guidelines. Finally, nurses made complex clinical judgements which extended beyond the administration of analgesics or antianxiety drugs. Study limitations.

A total of 1267 goats were examined [faecal examination: 938 (year 1: 470; year 2: 468); gastro-intestinal (GIT) examination: 329 (year 1: 175; year 2: 154)]. The overall prevalence of GIN infection in these animals was 54.3% (year 1: 54.8%; year 2: 53.8%; P = 0.842). The different parasites reported with their respective prevalences (%) were: Haemonchus contortus (48.3); Bunostomum trigonocephalum (30.1); Chabertia. ovina (29.8); Ostertagia circumcincta (29.8); Nematodirus spathiger (25.2); Trichostrongylus spp. (25.1); Oesophagostomum columbianum (23.5); Trichuris ovis (19.0); and Marshallagia marshalli (16.6). The mean maximum prevalence of GIN infection (faecal examination: 75.6 +/- 0.20; GIT examination: 85.3 +/- 0.95), faecal egg counts (2552 +/- 85.7) and average worm burden (333.25 +/- 2.25) were found in the summer and they were lowest in winter (prevalence: faecal examination, 23.2 +/- 0.95; GIT examination, 12.7 +/- 0.20; faecal egg counts: 134.15 +/- 9.15; and average worm burden: 79.8 +/- 52.2), with significant differences between the seasons (P < 0.05). The sex of the hosts was not an important factor influencing the prevalence of GIN infection. With the increase in host age, prevalence of infection decreased significantly (P > or = 0.05). Thus seasonal dynamics and age of the host animals significantly influenced the prevalence of GIN infection.

The experiments were designed to obtain presumptive evidence of survival and transfer of R factors by studying resistance-marker patterns of organisms isolated from the faeces. To prove conclusively that R-factor transfer had occurred and that the observed marker patterns were not fortuitous, studies of resistance-marker patterns in one of these subjects were supplemented by further detailed investigations including serological and molecular studies, which will be described in the succeeding paper. An incidental finding was a significant positive correlation between the mean number of antibiotic-resistance determinants in resistant organisms and the age of an individual, although these studies were limited to a small and highly selected group of subjects. No evidence of R-factor transfer was obtained in the absence of chemotherapy in four subjects, even though the plasmids concerned could be freely transferred in vitro from the potential donors to a wide range of faecal organisms, including the genetically marked ingested potential recipients. However, treatment of three subjects with a five-day course of a relevant antibiotic after ingestion of R factor bearing organisms led to the appearance in the faeces of large numbers of resistant coliform bacilli with antibiotic-resistance patterns consistent with transfer of the R factor either to an ingested potential recipient organism (one subject) or to endogenous strains of E. coli (two subjects). Chemotherapy greatly prolonged the persistence of ingested R factors in the faecal flora long after the antibiotics were withdrawn and caused the number of R-factor bearing organisms in the faeces to increase. No evidence was obtained in limited studies of fragmentation or loss of R factors from ingested E. coli.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1099/00222615-6-4-461", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144164155", "source": "openalex"}

Complications, except severe dehydration, are rare. Rotavirus was known to cause seizures and even GE encephalopathy, but these complications are less described in norovirus infection. The objective of this study is to compare the demographic features, clinical manifestations including the incidence of afebrile seizure, and the outcomes in children with rotavirus and norovirus infections. Methods: This is a retrospective review of children between age 1 month and 6 years admitted to the paediatric department of a regional hospital in Hong Kong with rotavirus and norovirus infections over a period of 3 years from 1 June 2006 to 31 May 2009. Their demographic data, clinical features, laboratory results and outcomes were compared and analysed. Results: Two hundred and thirty‐two children with rotavirus and 173 children with norovirus GE were admitted within the study period. Afebrile seizure commonly occurred in norovirus infection (8.67% vs. 1.29%, P &lt; 0.001). Children with rotavirus infection had higher temperature and more diarrhoea episodes, while more blood‐stained stool was noted in the norovirus group. Rotavirus‐infected patients stayed longer in hospital. All of them had full recovery without any complication. Among the 18 patients who developed afebrile convulsions, 17 of them had neuroimaging performed, which was normal. Fourteen of them had electroencephalogram (EEG) performed, demonstrating normal or non‐specific findings. None of them developed subsequent seizure attack after the GE episode. Conclusions: Norovirus is more commonly associated with benign convulsion in GE than rotavirus. We need to identify the presence of virus, in particular norovirus, in children with GE and afebrile generalised tonic–clonic seizure.

We therefore investigated whether delay in GE could impact on liquid, mixed, and gas reflux detected using combined esophageal pH‐impedance recording. Patients and methods Thirty consecutive patients were explored with GE and esophageal pH‐impedance measurement in the workup of typical symptoms of GERD . Gastric emptying was assessed using the 13 C–octanoic acid breath test and an ambulatory esophageal pH‐impedance recording was performed off proton pump inhibitors ( PPI s) for 24 h. Key Results Gastric emptying was normal in 17 patients and delayed in 13 patients. Delay in GE increased the daily number of liquid/mixed reflux events detected by combined esophageal pH‐impedance monitoring, but had no effect of esophageal acid exposure or gas reflux. This translated in increased number of postprandial reflux events, with a longer bolus clearance time and increased esophageal proximal extension. In patient with delayed GE , symptomatic reflux had a higher proximal extension and a longer bolus clearance time compared to symptomatic reflux events from patients with normal GE .

Over the years there has been a continuous interaction between the understanding of the disease, the diagnostic tools and treatments of GERD. The use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trials by primary care physicians as diagnostic tool in patients with symptoms suspected to be due to GERD has led to a shift in the type of patients referred to specialists. Currently, gastrointestinal specialists are frequently asked to evaluate patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite acid suppressive therapy. In these patients symptoms can be associated with reflux (both acid and non‐acid) or not associated with reflux. While conventional pH monitoring can quantify esophageal acid exposure and evaluate the association between symptoms and acid reflux, it cannot reliably detect reflux episodes with a pH &gt;4 (i.e. non‐acid reflux). Detecting reflux episodes by changes in intraluminal resistance to alternating current (i.e. impedance), combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII‐pH) monitoring offers the opportunity to detect both acid and non‐acid reflux episodes and to evaluate the relationship between symptoms and reflux. We believe that MII‐pH monitoring has become the new ‘‘gold standard’’ for clarifying the mechanisms of persistent symptom on PPI therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03039.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1654861366", "source": "openalex"}

Although most infants presenting with regurgitation have a normal physical examination, it is now recognized that infants may also present with a wide variety of symptoms. Oesophagitis is associated with increased oesophageal acid exposure. The determination of cause and effect is difficult, as there are many aspects of reflux disease where cause and effect relationships are cyclic. Reflux disease is present when there is an imbalance between a number of factors that can contribute to a decrease, as well as an increase, of GOR. Oesophageal pH monitoring with a semi‐disposable monocrysant antimony pH catheter with three sensors is very good at documenting oesophageal acidification and gastric buffering and, therefore, quantifies acid reflux frequency and duration. However, the interpretation of the data is complex as they are influenced by numerous factors, such as position, activity (sleep, crying), feeding (frequency and composition) or medication.

A Markov model was used to extrapolate cost and health benefit over a lifetime using data collected in the REFLUX trial and other sources. <b>Participants</b> The model compared laparoscopic surgery and continued proton pump inhibitors in male patients aged 45 and stable on GORD medication. <b>Intervention</b> Laparoscopic surgery versus continued medical management. <b>Main outcome measures</b> We estimated quality adjusted life years and GORD related costs to the health service over a lifetime. Sensitivity analyses considered other plausible scenarios, in particular size and duration of treatment effect and the GORD symptoms of patients in whom surgery is unsuccessful. <b>Main results</b> The base case model indicated that surgery is likely to be considered cost effective on average with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £2648 (€3110; US$4385) per quality adjusted life year and that the probability that surgery is cost effective is 0.94 at a threshold incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £20 000. The results were sensitive to some assumptions within the extrapolation modelling. <b>Conclusion</b> Surgery seems to be more cost effective on average than medical management in many of the scenarios examined in this study.

Aim To evaluate the effect of sodium alginate on gastro-oesophageal reflux features in preterm newborns by combined pH and impedance monitoring (pH-MII). Methods Thirty-two symptomatic preterm newborns underwent a 24 h pH-MII, during which each baby was fed eight times. Sodium alginate was given four times at alternate meals [drug-given (DG) vs. drug-free (DF) meals]. Gastro-oesophageal reflux features (i.e. number, acidity, duration and height of gastro-oesophageal reflux) after DG and DF meals were compared by Wilcoxon signed ranks test.

Previous studies have reported low health-related quality of life and high suicide rates for these patients. The occurrence of psychiatric morbidity and thus the potential need for psychological support may vary over time after diagnosis. This has not been adequately studied in patients with newly diagnosed cancer of the esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction. The present study therefore aimed to prospectively evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in 94 consecutive patients (median age 66, range 45-88 years) with all stages of disease. Psychiatric morbidity was evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire at inclusion and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months later. At inclusion, 42% of the patients had HADS scores indicating possible or probable anxiety disorder and/or depression. At all follow-ups except at 3 months, proportions of patients with possible/probable anxiety disorder were significantly lower than at inclusion. Among patients with a duration of tumor-specific symptoms exceeding 6 months pre-diagnosis, larger proportions of patients with a possible/probable anxiety disorder were found at the 1- and 6-month follow ups. The prevalence of possible/probable depression was greater among patients treated with a palliative intent than among those with a curative intent at inclusion. Patients who died during the study period scored worse for depression compared to the survivors. Apart from this, the proportion of patients with possible/probable psychiatric morbidity (anxiety and/or depression) was relatively stable over time and was unrelated to patient characteristics or clinical background, including the treatment regime. In conclusion, psychiatric morbidity is common among esophageal cancer patients, both at inclusion and over time, regardless of the cancer therapy given. The findings stress the importance of monitoring the patients' mental health and of offering adequate psychological care when needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-2050.2007.00741.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981792767", "source": "openalex"}

GERD can be currently treated by medical therapy, surgical or endoscopic transoral intervention. Medical therapy is the most common approach, though concerns have been increasingly raised in recent years about the potential side effects of continuous long-term medication, drug intolerance or unresponsiveness, and the need for high dosages for long periods to treat symptoms or prevent recurrences. Surgery too may in some cases have consequences such as long-lasting dysphagia, flatulence, inability to belch or vomit, diarrhea, or functional dyspepsia related to delayed gastric emptying. In the last few years, transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) has proved an effective and promising therapeutic option as an alternative to medical and surgical therapy. This review describes the steps of the TIF technique, using the EsophyX(®) device and the MUSE(TM) system. Complications and their management are described in detail, and the recent literature regarding the outcomes is reviewed. TIF reconfigures the tissue to obtain a full-thickness gastro-esophageal valve from inside the stomach, by serosa-to-serosa plications which include the muscle layers.

In conjunction with topical or intravenous fluorescent dyes, CLE allows for an “optical biopsy” for real-time diagnosis. Two different CLE system have been used in clinical endoscopy, probe-based CLE (pCLE) and endoscope-based CLE (eCLE). Using pCLE, the device can be delivered: (I) into the luminal gastrointestinal tract through the working channel of standard endoscopes; (II) into extraluminal cystic and solid parenchymal lesions through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) needle; or (III) into the biliary system through an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) accessory channel. With eCLE, the probe is directly integrated into the tip of a conventional endoscope, however, these endoscopes are no longer commercially available. CLE has moderate to high diagnostic accuracy for neoplastic and inflammatory conditions through the gastrointestinal tract including: oesophageal, gastric and colonic neoplasia, pancreatic cysts and solid lesions, malignant pancreatobiliary strictures and inflammatory bowel disease. Some studies have demonstrated the diagnostic benefit of CLE imaging when combined with either conventional white light endoscopy or advanced imaging technologies. Therefore, optical biopsies using CLE can resolve diagnostic dilemmas in some cases where conventional imaging fails to achieve conclusive results. CLE could also reduce the requirement for extensive tissue sampling during surveillance procedures. In the future, CLE in combination with molecular probes, could allow for the molecular characterization of diseases and assess response to targeted therapy. However, the narrow field of view, high capital costs and specialized operator training requirements remain the main limitations. Future multi-center, randomized trials with a focus on conventional diagnostic applications, cost-effectiveness and standardized training will be required for definitive evidence. The objective of this review is to evaluate the technical aspects and current applications of CLE in patients with gastrointestinal and pancreatobiliary diseases and discuss future directions for this technique.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21037/tgh.2020.04.02", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3021896252", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma CgA levels were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 61 patients with sporadic GEP NET and in 25 with MEN 1 including 16 with GEP NET. Controls were 50 healthy volunteers, 46 patients with pituitary adenoma and 35 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. RESULTS: The cutoff value for CgA established in our healthy subjects (as mean+2 s.d.) was 20 U/l. CgA levels were above the normal range in 71/77 patients with sporadic or MEN 1-related GEP NETs (92%), in four out of nine MEN 1 patients without GEP NETs (44%), and only in 22/81 control patients with pituitary or parathyroid disease (27%).

CONCLUSIONS: Plasma CgA was confirmed to be a reliable marker for GEP NETs.

The REFLUX trial", "text": "To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of a policy of relatively early laparoscopic surgery compared with continued medical management amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) judged suitable for both policies.Relative clinical effectiveness was assessed by a randomised trial (with parallel non-randomised preference groups) comparing a laparoscopic surgery-based policy with a continued medical management policy. The economic evaluation compared the cost-effectiveness of the two management policies in order to identify the most efficient provision of future care and describe the resource impact that various policies for fundoplication would have on the NHS.A total of 21 hospitals throughout the UK with a local partnership between surgeon(s) and gastroenterologist(s) who shared the secondary care of patients with GORD.The 810 participants, who were identified retrospectively or prospectively via their participating clinicians, had both documented evidence of GORD (endoscopy and/or manometry/24-hour pH monitoring) and symptoms for longer than 12 months. In addition, the recruiting clinician(s) was clinically uncertain about which management policy was best.Of the 810 eligible patients who consented to participate, 357 were recruited to the randomised arm of the trial (178 allocated to surgical management, 179 allocated to continued, but optimised, medical management) and 453 recruited to the parallel non-randomised preference arm (261 chose surgical management, 192 chose to continue with best medical management). The type of fundoplication was left to the discretion of the surgeon.Participants completed a baseline REFLUX questionnaire, developed specifically for this study, containing a disease-specific outcome measure, the Short Form with 36 Items (SF-36), the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the Beliefs about Medicines and Surgery questionnaires (BMQ/BSQ). Postal questionnaires were completed at participant-specific time intervals after joining the trial (equivalent to approximately 3 and 12 months after surgery). Intraoperative data were recorded by the surgeons and all other in-hospital data were collected by the research nurse. At the end of the study period, participants completed a discrete choice experiment questionnaire.The randomised groups were well balanced at entry. Participants had been taking GORD medication for a median of 32 months; the mean age of participants was 46 years and 66% were men. Of 178 randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) actually had fundoplication. There was a mixture of clinical and personal reasons why some patients did not have surgery, sometimes related to long waiting times. A total or partial wrap procedure was performed depending on surgeon preference. Complications were uncommon and there were no deaths associated with surgery. By the equivalent of 12 months after surgery, 38% in the randomised surgical group (14% amongst those who had surgery) were taking reflux medication compared with 90% in the randomised medical group. There were substantial differences (one-third to one-half standard deviation) favouring the randomised surgical group across the health status measures, the size depending on assumptions about the proportion that actually had fundoplication. These differences were the same or somewhat smaller than differences observed at 3 months. The lower the REFLUX score, the worse the symptoms at trial entry and the larger the benefit observed after surgery. The preference surgical group had the lowest REFLUX scores at baseline. These scores improved substantially after surgery, and by 12 months they were better than those in the preference medical group. The BMQ/BSQ and discrete choice experiment did distinguish the preference groups from each other and from the randomised groups. The latter indicated that the risk of serious complications was the most important single attribute of a treatment option. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the surgery policy was more costly (mean 2049 pounds) but also more effective [+0.088 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)]. The estimated incremental cost per QALY was 19,000-23,000 pounds, with a probability between 46% (when 62% received surgery) and 19% (when all received surgery) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. Modelling plausible longer-term scenarios (such as lifetime benefit after surgery) indicated a greater likelihood (74%) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pounds, but applying a range of alternative scenarios indicated wide uncertainty. The expected value of perfect information was greatest for longer-term quality of life and proportions of surgical patients requiring medication.Amongst patients requiring long-term medication to control symptoms of GORD, surgical management significantly increases general and reflux-specific health-related quality of life measures, at least up to 12 months after surgery. Complications of surgery were rare. A surgical policy is, however, more costly than continued medical management. At a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY it may well be cost-effective, especially when putative longer-term benefits are taken into account, but this is uncertain. The more troublesome the symptoms, the greater the potential benefit from surgery. Uncertainty about cost-effectiveness would be greatly reduced by more reliable information about relative longer-term costs and benefits of surgical and medical policies. This could be through extended follow-up of the REFLUX trial cohorts or of other cohorts of fundoplication patients.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15517081.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3310/hta12310", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022076560", "source": "openalex"}

However, little is known about the effect of omeprazole on duodenogastric reflux (DGR) and duodenogastro-oesophageal reflux (DGOR). Aims —To study the effect of omeprazole 20 mg twice daily on DGR and DGOR, using the technique of ambulatory bilirubin monitoring. Methods —Twenty three patients with Barrett’s oesophagus underwent manometry followed by 24 hour oesophageal and gastric pH monitoring. In conjunction with pH monitoring, 11 patients (group 1) underwent oesophageal bilirubin monitoring and 12 patients (group 2) underwent gastric bilirubin monitoring, both before and during treatment with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Results —In both groups there was a significant reduction in oesophageal acid (pH&lt;4) reflux (p&lt;0.005) and a significant increase in the time gastric pH was above 4 (p&lt;0.005). In group 1, median total oesophageal bilirubin exposure was significantly reduced from 28.9% to 2.4% (p&lt;0.005). In group 2, median total gastric bilirubin exposure was significantly reduced from 24.9% to 7.2% (p&lt;0.005).

Fasting gastric secretion, basal secretion, and maximal acid secretion after subcutaneous injection of 6 μg pentagastrin/kg bodyweight were determined additionally in some of the subjects. There was a significant inverse correlation between the results of continuous pH-recording and basal gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure, which confirms the relationship between low sphincter pressure and gastro-oesophageal acid reflux. Furthermore, there was a significant direct correlation between the results of continuous pH-recording and the volume of basal secretion and the basal acid output. These findings emphasize the significance of gastric acid secretion for the results of continuous pH-recording. As reflux-preventive surgery may elicit alterations in the variables of acid secretion, the results of continuous pH-recording do not allow conclusions to be drawn with regard to the effectiveness of a surgically established gastro-oesophageal barrier.Key-words: Gastric acidgastric regurgitationgastro-oesophageal refluxgastro-oesophageal sphincter pressuremanometrypentagastrinpH-measurements", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365527709181333", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119630474", "source": "openalex"}

Some concerns have been raised regarding the risk of de novo GORD or exacerbation of pre-existing GORD after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Here, 24-h pH monitoring was used to assess the influence of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on postoperative GORD in obese patients with or without preoperative GORD. Methods From July 2012 to September 2014, all patients scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were invited to participate in a prospective follow-up. Patients who underwent preoperative 24-h pH monitoring were asked to repeat the examination 6 months after operation. GORD was defined as an oesophageal pH &amp;lt; 4 for at least 4·2 per cent of the total time recorded. Results Of 89 patients, 76 had preoperative pH monitoring for GORD evaluation and 50 had postoperative reassessment. Patients without (group 1, 29 patients) or with (group 2, 21 patients) preoperative GORD were similar regarding age, sex ratio and body mass index. In group 1, the median (i.q.r.) total time at pH &amp;lt; 4 was significantly higher after surgery than before: 5·6 (2·5–9·5) versus 1·6 (0·7–2·9) per cent (P &amp;lt; 0·001). Twenty of the 29 patients experienced de novo GORD as determined by 24-h pH monitoring (P &amp;lt; 0·001).

Aim To assess the predictive value of MNBI on symptomatic outcomes after anti‐reflux therapy. Methods In this prospective observational cohort study, pH ‐impedance studies performed over a 5‐year period were reviewed. Baseline impedance was extracted from six channels at three stable nocturnal 10‐min time periods, and averaged to yield MNBI . Distal and proximal oesophageal MNBI values were calculated by averaging MNBI values at 3, 5, 7 and 9 cm, and 15 and 17 cm respectively. Symptomatic outcomes were measured as changes in global symptom severity ( GSS , rated on 100‐mm visual analogue scales) on prospective follow‐up after medical or surgical anti‐reflux therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed the predictive value of MNBI on symptomatic outcomes. Results Of 266 patients, 135 (50.8%) were tested off proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy and formed the study cohort (52.1 ± 1.1 years, 63.7% F). The 59 with elevated acid exposure time ( AET ) had lower composite and distal MNBI values than those with physiological AET ( P &lt; 0.0001), but similar proximal MNBI ( P = 0.62). Linear AET negatively correlated with distal MNBI , both individually and collectively (Pearson's r = −0.5, P &lt; 0.001), but not proximal MNBI (Pearson's r = 0, P = 0.72).

A prospective study was undertaken to determine the prognostic importance of lymph node involvement in adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction, analysing both a number- and site-based classification, in order to develop a clinically useful nodal staging system. Methods Two classification systems were analysed in 116 patients who underwent resection for adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction from January 1988 to August 2001. The Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of the site and number of positive nodes. Results The number- and site-based staging systems coincided only in 42 (56 per cent) of 75 patients; in particular, the old pN1 classification was upstaged in 13 of 41 patients and the old pN2 was downstaged in 13 of 34 patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess its continued relevance by evaluating whether there were differences in the biology and clinical characteristics of adenocarcinomas by Siewert type, in a contemporary cohort of patients, in whom the majority had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods A prospective database was reviewed for all patients who underwent resection from 2005 to 2011 and analysed with regard to Siewert classification determined from the pathological specimen, treatment and clincopathological outcomes. Results Two hundred and sixteen patients underwent oesophagogastric resection: 133 for type I, 51 for type II and 33 for type III tumours. 135 Patients (62.5%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with no difference between groups. There were no significant differences in age, sex, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage, ASA, or inpatient complications between patients with adenocarcinoma based on their Siewert classification. There was a significant increase in maximum tumour diameter ( P = 0.023), perineural invasion ( P = 0.021) and vascular invasion ( P = 0.020), associated with more distal tumours (Type III &gt; Type II &gt; Type I). Median overall survival was significantly shorter for more distal tumours (Type I: 4.96 years vs. Type II: 3.3 years vs. Type III: 2.64 years; P = 0.04). The surgical approach did not influence survival. Conclusion In the era of multi‐modal treatment pathological Siewert tumour type is of prognostic value, as patients with Type III disease are likely to have larger and more aggressive tumours that lead to worse outcomes.

In tissues where both modes of assessment were used, PC10 staining in the well-established proliferative compartments was found to be more extensive than that of BrdUrd.

Objective evaluation of benefit was obtained by endoscopy and biopsy, oesophageal manometry, acid reflux provocation test and 24‐h oesophageal pH monitoring. Cisapride significantly increased lower oesophageal sphincter pressure ( P = 0.003) against baseline and also against placebo, in patients ( n = 9) with an hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter pressure ( P &lt; 0.01). The frequency of dyspeptic symptoms was significantly improved in the cisapride group ( P = 0.03). Antacid intake, global evaluation of symptoms and a VAS score for symptoms were all better than placebo but failed to reach significance (global evaluation by patients, P = 0.07).

As a result of the current treatment paradigms for advanced laryngopharyngeal cancers, it is common that the surgical field has been previously irradiated or exposed to systemic chemotherapy, resulting in fistula rates as high as 78% and mortality as high as 8%. The free vascularized tubed gastric antrum and the accompanying greater omentum offer a single-staged method of pharyngoesophageal reconstruction, with the added benefit of protection of the great vessels, the tracheal stump, and the mediastinal contents in a high-risk surgical field.To assess the gastro-omental free flap as a method of pharyngoesophageal reconstruction in patients who have been previously treated with multimodality therapy.Five consecutive cases of gastro-omental free flap reconstruction after total laryngopharyngectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Each case was assessed for intraoperative, perioperative, and postoperative complications at the primary site of reconstruction and the donor site. Patients were also evaluated for their ability to maintain an oral diet. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months after surgery.Five patients aged 44 to 70 years (mean, 59 years) underwent gastro-omental free flap reconstruction after total laryngopharyngectomy. Five patients had received previous external beam irradiation, 2 had received systemic chemotherapy, and 4 had undergone previous surgery. There were no fistulae or flap complications.

Post‐prandial distress syndrome has been linked to impaired gastric fundic accommodation which may induce increased transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and consequent GERD. Duodenal eosinophilia has been linked to functional dyspepsia and post‐prandial distress syndrome. Aim To identify if there is an association between duodenal eosinophilia in functional dyspepsia and symptoms of GERD and whether post‐prandial distress syndrome or epigastric pain syndrome are associated with new onset GERD. Methods Participants (n = 1000) were randomly selected from the national Swedish population register and surveyed by questionnaires and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in 1999‐2001. All eligible subjects (n = 887) were invited to a follow‐up study in 2010 (response rate 79%). In a case‐control study of 213 subjects (functional dyspepsia vs healthy controls), histology from the duodenum was evaluated at baseline and the possible association of eosinophilia to new onset GERD symptoms was analysed. Results Functional dyspepsia (OR 7.6; 95% CI 2.93‐19.4, P &lt; 0.001) and post‐prandial distress syndrome at baseline (OR 9.0, 95% CI 3.36‐24.0, P &lt; 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of GERD at follow‐up. Eosinophilia in the second part of duodenum only was independently associated with an increased risk of GERD amongst those with functional dyspepsia (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.2‐4.77, P = 0.024) and post‐prandial distress syndrome at baseline (OR 6.0; 95% CI 1.50‐23.6, P = 0.011), respectively. Conclusions Duodenal eosinophilia is associated with increased risk of GERD at 10‐year follow‐up in those with functional dyspepsia and post‐prandial distress syndrome at baseline. Duodenal eosinophilia may explain the link between GERD and functional dyspepsia, suggesting subsets of functional dyspepsia and GERD may be part of the same disease spectrum.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15308", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2945829369", "source": "openalex"}

This is illustrated for the case of gastro-intestinal parasitism in lambs. A model of the parasite infection was developed to include between-animal variation (genetic, permanent and temporary environmental) for live-weight gain, food intake, larval establishment rate in the host, worm fecundity and worm mortality rate. Achieved live-weight gain was defined as the sum of potential live-weight gain under conditions of no parasite infection, a trait correlated with food intake and growth-rate reduction due to the infection. The reduction in growth-rate was calculated from cumulative larval challenge and cumulative worm mass in the lamb. Genetic parameters were then estimated for the output traits of observed live weight at 6 months of age, growth rate reduction and faecal egg count. Model parameters were chosen so that the output means and heritabilities for faecal egg count and live-weight gain mimicked field data for Scottish Blackface lambs and growth-rate reductions were proportionately 0·25 , on average. The model predicted a weak phenotypic correlation (mean = -0·10) between observed live weight and faecal egg count, the indicator of resistance but a stronger favourable (negative) genetic correlation between these traits (mean = -0·27). The severity, or epidemiology, of the disease greatly influenced the results - the genetic correlation between observed live weight and faecal egg count strengthened from -0·02 to -0·46 as the disease severity changed from mild to severe. Selection for reduced faecal egg count resulted in large correlated increases in live-weight gain, more than twice that predicted by quantitative genetic theory, due to the reductions in growth rate losses as the disease challenge to the animals decreased. Conversely, selection for increased live-weight gain resulted in reductions in faecal egg count close to expectations. This asymmetry of selection response emphasizes the epidemiological benefits obtainable from selection for resistance to infectious chronic diseases - such selection will result in improvements in both animal health and productivity not seen when selection is for improved productivity, alone. Breeding goals should be designed to take account of such effects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1357729800051365", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1580648268", "source": "openalex"}

Although gastro‐intestinal abnormalities are not as common as cardiomyopathy in such infection, they can still lead to an impaired quality of life. In a recent study based in Madrid, the frequencies of gastro‐intestinal involvement in a cohort of Latin American immigrants infected with T. cruzi, and the role of early diagnostic techniques in the detection of such involvement, were explored. Between January 2003 and April 2009, all Latin Americans who attended the Tropical Medicine Unit of the Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal were tested for T. cruzi infection, in IFAT and ELISA. Each subject found both IFAT‐ and ELISA‐positive was considered to be infected (chronically) and checked for symptoms indicative of Chagas disease. Each infected subject giving informed consent was investigated further, using an electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram and oesophageal manometry. Between January 2003 and June 2008, every infected subject who consented was also explored using a barium swallow and barium enema. After July 2008, however, only subjects showing oesophageal and/or colonic symptoms were investigated in this manner.Of the 248 patients found infected with T. cruzi, 118 underwent oesophageal manometry, 75 a barium enema and 48 a barium swallow. Thirteen (11%) showed evidence of oesophageal involvement (incomplete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter; three cases) or bowel involvement (five cases of dolichosigma, three of dolichocolon and two of megacolon). Only six of these 13 had any gastro‐intestinal symptoms (all six were suffering from constipation). None of the barium swallows revealed any pathology. It appears that oesophageal manometry can reveal mild abnormalities not detected by barium swallow, even in asymptomatic patients, while barium enemas are useful in the detection of colonic involvement.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1179/136485910x12851868780423", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011566830", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2044751320", "title": "Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in adults: Guidelines for clinicians", "text": "Reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus is a normal physiological event. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) occurs when reflux exposes the patient to the risk of physical complications or when symptoms lead to a significant impairment of well-being or quality of life. Clinically significant impairment of well-being (quality of life) often occurs when symptoms occur on two or more days a week. Reflux disease carries the risk of reflux (peptic) oesophagitis and complications such as columnar-lined (Barrett’s) oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the risk of cancer to an individual with reflux is small. Most patients do not have endoscopically visible lesions. Only about one-third of patients with reflux disease have reflux oesophagitis as evidenced by endoscopically visible mucosal breaks (erosions or ulceration) or columnar-lined (Barrett’s) oesophagus. Reflux disease is common. Between 15 and 20% of adults experience heartburn at least once a week. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), alcohol consumption (>7 standard drinks a week) and a first-degree relative with heartburn increase the risk of having reflux symptoms. Patients with connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma and chronic respiratory disease such as asthma and cystic fibrosis, institutionalized and intellectually handicapped patients and patients nursed in a supine position for prolonged periods are at increased risk of reflux disease. Reflux disease is the most common cause of heartburn and indigestion in Western society. In most patients, reflux disease is a chronic disorder. Mild symptoms may vary in intensity and occur only on some days. With increasing severity, symptoms tend to occur daily. Most patients will therefore require long-term management. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is usually associated with excessive exposure of the oesophagus to gastric contents. The most damaging components are acid and pepsin although bile and pancreatic enzymes may contribute in some patients. The excessive exposure to gastric contents is largely the result of an increased frequency of reflux episodes, but impaired clearance of stomach contents from the oesophagus is also an important factor. Under normal conditions, reflux is prevented by the tonic activity of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), supported by the crural diaphragm. Reflux episodes occur primarily because of defective LOS function. The major event that leads to reflux is transient LOS relaxation. An important minority of reflux episodes occurs because of defective basal LOS pressure. A number of factors may aggravate reflux, although these are not present in many patients. These include dietary components such as fat, chocolate, caffeine and alcohol, as well as possibly smoking and some drugs. Hiatal hernia is common in reflux disease. Hiatal hernia increases the likelihood that reflux will occur by impairing LOS function. However, the presence of a hiatal hernia does not necessarily mean that reflux disease is present. Symptoms may be broadly grouped into: Those directly related to reflux episodes; Those caused by complications of reflux disease. This is the hallmark symptom of reflux disease. It is characterized by a burning feeling rising up from the stomach or lower chest towards the neck. It is typically provoked by meals, particularly those containing fatty or highly spiced food, or by bending, straining or lying down. It is usually eased or relieved by antacids. This is the other characteristic symptom of reflux disease. Regurgitated material is usually tasted and re-swallowed but is sometimes so voluminous that it may be mistaken for ‘vomiting’. Some patients may experience regurgitation as their predominant symptom. Oesophageal acidification may cause such sudden and brisk stimulation of salivation that the patient's mouth fills with saliva. Reflux may cause a number of other symptoms not easily identified as being caused by reflux. These include angina-like chest pain, excessive belching, dyspepsia and non-specific queasiness, unease or nausea. Reflux has been incriminated as a cause of respiratory and laryngeal diseases such as asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis and sinusitis. Cough, wheeze, hoarseness or sore throat may occur and are occasionally the presenting symptom. It is uncertain how important reflux is in causing these non-specific symptoms, but this applies probably only in a minority. Dysphagia is common, but is usually variable and caused by either defective oesophageal peristalsis or heightened oesophageal sensitivity. Dysphagia that is associated with symptoms of bolus impaction is highly suggestive of a stricture. This may be a prominent symptom caused by excessive sensitivity of the oesophageal mucosa. It is usually associated with severe oesophagitis. Hematemesis may be a presenting symptom but is rarely severe. Occasionally, iron deficiency may result. The diagnosis of reflux disease is primarily symptom-based. In most patients, reflux disease has a characteristic symptom pattern. Heartburn is the cardinal symptom. However, this term is poorly understood by many patients and it is important to give a descriptive definition such as ‘a burning feeling rising up from the stomach or lower chest towards the neck’. This approach has been found to identify more patients with reflux disease than the use of the term ‘heartburn’ itself. There is substantial overlap between the symptoms of reflux disease and those of ulcer disease, non-ulcer dyspepsia, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Approximately two-thirds of patients will also complain of dyspepsia (upper abdominal pain or discomfort) and approximately 40% of patients with IBS also complain of reflux symptoms. Symptom severity is not a reliable guide to the severity of oesophagitis. Nevertheless, the presence of dysphagia, odynophagia, nocturnal choking, hematemesis or weight loss should alert the clinician to possible severe or complicated reflux disease, or another diagnosis. The history is the single most useful method for the diagnosis of reflux disease. A symptom-based diagnosis can be supplemented by the use of a therapeutic trial of double-dose proton pump inhibitor for 2 weeks. This test has a sensitivity and specificity for reflux disease that is comparable to that of oesophageal pH monitoring and substantially superior to endoscopy. A diagnosis based on symptoms can be aided by a trial of treatment. It is inappropriate to investigate every patient with suspected reflux symptoms. Patients who have mild, typical reflux symptoms and no alarm symptoms should be given a trial of therapy without investigation. Investigations should be performed when: The diagnosis is unclear because symptoms are either non-specific or atypical for reflux disease or are ‘mixed’ with gastroduodenal symptoms such as epigastric pain also being present; Symptoms persist or even progress on therapy; Symptoms suggest severe or complicated oesopha-gitis is present, for example hematemesis, persistent dysphagia; Other diagnoses seem possible, for example: infective or drug-induced oesophagitis oesophageal malignancy gastroduodenal disorders myocardial infarction or ischaemia. Investigations are warranted if the diagnosis is unclear, symptoms persist or are refractory to treatment, complications are suspected or there are alarm symptoms present. This is the investigation of first choice, as it: Is the most sensitive test for reflux oesophagitis; Gives the most accurate diagnosis of other mucosal lesions such as infective oesophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, malignancy, or other upper gut abnormalities which may be difficult to distinguish on history from reflux disease; Is the only effective way to grade oesophagitis, which is important to the choice of therapy and management of reflux disease (see below); Is the only sensitive method for diagnosing columnar-lined or Barrett's oesophagus; Is useful for recognition and management of peptic stricture. More than half of patients with GORD are ‘endoscopy’ negative, that is, they have no diagnostic oesophageal mucosal abnormalities. However, endoscopy has a limited role in the diagnosis of reflux disease, as fewer than half the patients with reflux symptoms have diagnostic endoscopic abnormalities. In these ‘endoscopy negative’ patients, distal oesophageal biopsies (which may demonstrate microscopic changes of oesophagitis in approximately 25%) are not recommended as routine practice, as this is a relatively expensive test that does not influence choice of therapy, which should be directed at symptom control. Potential roles for endoscopy are outlined in Table 1. In patients with alarm symptoms, endoscopy should be performed promptly, prior to any empiric therapy. Early endoscopy is also indicated in patients with atypical symptoms or when symptoms fail to respond to initial therapy. Endoscopic re-assessment should be performed within 6 months of planned anti-reflux surgery to exclude any new or unexpected pathology. The role of endoscopy in patients with longstanding ‘medically controlled’ GORD is less clear. Evidence suggests that symptomatic control equates to endoscopic healing (even in severe Los Angeles (LA) classification grade C or D oesophagitis), so endoscopic assessment is theoretically only necessary if there is a relapse while on maximal or near maximal medical therapy. Alternatively, a ‘once in a life-time’ endoscopy in this subset of patients may be reasonable to assist discussions about long-term management and to exclude the potential complications of severe oesophagitis. There is, however, no convincing evidence that screening all patients with reflux for Barrett's oesophagus would be of benefit. Endoscopic surveillance in known Barrett's oesophagus is discussed in Section 4. This is an inappropriate primary diagnostic test as it is insensitive and non-specific for reflux disease. It may be useful, however, to assess and plan management in patients with persistent dysphagia when a complicating stricture is suspected or for the assessment of large hiatal herniae. This investigation tests whether symptoms are related to the occurrence of reflux and is useful in patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear after a therapeutic trial and endoscopy. Measurement of the amount of reflux that occurs is of lesser diagnostic value. The objectives of treating reflux are to: Relieve symptoms and restore quality of life; Heal oesophagitis if present; Reduce the risk of complications. Time-honoured lifestyle changes have not been evaluated adequately in clinical trials. However, some lifestyle modifications are reasonable. In patients with mild and occasional reflux symptoms, these changes and ‘on demand’ use of antacids or over-the-counter H2-receptor antagonists (RA) may be all that is required. In patients with significant reflux disease, these measures are adjunctive to appropriate drug therapy as available evidence suggests they are of relatively low efficacy for symptom relief and ineffective for healing oesophagitis. Lifestyle measures that may enhance oesophageal acid clearance or minimize the frequency of reflux episodes and include: Patients often identify for themselves particular foods that provoke reflux symptoms and these are sensibly avoided. Unnecessarily strict dietary advice, however, usually leads to non-compliance. Common dietary components associated with reflux include fatty and spicy foods. Some drinks may also exacerbate symptoms, including cola, excess coffee, tomato and orange juice. Other measures that may help include: Avoidance of late, large meals; Refraining from assuming a supine position shortly after meals; Avoidance of tight-fitting garments, particularly after meals. This may be beneficial for patients with marked nocturnal or laryngeal symptoms, but is not generally useful otherwise and can be unnecessarily inconvenient. A wedge pillow is preferred so as to cause less disturbance to partners. Excessive alcohol intake may aggravate symptoms and should be reduced. Low-pH beverages such as red wine may exacerbate symptoms. Alcohol in moderation is reasonable in most cases. A number of drugs may exacerbate reflux. These include drugs with anticholinergic effects, theophylline, dopaminergic drugs and calcium-channel blockers. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen oesophagitis. Obesity is a risk factor for reflux, although improvement in symptoms following weight loss is variable. Nevertheless, because of a possible benefit and the risks of obesity to many aspects of health, weight loss in obese patients should be encouraged. However, treatment should not focus solely on this. Smoking aggravates reflux and increases the risk of oesophageal and other cancers. Smoking cessation forms part of the overall health care plan. Patient-directed ‘on demand’ use of antacids, antacid/alginate combinations or ‘over the counter’ H2-RA may be helpful for the relief of mild and occasional reflux symptoms. Patients who require regular self-medication should be reassessed for more effective treatment. Strict regular antacid use in patients with significant reflux is ineffective and inappropriate, and antacids have not been shown to heal oesophagitis. This has four major aims, given in order of importance. Because in the majority of patients, whether they have had endoscopy or not, the diagnosis will be based primarily on symptom patterning. Because symptoms are the major source of morbidity. Because a significant proportion fear malignancy. Because oesophagitis can cause stricture, bleeding and Barrett's oesophagus. Healing can overlap into the long-term management phase. There is an evolving switch of strategy for the initial treatment of reflux disease from the more traditional step-up approach to high level (more potent) initial therapy, on the grounds of outcomes, speed of response and total cost, in the majority of patients (Table 2). Because of the attributes of initial proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, this has become the initial treatment of choice where there is ready access to these agents, as is now the case in Australia. The traditional 4-week course of PPI treatment is currently appropriate; 2 weeks may be sufficient, but this requires research. The high-level initial therapy approach is not considered appropriate for individuals whose reflux-induced symptoms are not severe enough to meet the definition of reflux disease. This has three major aims, given in order of importance, which recognize the usual chronicity of reflux disease. Because symptoms are most important to patients and the only long-term issue in the majority. Because in a minority subset, reflux disease carries the risk of complications, and all therapies carry some degree of risk. Because over-treatment will generate significant unnecessary costs over time. Individual patients vary widely in the therapy they need for satisfactory long-term management of reflux disease. This can be readily determined by titration of the intensity of therapy according to symptom control, without recourse to endoscopy. A significant minority of patients do not experience a clinically significant relapse of symptoms after withdrawal of effective initial therapy: accordingly, a trial of withdrawal of therapy is appropriate. Patients known to have severe oesophagitis (LA grades C and D) should not have therapy withdrawn, as they all relapse and require daily proton pump in-hibitor therapy. The majority of patients will have symptom relapse; a repeat course of the previously successful therapy should then be given. Following a satisfactory response, intermittent, symptom-driven (‘on demand’) therapy should be tried with either an H2-RA or a PPI. A single standard dose should be taken once on days when symptoms are troublesome. This approach succeeds in a substantial minority of primary care patients; there may be added benefit from use of antacids in the same way. Those patients who are satisfied with symptom-driven therapy use PPI on average every 2–3 days, thus saving substantially on drug costs. Symptom-driven therapy will, by its nature, become daily if intermittent therapy is ineffective. As daily proton pump inhibitors are clearly superior to daily H2-RA, they should be used when H2-RA fail. Doubling of H2-RA dose provides no clear gain of efficacy and so is not appropriate. Cisapride is contra-indicated for routine therapy because of the risk of cardiotoxicity. Existing prokinetic agents are of low efficacy compared to proton pump inhibitors. Formal testing of the strategies outlined is needed, as currently available studies address only parts of this recommended decision pathway. The place of endoscopy in long-term management is controversial, but patients who require daily proton pump inhibitor therapy have most to gain from a risk-management endoscopy, during continued therapy. Failure of response to daily standard-dose PPI therapy can be the result of: Inadequate effect from the proton pump inhibitor on intragastric pH; Misdiagnosis or major complications of oesophagitis. Doubling of the dose may be effective, but specialist referral is advised. There are three principal indications for anti-reflux surgery in GORD: Failure to respond satisfactorily to adequate doses of medical therapy; Intolerable side-effects or failure of compliance; A desire to be free of long-term medication for GORD. Anti-reflux surgery, which usually comprises some form of fundoplication with or without repair of a hiatal hernia, may be undertaken by either an open technique or by laparoscopy. Laparoscopic fundoplication, which has been generally employed for 10 years, has the advantages of reduced postoperative pain, a shorter hospital stay, and a more rapid return to work than open fundoplication. There is a mortality rate of 0.2% and morbidity rates are lower than open fundoplication. The results of laparoscopic fundoplication are closely related to the experience of the operating surgeon, both in reflux control and in the prevalence of postoperative sequelae. Patients should be made aware of potential postoperative sequelae that include increased flatulence, dysphagia for some solids such as meat and bread, and early satiety. Generally, long-term (10 years) control of reflux is seen in 88–93% of patients, and both gastro-intestinal and psychological well-being are improved by anti-reflux surgery in those who have been on medical therapy without adequate symptom control. However, a proportion of patients will at some stage require antisecretory medication once more. Patients selected for anti-reflux surgery should have proven reflux by either the presence of oesophagitis on endoscopy (at some time during the course of their disease) or by 24-h pH monitoring. Barium swallow radiography is insensitive in diagnosing GORD. Esophageal manometry or other esophageal transit study is indicated to rule out a primary motor disorder (e.g. achalasia, scleroderma) when suspected, and to rule out aperistalsis, which may result in postoperative dysphagia after some forms of fundoplication. All patients should have undergone endoscopy within 6 months of planned anti-reflux surgery, to rule out new or unexpected pathology. A gastroenterologist or surgeon with a committed interest in reflux disease should have a detailed discussion with any patient being considered for surgery, regarding the merits of anti-reflux surgery and the potential for short- and long-term side-effects after surgery. A number of endoscopic antireflux techniques are under evaluation currently. These include endoscopic stitching, plication or injection of polymer around the lower esophageal sphincter. At present, these are all experimental and should not be offered outside the context of a clinical trial. One consequence of gastro-esophageal reflux is transformation of the stratified squamous epithelium of the distal oesophagus into columnar type epithelium with specialized intestinal metaplasia. This is most commonly called a Barrett's oesophagus and is found in up to 10% of patients with longstanding reflux disease who present for endoscopy. If there is only gastric, or more rarely, pancreatic type epithelium found in the oesophagus, there is no increased cancer risk. However, if intestinal metaplasia is present (whatever the length), then there is an increased risk of adenocarcinoma. The majority of people with a Barrett's oesophagus remain undiagnosed and unaware of the condition. Once Barrett's oesophagus has developed, there is no convincing evidence that acid control by either medical or surgical means reverses progression to dysplasia, which can be a precursor of adenocarcinoma. There is no convincing evidence that screening all patients with reflux for Barrett's oesophagus disease by endoscopy would be of benefit. If a patient is endoscoped for clinical reasons for reflux disease, and is found incidentally to have a Barrett's oesophagus, multiple biopsies should be routinely obtained in four quadrants at 2 cm intervals along the Barrett's mucosa to rule out coexistent dysplasia or cancer. The highest chance of detecting a malignancy is at initial diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus. In the presence of Barrett's mucosa with oesophagitis (mucosal breaks), epithelial atypia or dysplasia may be misdiagnosed. In this clinical setting, the examination needs to be repeated within 3 months on treatment. There are no reliable serological or endoscopic markers of dysplasia: this requires histological examination for diagnosis. A surveillance strategy aims to identify patients who have developed high-grade dysplasia or early adenocarcinoma so that appropriate intervention can be provided to improve survival. Biennial endoscopic surveillance with biopsies (in each quadrant of the oesophagus at 2 cm intervals) along the length of the Barrett's mucosa is currently recommended. However, it appears the risk of progression to cancer has been over-estimated in the literature, and the annual incidence of progression is probably only 0.5% per year. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance at 4-yearly intervals is likely to be sufficient. As it has not been established that screening reduces mortality from Barrett's oesophagus, screening should be considered only in patients who would be medically fit for an oesophagectomy if required. Screening of short-segment Barrett's (< 3 cm in length) is controversial, as the cancer risk is probably low; currently screening is not recommended. If low-grade dysplasia is found, it is recommended that repeat endoscopy and biopsy be performed within 6 months, with the patient on a full-dose PPI, to determine if high-grade dysplasia has been missed. If low-grade dysplasia persists, re-surveillance at 6 months, then annually, is recommended. If high-grade dysplasia is found, it is essential to have the pathology reviewed by two independent pathologists, and if there is any doubt, to repeat the biopsies. Approximately one-third with high-grade dysplasia have an underlying cancer; between 15 and 60% with high-grade dysplasia will progress to cancer within 1–4 years. Notably, there is recent evidence that unifocal high-grade dysplasia has a lower risk of cancer progression than multifocal high-grade dysplasia. If high-grade dysplasia is confirmed in the absence of adenocarcinoma, referral for an oesophagectomy is one option. An alternative is intensive surveillance (every 3 months) until intramucosal cancer is detected, then oesophagectomy. However, patients with high-grade dysplasia are typically elderly, with multiple other comorbidities. If the patient refuses or is not fit for surgery, experimental procedures such as photodynamic therapy or argon plasma coagulation with or without endoscopic mucosal resection may be available, but are not of proven value for treating high-grade dysplasia. The interactions between Helicobacter pylori infection, GORD and PPI are complex. Recent studies have clarified key elements of this interaction. Helicobacter pylori infection does not increase the risk of developing reflux oesophagitis. Similarly, H. pylori infection, in most patients, does not reduce the risk of developing reflux and oesophagitis. Helicobacter pylori infection rates in patients with reflux disease generally match the background prevalence of infection in that population. Case–control studies have shown no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection between patients with and without oesophagitis. The higher prevalence of oesophagitis in populations with lower rates of H. pylori infection represents mostly the different epidemiology of these two conditions, rather than cause and effect. Physiological studies using pH monitoring have shown that abnormal oesophageal acid exposure, which is the hallmark of oesophageal reflux, is not influenced by the presence or absence of H. pylori infection. A subgroup of patients infected with a more inflammatory strain of H. pylori (such as cagA positive organisms) may be less prone to severe oesophagitis and Barrett's change. This is because infection in these patients more often leads to severe corpus gastritis with marked atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, resulting in diminished acid output. However, these patients are at much greater risk of developing gastric cancer or ulcer. Eradication therapy should be considered, because the potential to reduce these risks outweighs a possibly reduced risk of developing reflux disease. Proton pump inhibitors cause a worsening of the histological grade of gastritis in H. pylori-infected patients. Recent studies have shown this to be associated with an increased likelihood of the development of atrophy of the gastric mucosa. This accelerated risk of gastric mucosal atrophy is not seen when PPI are used in uninfected subjects or in those in whom eradication therapy has been given successfully prior to longer-term PPI use. As gastric mucosal atrophy is known to be a risk factor for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma, there is reason to consider eradicating H. pylori infection before using long-term PPI therapy, particularly in younger patients. An initial report that oesophagitis was more likely to develop in patients who had eradication therapy for duodenal ulcer disease has not been substantiated. Moreover, any small risk of this was outweighed by the greater risk of ulcer relapse in those who remained infected. Studies since have established that H. pylori eradication does not significantly increase the risk of reflux or oesophagitis. Most studies have shown either no change or an improvement in symptoms after eradication therapy. In patients with endoscopy-negative reflux, no difference in heartburn was evident. Symptoms of heartburn have been reported to improve in a subset of uninvestigated patients given eradication therapy, and also in patients with documented ulcer disease in whom heartburn was one of the initial symptoms. There is no evidence that eradication of H. pylori increases the risk of cardia cancer. Similarly, there are no convincing data that reflux symptoms are better controlled in patients who are H. pylori-infected. Studies have shown that relief of reflux symptoms with PPI is not impaired by prior H. pylori eradication. The decision to test for and treat H. pylori in patients with GORD needs to be individualized, based on patient factors including overall and upper gut comorbidity, age, family history, and informed choice. A decision not to test for and treat H. pylori is just as active a choice as is the decision to test. There is not consensus in the world literature regarding best practice at present, and further research is required. The use of PPI affects the accuracy of biopsies for H. pylori (urease and histology) as well as breath tests and stool-antigen tests, by increasing false negatives. If testing is indicated, it is best done prior to commencement of PPI therapy. After short-term PPI use (< month), PPI should be stopped for at least 1 week and for longer if the duration of PPI use was longer. Serological tests are unaffected by acid suppression, but have variable accuracy in the initial diagnosis of H. pylori and are not useful to assess the outcome of therapy.

Gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry was applied to investigate whether lysine of intestinal origin is available for body protein synthesis. Two minipigs with an end-to-end ileorectal anastomosis received orally equimolar amounts of 15N as ammonium chloride or urea twice a day for 10 days. Samples of blood and ileal digesta were collected before and throughout the 10 days; tissue samples were taken at termination of the experiment. The N-acetyl-n-propyl (NAP)- and N-pivaloyl-i-propyl (NPP)-amino acid esters were evaluated for the determination of the 15N content of lysine and 16 other amino acids ranging from natural abundance to an enrichment of 0.6 APE 15N in a complex mixture of proteinogenic amino acids and several matrices. At natural abundances for all amino acids analysed, NAP and NPP derivatives gave mean precisions of 0.5 and 0.3‰ δ15N, respectively. The mean precision for NPP derivatives at enrichments between 0.42 and 1.10 AP 15N ranged between 1.0–15.0‰ δ15N. 15N from ammonium chloride was incorporated into lysine and in all other amino acids of serum albumin to a 2.5 times higher degree than from urea. Somewhat lower, but significant, lysine enrichments were detected in liver, duodenum and jejunum. After 10 days of ingestion of 15N-labeled urea a significant 15N enrichment in lysine of serum albumin could not be detected, although lysine in the ileal digesta was significantly labeled by day 5.

Methods: In Experiment 1, 20 symptomatic reflux patients underwent both pH and polysomnographic monitoring on two nights. On one night, patients ate a non‐provocative meal prior to 19.00 hours, while on the other night patients consumed a late evening meal (21.00 hours). In Experiment 2, 17 symptomatic reflux patients were studied using pH and polysomnographic monitoring on two nights subsequent to a late evening provocative meal. On one night, patients received 75 mg of the H 2 ‐antagonist ranitidine, while on another night they received a placebo. The data from 12 of the 17 patients studied were used in the analysis. Results: For Experiment 1, no significant differences in the number or duration of reflux events, acid exposure (total %), or polysomnographic measures of per cent of sleep stages between the two nights were observed. The results of the second experiment demonstrated that when given ranitidine, patients experienced significant decrease in acid contact time (total %), and mean duration of reflux events. Subjective reports of discomfort and sleep disturbance were also significantly improved on the drug night. However, significant differences in polysomnographic measures were not observed. Conclusions: Based on these results, we conclude that in some symptomatic reflux patients a late‐night non‐provocative meal may not increase the incidence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux, and that a low dose of an H 2 ‐antagonist is effective in decreasing oesophageal acid contact time following a late evening provocative meal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.1998.00407.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984238410", "source": "openalex"}

Materials and Methods:Sixty cases of gastric adenocarcinomas (44 biopsies and 16 gastrectomies) over the past five years ( June 2009 to June 2014),were included in the study.Diagnosis was confirmed by review of slides and IHC with anti HER2 antibodies was performed using Dako Real Envision Detection system and scoring was done by Hoffmann et al., scoring system.Results: Of the 60 cases, majority were males (60%),with a mean age of 65.65 yrs.Tumours in antrum (76.7%) formed the major bulk.HER2 expression was observed in 26.7% of Tumours, predominantly in males (p=0.006) and intestinal type (p= 0.054).HER2 expression correlated with Tumour grade (moderately differentiated and well differentiated, p= 0.042).Tumours of gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) showed HER2 expression in 45.5% as opposed to 22.4% in gastric location.Poorly differentiated and diffuse type of adenocarcinomas did not express HER2.Two of three Tumours from patients in the age group 31-40 y expressed HER2.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2015/12581.5630", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2184884072", "source": "openalex"}

We studied 52 extranodal B‐cell lymphomas: 18 extranodal marginal zone B‐cell lymphomas of MALT type (MZBL,MT), 7 MZBL,MT of the gastro‐intestinal tract with a diffuse large B‐cell component (giMZBL plus LBCL), and 27 diffuse large B‐cell lymphomas of the gastro‐intestinal tract without small cell component (giLBCL). Analytical techniques were comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The translocation t(11;18) was found as the sole aberration in two MZBL,MT only. In contrast to this, t(11;18)‐negative MZBL,MT were characterized by frequent gains on chromosome 3 and DNA amplifications on 2p13–p15. Furthermore, we found a clonal lymphoma progression from the small to the large cell component with accumulation of gains and losses of chromosomal material in the large cell component in giMZBL plus LBCL. Aberrations overlapping with MZBL,MT and giMZBL plus LBCL included losses on chromosome 13, amplifications of the REL proto‐oncogene, or gains on chromosome 12. In addition, the large cell component revealed gains on 8q24, including amplifications of the MYC proto‐oncogene, and losses on 2q. The giLBCL had frequent gains on chromosomes 12 and 9, as well as on 11q, and losses on 6q. We conclude that, based on the distinctive and partly overlapping patterns of genetic aberrations, MALT lymphomas can be divided into different genetic subgroups. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/gcc.1150", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066840473", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: One hundred and forty‐one patients with moderate to severe gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms occurring at least three times per week (but no oesophageal erosions or ulcers at endoscopy) were treated in this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study at six trial centres. Treatment was given for 6 weeks and consisted of daily doses of either 1 g sucralfate gel b.d. or placebo. The evaluation of efficacy was based on data of 139 patients. RESULTS: The responder rate at Day 42 was statistically significantly higher for the patients treated with sucralfate (71%) than for the placebo patients (29%) (P &lt; 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). The overall response of the non‐ulcer dyspepsia and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms was better for sucralfate gel than for placebo with 45% of patients treated with sucralfate gel being considered as having a 'good' or 'excellent' overall response compared with 22% of the patients who received placebo (P &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon test). Only a few adverse experiences were reported by 10% of sucralfate patients and 7% of placebo patients.

From the data it is apparent that 287 g of cells are lost every 24 h from the mucosa of the entire human gastrointestinal tract. Evidence is presented to show that in the steady-state this loss reflects the rate of production or turnover of surface epithelial cells. In atrophic gastritis, coeliac syndrome, exfoliative psoriasis and possibly ulcerative colitis turnover is high. The rate of cell loss in these diseases is high per unit of surface area. In patients with coeliac syndrome who are losing weight (active coeliacs) small bowel DNA rates are particularly high, and they fall to normal after successful treatment. There is both experimental animal, and human clinical evidence to show that in mal-absorptive states iron, protein, fat and folic acid are lost from the gut in excessive quantities. This increased endogenous loss of iron, protein and fat is related to the increased loss of DNA or cells. In the case of protein about 80 g are lost from the normal human small intestine per day, only 8–15% of which is derived from protein within cells. 12–30 g of lipid are lost per day from the human small bowel mucosa and it is virtually all derived from intracellular lipid within exfoliated epithelial cells. The term exfoliative enteropathy is suggested for this mechanism. We believe that excessive loss of endogenous material due to exfoliative enteropathy is an important cause of the malnutrition that results from diffuse diseases of the small intestine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000197310", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963958097", "source": "openalex"}

Strategies to improve treatment tolerability are warranted. This study examined the safety and feasibility of preoperative exercise training during neoadjuvant treatment in these patients. Patients were allocated to a standard-care control group or an exercise group, who were prescribed standard care plus twice-weekly high-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance training sessions. The primary endpoint was the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) that prevented surgery, including death, disease progression or physical deterioration. Preoperative hospital admission, postoperative complications, changes in patient-reported quality of life and pathological treatment response were also recorded. In the exercise group, adherence to exercise and changes in aerobic fitness, muscle strength and body composition were measured. The incidence of SAEs was not increased in the exercise group. The risk of failure to reach surgery was 5 versus 21 per cent in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0·23, 95 per cent c.i. 0·04 to 1·29), the risk of preoperative hospital admission was 15 versus 38 per cent respectively (RR 0·39, 0·12 to 1·23) and the risk of postoperative complications was 58 versus 57 per cent (RR 1·06, 0·61 to 1·73). The exercise group attended a mean of 17·5 sessions, and improved fitness, muscle strength and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Esophageal (FACT-E) total score compared with the baseline level. Preoperative exercise training during neoadjuvant treatment in patients with GOJ cancer is safe and feasible, with improvements in fitness, strength and quality of life.

Pathophysiological mechanisms of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy include a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter, increased gastro-esophageal pressure gradient and intra-thoracic migration of the remnant stomach. A reduction in the compliance of the gastric remnant may provoke an increase in transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations. Time-resolved MRI suggests relative gastric stasis in the proximal remnant and increased emptying from the antrum.

Despite the high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the environment and frequent contamination of uncooked meat and poultry products, infections with this pathogen are relatively uncommon, suggesting that protective defenses in the general population are effective. In the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, a variety of defense mechanisms prevent L. monocytogenes growth, epithelial penetration and systemic dissemination. Among these defenses, colonization resistance mediated by the gut microbiota is crucial in protection against a range of intestinal pathogens, including L. monocytogenes. Here we review defined mechanisms of defense against L. monocytogenes in the lumen of the gastro-intestinal tract, with particular emphasis on protection conferred by the autochthonous microbiota.

The system was established with newly designed universal primers with barcode sequences and newly modified algorithms to convert batch sequence data to bacterial population data. In silico primer match simulation indicates that the primers, Q-968F, Q-1046R, and Q-1390R, match to almost of all 16S rRNAs in the database within one base mismatch, with especially high coverage ratios for the four biggest common phyla in human GI tract. Also, the new SeqmatchQ100 algorithm correctly assigns almost all of the target 60-base sequences of the 16S rRNA V6 region to the corresponding genus except for those from the Enterobacteriaceae family and the Enterococcus genus. Furthermore, the SeqmatchQ400 algorithm efficiently provides species-level population data from a 400-base sequence of the 16S rRNA V6-V8 region with the exceptions of the Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae families. A barcode-sequence tag strategy was used to analyze up to 128 samples at a time. With these newly prepared tools, pyrosequence-based 16S rRNA profiling displays community structures of GI-tract microbiota. For instance, establishment of bifidus flora in newborn infants and dynamics in the microbial community structure after weaning were effectively demonstrated by 16S rRNA profiling.

Methods Twenty‐five patients (reflux oesophagitis 15, non‐erosive reflux disease 10; 18 men and seven women) drank 300‐mL white wine ( n = 17), 500‐mL beer ( n = 8), or identical amounts of tap water (controls) together with a standardized meal in a randomized order. pH‐measurement was carried out during three postprandial hours by pH‐metry and the percentage of time pH &lt; 4 was calculated. Results Both alcoholic beverages increased reflux compared with water [wine 23% (median), water 12%, P &lt; 0.01; beer 25%, water 11%, P &lt; 0.05]. Between wine and beer, no difference in reflux induction was obtained. The reflux induction was seen in patients with (23%, P &lt; 0.01) and without reflux oesophagitis (22%, P &lt; 0.05) and in both sexes (women 23%, men 25%, P &lt; 0.05 each). Conclusions Ingestion of commonly consumed alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer induces gastro‐oesophageal reflux in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients. Therefore, these patients should be advised to avoid the intake of large amounts (≥300 mL) of these beverages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02922.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061174598", "source": "openalex"}

It may have excitatory or inhibitory actions via three subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptor, and it modulates the mechanosensitivity of somatic sensory fibres. We aimed to determine if galanin also modulates vagal afferent mechanosensitivity, and to localize endogenous sources. The responses of ferret and mouse gastro-oesophageal vagal afferents to graded mechanical stimuli were investigated in vitro. The effects of galanin and/or the galanin receptor antagonist galantide on these responses were quantified. Immunohistochemistry for galanin was performed in ferret and mouse proximal stomach and nodose ganglion. In ferrets, retrograde labelling of gastric afferents to the nodose ganglion was combined with immunohistochemistry. When exposed to galanin (1-10 nM), 18/31 ferret and 12/15 mouse gastro-oesophageal afferents (tension, mucosal and tension/mucosal receptors) showed inhibition of mechanosensitivity. Four of 31 ferret afferents showed potentiation of mechanosensitivity, and 9/31 were unaffected (2/15 and 1/15 in mouse, respectively). Galanin effects were reversed after washout or by galantide (10-30 nM). Galantide given alone increased mechanosensitivity. Galanin immunoreactivity was found in nodose neurones, including those innervating the stomach in ferret. Enteric neurones were also galanin immunoreactive, as were endings associated with myenteric ganglia and smooth muscle. We conclude that galanin potently modulates mechanosensitivity of gastro-oesophageal vagal afferents with either facilitatory or inhibitory actions on individual afferent fibres. Both intrinsic and extrinsic (vagal) neurones contain galanin and are therefore potential sources of endogenous galanin.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2004.075291", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1600343254", "source": "openalex"}

This prospective, randomized, double‐blind study compared omeprazole and cimetidine in the treatment of GERD‐associated heartburn both in patients with symptomatic non‐ulcerative oesophagitis and in those with heartburn but without oesophagitis. Methods : A total of 221 patients with heartburn and oesophageal mucosa grade 0 (normal, n = 51), 1 (no macroscopic erosions, n = 52), 2 (isolated erosions, n = 97) or 3 (confluent erosions, n = 21) were randomized to receive double‐blind either omeprazole 20 mg daily or cimetidine 400 mg q.d.s. for a period of 4 weeks. Those still symptomatic after 4 weeks of treatment received omeprazole 20 mg daily for a further 4 weeks. Results : There was no correlation between severity of heartburn and endoscopic grade at entry (correlation coefficient = 0.196). After 4 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients in whom heartburn was controlled (no more than mild symptoms on no more than 1 day in the previous 7) on omeprazole (66%; 74/112) was more than double that on cimetidine (31%; 34/109) ( P &lt; 0.0001).

Following incubation at pH 7.2 in the presence of nitrate (or nitrite) for up to 24 (48) h, the yield of N-nitroso compounds (NOC) was quantified by HPLC equipped with a post-column derivatization device, allowing the sensitive detection of acid-labile and acid-stable NOC. Eleven out of the 23 test compounds underwent bacteria-catalysed nitrosation by salivary bacteria, the yield of the respective nitrosation products varying 800-fold. 4-(Methylamino)antipyrine exhibited the highest rate of nitrosation, followed by dichlofenac > metamizole > piperazine > five other drugs, whilst L-proline and L-thioproline had the lowest nitrosation rate. Ten drugs including aminophenazone, cimetidine and nicotine, did not inhibit bacterial growth, allowing transitory nitrite to be formed, but no N-nitroso derivatives were detected. Three drugs inhibited the proliferation of bacteria and neither nitrite nor any NOC were formed. Using metamizole as an easily nitrosatable precursor, two strains, Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori, were shown to catalyse nitrosation in the presence of nitrite at pH 7.2. As compared to Neisseria cinerea used as a nitrosation-proficient control strain, H. pylori was 30-100 times less effective, whilst C. jejuni had intermediary activity. The results of our sensitive nitrosation assay further confirm that bacteria isolated from human sources, possessing nitrate reductase and/or nitrosating enzymes such as cytochrome cd1-nitrite reductase (Calmels et al., Carcinogenesis, 17, 533-536, 1996), can contribute to intragastric nitrosamine formation in the anacidic stomach when nitrosatable precursors from exogenous and endogenous sources are present.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin/18.2.383", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158331962", "source": "openalex"}

The goal of this study was to determine (i) if there is a higher reflux burden as measured by pH‐MII in patients that are pepsin positive in the lung, and (ii) the sensitivity of pepsin in predicting pathologic reflux by pH, MII, and EGD. Methods We recruited children between the ages of 1–21 with chronic cough or asthma undergoing bronchoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and multichannel intraluminal impedance (pH‐MII) probe placement. The reflux profiles were compared between those patients who were pepsin positive and negative; proportions were compared using Chi‐squared analyses and means were compared using t ‐testing. Key Results Only the mean number of non‐acid reflux events was associated with pepsin positivity (0.04). The sensitivity and specificity of pepsin in predicting pathologic reflux by pH‐MII or EGD was 57% and 65%, respectively. The positive predictive value of pepsin in predicting pathologic reflux by pH, MII or EGD was 50% (11/22), and the negative predictive value was 71% (20/28).

We have studied the direct and indirect costs of medical and surgical therapy within the framework of a prospective randomised multicentre trial. <h3>METHODS</h3> After initial treatment of reflux oesophagitis with omeprazole to control symptoms and to heal oesophagitis, 154 patients were randomised to continue treatment with omeprazole (20 or 40 mg daily) and 144 patients to have an open antireflux operation (ARS). In case of GORD relapse, patients allocated to omeprazole were offered ARS and those initially operated on had either a reoperation or were treated with omeprazole. The costs were assessed over five years from randomisation. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Differences in cumulative direct medical costs per patient between the two therapeutic strategies diminished with time. However, five year direct medical costs per patient when given omeprazole were still significantly lower than for those having ARS in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (differences were DKK 8703 (US$1475), NOK 32 992 (US$ 5155), and SEK 13 036 (US$ 1946), respectively).

G. intestinalis, or G. lamblia) is a leading cause of waterborne diarrheal disease that infects hundreds of millions of people annually. Research on Giardia has greatly expanded within the last few years, and our understanding of the pathophysiology and immunology on this parasite is ever increasing. At peak infection, Giardia trophozoites induce pathophysiological responses that culminate in the development of diarrheal disease. However, human data has suggested that the intestinal mucosa of Giardia-infected individuals is devoid of signs of overt intestinal inflammation, an observation that is reproduced in animal models. Thus, our understanding of host inflammatory responses to the parasite remain incompletely understood and human studies and experimental data have produced conflicting results. It is now also apparent that certain Giardia infections contain mechanisms capable of modulating their host's immune responses. As the oral route of Giardia infection is shared with many other gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens, co-infections may often occur, especially in places with poor sanitation and/or improper treatment of drinking water. Moreover, Giardia infections may modulate host immune responses and have been found to protect against the development of diarrheal disease in developing countries. The following review summarizes our current understanding of the immunomodulatory mechanisms of Giardia infections and their consequences for the host, and highlights areas for future research. Potential implications of these immunomodulatory effects during GI co-infection are also discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens4040764", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151160295", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: One hundred and one GORD patients were followed up by symptomatic questionnaire 3 to 4.5 years after diagnosis and offered repeat investigation with endoscopy and oesophageal pH monitoring if symptoms persisted. Results: Seventy-seven (76%) patients responded (mean follow-up period, 39 months; range, 32-54 months); of these, 28 had grade-II or -III oesophagitis at initial endoscopy, 17 had normal endoscopy but abnormal pH monitoring, and 32 had normal investigations but frequent heartburn.

Results We identified 319 publications and 22 of them met the entry criteria. Of those, the relationship between GERD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was investigated in 14 articles, pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) in six articles and pulmonary involvement in mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) in two articles. We found the prevalence of GERD and/or oesophageal dysmotility to be higher in patients with different types of ILD as compared with those without ILD [Evidence B]. Among patients with IPF, 67–76% demonstrated abnormal oesophageal acid exposure off PPI treatment. No relationship was demonstrated between severity of GERD and severity of IPF [Evidence B].

The accuracy of this technique was found to be influenced by the distance between the lung and the abdominal source of activity, and the minimum detectable ‘aspirated’ activity was determined as 0.1 MBq at a distance of 15 cm and 1 MBq at 5 cm. The interpolative technique for background correction was evaluated on healthy volunteers and laryngectomized patients, examined 10 h after intragastric instillation of 200 MBq of 99 Tc m ‐pertechnetate. After background subtraction, their calculated pulmonary mean net count value was comparable to that registered before the radioactive tracer was administered. No localized accumulation of activity was found in any of these controls. The technique was then applied clinically to 55 patients with chronic respiratory disorders and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Aspiration was detected in 11 patients (20%).

The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model with improved survival prediction after oesophagectomy. Methods Consecutive patients who had potentially curative oesophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction were included. Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association between risk factors and time to death from oesophageal cancer. The concordance index, calculated after bootstrapping, was used to measure accuracy. A nomogram was designed for use in clinical practice. Results Oesophageal cancer-specific survival rates for the 364 included patients who underwent oesophagectomy between 1993 and 2003 were 75·8, 54·9 and 39·2 per cent at 1, 2 and 5 years respectively. A prognostic model using all prognostic variables outperformed TNM staging (concordance index 0·79 versus 0·68 respectively; P &amp;lt; 0·001). A reduced model derived after backward elimination, containing only T stage, lymph node ratio and extracapsular lymph node involvement, also outperformed TNM staging (concordance index 0·77; P &amp;lt; 0·001). Conclusion A prognostic model developed to predict disease-specific survival after oesophagectomy was superior to TNM staging. More reliable prognostic information might lead to different approaches to patient follow-up.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.5832", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998124363", "source": "openalex"}

This was investigated using lower oesophageal pH monitoring during physiotherapy. Twenty-one infants (age range 1-27 months) with respiratory disorders (CF=11), undergoing lower oesophageal pH monitoring were recruited. Subjects received two physiotherapy episodes in random order, A/B or B/A, 12 h apart. A began the gravity-assisted positioning head downward tip for: right lower lobe, middle lobe, left lower lobe and lingula; then supine with no tip for anterior segments of the upper lobes followed by apical segments of upper lobes in a sitting position. B was in the reverse order. Intermittent chest clapping was carried out for 4 min in each position by a physiotherapist blinded to the pH data. During episode A, the median change in pH from baseline was -0.32 (range -2.07 to +1.0) in non-CF subjects (NS) and -0.52 (range -2.7 to +0.52) in CF subjects (p&lt;0.02). During episode B, the median change in non-CF subjects was -0.1 (NS; range - 1.7 to -0.15) and in CF subjects was -0.05 (NS; range -0.67 to +0.5). There was no order effect for positioning. In the CF subjects the sitting position was twice as likely to have the lowest pH measurement during physiotherapy than the other positions (p&lt;0.04). In conclusion, the head-downward tipped positioning for physiotherapy treatment neither induces nor aggravates gastro-oesophageal reflux.

We have realized that NERD has to be considered as an umbrella term covering various subgroups with different pathophysiologies. The development of new impedance metrics, in particular mean nocturnal baseline impedance, seems to be promising in the improvement of the diagnostic process of this disease. There are no particularly innovative features in the pharmacological therapy of GERD, unless the interest toward drugs is able to increase the defense properties of esophageal mucosa and/or its protection. These compounds can be of help in combination with proton pump inhibitors in NERD patients with partial response to antisecretory drugs alone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2020.1752664", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3014209362", "source": "openalex"}

Night-time GORD can profoundly impair quality of life by causing pain, disturbing sleep, and interfering with next-day mental and physical functioning. Sleep impairs oesophageal acid clearance resulting in a prolongation of acid mucosal contact, and nocturnal reflux portends a greater risk of erosive oesophagitis and other significant complications of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Lifestyle changes such as elevating the head of the bed and adjusting the sleeping position can relieve night-time heartburn, and instituting some dietary changes along with occasional use of histamine H2 blockers can also be helpful. Relief of night-time reflux and its attendant symptoms usually requires a medication with acid-suppressing properties that extend into the sleeping interval. In most instances, more powerful acid suppression in the form of proton-pump inhibitors will be required. Clinical studies have shown that 40 mg esomeprazole provides better control of night-time GORD symptoms than 20 mg omeprazole or 30 mg lansoprazole. Furthermore, 40 mg pantoprazole offers even faster relief than 40 mg esomeprazole for night-time GORD symptoms. Of the several proton-pump inhibitors available on the market, esomeprazole and pantoprazole appear to have some advantages, which have been documented in recent studies. Esomeprazole has been shown to be more effective than lansoprazole in relieving GORD symptoms, and esomeprazole and pantoprazole appear to be equally effective in resolving GORD symptoms in a comparative study. Pantoprazole has pharmacokinetic properties that document a longer half-life compared with the other proton-pump inhibitors, and pantoprazole has the slowest inhibition recovery rate. These properties lend credence to pantoprazole as an effective treatment for associated symptoms of night-time reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200501000-00021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026613481", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore we collected blood samples from 29 athletes before, immediately after, and 1, 2 and 16 h after a long-distance triathlon for measurement of LPS, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6). As the cytokine response would trigger an acute-phase response, characteristic variables of these responses were also measured, along with creatine kinase (CK) to obtain an indicator of muscle damage. There was a high incidence (93% of all participants) of GI symptoms; 45% reported severe complaints and 7% of the participants abandoned the race because of severe GI distress. Mild endotoxaemia (5–15 pg/ml) was evident in 68% of the athletes immediately after the race, as also indicated by a reduction in IgG anti-LPS levels. In addition, we observed production of IL-6 (27–fold increase immediately after the race), leading to an acute-phase response (20-fold increase in C-reactive protein and 12% decrease in pre-albumin 16 h after the race). The extent of endotoxaemia was not correlated with the GI complaints or the IL-6 response, but did show a correlation with the elevation in C-reactive protein (rs 0.389; P = 0.037). Creatine kinase levels were increased significantly immediately post-race, and increased further in the follow-up period. Creatine kinase levels did not correlate with those of either IL-6 or C-reactive protein. It is therefore concluded that LPS does enter the circulation after ultra-endurance exercise and may, together with muscle damage, be responsible for the increased cytokine response and hence GI complaints in these athletes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1042/cs19990258", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4250804411", "source": "openalex"}

Participants 1657 patients aged ≥18 years with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status, who had not received systemic anticancer therapy for advanced disease. Interventions Patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either tislelizumab 200 mg or placebo intravenously every three weeks in combination with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of oxaliplatin and capecitabine, or cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) and stratified by region, PD-L1 expression, presence or absence of peritoneal metastases, and investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was overall survival, both in patients with a PD-L1 tumour area positivity (TAP) score of ≥5% and in all randomised patients. Safety was assessed in all those who received at least one dose of study treatment. Results Of 1657 patients screened between 13 December 2018 and 9 February 2021, 660 were ineligible due to not meeting the eligibility criteria, withdrawal of consent, adverse events, or other reasons. Overall, 997 were randomly assigned to receive tislelizumab plus chemotherapy (n=501) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=496). Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy showed statistically significant improvements in overall survival versus placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TAP score of ≥5% (median 17.2 months v 12.6 months; hazard ratio 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.94); P=0.006 (interim analysis)) and in all randomised patients (median 15.0 months v 12.9 months; hazard ratio 0.80 (0.70 to 0.92); P=0.001 (final analysis)).

Ten cases of GTF were encountered in three hospitals in 2000-2009. Their clinicopathological, surgical, and postoperative care are summarized, together with a review of previously reported cases. GTF was classified as anastomotic leakage (n= 5), gastric necrosis (n= 4), and gastric ulcer type (n= 1). The anastomotic leakage type appeared about 2 weeks (postoperative day [POD]: 8-35) after esophagectomy, was located in the cervical or higher thoracic trachea. Breathing and pneumonia were controlled by tracheal tube placed in the distal of fistula. The gastric necrosis type was noted in patients who developed necrosis of the upper part of the gastric tube and abscess formation behind the tracheal wall, at POD 20-36 around the carina, the site of pronounced ischemia. Due to the large fistula around the carina, emergency surgery with muscle patch repair was frequently required for the control of aspiration pneumonia. Patients of the gastric ulcer type had peptic ulcer in the lesser curvature of the gastric tube, which perforated into the right bronchus long after surgery (POD 630). With respect to tracheobronchial factors, preoperative chemoradiation (three cases) and pre-tracheal node dissection (three cases) tended to increase the risk of GTF. Closure of GTF by surgery (muscle patch repair) was successful in four cases and by nonsurgical treatment in three cases. In one case, stable oral intake was achieved by bypass operation without closure of GTF. Hospital death occurred in three cases.

Current methods of diagnosis lack accuracy, are invasive and can be costly. Recently, novel methods of analysing lung pathophysiology have been developed including the use of an electronic nose and analysis of components of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). We hypothesised that these methods would distinguish patients with GORD from those without GORD in the common obstructive lung diseases and healthy controls. In a cross-sectional study, exhaled breath was analysed using the Cyranose 320 electronic nose, using principal components and canonical discriminant analyses. EBC pH and pepsin were quantified using a pH meter and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A standardized reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) was used to assess reflux symptoms. The Cyranose 320 distinguished exhaled breath profiles of obstructive lung disease patients without GORD from obstructive lung disease patients with GORD (p = 0.023, accuracy 67.6%), asthmatic patients with reflux from asthmatics without GORD (85%, p = < 0.015, interclass M distance > 2.8), but did not produce as robust a profile for patients with COPD and COPD with GORD (p = 0.047, accuracy 64%). Patients with obstructive lung disease and GORD had significantly higher levels of EBC pepsin (9.81 ± interquartile range (IQR) 4.38 ng ml(-1)) than those without GORD (4.6 ± IQR 6.95 ng ml(-1)), as well as healthy controls (3.44 ± IQR 7.87 ng ml(-1); p = < 0.013). EBC pH was not significantly related to the presence of GORD in any group. The RDQ results correlated significantly with the presence of EBC pepsin. This pilot study has shown that exhaled breath profiling can be used for detecting GORD in obstructive lung diseases. While the electronic nose was useful in asthma, EBC pepsin was more helpful in COPD. In this study, several different confounders could potentially have affected results and larger prospective interventional studies are needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7155/6/1/016003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2034662626", "source": "openalex"}

In order to better understand the role of acid and DGER in esophageal mucosal injury, we summarized the recent publications in this area.Review of published medical literature (MEDLINE) on the clinical consequence of esophageal exposure to gastric acid or DGER.Recent data suggest that esophageal pH monitoring and pH > 7 is a poor marker for reflux of duodenal contents into the esophagus. DGER in non-acidic environments (i.e., partial gastrectomy patients) may cause symptoms but does not cause esophageal mucosal injury. Acid and duodenal contents usually reflux into the esophagus simultaneously, and may be contributing to the development of Barrett's metaplasia and possibly adenocarcinoma. Proton pump inhibitors decrease acid and DGER by reducing intragastric volume available for reflux and raising intragastric pH. The promotility agent cisapride decreases DGER by increasing LES pressure and improving gastric emptying.1) The term \"alkaline reflux\" is a misnormer and should no longer be used in referring to reflux of duodenal contents. 2) Bilitec is the method of choice in detecting DGER and should always be used simultaneously with esophageal pH-monitoring for acid reflux. 3) DGER alone is not injurious to esophageal mucosa, but can result in significant esophageal mucosal injury when combined with acid reflux. 4) Therefore, controlling esophageal exposure to acid reflux by using proton pump inhibitors also eliminates the potentially damaging effect of DGER.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2410730641", "source": "openalex"}

For clinical purposes, the Bristol Stool Form Scale works well to distinguish stool form and to identify loose stools. Laboratory testing of stool consistency has lagged behind. Acute diarrhea is likely to be due to infection and to be self-limited. As diarrhea becomes chronic, it is less likely to be due to infection; duration of 1 month seems to work well as a cut-off for chronic diarrhea, but detailed scientific knowledge is missing about the utility of this definition. In addition to duration of diarrhea, classifications by presenting scenario, by pathophysiology, and by stool characteristics (e.g. watery, fatty, or inflammatory) may help the canny clinician refine the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea. In this regard, a careful history remains the essential part of the evaluation of a patient with diarrhea. Imaging the intestine with endoscopy and radiographic techniques is useful, and biopsy of the small intestine and colon for histological assessment provides key diagnostic information. Endomicroscopy and molecular pathology are only now being explored for the diagnosis of chronic diarrhea. Interest in the microbiome of the gut is increasing; aside from a handful of well-described infections because of pathogens, little is known about alterations in the microbiome in chronic diarrhea. Serological tests have well-defined roles in the diagnosis of celiac disease but have less clearly defined application in autoimmune enteropathies and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of peptide hormones is of value in the diagnosis and management of endocrine tumors causing diarrhea, but these are so rare that these tests are of little value in screening because there will be many more false-positives than true-positive results. Chemical analysis of stools is of use in classifying chronic diarrhea and may limit the differential diagnosis that must be considered, but interpretation of the results is still evolving. Breath tests for assessment of carbohydrate malabsorption, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and intestinal transit are fraught with technical limitations that decrease sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, tests of bile acid malabsorption have had limited utility beyond empirical trials of bile acid sequestrants.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12392", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1521766620", "source": "openalex"}

Well-differentiated adenocarcinomas developed in the resected stomachs with and without MNNG administration at incidences of 40% in the former and 23% in the latter. All the carcinomas were localized in the vicinity of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis, at which the proximal jejunal segment was drained. Several mucosal changes were found predominantly in the fundic mucosa surrounding the anastomosis, i.e., ulcer, foveolar hyperplasia, intestinal metaplasia and atypical hyperplasia. On the other hand, there was little mucosal change surrounding the gastro-jejunal anastomosis of the distal jejunal segment. These findings suggest a direct correlation between the exposure of mucosa of the anastomotic region to the duodenal contents and the development of adenocarcinoma.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2397770742", "source": "openalex"}

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW", "text": "The growing interest reflected in the studies on dental erosion is justified by the severe health problems it entails, i.e. esthetic, phonetic, masticatory disturbances and pulp complications. Most studies investigate the prevalence of dental erosion in adults and children, the severity of lesions and etiopathogenetic factors.Dental erosions (DE) are one of the extraesophageal complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). An increasing amount of papers shed light on this topic. We carried out a systematic review on the association between GERD and DE.We studied the association between DE and GERD in adults and children. The search for published studies was performed in PubMed using search terms \"dental erosion\" and \"gastro-esophageal reflux disease\". References published since 2007 were included and a systematic review was carried out. Articles not assessing DE in GERD patients were excluded, and also case presentations and articles in languages of limited circulation. The prevalence of DE in patients with GERD, extrinsic and intrinsic etiological factors of DE and the severity of dental erosion lesions were analyzed.A total of 273 articles were found, 10 studies being retained for analysis. Correlations between DE and GERD, namely the prevalence and severity of dental erosion in GERD patients, were investigated. DE prevalence was between 10.6% - 42%, median 25.5%. Mean values of DE prevalence were 48.81% in GERD patients, compared to 20.48% in non-GERD controls. Comparative values of DE frequency in adults with GERD was 38.96%, compared to 98.1% in children with GERD.DE is a condition associated with GERD. DE prevalence is higher in GERD patients. Intrinsic pathogenetic factors with direct action on the hard dental tissues are GERD, while extrinsic factors are represented by diet. Among the patients diagnosed with GERD, youth under the age of 18 had a higher frequency compared to adults.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15386/cjmed-1017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2810205377", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Subjective and objective 5-year outcomes of Nissen fundoplication were compared in 96 patients with NERD and 117 with ERD, operated on for proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory GORD. Results Preoperative and postoperative QoL, PPI use, acid exposure time, symptom–reflux correlation, lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure and reoperation rates were similar in the two groups. At 5 years, relief of reflux symptoms was similar (NERD 89 per cent versus ERD 96 per cent), PPI use showed a similar reduction (82 to 21 per cent versus 81 to 15 per cent respectively; both P &amp;lt; 0·001) and QoL score improved equally (50·3 to 65·2 (P &amp;lt; 0·001) versus 52·0 to 60·7 (P = 0·016)).

Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis of stage IV GEP-NENs was performed. Multivariate analysis for progression of disease (PD) was performed by Cox proportional hazards method to obtain a risk score. Area under the curve obtained by receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the score performance. Progression-free survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. Results Two hundred eighty-three stage IV GEP-NENs were evaluated, including 93 grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (32.9%), 153 grade 2 neuroendocrine tumors (54%), and 37 grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinomas (13.1%). Independent risk factors for PD were Ki67, proportion of metastatic liver involvement, and presence of extra-abdominal metastases. The risk score was calculated as follows: (0.025 × Ki67) + [(0 if no liver metastases or liver involvement &amp;lt;25%) OR (0.405 if liver involvement 25%–50%) OR (0.462 if liver involvement &amp;gt;50%)] + [(0 if no extra-abdominal metastases) OR (0.528 if extra-abdominal metastases present)]. The risk score accuracy to predict PD was superior compared with the G grading system (area under the curve: 0.705 and 0.622, respectively). Three subgroups of patients with low, intermediate, and high risk of PD according to risk score were identified, median progression-free survival being 26 months, 19 months, and 12 months, respectively. Conclusion In stage IV GEP-NENs, a risk score able to predict PD was obtained by combining Ki67, proportion of metastatic liver involvement, and presence of extra-abdominal metastases.

Mechanisms involved in triggering transient LOS relaxation are poorly understood, and their further study requires a small animal model. In this study we aimed to establish methods for prolonged ambulant oesophageal manometry in ferrets, and to determine motor events associated with reflux episodes and their triggering by different gastric nutrient loads. Forty‐two studies were performed on nine ferrets with chronic cervical oesophagostomies, through which a manometric assembly was introduced and secured to a collar, which incorporated a microphone for detection of swallows. The assembly included a gastric feeding channel, one gastric and four oesophageal manometric sideholes, a 2.5‐cm‐long LOS sleeve sensor, and an oesophageal pH electrode. Intragastric infusions were given over 2 min, the first after a 30‐min control recording period, and in 29/42 studies, a second infusion was given 60 min later. Infusions were either 25 mL 10% dextrose solution, pH 3.5 (22 studies), 25 mL triglyceride emulsion (Intralipid) pH 3.5 (11 studies), or 25 mL air (nine studies). Episodes of oesophageal acidification were absent before gastric infusions. After infusion, 2.1 ± 0.2 episodes occurred over the first 30 min. After glucose infusion, 15/18 acidification episodes (83%) occurred during transient LOS relaxation, and 3/18 (17%) occurred after gradual (&lt; 1 mmHg sec −1 ) downward drifts in basal LOSP to &lt; 2 mmHg. After lipid infusion two acidification episodes occurred, both during transient LOS relaxation. Mean duration of transient LOS relaxation was 8.0 ± 0.4 sec. All infusions increased occurrence of transient LOS relaxation to a similar extent, each of which ended with primary peristalsis. We conclude that gastric infusion of glucose, lipid and gas are all effective in provoking gastro‐oesophageal reflux in ferrets. Reflux occurs through similar mechanisms to those seen in humans, i.e. increased triggering of transient LOS relaxation. The conscious ferret is therefore an appropriate model for future studies of manipulation of mechanisms giving rise to gastro‐oesophageal reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2982.1998.00085.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067965338", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to assess this relationship in a large sample of Iranian adults. Methods In a cross‐sectional study in 4763 adults, diet‐related practices were assessed in four domains, ‘meal pattern’, ‘eating rate’, ‘intra‐meal fluid intake’, and ‘meal‐to‐sleep interval’, using a pretested questionnaire. LCA was applied to identify classes of diet‐related practices. We defined GERD as the presence of heartburn sometimes, often or always. Key Results The prevalence of GERD in the study population was 23.5% ( n = 1120). We identified two distinct classes of meal patterns: ‘regular’ and ‘irregular’, three classes of eating rates: ‘moderate’, ‘moderate‐to‐slow’, and ‘moderate‐to‐fast’, two major classes of fluid ingestion with meals: ‘moderate’ and ‘much intra‐meal drinking’, and two classes regarding the interval between meals and sleeping: ‘short’ and ‘long meal‐to‐sleep’ interval. After adjustment for potential confounders, subjects with ‘irregular meal pattern’ had higher odds of GERD compared with subjects with ‘regular meal pattern’ ( OR : 1.21; 1.00–1.46). However, when taking into account BMI , the association disappeared. ‘Long meal‐to‐sleep interval’ was inversely associated with GERD compared with ‘short meal‐to‐sleep interval’ ( OR : 0.73; 95% CI : 0.57–0.95). ‘Eating rate’ and ‘intra‐meal fluid intake’ were not significantly associated with GERD .

Furthermore, although the age-standardised prevalence appeared to be stable between 1990 and 2017, all-age prevalence increased by 18·1% between 1990 and 2017, while years lived with disability increased by 67·1% between 1990 and 2017, reflecting the increased prevalence in older age groups and population ageing over time. As with any such analysis, the results depend on the quality of data and assumptions made by the authors about the disease. In this study the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was defined by the presence or absence of typical reflux symptoms, specifically heartburn and acid regurgitation. However, there is an important difference between symptoms (which are based on a subjective description), and disease (diagnosis of which is based on objective evidence of reflux). Patients with typical symptoms and reflux oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus on endoscopy have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; however, about half of patients with pathological acid exposure in the oesophagus do not have mucosal disease (ie, non-erosive reflux disease). Ambulatory reflux monitoring also identifies individuals with symptoms related to reflux events that have normal levels of acid exposure (reflux hypersensitivity). All three groups are classified as forms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; however, the same symptoms are reported by individuals with functional heartburn in whom there is no pathological reflux and no association of reflux events with symptoms.4Herregods TV Troelstra M Weijenborg PW Bredenoord AJ Smout AJ Patients with refractory reflux symptoms often do not have GERD.Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2015; 27: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Gyawali CP Kahrilas PJ Savarino E et al.Modern diagnosis of GERD: the Lyon Consensus.Gut. 2018; 67: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar Additionally, typical reflux symptoms can be reported by patients with other conditions including eosinophilic oesophagitis, motility disorders (eg, achalasia), and other functional disorders (eg, rumination).

Determining the burden of diseases in an ageing population is important in planning health-care services. This study provides up to date information about the prevalence of typical reflux symptoms and the level of disability that is associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; however, the results are conservative because the analysis did not include the full spectrum of symptoms and disease caused by this condition.

The stability of our global age-standardised prevalence estimates over time suggests that the epidemiology of the disease has not changed, but the estimates of all-age prevalence and YLDs, which increased between 1990 and 2017, suggest that the burden of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is nonetheless increasing as a result of ageing and population growth.

The other detected worm egg species and their respective frequencies were: Toxocara canis (13.7%), Mesostesphanus spp. (1.66%) and Taenia spp. (0.4%). Protozoan eggs (E. canis) were detected in two samples. The prevalence of helminth eggs was higher in young dogs (puppies) compared to adults (p＜0.05). The prevalence of different species of helminths also varied in different age groups, with Toxocara canis being higher in puppies than in adults (p=0.005). Sex-wise prevalence of helminths was not significant (p＞0.05). The high prevalence of gastro-intestinal helminth parasites of zoonotic potential registered in the dog population from a highly urban area in Arusha indicates a potential risk to human health. Increased awareness of their potential threat to human health coupled with additional research into the zoonotic capacity of Toxocara spp. and Ancylostoma spp. is desirable.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2323325566", "source": "openalex"}

All subjects had a positive Bernstein test, and nine of the 12 subjects had erosive oesophagitis. The study was conducted as a double‐blind crossover design utilizing 40 mg nocte, 20 mg b.d., and 40 mg b.d. and placebo treatments. Results indicated that all treatments significantly reduced the 24‐h percentage acid contact time ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to placebo.

The median of reflux episodes per hour was 1.8 (range, 0.2-6.3/h). The median height of the refluxate was 1.5 channels (range, 1.1-2.9); and 71.3% of reflux episodes reached the upper oesophagus, of which 52.4% were nonacid reflux events. On average there were more GOR events (both acid and nonacid) in the children who were fed via a nasogastric tube, and the median height of refluxate was also higher in this group.

The median acid clearance time (21.7 s proximally; 39.5 s distally) was longer when compared with bolus clearance (14.9 s).More than half of the reflux events in neurologically impaired children are nonacidic and would therefore go undetected by conventional pH metry.

Aim To trace the rise in understanding of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and highlight remaining areas of uncertainty. Methods Literature review. Results In 1906, Tileston published his observations on ‘peptic ulcer of the oesophagus’. Winkelstein, in 1934, first correlated symptoms of heartburn with acid regurgitation and reflux oesophagitis. In 1946, Allison described hiatus hernia as a causal factor in the development of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. In 1958, Bernstein and Baker showed a direct relationship between oesophageal acidification and heartburn in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, irrespective of endoscopic findings, leading to the recognition of non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. In the 1980s, continuous recordings of the lower oesophageal sphincter showed that episodes of reflux were related to transient relaxations of lower oesophageal sphincter tone. There is now increasing recognition that gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease arises from the interaction of several anatomical and physiological factors. A turning point in the medical treatment of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease came with the introduction of the first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, in 1989.

To date, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the mainstay of GERD medical treatment. However, despite their undoubted benefit, about 40% of GERD patients display an inadequate response to these drugs. Recently, a new PPI, ilaprazole , at oral doses of 10 mg has shown higher suppression of gastric acid secretion, more prolonged plasma half-life, and similar safety compared to 20 mg omeprazole.This review provides an update on the following points: pharmacokinetic profile and metabolism of ilaprazole in relation to its pharmacodynamic properties; comparative data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ilaprazole with currently available PPIs; and implications for studies on the therapeutic efficacy of ilaprazole in GERD.Different studies show that ilaprazole, a benzimidazole derivative, has an extended plasma half-life in comparison with all other approved PPIs. In addition, ilaprazole metabolism is not significantly influenced by CYP2C19, compared to the available PPIs. Furthermore, the pharmacological characteristics of ilaprazole confer theoretical advantages that are expected to translate into an improved acid control, particularly at night time. However, studies comparing the clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ilaprazole with those of second-generation PPIs are insufficient. Moreover, further investigations assessing the efficacy of ilaprazole in the management of GERD are required.

While absent from the human stomach, cholinergic tuft cells localized to villi and crypts in the small and large intestines. In the biliary tract, they were present in the epithelium of extra-hepatic peribiliary glands, but not observed in the epithelia of the gall bladder and the common duct of the biliary tract. In the pancreas, solitary cholinergic tuft cells were frequently observed in the epithelia of small and medium-size intra- and inter-lobular ducts, while they were absent from acinar cells and from the main pancreatic duct.

Although metabolic syndrome has been linked to erosive oesophagitis (EO), the impact of insulin resistance, the core of the metabolic syndrome, on reflux symptoms remains to be elucidated. Aim To assess the effects of insulin resistance on GERD, including both endoscopic findings and symptoms. Methods A total of 743 sonographic noncirrhotic adult subjects, who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination, completed a gastro-oesophageal reflux questionnaire and had available fasting insulin data were included. Endoscopic findings were classified according to the Los Angeles classification. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was used to evaluate the status of insulin resistance. Univariate and multivariate approaches were used to evaluate the associations between insulin resistance and GERD. Results Older age, male gender, smoking and alcohol consumption increased the prevalence of EO, but not GERD symptoms. A large waist circumference, high fasting blood glucose levels and high number of metabolic syndrome components were associated with increased prevalence of both EO and GERD symptoms, while high blood pressure was associated with increased prevalence of EO only. Moreover, higher scores in the gastro-oesophageal reflux questionnaire were associated with higher HOMA-IR index, and higher HOMA-IR index was associated with increased prevalence of EO (adjusted odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.03–1.26, P = 0.012).

During the lifetime of this journal, much has been learnt about the pathophysiology of reflux disease. Abnormally, frequent acid reflux plays a key role in pathogenesis: this reflux occurs predominantly during transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations. Analysis of the literature suggests that the importance of transient relaxations as the major permissive event for occurrence of acid reflux is currently substantially underestimated. ‘Transient relaxation’ is an inexact descriptor, as this motor programme includes inhibition of the diaphragmatic hiatus and distal oesophageal body circular muscle and contraction of the oesophageal longitudinal muscle. Laxity of the diaphragmatic hiatus and hiatus hernia are probably important factors that increase the probability for acid reflux to occur during transient relaxations and in allowing strain‐induced reflux episodes. The importance of straining and low basal tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter in causing abnormal reflux has probably been overestimated, but these need more investigation. High resolution manometry is the key method for acquisition of important new insights into the normal and disordered mechanics of the antireflux function of the gastro‐oesophageal junction, but as yet, the potential of this technique has been tapped relatively little. In the future, improved understanding of the mechanics of the gastro‐oesophageal junction should lead to improved physical antireflux procedures. Much progress has been made in defining the control of transient relaxations and this has been translated into several promising options for a new class of drug that treats reflux disease by inhibition of transient relaxations. Clinical trials on these agents appear imminent.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01096.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4252825578", "source": "openalex"}

The most important species of nematodes associated with this disease are Haemonchus contortus, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Cooperia punctata, C. pectinata, and Bosicola radiatus. All of these are serious among dairy cattle, but only H. contortus, Bosicola radiatus, and rarely Bunostomum phlebotomum among beef cattle. Ostertagia ostertagi and Trichostrongylus urei are common, but occur in pathogenic numbers only occasionally. Strongyloides papillosus and Moniezia sp., probably M. benedeni, are also discussed. The incidence and prevalence of these parasites are recorded and also the age of the calf when infestation was first detected. Pathogenic infestations are for the most part confined to young cattle 3 to 24 months of age. In dairy cattle, the most susceptible age is from 4 to 12 months; in beef cattle, the majority of outbreaks occur a few months after weaning. Outbreaks are usually seen during the winter and early spring, although on occasion, losses may commence in the autumn and occur also in early summer. Seasonal fluctuations in the populations of these helminths were followed by means of regular faecal egg counts. It was usual for the egg count of each species to increase to a peak, then to decline fairly rapidly, and to remain on a low level during the remainder of the period the animals were under observation, i.e. up to 18 months of age. The ages at which these peaks occurred are recorded and their relationship to the season of birth of the host is discussed. The influence of temperature and rainfall on the prevalence of these helminths has been studied and some preliminary observations are recorded on the development and behaviour of their preparasitic stages in the dung pad. Evidence is brought forward to show that cattle develop a strong resistance to infestation during the first 18 months or so of life. In young animals this reaction depends on exposure to infestation and is somewhat specific in nature in so far as it may be manifested against one species, but populations of other species may continue to increase. Thus, most animals became resistant to infestation with Cooperia spp. at about five months of age, but not to H. contortus and the other species until several months later. This resistance is considered mainly responsible for the light infestations usual among adult cattle. It appears strongest against B. phlebotomum and weakest against H. contortus, which is the most common and prevalent species among adult animals. Outbreaks of parasitic gastro-enteritis are considered to occur under conditions of high larval prevalence and poor nutrition, when resistance against infestation fails to be effective.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1071/ar9520187", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1997083566", "source": "openalex"}

Proton pump inhibitors ( PPI s) reduce gastric acidity; however, as they are unable to control transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations ( TLESR s), the main mechanism for reflux in GERD , they do not abolish reflux. TLESR s occur predominantly in the postprandial period, and they are believed to be triggered by gastric distention. Gastric accommodation ( GA ) is the physiologic response to gastric distention and serves to prevent a rise in gastric wall tension during food intake. We aimed to study the relationship between GA and TLESR s, as they both are triggered by gastric distention. Methods We studied 12 GERD patients (average age 37 years [range 18–62], 7m/5f) and nine healthy volunteers (average age 27 years [range 22–36], 2m/7f) using high resolution manometry‐impedance measurement before and after a mixed meal challenge. We determined the number of TLESR s (with or without reflux) and measured pre‐ and postprandial IGP . The change in IGP between the pre‐ and postprandial period (Δ IGP ) is used as surrogate for GA . We also measured LES pressure before and after the meal and calculated the change (Δ LES p). Key Results There were no statistical differences between pre‐ and postprandial IGP in GERD and healthy volunteers and similarly, there was no significant difference between pre‐ and postprandial LES pressures in GERD patients and healthy volunteers. The number of TLESR s (with or without reflux) was similar in GERD and healthy volunteers. More importantly, we did observe a negative correlation between Δ IGP and the number of TLESR s, irrespective of whether they were associated with reflux or not, in the GERD patients (without reflux r = −0.67, p = 0.017; with reflux r = −0.81, p = 0.0014). The same observations were found in healthy volunteers, where Δ IGP and the number of TLESR s are significantly inversely correlated (without reflux r = −0.87, p = 0.0045; with reflux r = −0.75, p = 0.021). We could not establish a correlation between Δ LES p and the number of TLESR s, neither in GERD patients nor in healthy volunteers. Conclusions &amp; Inferences This is the first study showing a clear negative correlation between Δ IGP and the number of TLESR s, irrespective of whether they were associated with reflux or not, both in GERD patients and in healthy subjects. These results suggest that TLESR s and GA are closely linked, probably through activation of mechanoreceptors involved in triggering of TLESR s.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12305", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158788137", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Costs and outcomes for 12 months were obtained from the first 100 patients in the trial. Detailed costing was performed using resource use data from hospital records and general practitioners' notes. Short-term incremental cost–effectiveness ratios, calculated as the cost difference divided by the effectiveness difference between LNF and PPI therapy, were analysed using net benefit and bootstrap approaches. Long-term cost was examined using sensitivity analyses incorporating published data from other large series. Results The incremental cost of LNF compared with PPI therapy per additional patient returned to a physiologically normal acid score (less than 13·9) at 3 months was £5515 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) £3655 to £13 400) and the incremental cost per point improvement in combined Gastro-Intestinal and Psychological Well-being score at 12 months was £293 (90 per cent c.i. £149 to £5250). On average, LNF cost £2247 (95 per cent c.i. £2020 to £2473) more than PPI therapy in year 1 and broke even in year 8. Break-even was highly sensitive to hospital unit costs but less sensitive to PPI ingestion rate after LNF, LNF reoperation rate, PPI relapse rate, future PPI price, PPI dose escalation and discount rate. Conclusion From a National Health Service perspective, LNF may be cost-saving after 8 years compared with maintenance PPI therapy for the treatment of GORD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.4933", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1972580224", "source": "openalex"}

We have previously identified a genetic locus provisionally named bop that is involved in maltose metabolism and biofilm formation. A transposon insertion into the second gene of the locus ( bopB ) resulted in loss of biofilm formation, while the non-polar deletion of this gene, together with parts of the flanking genes ( bopA and bopC ) resulted in increased biofilm formation. A polar effect of the transposon insertion on a transcriptional regulator ( bopD ) was responsible for the reduced biofilm formation of the transposon mutant. Results The amount of biofilm formed is related to the presence of maltose or glucose in the growth medium. While the wild-type strain was able to produce biofilm in medium containing either glucose or maltose, two mutants of this locus showed opposite effects. When grown in medium containing 1% glucose, the transposon mutant showed reduced biofilm formation (9%), while the deletion mutant produced more biofilm (110%) than the wild-type. When grown in medium containing 1% maltose, the transposon mutant was able to produce more biofilm than the wild-type strain (111%), while the deletion mutant did not produce biofilm (4%). Biofilm formation was not affected by the presence of several other sugar sources. In a gastrointestinal colonization model, the biofilm-negative mutant was delayed in colonization of the mouse intestinal tract. Conclusion The biofilm-positive phenotype of the wild-type strain seems to be associated with colonization of enterococci in the gut and the presence of oligosaccharides in food may influence biofilm formation and therefore colonization of enterococci in the gastrointestinal system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-6-60", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1572099531", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg of rabeprazole once daily during the first treatment period and 40 mg once daily during the second treatment period, or 40 mg during the first treatment period and 20 mg during the second treatment period. The primary efficacy variable was oesophageal acid exposure determined by 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. Acid-reflux time was defined as the percentage of time over 24 h that oesophageal pH was < 4. A dosage was considered effective if reflux time was reduced to < 6%, a number which has been our internal laboratory reference.Both rabeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg, given once daily, normalized reflux time, with decreases of 79% and 92% in acid exposure by day 7. Both dosages also decreased the mean total number of reflux episodes and the number of episodes lasting > 5 min, with no significant differences between dosages for any reflux parameter. Mean gastric pH increased with 20 mg from 1.86 at baseline to 3.71 on day 1 and 4.17 on day 7. Rabeprazole 40 mg once daily increased gastric pH from 2.01 to 4.37 on day 1, and to 4.65 on day 7.

Luminal and tissue concentrations of nitric oxide were measured with an electrode and an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer, respectively. Concentrations of glutathione in the tissue were measured as a marker of nitrosative stress. <b>Results:</b> High concentrations of luminal nitric oxide were generated locally at the gastro-oesophageal junction of nitrite administered rats, reproducing a phenomenon observed in humans. High levels of nitric oxide were also detected largely in the superficial epithelium of the gastro-oesophageal junction. The concentration of tissue glutathione at the gastro-oesophageal junction was significantly lower in nitrite administered rats compared with control rats, whereas that in the distal stomach was similar in the two rat groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> Using an animal model, this study demonstrated that nitric oxide generated in the lumen diffuses into the adjacent gastric tissue to a substantial degree, leading to localised consumption of glutathione in the tissue.

This review provides a summary of the most recent advancements in the pathogenesis of this disease and the new drugs introduced into the market to overcome some of the unmet needs of traditional therapies. Nowadays, the most fruitful diagnostic examinations are 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring, which allows us to separate true NERD from esophageal functional disorders and high-resolution manometry, which helps to exclude the existence of motility disorders sharing the same symptoms of GERD. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) remain the first-choice therapy in the treatment of GERD, but a consistent proportion of these patients continue to experience symptoms despite their intake. These cases pertain mainly to the subpopulation with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and represent very challenging clinical situations, because it is mandatory to understand the reasons for PPI failure. The management of these difficult patients requires necessarily to test them and avoid the use of empiric treatments that are often unsuccessful, costly and potentially dangerous. Recently, several new drugs have been used to increase the defensive properties of this mucosa with promising results in randomized clinical trials.

Twenty patients with small stones in an opacified gallbladder at oral cholecystography and 20 healthy subjects homogeneous for sex, age and body size were studied by ultrasonography to assess gallbladder and gastric emptying simultaneously in response to a standard liquid meal (120 kcal, 11 g fat, 200 mL). The same subjects underwent ambulatory 24-h gastro-oesophageal pH monitoring. Dyspeptic symptoms were specifically investigated using a questionnaire. Gallstone patients had a significantly larger fasting (P < 0.05) and residual (P < 0.005) gallbladder volume with slower (P < 0.05) and less complete (ANOVA, 0.001 < P < 0.05) gastric emptying than healthy control subjects.

View this table: Table 1 Symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) The prevalence of GOR and GORD in infants is between 20–40%, higher than that in children and adults. This high number is associated with the transient immaturity of the oesophagus and the stomach. Features include a short abdominal oesophagus (<1 cm), increased oesophageal clearance, increased number of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations coupled with delayed gastric emptying.4–6 Methods of detection include oesophageal pH monitoring, especially with respiratory manifestations,1,3,7–9 or multiple intraluminal impedance.10–12 The latter allows detection of continued postprandial reflux despite a neutralisation of gastric contents by milk formula. However, there continues to be a wide variation in diagnostic and management strategies even across major neonatal intensive care units in the UK, requiring further work to evaluate appropriateness and effectiveness.13 The principal aims of treatment are to alleviate symptoms, allow healing of the oesophageal mucosa if indicated, manage and prevent any complications and to maintain long-term remission. Treatment strategies and options depend upon the severity of the GORD and may include lifestyle changes or pharmacological and surgical interventions.

The variation of a pressure signal of the gastro-intestinal tract can offer the information of a digestive trouble or some clues of the diseases. In this paper, a pressure monitoring system for the digestive organs of a living pig is presented. This is why a pig's gastro-intestinal tract is very similar as human's. This system concept is to transmit the measured biomedical signals from a transmitter in a living pig to a wireless receiver that is positioned out of body. The integrated solution includes the following parts: (1) the swallow type pressure capsule, (2) the receiving set consisting of a receiver, decoder box, and PC. The merit of the proposed system is that the monitoring system can supply the precise and repeatable pressure in the gastro-intestinal tract. In addition, the design of low power consumption enables it to keep sending reliable signals while the pressure capsule is working in the digestive organ.

No grouping had basal upper oesophageal sphincter pressure that differed significantly from any other. Oesophageal distention due to gastro-oesophageal reflux, which was recognisable as oesophageal common cavity episodes, was associated with augmentation of mean basal upper oesophageal sphincter pressure from 36.5 (SD 18) mm Hg to 48.5 (18) mm Hg (p &lt; 0.0001), irrespective of whether gastro-oesophageal reflux caused oesophageal acidification. Abrupt relaxations of the upper oesophageal sphincter independent of swallowing and lasting up to three seconds occurred during 54% of common cavity episodes. Forty nine per cent of these relaxations occurred within four seconds after the onset of distention. The oesophageal distention caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux is a potent stimulus of transient upper oesophageal sphincter relaxations in children.

We have compared these two therapeutic options in a randomized, clinical trial. Patients and methods Three hundred and ten patients with erosive oesophagitis were enrolled into the trial. After a run-in period when all patients had ≤ 40 mg of omeprazole daily to heal the oesophagitis and relieve symptoms, 155 patients were randomized to continuous omeprazole therapy and 155 to open antireflux surgery, of whom 144 later had an operation. One hundred and thirtynine and 129 in the omeprazole and antireflux surgery groups, respectively, completed the 3-year follow-up. Symptoms, 24-h pH monitoring and endoscopy were used to document the outcome. Quality of life was evaluated by the psychological general well-being (PGWB) index and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). Results Analysis of time to treatment failure (defined as moderate to severe GORD symptoms for ≥ 3 days during the last 7 days, oesophagitis or changed therapy) revealed a significant difference in favour of antireflux surgery (P= 0.0016). Seventeen patients originally submitted to antireflux surgery experienced symptom relapse alone, 14 had oesophagitis at endoscopy and another six had omeprazole for different reasons, leaving 97 patients in clinical remission after 3 years. The corresponding figures in the omeprazole arm were 50 relapses, 18 with oesophagitis, two had surgery, leaving 77 patients in remission. Allowing a dose adjustment in the case of relapse in those on omeprazole therapy to either 40 or 60 mg, the curves describing the failure rates were not significantly different from each other. Quality of life assessment showed a comparable outcome in the two study groups. Conclusion In this randomized multicentre trial we found antireflux surgery to be very efficacious in controlling GORD, a level of control which could also be achieved by omeprazole provided that advantage was taken of the opportunity of adjusting the dose.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol12:879-887", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200012080-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979735006", "source": "openalex"}

Reflux chest pain may occur without heartburn. We explored the response of unexplained chest pain to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in randomised clinical trials (RCTs), differentiating patients with and without objective evidence of GORD. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for RCTs that reported chest pain response to PPIs in patients who had had pH-monitoring and/or endoscopy to differentiate GORD-positive from GORD-negative subpopulations. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Cochran Q and I<sup>2</sup> statistics, and a fixed effect model was applied. Possible publication bias was assessed by Egger9s test. <h3>Results</h3> Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria. All used 24 h pH monitoring and/or endoscopy to define GORD-positive patients and improvement in chest pain to define response (five used ≥50%; one used ≥20%). The therapeutic gain of &gt;50% improvement with PPIs relative to placebo was 56–85% in GORD-positive and 0–17% in GORD-negative patients. The RR of &gt;50% improvement in chest pain with PPI versus placebo was 4.3 (95% CI 2.8 to 6.7; p&lt;0.0001) for GORD-positive and 0.4 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7; p=0.0004) for GORD-negative patients. Concomitant heartburn varied among trials from being an exclusion criterion to being essentially concordant with GORD-positive status. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Unexplained chest pain in patients with endoscopic or pH-monitoring evidence of GORD tends to improve, but not resolve, with PPI therapy, whereas GORD-negative patients have little or no response. Heartburn was a poor predictor of whether patients with chest pain were GORD-positive or GORD-negative by objective testing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2011.241307", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2158362708", "source": "openalex"}

Determination of oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold (AT) with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to objectively measure cardiorespiratory reserve. Oxygen uptake at AT predicts perioperative risk, with low values associated with increased morbidity. Previous studies indicate NAC may have a detrimental impact on cardiorespiratory reserve. Methods CPET was completed by 30 patients before and after a standardised NAC protocol. The ventilatory AT was determined using the V-slope method, and the peak oxygen uptake and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide measured. Median AT before and after chemotherapy was compared using a paired Student's t-test. Results Median oxygen uptake at AT pre- and post-NAC was 13.9±3.1 ml/kg/min and 11.5±2.0 ml/kg/min, respectively. The mean decrease was 2.4 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.85; p<0.001). Median peak oxygen delivery also decreased by 2.17 ml/kg/min (95% CI 1.02-3.84; p=0.001) after NAC. Ventilatory equivalents were unchanged. Conclusions This reduction in AT objectively quantifies a decrease in cardiorespiratory reserve after NAC. Patients with lower cardiorespiratory reserve have increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Preventing this decrease in cardiorespiratory reserve during chemotherapy, or optimising the timing of surgical resection after recovery of AT, may allow perioperative risk-reduction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2016.0135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2345853063", "source": "openalex"}

Described in the 1950s by Norman Barrett, the diagnostic criterion for this lesion has evolved significantly over the last three decades. Endoscopic Barrett's oesophagus requires the recognition of columnar mucosa in the distal oesophagus; documentation of metaplastic tissue is confirmed by random biopsies. Given this changing definition of Barrett's metaplasia, the prevalence rates vary in the literature depending on the diagnostic criteria applied. However, it is generally accepted that approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease will be diagnosed with this condition. There are no population‐based studies on the prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus, but emerging data indicate that it may be equally prevalent in asymptomatic individuals. These studies require confirmation. Although the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing rapidly, it is unclear whether the true incidence of Barrett's oesophagus is increasing at the same time. On the other hand, metaplasia at the gastro‐oesophageal junction appears to be distinct from Barrett's oesophagus, is probably not related to chronic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and is a common finding if routine biopsies are obtained at the gastro‐oesophageal junction.

In Japan, however, GOR-associated chronic cough (GOR-CC) has been rarely reported and its clinical manifestation including frequency of concomitant reflux laryngitis is poorly known. We have analyzed prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients who were diagnosed as having GOR-CC among adult patients with chronic cough (≥ 8 weeks) who visited our asthma and cough clinic over a period of 19 months. Diagnosis of GOR-CC was based on the response of coughing to a proton-pump inhibitor (lansoprazole™) and/or positive results of 24 h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring.

It has become increasingly clear that most reflux episodes occur during TLOSRs and therefore play a key role in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Aim To describe the current knowledge about TLOSRs and its clinical implications. Methods Search of the literature published in English using the PubMed database and relevant abstracts presented at international conventions. Results Several factors influence the rate of TLOSRs including anti-reflux surgery, meal, body position, nutrition, lifestyle and a wide array of neurotransmitters. Ongoing insights in the neurotransmitters responsible for the modulation of TLOSRs, as well as the neural pathways involved in TLOSR induction, have lead to novel therapeutic targets. These therapeutic targets can serve as an add-on therapy in patients with an unsatisfactory response to proton pump inhibitor by inhibiting TLOSRs and its associated reflux events.

Aim: To evaluate the economic and clinical consequences of two different maintenance treatment modalities, administered to 6017 gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients at 451 gastroenterological centres in Italy. Methods: Adult gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients received, at enrolment, an acute treatment of esomeprazole 40 mg/day for 4 weeks and, if successfully treated, were randomized into two maintenance treatment strategies: esomeprazole 20 mg/day or esomeprazole on demand for 6 months. A baseline endoscopy allowed the exclusion of grade II–IV oesophagitis according to Savary–Miller's classification. Burden of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease was measured at baseline by the generic questionnaire Short‐Form 36 and by a disease specific instrument, quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia (QOLRAD), also administered at start and conclusion of maintenance period. Investigators were required to collect patient judgement about the degree of satisfaction with treatment effect on heartburn, with a 7‐point scale. Results: A comparison between Short‐Form 36 scores and the normative source of the Italian general population suggested that symptomatic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients experience a worse quality of life than the general population. At the end of the 4‐week treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg all (QOLRAD) dimensions showed a statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.0001) and clinically meaningful improvement. Satisfaction level towards treatment was reported high in the total enrolled population after acute treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg/day (96.2% satisfied and 64.4% very satisfied).

The Bard EndoCinch plication technique has been reported to improve symptoms and reduce oesophageal acid exposure in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). However, no placebo-controlled studies have been published as yet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the EndoCinch plication technique in a randomized, placebo-controlled setting. Material and methods. Forty-six otherwise healthy subjects with objectively verified GORD requiring regular use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to the EndoCinch plication technique or a sham procedure. Pre- and post-procedure assessments included gastro-oesophageal endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24-h pH recording, quality of life (QoL) assessment and use of PPIs. Results. Reflux-specific symptoms and use of PPIs (total intake as well as number of patients not taking PPIs) improved in both groups at 6 weeks and at 3 and 12 months post-procedure (p<0.05) with an increased improvement in the treatment group at 3 months compared to controls (p<0.05 versus sham). There were no inter- or intra-group differences in endoscopic findings, oesophageal manometry or acid exposure before or at 3 or 12 months post-procedure. Gastro-oesophageal endoscopy showed that 71% and 67% of sutures remained at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Conclusions. Although some short-term effects were achieved, it was found that there were no differences between the treatment and control groups after 12 months and the lack of reduction of oesophageal acid exposure suggests that, in its present form, the EndoCinch plication technique is not to be recommended for use in clinical practice. It is suggested that the lack of long-term effects is primarily due to detachment of the sutures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00365520600735738", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2085777820", "source": "openalex"}

Definitions of increased bilirubin exposure were based on the 95th percentiles in healthy volunteers. The relationship between gastric and oesophageal bilirubin exposure and the correlation with disease severity were analysed.Of the 341 patients with GORD, 130 (38.1 per cent) had increased gastric and 173 (50.7 per cent) had increased oesophageal bilirubin exposure. Of the 173 patients with bile in the oesophagus, 89 (51.4 per cent) had normal and 84 (48.6 per cent) had increased gastric bilirubin exposure. Of these 84 patients, 75 (89 per cent) had oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus (P = 0.003).

Methods In all, 143 patients were examined with pH/MII because of GERD‐symptoms resistant to PPI‐therapy. Patients with pathological pH/MII (group 1) and with normal results (group 2) were identified. Therapy modifications were evaluated after a minimum follow‐up of 3 months.

In animal models, bilateral vagotomy or muscarinic antagonists prevent the increase in airway resistance and the microvascular leakage induced by acute oesophageal acid instillation. The present study investigates lung inflammation and remodelling in an animal model of chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and the effectiveness of pretreatments with tiotropium, atropine and dexamethasone. Mice were exposed to twice-daily intra-oesophageal HCl instillations for 21 days. Exposure to HCl causes: marked infiltration by inflammatory cells of the airways and of peribronchial areas; an increase in epithelial thickness; histological features of interstitial pneumonitis; an increase in cell numbers and in the levels of interleukin-8; and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, as well as of in vitro tracheal contractility. The administration of nebulised tiotropium or intraperitoneal atropine prior to each instillation of HCl, considerably inhibited all these changes. These results indicate a major role of acetylcholine in airway inflammation and remodelling in a GORD model, and demonstrate that tiotropium and atropine can prevent lung inflammation with an effectiveness similar to intraperitoneal dexamethasone, providing additional evidence that anticholinergics might contribute to the control of inflammatory processes in airway diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00139909", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129393618", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to assess the agreement of Endo FLIP ® measurements with clinical and physiologic diagnosis of GERD . Methods Twenty‐one HV and 18 patients with typical GERD symptoms were studied. After gastroscopy, EGJ CSA , and distensibility were measured by Endo FLIP ® . Forty‐eight hour esophageal pH monitoring was then performed by a wireless system. The ability of Endo FLIP ® to discriminate GERD patient and HV s was assessed.

The flock grazed all year on Digitaria decumbens pastures. Faecal and blood samples were taken from kids at 11 months of age and from does at kidding before drenching (week 0) and at weeks 4 and 6 after kidding. Faecal egg counts (FEC) were estimated using a modified McMaster method. Blood samples were used to determine packed cell volume (PCV) and eosinophil concentrations (EOS) values. Haemonchus contortus , Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Oesophagostomum columbianum were the main strongyle species identified in faecal cultures. The data came from 1092 litters obtained from 688 does sired by 142 bucks and 413 dams. Variance and covariance components for genetic and residual effects were estimated with multivariate animal models using the restricted maximum likelihood VCE package. Repeatability and overall heritability for FEC during the post-partum period were 0·17 and 0·10±0·02. The genetic correlations between FEC and PCV were −0·56±0·11 at 4 weeks after kidding and −0·79±0·13 at 6 weeks after kidding. The genetic correlations between FEC and EOS were 0·37±0·15 at 4 weeks after kidding and 0·68±0·17 at 6 weeks after kidding. Hence, does that contributed least to pasture contamination during the postpartum period also had low EOS and high PCV breeding values. The genetic correlations between FEC measured at 11 months of age and FEC during periparturient period ranged from 0·57±0·12 to 0·76±0·16. Therefore, breeding goats for increased resistance during the post-weaning period will lead to a less marked and less persistent rise in doe FEC during early lactation. The epidemiological implications of this selection have to be quantified in terms of lower pasture contamination, lower kid parasitism, and higher milk production of does.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1079/asc200640", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107214401", "source": "openalex"}

Although the causes of these complications are uncertain, studies indicate that erosive oesophagitis may progress to the development of ulcers, strictures and GI bleeding. Pharmacological treatment with proton pump inhibitors is favoured over that with H 2 ‐receptor antagonists for the treatment of strictures. The treatment of strictures is accomplished with dilation and many favour the concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors. Most gastroenterologists are seeing far fewer oesophageal strictures these days since the introduction of proton pump inhibitors. In addition, research has shown that oesophageal complications have a greater impact on patients suffering from night‐time GERD than on those suffering from daytime GERD. Barrett's oesophagus is a significant complication associated with persistent GERD and those at risk generally experience a longer duration of symptoms, especially those with a high degree of severity. In addition, there is a strong relationship between Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This is in part due to the association of obesity and the development of hiatal hernias. Furthermore, endoscopic screening is being used to detect Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma in persons suffering from chronic GERD, even though screening may not have an impact on outcomes (Sharma P, McQuaid K, Dent J, et al.

Here is the first study demonstrating the metabolic impact of infection by a gastro-intestinal pathogen (Brachyspira pilosicoli) and its resolution by antibiotic treatment (tiamulin) on the host (chicken) systemic metabolism and gut microbiota composition using high-resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and 16S rDNA next generation sequencing (NGS). Clear systemic metabolic markers of infections such as glycerol and betaine were identified. Weight loss in untreated animals was in part explained by the observation of a modification of systemic host energy metabolism characterized by the utilization of glycerol as a glucose precursor. However, antibiotic treatment triggered an increased VLDL/HDL ratio in plasma that may contribute to reducing weight loss observed in treated birds. All metabolic responses co-occurred with significant shift of the microbiota upon infection or antibiotic treatment.

Traditional management strategies consist of sequentially intensive therapeutic trials followed by invasive diagnostic testing for nonresponders. A high dose proton pump inhibitor trial (the ‘proton pump inhibitor test’) has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic alternative, and may be an efficient initial approach to patients with GERD symptoms. Aim: To examine the clinical, economic and policy implications of alternative management strategies for GERD. Methods: Decision analysis was used to calculate the clinical and economic outcomes of competing management strategies. The traditional strategy incorporates sequential therapeutic trials with more intensive therapy (‘step‐up’ approach) followed by sequential invasive diagnostic testing of nonresponders. The ‘proton pump inhibitor test’ strategy includes an initial ‘proton pump inhibitor test’ (7 days of omeprazole; 40 mg AM + 20 mg PM daily) followed by less intensive therapeutic trials in those testing positive (‘step‐down’ approach) with sequential invasive diagnostic testing as needed. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement and average wholesale drug prices. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of the published medical literature. Model results are reported as the average and incremental cost‐per‐symptom free patient and cost‐per‐quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) gained. Results: The average cost per patient was $1045 for the traditional step‐up management strategy, compared to $1172 for the ‘proton pump inhibitor test’ and step‐down strategy. The percentage of patients who were symptom‐free at 1 year was 50% for the traditional management strategy compared to 75% for the ‘proton pump inhibitor test’ strategy. The ‘proton pump inhibitor test’ strategy results in QALY gains of 0.01–0.05 depending on the utility estimate employed. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio for the ‘proton pump inhibitor test’ strategy is $510 per additional symptomatic cure over 1 year, and between $2822–$10 160 per QALY gained. The traditional management strategy resulted in a greater than 5‐fold increase in the utilization of upper endoscopy, which was partially offset by a 47% reduction in the use of ambulatory 24‐h oesophageal pH monitoring. The reduced effectiveness of the traditional management strategy may be attributed in part to a 118% increase in the use of ‘high‐dose’ H2RAs while reducing the use of standard dose proton pump inhibitors by only 42% and ‘high‐dose’ proton pump inhibitors by 57%. Conclusions: Based on the results of this analysis, strategies utilizing the initial PPI test followed by a ‘step‐down’ approach may result in improved symptom relief and quality of life over 1 year, and more appropriate utilization of invasive diagnostic testing at a small marginal increase in total costs. These findings warrant a prospective trial comparing these competing management strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2002.01167.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2074266195", "source": "openalex"}

Among responders at 5 years, 44% (56/127) of those randomised to surgery were taking antireflux medication versus 82% (98/119) of those randomised to medical management. Differences in the REFLUX score significantly favoured the randomised surgery group (mean difference 8.5 (95% CI 3.9 to 13.1), P&lt;0.001, at five years). SF-36 and EQ-5D scores also favoured surgery, but were not statistically significant at five years. After fundoplication, 3% (12/364) had surgical treatment for a complication and 4% (16) had subsequent reflux-related operations—most often revision of the wrap. Long term rates of dysphagia, flatulence, and inability to vomit were similar in the two randomised groups. <b>Conclusions</b> After five years, laparoscopic fundoplication continued to provide better relief of GORD symptoms than medical management. Adverse effects of surgery were uncommon and generally observed soon after surgery. A small proportion had re-operations. There was no evidence of long term adverse symptoms caused by surgery. <b>Trial registration</b> Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15517081.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f1908", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2029316036", "source": "openalex"}

A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Primary outcome measures were the requirement for re‐operation, postoperative mortality and postoperative dysphagia. Secondary outcome measures were operative time, length of hospital stay, operative complications and cost. Six randomized trials, of 226 patients, were included in this meta‐analysis. There was no significant difference in requirement for re‐operation or in postoperative dysphagia. There was a significantly reduced total operative time in the laparoscopic group (weighted mean difference = 4.154; 95% CI = 1.932–6.375; p = 0.0002). There was no significant difference between robotic and laparoscopic groups for hospital stay or operative complications. Clinical results from robotic Nissen fundoplication were comparable to the standard laparoscopic approach, but there was associated increased operative time and procedure cost.

Results The prevalence of frequent and occasional gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms was 7.8% and 23.4%, respectively. Compared to subjects with occasional gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms, those with frequent symptoms were older, suffered from more severe symptoms and felt greater impact on daily living, despite a slightly shorter duration of symptoms. These subjects more often sought medical advice. Most of them had treated the last episode of symptoms primarily with a proton‐pump inhibitor and less often with antacids/alginates. The degree of treatment satisfaction was lower in subjects with frequent gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms, in relation to a more frequently observed persistence of symptoms irrespective of the medication used except for proton‐pump inhibitors. Conclusions This survey suggests that subjects complaining of frequent or occasional gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms constitute two distinctive groups.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2264287915", "title": "Gastro-Oesophageal Incompetence in Children", "text": "It is becoming recognised that weakness of the valve mechanism between oesophagus and stomach is a not infrequent cause of vomiting in infancy and early childhood (1, 2). This gastro-oesophageal incompetence allows abnormal reflux of stomach contents into the gullet, a process facilitated by the horizontal posture and fluid diet of infancy. In 1947, Neuhauser and Berenberg described in babies the condition of cardio-oesophageal relaxation or “chalasia,” in which the cardia is normally situated but wide and patulous, permitting easy reflux (3–5). More frequent than this condition, in our experience with children, is the so-called “short oesophagus,” with a small proportion of the stomach situated above the diaphragm. At The Children's Hospital in Birmingham (England), the annual incidence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is about 90 cases. In one year we see about 18 infants under twelve months of age, as well as a number in the older age groups, in whom vomiting is associated with a minor degree of partial thoracic stomach. Thus the condition is of considerable importance. The present paper is based on a study of 115 cases. Pathology The normal valve mechanism between the oesophagus and the stomach may be considered as a triple entity (6–10). One component is the “pinchcock” of the muscular right crus of the diaphragm, which largely constitutes the oesophageal hiatus. Possibly more important is the normal obliquity of insertion of the oesophagus into the stomach. This angle is maintained by the oblique fibres of the stomach wall, looped around the cardiac incisura, and by the sling-like action of the right crus, an action which Allison (10) compares to that of the pubo-rectalis muscle in controlling defaecation. The third and perhaps weakest element is the sphincteric action inherent in the lower end of the oesophagus itself; although there is no anatomical sphincter to be detected here, there is evidence that a functional sphincter exists. In the condition of “short oesophagus” and partial thoracic stomach, the oesophagus has a normal direct course but terminates above the diaphragm by entering the apex of a small loculus of the thoracic stomach. The proportion of the stomach that lies above the diaphragm is variable; in all of the present series of cases it has been estimated at under 15 per cent and often very much less. (More gross herniations are relatively uncommon; they are less apt to produce symptoms due to gastro-oesophageal incompetence and may conceivably have a different aetiology.) The diaphragmatic hiatus is wider than usual and, as a result, the “pinch-cock” action of the right crus is less effective than in the normal individual. Moreover, the direct entry of the oesophagus into the apex of the thoracic stomach means that the second valvular element, the obliquity of insertion, is lost. Only the weak sphincteric action of the oesophagus remains (Fig. 1).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/62.3.351", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2264287915", "source": "openalex"}

It is argued that the best route to successful vaccines will be to seek parasite immunogens which are not normally seen by the host's immune system in the course of infection. Routes to be followed in identifying and characterising such immunogens are proposed and methods for evaluating and maximising the immune response are surveyed. The success of this strategy is illustrated by reference to an experimental molecular vaccine against Haemonchus contortus. Strategies for the use of vaccines and methods for their production in vitro are reviewed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.9.2.495", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1474650545", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Patients formally diagnosed with GERD (n = 929) and undiagnosed subjects with symptoms suggestive of GERD (n = 924) were included. Results: Sixty per cent of diagnosed (mean age: 51.7 years) and 54% of undiagnosed (mean age: 44.3 years) participants were female. Over 50% of participants were overweight or obese. Most respondents consumed alcohol, and one-third were smokers. In total, 78% of diagnosed subjects were currently receiving medication prescribed by their doctor, and 65% were taking over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. The majority (97%) of undiagnosed subjects were taking OTC medication, the most common of which were antacids (78%). Despite medication, 58% of diagnosed and 73% of undiagnosed subjects still experienced GERD symptoms some of the time. Approximately one-third of subjects in each group reported that they ate less than usual, felt generally unwell, were tired/worn out or worried/fearful for the majority of the time because of their GERD symptoms, and around half reported decreased well-being, including reduced work or leisure time productivity. Conclusions: These findings attest to the severity and impact of GERD symptoms, highlighting the need to improve the management of GERD in routine practice.

Our aim was to identify genetic factors associated with GORD. <h3>Patients and methods:</h3> Four separate patient cohorts were analysed using a step-wise approach. (1) Whole genome linkage analysis was performed in 36 families. (2) Candidate genes were tested for GORD association in a trio cohort. (3) Genetic association was replicated in a case–control cohort. We also investigated genetic association to hiatus hernia (HH). (4) Protein expression was analysed in oesophageal biopsies. <h3>Results:</h3> A region on chromosome 2, containing collagen type III alpha 1 (COL3A1), was identified (LOD = 3.3) in families with dominant transmission of GORD, stratified for hiatus hernia (HH). COL3A1 showed significant association with GORD in an independent paediatric trio cohort (p<sub>corr</sub> = 0.003). The association was male specific (p<sub>corr</sub> = 0.018). The COL3A1 association was replicated in an independent adult case control cohort (p<sub>corr</sub> = 0.022).

Thirty‐eight patients with peptic stricture (grade IV oesophagitis) and erosive oesophagitis underwent endoscopic dilatation and were randomized to omeprazole (40 mg daily; n = 20) versus ranitidine (150 mg twice daily; n =18). Healing was proven endoscopically and patients were interviewed for dysphagia relief. Patients were assessed for relapse by endoscopy 6 months later. The follow‐up period was a further 6 months. Patients received maintenance treatment with 40 mg omeprazole daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and the total duration of treatment was 1 year. At 6 months, omeprazole produced a highly significant ( P &lt; 0.0001) greater rate of oesophagitis healing and highly significant ( P &lt; 0.0001) fewer dilatations compared with H 2 ‐receptor antagonists (18 (90%) patients vs five (28%) patients, respectively; 3.5 vs 9.0 dilatations/patient).

We have characterized two families with HSN I associated with cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). From a large Australian family, 27 individuals and from a smaller family, 11 individuals provided clinical information and blood for genetic analysis. Affected individuals had an adult onset of paroxysmal cough, GOR and distal sensory loss. Cough could be triggered by noxious odours or by pressure in the external auditory canal (Arnold's ear-cough reflex). Other features included throat clearing, hoarse voice, cough syncope and sensorineural hearing loss. Neurophysiological and pathological studies demonstrated a sensory axonal neuropathy. Gastric emptying studies were normal, and autonomic function and sweat tests were either normal or showed distal hypohidrosis. Cough was likely to be due to a combination of denervation hypersensitivity of the upper airways and oesophagus, and prominent GOR. Most affected individuals were shown on 24 h ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring to have multiple episodes of GOR, closely temporally associated with coughing. Hoarse voice was probably attributable to acid-induced laryngeal damage, and there was no evidence of vocal cord palsy. No other cause for cough was found on most respiratory or otorhinological studies. Linkage to chromosome 3p22-p24 has been found in both families, with no evidence of linkage to loci for known HSN I, autosomal dominant hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, hereditary GOR or triple A syndrome. These families represent a genetically novel variant of HSN I, with a distinctive cough owing to involvement of the upper aerodigestive tract.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awh653", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2168264946", "source": "openalex"}

A Gastro‐Gastro‐Duodenal Fistula Formation", "text": "Children like to play with many kinds of magnetic construction toys, and their size and shape make them easy to swallow. They can cause serious complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, and fistula formation when multiple magnets are ingested (1–3). Ingestion accidents can occur frequently in young children, especially those with developmental disabilities (1,3). We introduce an extremely unusual case involving the ingestion of multiple construction toy magnets that formed a gastro-gastro-duodenal fistula formation without bowel perforation. A 12-y-old boy with autism presented to the emergency department after vomiting for 4 d. On clinical examination he was afebrile and had no abdominal distension or peritoneal irritation. An abdominal x-ray demonstrated that the multiple radiopaque bar objects arranged in multiple tandem structures were found in the stomach (Fig. 1A). The exact time of the ingestion could not be ascertained because the ingestion was not witnessed and the patient was nonverbal. On showing the x-ray to his parents, they recognized the foreign bodies as parts of a magnetic educational construction toy, and they recalled that 22 rods had disappeared from the toy box. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed under general anesthesia. After repeated EGD with a polypectomy snare, 17 of 22 rods were removed from the stomach. Then it was noticed that 1 rod was deeply embedded in the fundic wall of the gastric angle (Fig. 1B), and its distal end was found in the antral side across the gastric angle. In the antrum this embedded rod was being attracted by another magnetic rod, which had passed through the prepyloric antral wall into the duodenum (Fig. 1C). Hence, these 2 connected magnets had caused the formation of a gastro-gastro-duodenal penetration. This tandem complex of 2 magnets was connected with another tandem complex of 3 pieces, forming a \"T\" shape, in the duodenal bulb (Fig. 1C). A surgery consult was obtained for suspected bowel perforation despite the lack of free air on the x-ray. An operation or EGD removal was scheduled after a further evaluation of the risk of perforation or bleeding. However, an abdominal x-ray taken the next day revealed that the remaining 5 rods were located in the descending colon (Fig. 1D); there was no sign of peritoneal irritation on physical examination and no sign of perforation by radiographic and ultrasonographic evaluations. The patient was treated with a proton pump inhibitor for 14 d, and a follow-up EGD showed that the fistulas in the stomach and duodenum had completely healed.FIG. 1: A, An assemblage of multiple radiopaque bar objects in the stomach. B, A magnetic rod is deeply embedded in the fundic wall, and (C) this protrudes across the gastric angle and attracts another rod in the antrum. This antral rod also penetrates the prepyloric antral wall into the duodenum. D, Five magnetic rods in the descending colon. F indicates fundic wall; A, antral wall; P, pyloric ring.In the present case, the pressure exerted on the respective walls of the bowel because of magnetic attraction and the pressure of gastroduodenal peristalsis probably led to local pressure necrosis and perforation with attracted rods, which dramatically demonstrates the strength of construction toy magnets. After 17 pieces had been endoscopically removed, the remaining magnets appeared to lose the ability to resist gastroduodenal peristalsis, and were probably dislodged from their embedded positions in gastric and duodenal walls. Fortunately, the lesions that had developed in the stomach and duodenum healed without perforation or bleeding. We suggest that warning labels concerning the unique dangers of ingesting magnetic toys be implemented on all packaging.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0b013e31802c6e69", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973608594", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To assess the association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome in a country with high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori. Methods This study was designed as cross-sectional and population-based in Tehran province, Iran. The participants were interviewed by using a valid and reliable questionnaire. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was defined by weekly or more frequent heartburn and/or acid regurgitation. Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rome III. The association between these two disorders was calculated using a statistical model that allows the odds ratio (OR) to be measured. Results A total of 6526 individuals were selected randomly, the response rate was 87.8%. Among the respondents, 178 (3.1%) participants reported both the diseases. The OR of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome together was estimated to be 16.55 (95% confidence interval: 12.85–21.33) indicating significant association between the two diseases. Thirty-four percent of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and 61.5% with irritable bowel syndrome suffered from both diseases. Sex did not have a significant effect on the OR of coexistence. Older participants were statistically more prone to the coexistence of two diseases.

When the tension of the thin wall of the varices exceeds its elastic limit, the varices rupture and bleed. Wall tension is directly proportional to variceal pressure (which is a function of portal pressure) and variceal radius, and inversely related to the thickness of the variceal wall. The above facts explain why a high portal pressure (usually determined by the hepatic venous pressure gradient, or HVPG) and the presence at endoscopy of large varices with red wheals, red spots or diffuse redness on the varices (signalling a reduced wall thickness) correlate with the risk of bleeding.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02109.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2003438586", "source": "openalex"}

We assessed whether GOPG and SHH are predictors of pathological reflux in severely obese patients.Ninety-four consecutive patients were prospectively studied with oesophageal manometry, 24-h pH monitoring, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and barium swallow X-ray. Inspiratory and expiratory GOPGs were measured at manometry testing, whereas SHH was characterized by X-ray. Patients were classified as having physiological or pathological reflux depending on pH monitoring. Patients with oesophagitis but normal pH testing were excluded.Eighty-nine patients composed the study sample (25 men, 38.3+/-11.1 years; BMI 45+/-6.9 kg/m). Sixty-two patients (70%) had pathological reflux, whereas 27 patients (30%) had physiological reflux. Pathological reflux was predicted either by inspiratory GOPG [prevalence ratio (PR) =1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.08; P<0.001] or by expiratory GOPG (PR=1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.11; P=0.001).

There is currently a lack of clear understanding and accepted standards for teaching caring profession students how to provide care remotely. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and assess the ways in which educators can integrate online learning opportunities to help students develop effective caring practices and translate these into today’s remote and virtual care environments. <h3>Methods and analysis</h3> This systematic review will consider diverse quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies of innovative online education initiatives and required technology for caring profession education. Articles will be retrieved from academic databases and limited to articles reporting primary data and published in English within the last 10 years. Data extraction procedures will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline. The methodological quality of all studies will be assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and/or the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Study characteristics will be tabulated and narratively synthesised to integrate and explore relationships within the data. <h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3> No ethics approval is required to conduct this review.

The aim of this multicenter study was to describe the CT2 regimens used, the response rates, and the outcomes of patients treated with various CT2 regimens. METHODS Patients who received CT2 for ABTC at 17 French institutions after the failure of the gemcitabine‐platinum combination were retrospectively studied. Progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated with the Kaplan‐Meier method. Cox models were used for multivariate analyses. RESULTS Among 603 patients who received first‐line chemotherapy (CT1) for ABTC, 196 received CT2: 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) and irinotecan (n = 64), 5‐FU and oxaliplatin (n = 21), 5‐FU and cisplatin (n = 38), 5‐FU or capecitabine (n = 40), sunitinib (n = 10), or other various regimens (n = 23). Among the 186 assessable patients, there were 22 partial responses and 70 stabilizations. After a median follow‐up of 26.4 months, the median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 6.7 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in PFS or OS between CT2 regimens. Fluoropyrimidine‐based doublet chemotherapy was not superior to fluoropyrimidine alone in terms of OS and PFS. In a multivariate analysis, a performance status of 0 to 1, disease control with CT1, and a carbohydrate antigen 19‐9 (CA 19‐9) level ≤ 400 IU/mL were significantly associated with longer PFS and OS. Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 32% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS CT2 might provide disease control for selected patients with ABTC after the failure of gemcitabine‐platinum, but the prognosis remains poor. No particular regimen seems superior to others, and this calls for new treatments. A good performance status, disease control with CT1, and a low level of CA 19‐9 were associated with longer survival.

The possible aflatoxins (AFs) absorption through mucous membranes was also investigated using the vaginal mucosa (Trial 2). In trial 1, seven lactating Holstein dairy cows were given a single oral bolus of a naturally contaminated corn meal assuring an intake of 4.89 mg AFB1, 1.01 mg AFB2, 10.63 mg AFG1 and 0.89 mg AFG2. Blood samples were collected at 0 and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes after treatment. In trial 2 an aflatoxin dosage similar to that of trial 1 was provided through vaginal implant to eight lactating Holstein dairy cows. Blood samples were collected at 0 and 15, 30, 60, 180, 360 minutes after treatment. Individual milk samples of six milkings, one before and five after treatment, were also collected. Plasma and milk samples were analysed by HPLC for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2 and AFM1 contents. In trial 1 AFB1 in plasma peaked (33.6 ng/L) as soon as 20 minutes after treatment. The plasma AFM1 was already detectable at 5 minutes (10.4 ng/L) and peaked at 25 minutes (136.3 ng/L). In trial 2 only AFB1 and AFM1 were detectable in plasma, starting from the first sampling time (15 minutes), with values of 10.7 and 0.5 ng/L, respectively. The AFB1 peaked at 30 minutes (23.9 ng/L). The AFB1 excreted in milk as AFM1 had the highest concentration (203.0 ng/L) in the first milking after treatment and decreased close to the starting values after 36 hours from treatment.The prompt appearance of studied aflatoxins, and their metabolites, in plasma suggests absorption might also take place in mouth or oesophageal mucous membranes, before the rumen compartment.Results support the hypothesis that the cytochrome P450 oxidative system, which is present in these tissues and in leukocytes, could be involved in the conversion of the AFB1 in AFM1. The absorption of AFB1 through the vaginal mucosa confirms the passive diffusion as a probable mechanism for AFB1 absorption.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4081/ijas.2008.53", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991791589", "source": "openalex"}

Results of FISH performed in 42 cases were identical to SISH. Amplification was heterogeneous in 73% of the adenocarcinomas; 24% of the oesophago-gastric carcinomas and 7% of distal stomach tumours were amplified.HER2-positivity is present in a significant proportion of oesophago-gastric adenocarcinomas (24%), but at a lower rate in the distal stomach (7%). Sensitivity for amplification is higher with 4B5 IHC than with SP3. FISH and SISH yield identical results, but assessment is much easier with SISH. Our findings provide important guidance for HER2-testing in gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinomas for patients in whom anti-HER2 treatment is considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.03760.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1487117163", "source": "openalex"}

Various studies have also assessed the relationship between GOR and dental erosion. The authors are not aware of such studies in Nigerians. It is therefore the aims of the present study to estimate the prevalence of GOR; to estimate the prevalence of dental erosion in patients with GORD; to document the oral findings in patients diagnosed with GORD and to compare these findings with previous studies elsewhere. METHODS: A total of 225 subjects comprising of 100 volunteers and 125 patients diagnosed with GORD were involved in this study. History of gastric juice regurgitation and heartburn were recorded. Oral examination to quantify loss of tooth structure was done using the tooth wear index (TWI) designed by Smith and Knight (1984). RESULTS: Twenty patients with GORD presented with dental erosion in the maxillary anterior teeth with TWI scores ranging from 1-3. The prevalence of erosion was found to be statistically significant between GORD patients (16%) and control (5%) (p < 0.05), but not significant between endoscopic diagnostic groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study supports the consideration of dental erosion as the extra-oesophageal manifestation of GORD. However the association between GORD and burning mouth sensation needs more investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6831-5-1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1809891360", "source": "openalex"}

In general, the choice of instrument depends on its purpose. Several investigators, using generic quality of life instruments, have shown that GORD significantly reduces QoL, and its effects are comparable with those of congestive heart failure. However, these generic instruments do not seem to be sensitive enough to measure the effects of treatments on GORD. For this, disease-specific instruments are more appropriate.

Melatonin has been shown to possess potent antioxidant properties in several models of inflammation in mice and rats. In the present study we focused on the possible protective mechanism of melatonin in preventing gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances induced by LPS in mice. In fact, mice treated with LPS showed a reduced gastric emptying of solid beads. Also the geometric center, representing the relative distribution of the solid beads throughout the entire GI tract, was significantly reduced in LPS‐treated mice confirming that sepsis leads to a disturbed GI motility in mice. Melatonin completely reversed the LPS‐induced motility disturbance. This beneficial effect of melatonin is associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation, MAPK activation, NF‐kappaB activation, iNOS transcription and expression and nitrite production in intestinal tissue from septic mice. These results demonstrate that melatonin prevents the LPS‐induced GI disturbances in mice switching off the pro‐oxidant pathways induced by the endotoxin. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose melatonin as a molecule with therapeutic potential for the treatment of systemic inflammation by interfering at the earliest steps of activation of the oxidative and pro‐inflammatory cascade.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-079x.2007.00526.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007671795", "source": "openalex"}

However, polyphenols have very low bioavailability and stability, which make polyphenols a less bioactive compound. Many researchers have indicated that several factors might affect the efficiency and the metabolism (biotransformation) of various polyphenols, which include the gut microbiota, structure, and physical properties as well as its interactions with other dietary nutrients (macromolecules). Hence, this mini-review covers the two-way interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota (interplay) and how polyphenols are metabolized (biotransformation) to produce various polyphenolic metabolites. Moreover, the protective effects of numerous polyphenols and their metabolites against various gastrointestinal disorders/diseases including gastritis, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) like celiac disease (CED) are discussed. For this review, the authors chose only a few popular polyphenols (green tea polyphenol, curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin), and a discussion of their proposed mechanism underpinning the gastroprotection was elaborated with a special focus on clinical evidence. Overall, this contribution would help the general population and science community to identify a potent polyphenol with strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory properties to combat various gut-related diseases or disorders (complementary therapy) along with modified lifestyle pattern and standard gastroprotective drugs.

This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted at 13 GP centres in the UK. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, who had experienced symptoms of reflux oesophagitis within the previous 24 h, and on two other occasions within the. previous week, were recruited into the study. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed after two and four weeks of treatment with sodium alginate or placebo, for symptoms of reflux oesophagitis in the previous 24 h. Patients were required to fill out a diary card twice daily, from which frequency and severity of symptoms were assessed, and the percentage of symptom-free days and nights calculated. Of the 100 patients recruited into the study, 98 received medication (safety population; placebo, n = 50; sodium alginate, n = 48) and 94 were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (placebo, n = 48; sodium alginate, n = 46). For this population, sodium alginate was assessed as significantly superior by both investigators and patients at week two (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) and at week four (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Significantly more patients in the safety population on placebo withdrew from the study (40%) compared with sodium alginate (21%;p = 0.04), due primarily to lack of effect and adverse events. The sodium alginate preparation demonstrated a superior efficacy compared with placebo, which was achieved in a more acceptable volume of medication than a previous standard preparation, Liquid Gaviscon.

Aim To investigate the association between post‐diagnosis ARB use and gastro‐oesophageal cancer survival. Methods We selected a cohort of patients with newly‐diagnosed gastro‐oesophageal cancer between 1998 and 2012 from English cancer registries. We linked to prescription and clinical records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and to death records from the Office for National Statistics. We used time‐dependant Cox‐regression models to calculate hazard ratios ( HR s) comparing gastro‐oesophageal cancer‐specific mortality between post‐diagnosis ARB users and non‐users, after adjusting for demographics, comorbidities and post‐diagnosis aspirin or statin use. Results Our cohort included 5124 gastro‐oesophageal cancer patients, of which 360 used ARB s, and 3345 died due to their gastro‐oesophageal cancer during follow‐up.

Laparoscopic anterior 180° fundoplication (180° LAF) is reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications while obtaining similar control of reflux. The present meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the value of the 2 techniques. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Springerlink, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Platform databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNF and 180° LAF. Data regarding the benefits and adverse results of 2 techniques were extracted and compared using a meta-analysis. Results: Six eligible RCTs comparing LNF (n = 266) and 180° LAF (n = 265) were identified. There were no significant differences between LNF and 180° LAF with regard to operating time, perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, willingness to undergo surgery again, quality of life, postoperative heartburn, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, postoperative DeMeester scores, postoperative lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, postoperative gas-bloating, unable to belch, diarrhea, or overall reoperation. LNF was associated with a higher prevalence of postoperative dysphagia compared with 180° LAF, while 180° LAF was followed by more reoperation for recurrent reflux symptoms. Conclusion: LNF and 180° LAF are equally effective in controlling reflux symptoms and obtain a comparable prevalence of patient satisfaction. 180° LAF can reduce the incidence of postoperative dysphagia while this is offset by a higher risk of reoperation for recurrent symptoms. The risk of recurrent symptoms should need to be balanced against the risk of dysphagia when surgeons choose surgical procedures for each individual with GERD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000008085", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2754423666", "source": "openalex"}

The study also assessed the effectiveness of rabeprazole in preventing GORD symptom recurrence and reductions in quality of life. Design/methods The trial used a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design and enrolled 288 male and female outpatients of ≥ 18 years of age. Patients were assigned to treatment with either rabeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg once daily in the morning (QAM) or placebo and followed for 52 weeks. Results Both rabeprazole doses were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing endoscopically demonstrable GORD relapse (P< 0.001 versus placebo).

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is said to be the causative factor in up to 41% of adults with chronic cough. However cough and GORD are common ailments and their co‐existence by chance is high. Also cough can induce reflux episodes. Treatment for GORD includes conservative measures (diet manipulation), pharmaceutical therapy (motility or prokinetic agents, H2 antagonist and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) and fundoplication. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of GORD treatment on chronic cough in children and adults with GORD and prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease i.e. non‐specific chronic cough. Search methods The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The date of last search was 7th April 2005. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials on GORD treatment for cough in children and adults without primary lung disease. Data collection and analysis Results of searches were reviewed against pre‐determined criteria for inclusion. Two independent reviewers selected, extracted and assessed data for inclusion. Authors were contacted for further information. Data was analysed as \"intention to treat\" as well as \"treatment received\". Paediatric and adults data were considered separately. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Main results 12 studies (3 paediatric, 9 adults) were included. Data from five were available for analysis. None of the paediatric studies could be included in meta‐analysis. In adults, analysis on use of H2 antagonist, motility agents and conservative treatment for GORD were not possible (from lack of data) and there were no controlled studies on fundoplication as an intervention. Five adult studies comparing PPI (2‐3 months) to placebo were analysed for various outcomes in the meta‐analysis. Enrolment of subjects for two studies were primarily from medical clinics and another 3 studies were otolaryngeal clinic patients. Using \"intention to treat\", pooled data from 3 studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough. Pooled data revealed no significant improvement in cough outcomes (end of trial or change in cough scores). Significant differences were only found in sensitivity analysis. A significant improvement in change of cough scores was found in end of intervention (2‐3 months) in those receiving PPI with a standardised mean difference of ‐0.41 (95%CI ‐0.75, ‐0.07) using GIV analysis on cross over trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after 5 days to 2 weeks of treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found between studies using omeprazole and other PPIs. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to definitely conclude that GORD treatment with PPI is beneficial for cough associated with GORD in adults. The beneficial effect was only seen in sub‐analysis and its effect was small. The optimal duration of such a trial of therapy to evaluate response could not be ascertained in the meta‐analysis although two RCTs reported significant change by 2 weeks of therapy. Clinicians should be cognisant of a period (natural resolution with time) and placebo effect in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure. Data in children are inconclusive. Future paediatric and adult studies are needed whereby studies should be double blind, randomised controlled, parallel design, using treatments for at least two months, with validated subjective and objective cough outcomes and include ascertainment of time to respond as well as assessment of acid and/or non acid reflux whilst on therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd004823.pub2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4246728559", "source": "openalex"}

The rationale is that intra-abdominal drainage enhances early detection of complications (gastro-intestinal leakage, hemorrhage, bile leak), prevents collection of fluid or pus, reduces morbidity and mortality, and decreases the duration of hospital stay. However, dogmatic attitudes favoring systematic drain placement should be questioned. The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence supporting systematic use of prophylactic abdominal drainage following gastrectomy, pancreatectomy, liver resection, and rectal resection. Based on this review of the literature: (i) there was no evidence in favor of intra-peritoneal drainage following total or sub-total gastrectomy with respect to morbidity-mortality, nor was it helpful in the diagnosis or management of leakage, however the level of evidence is low, (ii) following pancreatic resection, data are conflicting but, overall, suggest that the absence of drainage is prejudicial, and support the notion that short-term drainage is better than long-term drainage, (iii) after liver resection without hepatico-intestinal anastomosis, high level evidence supports that there is no need for abdominal drainage, and (iv) following rectal resection, data are insufficient to establish recommendations. However, results from the French multicenter randomized controlled trial GRECCAR5 (NCT01269567) should provide new evidence this coming year. Accumulating data support that systematic drainage of the abdominal cavity in digestive surgery is a non-beneficial and obsolete practice, except following pancreatectomy where the consensus appears to indicate the usefulness of short-term drainage. While the level of evidence is high for liver resections, new randomized controlled trials are awaited regarding gastric, pancreatic and rectal surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2015.09.008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1847472555", "source": "openalex"}

Complications were more common after thoracoabdominal resection (101 in 81 patients) than after laparotomy/gastrectomy (108 in 132 patients). The most common complication in both groups was pneumonia (29/132, 22%, compared with 22/81, 27%), but this could be predicted only in the group that underwent thoracoabdominal resection. Significant risk factors in this group were: an abnormal chest radiograph preoperatively (p = 0.0007), a high risk predicted by the anaesthetist (p = 0.005), and signs of obstruction on spirometry (p = 0.002).

We therefore studied the genetic parameters of AMEn (Apparent metabolisable energy corrected for zero nitrogen balance), feed efficiency, and GIT traits in chickens.Genetic parameters were estimated for 630 broiler chickens of the eighth generation of a divergent selection experiment on AMEn. Birds were reared until 23 d of age and fed a wheat-based diet. The traits measured were body weight (BW), feed conversion ratio (FCR), AMEn, weights of crop, liver, gizzard and proventriculus, and weight, length and density of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.The heritability estimates of BW, FCR and AMEn were moderate.

When treatment is required, Cisapride, a pro‐kinetic agent, has been commonly prescribed for the symptomatic management of GOR. There have been recent reports of possibly serious adverse events, e.g. an increased QTc interval, cardiac arrhythmias, and death, associated with the use of Cisapride. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of Cisapride for symptoms of GOR compared with placebo or any other non‐surgical treatments. Search methods Searches were conducted of the Cochrane Central Trials Register and the specialised Trials register of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group, MEDLINE and Embase up till April 2002. Reference lists of relevant review articles and identified trials were scrutinised and forward citation searches were performed in the Science Citation Index on all trials identified. The searches were re‐run in August 2003, May 2004, June 2005 and June 2006 and no new trials were found. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared oral Cisapride therapy with placebo or with other non‐surgical treatments for children with a diagnosis of GOR were included. Only studies in which Cisapride was administered orally for a minimum of one week and which documented at least one of the primary outcomes were included. We excluded trials in which the majority of participants were aged less than 28 days. Data collection and analysis The primary outcomes were defined as a change in symptoms at the end of treatment, presence of adverse events, occurrence of clinical complications, and weight gain. The secondary outcomes included physiological measures of GOR or histological evidence of oesophagitis. We dichotomised symptoms into 'same or worse' vs 'improved' and calculated summary odds ratios. Continuous measures of GOR (e.g. reflux index) were summarised as a weighted mean difference. All outcomes were analysed using a random effects method. Main results Searches identified nine trials which met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials compared Cisapride with placebo, of which seven (236 participants) reported data on symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux, and one reported data on the QTc interval (49 patients). The odds ratio for 'same or worse' vs 'improved symptoms' at the end of treatment of 0.34 (95%CI 0.10, 1.19) did not show a statistically significant difference between the two interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies and the funnel plot suggested publication bias. In a sensitivity analysis, the definition of outcomes was changed to 'any symptoms' vs 'no symptoms'. This resulted in the exclusion of three trials (one of them the largest, best quality trial). The resulting pooled odds ratio showed a significant effect of Cisapride (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.08, 0.44). Five studies reported adverse events. Four reported adverse events (mainly diarrhoea) but the difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.80, 95%CI 0.87, 3.70). One trial found no difference in the QTc after 3 to 8 weeks of treatment. Cisapride was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the reflux index (weighted mean difference ‐6.49, 95%CI ‐10.13, ‐2.85), but as reflux index and clinical symptoms are poorly correlated, the clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Other measures of oesophageal pH monitoring did not reach significance. One included study compared Cisapride with Gaviscon (or Gaviscon and Carobel). The odds ratio for 'same or worse' vs 'improvement' in the Cisapride group compared with Gaviscon was 3.26 (95%CI 0.93‐11.38). Authors' conclusions We found no clear evidence that Cisapride reduces symptoms of GOR. The results suggested substantial publication bias favouring studies showing a positive effect of Cisapride. This finding is supported by the report of one unpublished multi‐centre study of 134 patients, which was reported to show no evidence of a significant effect of Cisapride. Due to reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death, from July 2000, cisapride was restricted to a limited access programme supervised by a paediatric gastrologist in the USA and in Europe, to patients treated within a clinical trial or safety study or registry programme.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd002300", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4251413311", "source": "openalex"}

Laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication (LTF) is reported to be as effective as LNF but to be associated with a lower incidence of post‐operative dysphagia. This meta‐analysis was performed to compare the two techniques with respect to reflux control and associated complications, particularly dysphagia. Methods: Pubmed, Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Library were searched. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LNF and LTF were included. Outcomes evaluated were occurrences of heartburn and associated complications (e.g. dysphagia) and degree of patient's satisfaction at early (three to six months) and later (one to three years) post‐operative periods. Results: Of 939 patients in seven RCTs, 478 received LNF and 461 received LTF. For both groups, control of reflux was good and occurrence of heartburn were similar. A lower incidence of post‐operative dysphagia for both early and later post‐operative periods was observed for the LTF group. Patient's satisfaction following either procedure was similar. Conclusion: LNF and LTF are both safe and effective. LTF is truly associated with a lower occurrence of dysphagia.

For example, all current proton pump inhibitors have a relatively slow onset of action and their activity is limited mainly to the post‐prandial period with far less effective inhibition of nocturnal acid secretion. In order to achieve more potent, rapid and sustained acid inhibition several compounds are currently under development, such as new proton pump inhibitors with a prolonged plasma half‐life, potassium competitive ATPase blockers (PCABs), histamine H 3 agonists, and gastrin antagonists. Acid suppression does not, however, cure the disease and relapses are frequently observed after discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor therapy. Among the different abnormalities involved in the pathophysiology of this multifactorial disease, transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations represent the major mechanism responsible for episodes of reflux. Baclofen, the prototype GABA B receptor agonist, is one of the most potent inhibitors of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations identified. To date the transfer of these relaxation‐controlling pharmacological agents into clinical practice has however been hampered by the occurrence of unacceptable side effects. Beside “anti‐relaxation therapy”, the potential of novel prokinetics such as motilin agonists has been explored, especially since the motilin receptor has been cloned. Thus far the broad therapeutic value of prokinetics in GORD does, however, seem very limited in terms of efficacy with respect to oesophageal motility and acid exposure. Lastly, further research is necessary to better understand the complex mechanisms involved in oesophageal sensitivity and mucosal defence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-7843.2005.pto_273.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2040040183", "source": "openalex"}

Annually, a random sample of around 1000 GPs recorded details for 100 consecutive visits with consenting, unidentified patients. <h3>Outcome measures</h3> Diagnoses of reflux and GORD and their management including prescribing of acid-suppressant medicines (proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine receptor antagonists (H2RAs)) and counselling, advice or education. <h3>Results</h3> Of all infants' visits, 512 (2.7%) included a diagnosis of reflux (n=413, 2.2%) or GORD (n=99, 0.5%). From 2006 to 2016, diagnostic rates decreased for reflux and increased for GORD. Prescribing of acid suppressants occurred in 43.6% visits for reflux and 48.5% visits for GORD, similar to rates of counselling, advice or education (reflux: 38.5%, GORD: 43.4% of visits). Prescribing of PPIs increased (statistically significant only for visits for reflux), while prescribing of H2RAs decreased. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Overprescribing of acid suppressants to infants may be occurring. In infants, acid-suppressant medicines are no better than placebo and may have significant negative side effects; however, guidelines are inconsistent.

Many different factors may significantly influence the absorption of LT4, including: interval between the ingestion of the drug and the last meal, eating habits, and different functional and organic pathologies of the gastro-intestinal tract. The main purpose of this paper is to review and systematise the available literature on the subject of the influence of different malabsorption syndromes on the effectiveness of LT4 preparations. The need to use high LT4 doses in the substitutional treatment of hypothyroidism is often the very first sign of one of the pathologies that are connected with malabsorption syndrome, which might have been asymptomatic and undiagnosed previously. Patients who require more than 2 μg/kg body weight of LT4 per day, with constantly increased thyrotropin level, should be diagnosed with the suspicion of pseudomalabsorption or real absorption disorder. An LT4 absorption test, using high doses of LT4, may be useful in the diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption. After excluding non-compliance, the differential diagnosis should include such disorders as lactose intolerance, coeliac disease, atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease, and parasite infection. Where there is a diagnosis of lactose intolerance, both a low lactose diet and a lactose-free LT4 preparation should be administered to restore euthyroidism or make it possible to decrease the dose of the LT4 preparation. In coeliac disease, a gluten-free diet usually allows a normalisation of the need for LT4, as do eradication of the H. pylori infection or parasite colonisation. In cases of atrophic gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease, treating the underlying diseases and regaining the state of remission may improve the absorption of LT4. In patients after gastro-intestinal tract surgery, a dose of LT4 higher than that typically used is needed to restore euthyroidism.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2418623560", "source": "openalex"}

Aim: To evaluate whether the amount of postprandial gastro‐oesophageal reflux is also related to the calorie content of a meal, a second parameter that will be reduced by avoidance of the ingestion of large meals. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (six female, 19–31 years) received two solid–liquid meals with either 842 kcal (solid 582 kcal, liquid 260 kcal) or 582 kcal (31% reduction) in a randomized order. The nutritional components (10% fat, 76% carbohydrates, 14% protein) and the volume of the meals were identical in both meals. The lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was measured continuously in the first postprandial hour with a Dent sleeve, and pH‐metry was performed for 3 h postprandially with a glass electrode in the distal oesophagus. Blinded to the type of ingested meal, we calculated the mean lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, the frequency of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, the number of reflux episodes, and the fraction of time for which pH &lt; 4. Results: A similar decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was observed after ingestion of the high calorie meal (median 10.9 mmHg, range 4.8–16.7 mmHg) and low calorie meal (median 9.9 mmHg, range 3.9–18.4 mmHg). No difference in the number of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (high calorie: median 9 per hour, range 5–13 per hour; low calorie: median 7 per hour, range 0–14 per hour) and of reflux episodes (high calorie: median 12 in 3 h, range 3–22 in 3 h; low calorie: median 12 in 3 h, range 3–30 in 3 h) was registered after intake of both types of meal. Additionally, no difference was identified regarding the fraction of time for which pH &lt; 4 between the high calorie (mean 2.3%, 0.2–23.7%) and low calorie meal (3.3%, 0.5–17.8%). Conclusion: Reducing the caloric density of a meal neither influences postprandial lower oesophageal sphincter pressure nor decreases gastro‐oesophageal reflux in healthy volunteers.

In contrast, EBV has not been reported to play a major role in esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) and adenocarcinomas of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ). We report our experiences on EBV in collections of gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas from two surgical centers and discuss the current state of research in this field. Tumor samples from 465 primary resected gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas (118 EAC, 73 GEJ and 274 GC) were investigated. Presence of EBV was determined by EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBER) in situ hybridization. Results were correlated with pathologic parameters (UICC pTNM category, Her2 status, tumor grading) and survival. EBER positivity was observed in 14 cases. None of the EAC were positive for EBER. In contrast, we observed EBER positivity in 2/73 adenocarcinomas of the GEJ (2.7%) and 12/274 GC (4.4%). These were of intestinal type (7 cases) or unclassifiable (6 cases), while only one case was of diffuse type according to the Lauren classification. No association between EBV and pT, pN or tumor grading was found, neither was there a correlation with clinical outcome. None of the EBER positive cases were Her2 positive. In conclusion, EBV does not seem to play a role in the carcinogenesis of EAC. Moreover adenocarcinomas of the GEJ show lower rates of EBV positivity compared to GC. Our data only partially correlate with previous reports from the literature. This highlights the need for further research on this distinct entity. Recent reports, however, have identified specific epigenetic and genetic alterations in EBV-associated GC, which might lead to a distinct treatment approach for this specific subtype of GC in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2015.00073", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1972282866", "source": "openalex"}

A similar number of cyclical periods of antroduodenal motor activity (GOR 94 and control 91) was studied in each group. Mean antral cycle times and the frequency of occurrence of related proximal duodenal contractions (antroduodenal coordination) were similar. Transpyloric fluid movement occurred as a number of discrete episodes in each cycle. Gastroduodenal flow was more frequent in the GOR group (mean 2.7 +/- 0.4 episodes per cycle) than in controls (mean 1.7 +/- 0.3). The mean duration of these episodes in both groups was similar at around 2.5 seconds. Duodenogastric flow (reflux) was observed in many cycles (GOR 63%; controls 54%), but there was no difference in the mean number of episodes per cycle (GOR 0.79; control 0.74) or their mean duration (two seconds for both). Transpyloric fluid flow only occurs when a pressure gradient is created across the open pylorus.

The cellular sites could, as a rule, be easily visualized light-microscopically by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) immunocytochemical procedure, using guinea-pig and rabbit antisera against synthetic SRIF. The standard Hellerström-Hellman technique, used to detect argyrophil SRIF-storing D cells, failed to visualize the SRIF cells in the GEP endocrine system of the tunicate and of the jaw-less fish. Moreover, the results confirmed the previous description that this technique only exceptionally (and sometimes only after further modifications) gave positive results when applied to the GEP endocrine system of bony fish, amphibians, and reptiles. In cartilaginous fish, however, it worked adequately and confirmed the radioimmunological and immunocytochemical observations.In the mucosa of the alimentary tract and in the parenchyma of its associated glands of one echinoderm and two pelecypod molluscs and one crustacean arthropod no signs of the occurrence of SRIF-storing cells were observed using the three correlated procedures. In several of these tissues, signs of the occurrence of insulin-producing cells had previously been observed. Thus, SRIF seems to appear at a later evolutionary stage than insulin.The principal islets (Brockmann corpusles) of the marine teleost fish, Cottus scorpius, had the highest concentrations of radioimmunoassayable SRIF of all the GEP organs and tissues investigated, viz. about 200ng/mg wet weight.

When 24-h pH-metry formed the basis for diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the sensitivity for ES at abdominal compression was 64%, but no statistically significant differences were found among erect refluxers (ER), supine refluxers (SR), and combined refluxers (CR). Only 4% of the GERD patients had pathologic oesophageal clearing at ES. The more severe the macroscopic oesophagitis found by OE, the more pronounced were the abnormal findings at 24-h pH-metry and at ES with abdominal compression. Increased postprandial reflux was associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux and hiatal hernia at ES with abdominal compression and the most severe form of oesophagitis, respectively. It was concluded that ES had too low sensitivity to be recommended as a screening test for GERD. Nevertheless, the specificity of 76% can to some extent help us to rule out GERD in patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529108996505", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114488968", "source": "openalex"}

This paper reports the effects of condensed tannins (CT) extracted from Lotus pedunculatus, Lotus corniculatus, sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) and sainfoin (Onobrychus viciifolia) on in vitro viability of eggs, first stage larvae (L1) and third stage larvae (L3) of the sheep nematode, Trichostrongylus colubriformis. When in vitro assays contained CT in a similar concentrations to that in the digestive tract of sheep fed these forages, the CT reduced the development of eggs to L3 larvae as well as the proportion of eggs hatching. The CT also reduced the development of L1 larvae to L3 larvae and decreased the motility of L3 larvae when assessed by the larval migration inhibition assay and this may reduce their infective capacity in vivo. If these forages are fed to grazing sheep, then it may be possible to reduce contamination of pasture with infective larvae and reduce our dependence on anthelmintics as the principal method for controlling internal parasites.

These lambs were the progeny of 41 Dorper and 35 Red Maasai rams. Live weights (LWT), blood packed cell volume (PCV) and faecal egg counts (FEC) were recorded at 1- to 2-monthly intervals from birth until the lambs were about one year of age. Red Maasai were more resistant and resilient post weaning to infections with GI nematodes than Dorper lambs as shown by their significantly lower FEC and their significantly higher PCV, respectively. An increasing proportion of Red Maasai genes in the crossbred lambs was associated with decreased FEC and higher PCV, but there was no heterosis for logarithm-transformed FEC (LFEC) or PCV.

Patients with supra‐oesophageal manifestations of GERD may report symptoms involving the pulmonary, otolaryngologic or pharyngeal systems. Endoscopy is often negative and therefore of limited diagnostic value in these patients, and while laryngoscopy and 24 h dual‐channel intra‐oesophageal pH‐metry may have greater yields they are costly, invasive and time‐consuming. Therefore, a trial of proton pump inhibitor therapy is now widely considered a first‐line diagnostic test in those with suspected GERD‐induced supra‐oesophageal symptoms. The dose as well as duration of the proton pump inhibitor trial is dependent upon a patient's presenting symptoms. For example, GERD‐related non‐cardiac chest pain may be relieved with a short‐term (e.g. 1 week) treatment with standard doses of a proton pump inhibitor. The use of high‐dose twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy for an extended period (e.g. 2–3 months) may be required before any discernible improvement in pulmonary symptoms or pharyngo‐laryngitis is noted. Patients who do not experience symptom improvement following a proton pump inhibitor trial may require further diagnostic evaluations including 24 h oesophageal pH studies, while on acid anti‐secretory therapy, to establish the absence of persistent acid reflux. The role of anti‐reflux surgical or endoscopic interventions in those with supra‐oesophageal manifestations of GERD remains to be established.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0953-0673.2004.01836.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2075924860", "source": "openalex"}

Thirteen (13) species of gastro-intestinal parasites were identified, of them 4 species were trematodes (Fasciola gigantica (25.40%), Paramphistomum cervi (41.40%), Schistosoma indicum (5.80%), Schistosoma spindale (2.40%)); 6 species of nematodes (Haemonchus contortus (9.70%), Toxocara vitulorum (3.0%), Trichuris ovis (3.0%), Strongyles (0.80%), Strongyloides papillosus (2.0%), Capillaria sp. (0.40%)), 1 species of cestode (Moniezia expansa (0.60%)), and 2 species protozoa (Eimeria zuernii (7.0%) and Buxtonella sulcata (37.40%)). In this study, prevalence of gastro-intestinal parasites in relation to age, sex, seasonal dynamics and nutritional status of the animal were studied. Significantly higher prevalence was observed in summer (84.30%) followed by rainy (83.62%) and winter (81.16%). Females (87.53%) were 1.20 times more susceptible to gastro- intestinal parasitic infection than males (84.37%). In age group, significantly higher prevalence was in adult (88.81%) followed by young (83.45%) and calves (68.05%). In nutritional status group, significantly higher rate of infection was in poor conditioned buffalo (96.61%) than that in medium body conditioned buffalo (75.51%). Egg per gram/ cyst per gram/oocyst per gram of feces was also determined and ranged from 100–1,600. The present study has not emphasized on the losses due to parasitic infection. So it is necessary to assess the economic losses due to parasitic infections and to find out effective control strategies against it.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.56093/ijans.v84i3.38696", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1456071731", "source": "openalex"}

Recognition of this patient group, however, is difficult. The Carlsson–Dent gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease questionnaire was developed to justify the selection of primary care patients for empirical proton pump inhibitor treatment. Aim : To evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of the Carlsson–Dent questionnaire in a primary care population. Methods : A prospective, open‐label, multi‐centre diagnostic prevalence study was conducted amongst primary care adults with reflux symptoms. All patients completed the questionnaire and underwent gastroscopy. If no abnormalities were found, the patients were prescribed 2 weeks of treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the overall discriminative value of the questionnaire. Diagnostic test characteristics of both the cut‐off score (total diagnostic score) in the questionnaire and the physician's provisional classification were measured using oesophagitis and omeprazole treatment success as the reference tests. Results : Of the 536 patients included, 515 underwent endoscopy. No abnormalities were found in 286 (55%). Omeprazole treatment success occurred more frequently in patients with a total diagnostic score of &gt; 7 and oesophagitis II–IV in patients with a total diagnostic score of &gt; 9. The diagnostic test characteristics of the questionnaire were comparable with those of the physician's provisional classification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve did not exceed 0.65. Kappa values for observer agreement with the gold standard were far below 0.4. Conclusion : The diagnostic performance of this version of the Carlsson–Dent questionnaire was poor. It equalled the physician's clinical judgement and therefore its value for clinical use is limited.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.01549.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078928373", "source": "openalex"}

One single reflux episode lasting 15-30 min occurred in two, and one lasting 30-45 min was recorded in one. The total duration of low pH is expressed in percentages of the total time of recording and is dependent on the criteria used for low pH.

The aim of this study was to compare the pressure contributions from the three sphincteric components in normal subjects with those in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) patients. A simultaneous endoluminal ultrasound and manometry catheter was pulled through the OGS in 15 healthy volunteers and seven patients with symptomatic GORD, before and after administration of atropine. Pre-atropine (complete muscle tone), postatropine (non-muscarinic muscle tone plus residual muscarinic tone) and subtracted (pure muscarinic muscle tone) pressure contributions to the sphincter were averaged after referencing spatially to the right crural diaphragm and the pull-through start position. In the normal group, the atropine-resistant and atropine-attenuated pressures identified the crural and two smooth muscle sphincteric components respectively. The subtraction pressure curve contained proximal and distal peaks. The proximal component moved with the crural sling between full inspiration and full expiration and the distal component coincided with the gastric sling-clasp fibre muscle complex. The subtraction curve in the GORD patients contained only a single pressure peak that moved with the crural sphincter, while the distal pressure peak of the intrinsic muscle component, which was previously recognized in the normal subjects, was absent. We hypothesize that the distal muscarinic smooth muscle pressure component (gastric sling/clasp muscle fibre component) is defective in GORD patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2009.01294.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171116121", "source": "openalex"}

Besides other barriers, the enzymatic barrier caused by gastro-intestinal (GI) proteolytic enzymes is believed to be responsible for negligible teriparatide oral bioavailability. It was therefore the aim of the study to evaluate the stability of teriparatide towards a variety of GI proteases under physiological conditions. Results indicate that teriparatide is entirely degraded by trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin within 5 min. In contrast, even after 3 h of incubation with elastase about 85% of undegraded teriparatide could still be detected. Within an incubation period of 3 h in the presence of rat small intestinal mucosa, approximately half of the teriparatide was degraded. Experiments with isolated aminopeptidase N demonstrated that this membrane bound peptidase is primarily involved in the degradation process.

Materials and Methods: We performed an operation to force gastro‐duodenal contents reflux in male Wistar rats, and examined the teeth in the reflux rats at 15 or 30 weeks postoperatively. Dental erosion was evaluated based on a slightly modified index from a previous report. Estimation of pH was employed in the oesophageal and gastric contents. Results: Macroscopically, dental erosion was only detected in the reflux rats. Histopathologically, dentin exposure was detected in three of the seven cases after 30 weeks. Alveolar bone destruction and osteomyelitis were also noted in severe cases. The pH of the oesophageal and stomach contents was 6.93 ± 0.15 and 3.7 ± 0.39, respectively. Conclusions: We confirmed the relationship between dental erosion and GORD. First step of dental erosion caused by GORD is the loss of surface enamel induced by regurgitation of an acidic liquid and acidic gas. Subsequently, further destruction of dental hard tissues and tooth supporting structure is accelerated by mixed juice with gastric and duodenal contents.

A similar trend is occurring in oesophageal cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma on the decline and adenocarcinoma on the rise, possibly due to the dramatic increase in GORD. The true clinical spectrum of these disorders, however, is only recently becoming evident: 60% of patients with GORD do not have detectable evidence of oesophagitis; they can be classified as having non-erosive or negative-endoscopy reflux disease (NERD). In this subgroup, a significant proportion will also manifest normal acid exposure on 24-h pH monitoring. Further, patients with NERD appear to be somewhat less responsive to gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors. These differences, combined with the concept of the 'tender' oesophagus and the frequent presence of dyspeptic symptoms in patients with NERD, have important therapeutic implications. Therefore, considering the marked overlap in these disorders, is it realistic or clinically relevant to distinguish the entities of GORD, NERD, and functional dyspepsia? This dilemma has led to general guidelines: should heartburn predominate, treat as GORD; if dyspepsia predominates, treat as functional dyspepsia.

The use of this test is aimed at improving the association between patients’ extraoesophageal symptoms and oesophageal or hypopharyngeal acid reflux events. However, the clinical utility of pH monitoring in this patient population remains controversial. Important clinical questions in this area include: does the presence of abnormal oesophageal acid reflux suggest a causal association between patients’ extraoesophageal symptoms and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease?

The author points out that the gastrointestinal tract differs from other systems of the body in that there are very few gastrointestinal disorders whose pattern of heredity is obviously due to single genes of good penetrance and regular expression. More frequently, the inheritance appears to be polygenic. In these circumstances, the best one can do is to marshall all of the available evidence for the involvement of genetic factors in the etiology and to analyze it critically. This the author has done admirably. However, this book is very much more than just an enumeration of the many family and twin studies on diseases of the digestive tract. In considering the various diseases on which genetic studies have been done, the author does not limit himself merely to listing the evidence for or against any genetic pattern; he uses the genetic information to shed more light on the pathogenesis of these diseases. Thus he deals with the relationship between re¬ gional enteritis and ulcerative co¬ litis: his evaluation of the genetic studies that have been done on both diseases lead him to believe that these two diseases occur together too frequently in the same families to be due to chance. He concludes that liability to the two diseases is probably determined by two poly¬ genic systems that may have a number of genes in common. The first chapter is perhaps the most interesting of all. In it, the author deals with the genetics of certain physiological processes of the gastrointestinal tract—mainly the secretion and content of saliva and gastric juice and their relation¬ ship to blood groups. Throughout the book, the studies dealing with the relationship between the blood group substances and a host of gas¬ trointestinal diseases are critically analyzed.

Known peripheral sites of expression include the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the pancreas, and the adrenal glands. In rodent pancreas CART is expressed both in islet endocrine cells and in nerve fibers, some of which innervate the islets. Recent data show that CART is a regulator of islet hormone secretion, and that CART null mutant mice have islet dysfunction. CART also effects GI motility, mainly via central routes. In addition, CART participates in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis. We investigated CART expression in porcine pancreas, GI-tract, adrenal glands, and thyroid gland using immunocytochemistry.CART immunoreactive (IR) nerve cell bodies and fibers were numerous in pancreatic and enteric ganglia. The majority of these were also VIP IR. The finding of intrinsic CART containing neurons indicates that pancreatic and GI CART IR nerve fibers have an intrinsic origin. No CART IR endocrine cells were detected in the pancreas or in the GI tract. The adrenal medulla harboured numerous CART IR endocrine cells, most of which were adrenaline producing. In addition CART IR fibers were frequently seen in the adrenal cortex and capsule. The capsule also contained CART IR nerve cell bodies.

Inhibition of propulsive gut motility is especially marked after an opioid‐based technique. Little, however, is known of the gastrointestinal effects of the hypnotic propofol when given continuously over a longer period of time, which is the case in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and in intensive care sedation. We therefore set out to study the effects of a propofol‐based nitrous oxide/oxygen anaesthesia (group PO) on gastro‐caecal transit time. The results were compared with a propofol‐ketamine technique (group PK) and an isoflurane‐based anaesthesia (group I; each group n=20). Methods: Gastro‐caecal transit was determined by measurement of endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (ppm). Following gastral installation of lactulose at the end of the operation, the disacchharide was degraded by bacteria in the caecum, resulting in the liberation of hydrogen which was expired. A 100% increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration compared to the preinduction period was considered the end‐point of gastrocaecal transit. Results: There was no significant difference with regard to gastro‐caecal transit in the three groups of patients. In the propofol group mean gastro‐caecal transit was 119 (±50.6 SD) min, in the propofol‐ketamine group it was 147 (±57.4 SD) min, and in the isoflurane group transit time was 122 (±48.6 SD) min. Conclusion: The data suggest that propofol, even when given as a continuous infusion, does not alter gastrointestinal tract motility more than a standard isoflurane anaesthesia. The data may be particularity relevant to patients who are likely to develop postoperative ileus. They also suggest that in an ICU setting propofol does not alter gut motility more than a sedation technique with the analgesic ketamine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.1998.tb05299.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145519642", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2039075519", "title": "Management of mild and severe gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease", "text": "Summary Treatment of endosocopy‐negative gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (s‐GERD) should be directed towards rapid relief of symptoms and then maintenance of relief using minimum yet effective therapy. Responses to proton pump inhibitors are somewhat lower in s‐GERD patients compared to GERD with overt erosive damage (e‐GERD). The reasons for a lower response rate are not clear but may relate to the inclusion of patients who do not have reflux disease or patients with a lower oesophageal sensory threshold. Also poorly understood is the lower yield of complete heartburn relief when the number of associated dyspeptic symptoms is high. Some form of long‐term therapy is needed in the majority of patients. ‘On demand’ proton pump inhibitor therapy to control reflux symptoms is a new and attractive option. Time to study discontinuation due to insufficient control of heartburn, or any other reason resulting in unwillingness to continue with on‐demand therapy, is a pragmatic outcome that is well suited to definition of the efficacy of on‐demand therapy. The goals of treatment of e‐GERD should be to relieve symptoms and to heal lesions. Symptom severity and much less endoscopic abnormalities drives the therapeutic choices. When symptoms are mild or intermittent and when oesophagitis is of limited degree, standard dose proton pump inhibitor is usually instituted. Fewer and fewer clinicians would still opt for an H2‐receptor antagonist. If there is moderate or severe oesophagitis or if symptoms are particularly troublesome, then the patient should start with standard‐dose proton pump inhibitor therapy once a day, but not uncommonly a b.d. dosage maybe necessary. Once the dose of the acid suppressant that relieves symptoms is found, this dose should be maintained for a period of 3 months. After this time, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose. If symptoms recur, then the patients should go back to the full‐dose proton pump inhibitor and a plan should be formulated for long‐term treatment. The long‐term treatment options vary between ongoing acid and suppressant therapy, with occasional attempts to reduce the dose, or to go for ‘on demand’ therapy and (rarely) includes consideration for surgery or endoscopic anti‐reflux therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.17.s2.5.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039075519", "source": "openalex"}

Changes in oesophageal pH associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux. Are traditional criteria sensitive for detection of reflux? Scand J Gastroenterol 1993;28:827-832.Traditionally, gastro-oesophageal reflux is deemed to have occurred when oesophageal pH falls below 4. Other 'non-traditional' pH changes that do not fall below pH4, that fall below 4 for only brief intervals, or that occur when basal pH is less than 4 are usually disregarded. The aim of this study was to determine whether these non-traditional pH changes represent gastro-oesophageal reflux or are artefactual. The 3-h postprandial combined oesophageal pH and manometric records of 22 patients referred for investigation of suspected gastro-oesophageal reflux were reviewed. All pH falls of ≥0.5 pH units were analysed for manometric evidence of reflux that was classified as definite, probable, or possible. In total, 196 traditional and 223 non-traditional pH events were scored and analysed. The majority of traditional (80%) and non-traditional (60%) events were associated with definite manometric evidence of reflux, although a greater proportion of non-traditional events were associated with only probable evidence of reflux (33%) compared with traditional events (18%). The proportions of possible reflux were similar in the two groups. Limiting pH events to only those satisfying traditional criteria excluded an additional 32% with definite manometric evidence of reflux and 49% with definite or probable evidence of reflux. Most pH falls that remained above 4 or fell across 4 for <15 sec occurred in the 1st h postprandially, compared with traditional pH events, which occurred equally throughout the 3-h period. We conclude that traditional criteria for scoring pH episodes substantially underestimate the number of reflux episodes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529309104017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1974496938", "source": "openalex"}

It is not known if this association arises because GORD causes IPF or because IPF causes GORD, or because of confounding by factors, such as smoking, associated with both GORD and IPF. We used bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR), where genetic variants are used as instrumental variables to address issues of confounding and reverse causation, to examine how, if at all, GORD and IPF are causally related. Methods A bidirectional two-sample MR was performed to estimate the causal effect of GORD on IPF risk and of IPF on GORD risk, using genetic data from the largest GORD (78 707 cases and 288 734 controls) and IPF (4125 cases and 20 464 controls) genome-wide association meta-analyses currently available. Results GORD increased the risk of IPF, with an OR of 1.6 (95% CI 1.04–2.49; p=0.032). There was no evidence of a causal effect of IPF on the risk of GORD, with an OR of 0.999 (95% CI 0.997–1.000; p=0.245). Conclusions We found that GORD increases the risk of IPF, but found no evidence that IPF increases the risk of GORD.

Outcomes evaluated were intraoperative, dysphagia, flatulence, antisecretory medication, satisfaction with intervention, operation time, hospital stay and total cost. Results were pooled in meta‐analyses as risk ratios and weighted mean differences (WMD). Results: Of 221 patients in six RCTs, 111 were allocated to CLF and 110 to RALF.

The study evaluated the local, systemic and neurological complications following digital subtraction angiography with selective catheterisation of the carotid arteries in 200 patients presenting to a cerebrovascular clinic for assessment of cerebral ischaemia. All patients had carotid ultrasound screening before angiography to screen out those with normal arteries or mild disease (less than 30% stenosis of symptomatic internal carotid artery).

Neurological complications occurred more frequently when angiography was performed by a trainee rather than a consultant neuroradiologist (p &lt; 0.01). The neurological complications were transient (resolved within 24 hours) in 10/200 (5%), reversible (resolved within seven days) in two (1%) and permanent in 8/200 (4%).

The dramatic expansion of public eating in this period was met in part by foreign-born entrepreneurs, and wait and kitchen staff drawn from a genuinely international labour market. Londoners and visitors to the metropolis were exposed to a variety of new, often hybrid, culinary cultures, which call into question simplistic binaries between Britain and the world beyond. The simultaneous presence in London's restaurant scene of French menus, Indian dishes, Italian cooks, German waiters, and Chinese and American diners reveals the complexity of the relationship between populations and places. London's ‘gastro-cosmopolitan’ culture reveals not merely the extent to which Britain's imperial metropolis was exposed to transnational forces, but that these influences were genuinely global and not confined to Britain's formal empire. London's cosmopolitan dining culture suggests that historians might be advised to move beyond the tropes of danger and anxiety when discussing late nineteenth-century London, and do more to acknowledge a range of responses – attraction and pleasure included – which more accurately reflected the metropolitan experience.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0018246x13000071", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121776428", "source": "openalex"}

The findings indicate that perceived importance-performance of food service attributes in gastro-tourism development varied considerably. Three factors identified were food service output, food service input both perceived to be important with good performance; and food service process perceived important but hoteliers’ performance on the same was poor.

However, prognosis of AGC is still poor. Nivolumab (ONO-4538/BMS-936558) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody which blocks the human programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab as salvage treatment after failure of the standard chemotherapy for AGC. Methods: 493 patients aged ≥ 20 years with ECOG PS 0-1 and unresectable advanced or recurrent AGC who had failed two or more previous chemotherapy regimens were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 3 mg/kg nivolumab (N=330) or placebo ( N=163) every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in Intention-to-Treat population. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02267343). Results: As of the data cut-off on Aug 13 th 2016, 5.6 months after last patient randomized, median OS was 5.32 months with nivolumab versus 4.14 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.78; p&lt;0.0001), and OS rates at 6 and 12 month were 46.4% versus 34.7% and 26.6% versus 10.9%, respectively.

Design A prospective, environmental aerosol monitoring study, undertaken in an ultraclean environment, on patients undergoing OGD. Sampling was performed 20 cm away from the patient’s mouth using an optical particle sizer. Aerosol levels during OGD were compared with tidal breathing and voluntary coughs within subject. Results Patients undergoing bariatric surgical assessment were recruited (mean body mass index 44 and mean age 40 years, n=15). A low background particle concentration in theatres (3 L −1 ) enabled detection of aerosol generation by tidal breathing (mean particle concentration 118 L −1 ). Aerosol recording during OGD showed an average particle number concentration of 595 L −1 with a wide range (3–4320 L −1 ). Bioaerosol-generating events, namely, coughing or burping, were common. Coughing was evoked in 60% of the endoscopies, with a greater peak concentration and a greater total number of sampled particles than the patient’s reference voluntary coughs (11 710 vs 2320 L −1 and 780 vs 191 particles, n=9 and p=0.008). Endoscopies with coughs generated a higher level of aerosol than tidal breathing, whereas those without coughs were not different to the background. Burps also generated increased aerosol concentration, similar to those recorded during voluntary coughs. The insertion and removal of the endoscope were not aerosol generating unless a cough was triggered. Conclusion Coughing evoked during OGD is the main source of the increased aerosol levels, and therefore, OGD should be regarded as a procedure with high risk of producing respiratory aerosols. OGD should be conducted with airborne personal protective equipment and appropriate precautions in those patients who are at risk of having COVID-19 or other respiratory pathogens.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-324588", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3174896669", "source": "openalex"}

Aim : To correlate physician and patient assessment of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease severity and its response to treatment. Methods : Adult uninvestigated gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients ( n = 217) completed symptom and health‐related quality of life questionnaires at baseline and after treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg p.o. daily. Pearson coefficients quantified correlations between physician assessments and patient responses. Results : At baseline, the strongest correlations were heartburn severity (0.31), overall symptom severity (0.44) and a domain of the quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia questionnaire (0.31) ( P &lt; 0.001). Correlations of change with treatment were greater than baseline correlations: heartburn (0.39), overall symptoms (0.50) and global rate of change – stomach problems (0.72, all P &lt; 0.001). The mean difference between the physicians’ assessment of change and the patients’ global rating of change was 0.20 (95% confidence intervals: 0.10–0.29) with physicians overestimating benefit. Conclusions : Correlations were often significant, although weak to moderate and better with symptom severity than with health‐related quality of life instruments as well as with change after therapy than at baseline.

Motor dysfunction of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) and, possibly, the proximal stomach is a major cause of the increase in the number of reflux episodes. Transient LOS relaxation is the main mechanism of reflux in many patients with endoscopically negative disease, whereas a hypotensive LOS becomes relevant only in patients with oesophagitis. Alterations in primary and secondary peristalsis contribute to the increased oesophageal acid exposure by delaying clearance. The presence of a hiatus hernia, especially when voluminous and/or non‐reducible, increases the number of reflux episodes by mechanically weakening the oesophago‐gastric junction, and impairs oesophageal clearance. Hypersensitivity to acid is often present and contributes to the clinical manifestations of the disease, whereas oesophageal hypersensitivity, both to chemical and mechanical stimuli, plays a predominant role in a subset of patients. Increased concentrations of noxious compounds in the oesophageal refluxate may contribute to the development of anatomical lesions, but this is still a matter for debate. The clinical relevance of Helicobacter pylori infection and of mucosal defensive factors still needs to be fully elucidated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.16.s4.10.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005133417", "source": "openalex"}

In the former group, the mean effect of all the doses of pethidine was a reduction of the lower oesophageal barrier pressure by 6.8 cmH2O from control values (p less than 0.0002), while the intravenous administration of metoclopramide resulted in a mean increase in barrier pressure of 8.75 cmH2O above the depressed level (p less than 0.0001). Following the combination of pethidine and metoclopramide given intramuscularly depression of the sphincter pressure was not totally prevented, but there was a reduction in its incidence and severity.

Despite numerous clinical and experimental studies to investigate localised and systemic fetal inflammation following exposure to microbial agonists, there is minimal data to describe which fetal organ(s) drive systemic fetal inflammation. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E.coli in an instrumented ovine model of fetal inflammation and conducted a series of experiments to assess the systemic pro-inflammatory capacity of the three major fetal surfaces exposed to inflammatory mediators in pregnancy (the lung, gastro-intestinal tract and skin/amnion). Exposure of the fetal lung and fetal skin/amnion (but not gastro-intestinal tract) caused a significant acute systemic inflammatory response characterised by altered leucocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated plasma MCP-1 levels and inflammation of the fetal liver and spleen. These novel findings reveal differential fetal organ responses to pro-inflammatory stimulation and shed light on the pathogenesis of fetal systemic inflammation after exposure to chorioamnionitis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063355", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051394900", "source": "openalex"}

We wanted to determine the risk of prosthetic hip or knee infection following gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures in patients with joint arthroplasty. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-center, case-control study at a single, tertiary-care referral center. Cases were defined as adult patients hospitalized for prosthetic joint infection of the hip or knee between December 1, 2001 and May 31, 2006. Controls were adult patients with hip or knee arthroplasties but without a diagnosis of joint infection, hospitalized during the same time period at the same orthopedic hospital. The main outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) of prosthetic joint infection after gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures performed within 2 years before admission. Results 339 cases and 339 controls were included in the study. Of these, 70 cases (21%) cases and 82 controls (24%) had undergone a gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure in the preceding 2 years. Among gastrointestinal procedures that were assessed, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy was associated with an increased risk of prosthetic joint infection (OR = 3, 95% CI: 1.1–7). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for sex, age, joint age, immunosuppression, BMI, presence of wound drain, prior arthroplasty, malignancy, ASA score, and prothrombin time, the OR for infection after EGD with biopsy was 4 (95% CI: 1.5–10). Interpretation EGD with biopsy was associated with an increased risk of prosthetic joint infection in patients with hip or knee arthroplasties. This association will need to be confirmed in other epidemiological studies and adequately powered prospective clinical trials prior to recommending antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/17453674.2013.769079", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987975568", "source": "openalex"}

We investigated the relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and reflux symptoms in a large cohort of patients with achalasia.The symptoms of all patients with a manometric diagnosis of achalasia made over the past 15 years were studied. The types of treatment, onset and pattern of heartburn, lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (LOSP) and 24-h oesophageal pH studies were compared.A total of 110 out of 225 untreated (48.9%) and 57 out of 99 treated (57.6%) patients experienced heartburn. An oesophageal pH study was performed on 80 patients and GOR was found in only six out of 57 untreated (10.5%) and 10 out of 23 treated (43.5%) patients. A low LOSP (<10 mmHg) was associated with an increased risk of GOR [odds ratio (OR) 14.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-128.7; P<0.02).

However, several countries have reported anthelmintic resistance (AR), representing a limitation for sustainable small ruminant production. The knowledge regarding worm control management represents a baseline to develop a guideline for preventing AR. The aim of the present study was therefore to improve our knowledge about the worm control practices in small ruminant flocks in Norway. A questionnaire survey regarding worm control practices was performed in small ruminant flocks in Norway. Flocks were selected from the three main areas of small ruminant farming, i.e. the coastal, inland and northern areas. A total of 825 questionnaires, comprising 587 sheep flocks (return rate of 51.3%) and 238 goat flocks (52.6%) were included. The results indicated that visual appraisal of individual weight was the most common means of estimating the anthelmintic dose used in sheep (78.6%) and goat (85.1%) flocks. The mean yearly drenching rate in lambs and ewes were 2.5 ± 1.7 and 1.9 ± 1.1, respectively, whereas it was 1.0 (once a year) in goats. However, these figures were higher in sheep in the coastal area with a rate of 3.4 and 2.2 in lambs and ewes, respectively. Benzimidazoles were the predominant anthelmintic class used in sheep flocks (64.9% in 2007), whereas benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones were both equally used in dairy goat flocks. In the period of 2005-2007, 46.3% of the sheep flocks never changed the anthelmintic class. The dose and move strategy was practiced in 33.2% of the sheep flocks. The present study showed that inaccurate weight calculation gives a risk of under-dosing in over 90% of the sheep and goat flocks in Norway. Taken together with a high treatment frequency in lambs, a lack of anthelmintic class rotation and the common use of a dose-and-move strategy, a real danger for development of anthelmintic resistance (AR) seems to exist in Norwegian sheep and goat flocks. This risk seems particularly high in coastal areas where high treatment frequencies in lambs were recorded.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-29", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157109011", "source": "openalex"}

Unfortunately such an approach does not necessarily identify the therapeutic option which provides the greatest benefit from available resources in real life situations. To make an informed choice requires a recognition that the costs and benefits of therapy in practice may differ from those identified in trials. Aims —To evaluate, based on a retrospective prescription database analysis, the cost effectiveness of alternative treatment options for patients with uncomplicated GORD. The analysis assesses health service resource use during the first six months of treatment in three groups of patients initially prescribed cisapride (CIS), ranitidine (RAN), or omeprazole (OME). Methods —The MediPlus™ UK database was used to identify all health care resources consumed by patients in the three treatment groups during their first six months of treatment. Patients with more complicated GORD, as indicated by initial referral to a specialist or outpatient hospital visit (&lt;13%), were excluded from the analysis. Results —The average cost per patient for the initial six months of treatment for CIS, RAN, and OME based therapies was £136, £177, and £189 per patient, respectively. A major element underlying this cost variation was the acquisition cost and quantity of antireflux medication required by patients. The average number of one month equivalent prescriptions consumed during this six month period was 1.85 (CIS), 2.57 (RAN), and 2.96 (OME) with associated costs of £49 (CIS), £67 (RAN), and £105 (OME). Antacid and alginate/antacid use was higher in the CIS and RAN groups (about 1.0 antacid prescription per patient versus 0.4 for OME), but their contribution to the total cost per patient was less than 2%. The number of general practitioner consultations over the six month period for each treatment group was 2.4 (CIS), 2.9 (RAN), and 2.6 (OME) with associated costs of £60.31 (CIS), £73.06 (RAN), and £65.52 (OME). The average number of non-drug interventions (referrals, outpatient visits, endoscopies, barium meals, or x rays) was 0.34 in the RAN group compared with less than 0.2 in the CIS and OME groups. The costs associated with such interventions were £23.80 (RAN), £9.60 (CIS), and £11.10 (OME) per patient. Conclusion —The data indicate that the “step up” approach, starting with a prokinetic or H 2 receptor antagonist, represents the most cost effective initial therapeutic strategy for a primary care physician to adopt when faced with a patient with first diagnosis of uncomplicated GORD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.42.1.13", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143917739", "source": "openalex"}

A previous trial of a new immediate‐release omeprazole oral suspension suggested that nocturnal gastric acidity could be more effectively controlled with a bedtime dose of immediate‐release omeprazole than with a delayed‐release proton‐pump inhibitor administered before dinner or at bedtime. Aim : To compare the ability of immediate‐release omeprazole with pantoprazole to control nocturnal gastric acidity, when they were dosed once daily and twice daily. Methods : Thirty‐six patients with nocturnal gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms received immediate‐release omeprazole and pantoprazole in this open‐label, randomized‐crossover trial. Median gastric pH, the percentage of time with gastric pH &gt; 4 and the percentage of patients with nocturnal acid breakthrough, were evaluated with 24‐h pH monitoring.

The antigenic structure of the α and β types has been examined, and both types show a well-marked specificity. 4. Either organism can be readily isolated from faeces during an acute phase of the disease, but there may be some difficulty in recovering either during a subacute stage. 5.

Critical to accurate diagnosis is the determination of limits of normality based on the study of control human tissues. Although robust diagnostic criteria exist for many qualitative alterations in the neuromuscular apparatus, these do not include quantitative values due to lack of adequate control data. Purpose The aim of this report was to summarize all relevant available published quantitative data for elements of the human enteric nervous system (neuronal cell bodies, glial cells, and nerve fibers) from the perspective of the practicing pathologist. Forty studies meeting inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed with data tabulated in detail and discussed in the context of methodological variations and limitations. The results reveal a lack of concordance between observations of different investigators resulting in data insufficient to produce robust normal ranges. This diversity highlights the need to standardize the way pathologists collect, process, and quantitate neuronal and glial elements in enteric neuropathologic samples, as suggested by recent international guidelines on gastrointestinal neuromuscular pathology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2010.01657.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011814583", "source": "openalex"}

The proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1B polymorphisms increase the risk of hypochlorhydria and gastric atrophy. We examined the association between proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms, presence of gastric atrophy, and risk of GORD in H pylori positive and negative subjects in Japan.We studied 320 consecutive dyspeptic patients without peptic ulcers or cancers. GORD symptoms were scored using the Carlsson-Dent questionnaire and erosive oesophagitis was assessed endoscopically. H pylori infection was diagnosed by urea breath test, histological examination, and serology. Gastric atrophy was assessed histologically, and polymorphisms in the IL-1B, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-A) genes were genotyped.Two hundred and eight patients were H pylori positive and 112 were negative. One hundred and eight (34%) were found to have erosive oesophagitis by endoscopic criteria (grade A: 78; grade B: 23; grade C: 6; grade D: 1).

Aspiration and prolonged monitoring studies in humans have shown that reflux of gastric contents is comprised of both acid and non‐acid components, in healthy as well as diseased people. Methods to monitor the non‐acid component of the refluxate are described in detail. Experimental models suggest that synergism between acid and pepsin and conjugated bile acids have the greatest damaging potential for oesophageal mucosa, although unconjugated bile acids may be caustic at a more neutral pH. Human studies are compatible with a synergistic action between acid and duodenogastric reflux in inducing lesions. During prolonged monitoring studies, typical gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms are more related to acid reflux events than to non‐acid reflux events. However, symptoms that persist during acid‐suppressive therapy are often related to non‐acid reflux events. The therapeutic options for the non‐acid component of the refluxate, including acid suppression, prokinetics, baclofen and surgery, are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02609.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056381605", "source": "openalex"}

However cough and GORD are common ailments and their co‐existence by chance is high. Also cough can induce reflux episodes. Treatment for GORD includes conservative measures (diet manipulation), pharmaceutical therapy (motility or prokinetic agents, H2‐antagonist and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) and fundoplication. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of GORD treatment on chronic cough in children and adults with GORD and prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease i.e. non‐specific chronic cough. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The date of last search was 24th April 2009. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on GORD treatment for cough in children and adults without primary lung disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted. Study authors were contacted for further information. Main results Eighteen studies (5 paediatric, 13 adults) were included. None of the paediatric studies could be included in meta‐analysis. In adults, analysis on use of H2 antagonist, motility agents and conservative treatment for GORD were not possible (from lack of data) and there were no controlled studies on fundoplication as an intervention. Nine adult studies comparing PPI (two to three months) to placebo were analysed for various outcomes in the meta‐analysis. Enrolment of participants subjects for two studies were primarily from medical clinics and another eight studies were otolaryngology clinic patients or patients with laryngeal symptoms. Using \"intention to treat\", pooled data from studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough, Odds Ratio 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 1.15). Pooled data revealed no overall significant improvement in cough outcomes (end of trial or change in cough scores). Significant differences were only found in sensitivity analyses. A significant improvement in change of cough scores was found in end of intervention (two to three months) in those receiving PPI with a standardised mean difference of ‐0.41 (95% CI ‐0.75 to ‐0.07) using generic inverse variance analysis on cross over trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after five days to two weeks of treatment. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to definitely conclude that GORD treatment with PPI is universally beneficial for cough associated with GORD in adults. The beneficial effect was only seen in sub‐analysis. The optimal duration of such a trial of therapy to evaluate response could not be ascertained although two RCTs reported significant change by 2‐weeks of therapy. Clinicians should be cognisant of a period (natural resolution with time) and placebo effect in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure.

Summary Background Data: Gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) post-SG is a critical issue due to symptom severity, impact on quality of life, requirement for reoperation, and potential for Barrett esophagus. The pathophysiology is incompletely delineated. Methods: Post-SG patients, stratified into asymptomatic and symptomatic, underwent protocolized nuclear scintigraphy (n = 83), 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and stationary manometry (n = 143) to characterize reflux patterns. Ten patients underwent fasting and postprandial concurrent manometry and pH for detailed analysis of reflux events. Results: Baseline demographics between cohorts were similar: Age 47.2 ± 11.6 versus 44.1 ± 11.3 years ( P = 0.121); females 73.2% versus 90.8% ( P = 0.005); excess weight loss 53.8 ± 28.1% versus 57.4 ± 25.5% ( P = 0.422), follow-up duration 12.3 versus 7.4 months ( P = 0.503). Nuclear scintigraphy delineated bolus-induced deglutitive reflux events (29.6% vs 62.5%, P = 0.005) and postprandial reflux events [4 (IQR2) versus 4 (IQR 3) events, P = 0.356]. Total acid exposure was significantly elevated in the symptomatic population (7.7% vs 3.6%, P &lt; 0.001), especially fasting acid exposure (6.0% vs 1.3%, P &lt; 0.001). pH/manometry analysis demonstrated acute elevations of the gastro-esophageal pressure gradient (&gt;10 mm Hg) underpinned most reflux events. Swallow-induced intragastric hyper-pressur-ization was associated with individual reflux events in most patients (90% in fasting state and 40% postprandial). Conclusions: We found reflux to be strongly associated with SG and identified 3 unique categories. Bolus-induced deglutitive and postprandial reflux occurred in most patients. Elevated fasting esophageal acid exposure mediated symptoms. Frequent, significant elevation in the gastro-esophageal pressure gradient was the mechanism of reflux and seemed to relate to the noncompliant proximal stomach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004637", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3103513087", "source": "openalex"}

As an extension of our earlier work on the pharmacological characterization of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites in the duck jejunum, the regional and diurnal variations of melatonin and putative melatonin receptors of different segments of the duck gastro-intestinal tract were studied in an attempt to understand the role of melatonin in the physiology of the digestive system. Although no significant effects of diurnal variation and pinealectomy on the regional distribution of melatonin were observed, significant regional variations of melatonin levels were detected with decreasing levels as follows: colon > oesophagus, caecum > duodenum, jejunum > ileum. The densities of melatonin binding sites showed a significant variation between different intestinal regions at either mid-light or mid-dark, with the following descending order: ileum, jejunum > duodenum, colon > caecum > oesophagus. Analysis of the distribution of melatonin binding sites in the wall of the intestine revealed maximal binding in the mucosa and minimal binding in the muscular layers of the jejunum. Similar results were obtained for other intestinal regions as revealed by autoradiography. No significant changes in the affinities of melatonin binding sites were detected between different regions and tissue layers of the alimentary canal. Moreover, the densities and affinities of melatonin binding sites among different regions of the gut exhibited no significant diurnal variations. The demonstration of regional variations in melatonin levels and the density of melatonin binding sites along the gastro-intestinal tract, with a concentration of the putative melatonin receptors in the mucosal layer, suggests a possible direct action of melatonin in the regulation of fluid/electrolyte transport and nutrient absorption in the gut.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000109445", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2040746589", "source": "openalex"}

Method : We conducted randomized‐controlled trials of non‐continuous therapy in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients. Results : Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria. Because of variation in outcome measures statistical pooling of results was not possible. Results were analysed qualitatively. Four studies evaluated intermittent therapy of treatment 3 days a week with omeprazole 20 mg or daily with ranitidine which were not efficacious compared to a daily proton pump inhibitor. Famotidine 10 and 20 mg, ranitidine 75 mg and cimetidine 200 mg were efficacious in five on‐demand studies for relief of symptomatic heartburn episodes. In three of four studies, evaluating only non‐erosive (endoscopy‐negative) gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients, esomeprazole 20 and 40 mg and omeprazole 10 and 20 mg a day were efficacious using willingness to continue as an endpoint. Lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg maintained symptom control in 60–70% of healed oesophagitis patients. Conclusions : Intermittent proton pump inhibitor or H 2 ‐receptor antagonist therapy is not effective in maintaining control in oesophagitis patients.

Immunoreactivity for P2X receptors has also been seen in putative gastric mechanoreceptors, the intraganglionic laminar endings. We therefore hypothesized that deletion of P2X3 receptors will blunt responses to gastric distension in vagal sensory neurons. Using wildtype and P2X3(-/-) mice, we examined responses to purinergic agonists in retrogradely labelled gastric sensory neurons with patch-clamp techniques. Activation of gastro-oesophageal neurons by fluid distension was studied with intracellular electrodes. Distension-evoked ATP release into the gastric lumen was determined with the luciferase assay and intake and gastric emptying of a solid meal was assessed. ATP triggered inward currents in 80% of gastric nodose neurons. In P2X3(-/-) mice, the peak current density was lower compared to controls. Ten of 14 controls but none of 30 neurons from P2X3(-/-) mice responded to alpha,beta-metATP. Gastro-oesophageal sensory neurons of P2X3(-/-) mice showed a blunted response to fluid distension of oesophagus and stomach. This difference was not explained by differences in distension-evoked ATP release, which did not differ between knockout mice and controls. Food intake during a 3-h period was lower in P2X3(-/-) mice. Gastric emptying of a solid meal was slightly faster in knockout mice after 1.5 h, but did not differ between groups at 3 h. Our data support a role of purinergic signalling in gastric vagal afferents. Considering the role of vagal input in sensations of fullness or nausea, P2X receptors may be interesting treatment targets for dyspeptic symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2009.01292.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982345712", "source": "openalex"}

Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with In-111 pentatreotide has proved to be useful in detecting gastro-enteropancreatic tumours; however, the role of abdominal single photon emission computed tomography has not yet been definitively established. In a series of 52 patients with gastro-enteropancreatic tumours (9 non-functioning islet cell carcinomas, 4 insulinomas, 3 somatostatinomas, 2 VIPomas, 1 glucagonoma and 33 carcinoids) we compared somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with the results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging performed within one month. Four and 24-hour total body planar images and 4-hour abdominal single photon emission computed tomography were acquired after the i.v. injection of approximately 250 MBq of In-111 pentatreotide. Only abdominal localizations were considered: planar scans detected 16 extrahepatic lesions in 13 patients and 54 liver sites in 21 patients; single photon emission computed tomography visualized 31 extrahepatic lesions and 89 liver metastases in 27 and 28 patients, respectively; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging detected 11 extrahepatic lesions in 10 patients and 73 liver sites in 21 patients. In-111 pentatreotide single photon emission computed tomography was the only imaging method able to localize tumoural lesions in 13 patients; all these localizations were then histologically verified. The scintigraphic positivity did not depend on the site or on the presence of hormonal hypersecretions. In conclusion, our results indicate that single photon emission computed tomography is more sensitive than planar images and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging in detecting abdominal gastro-enteropancreatic tumours and their metastases; it is able to increase both the number of visualized lesions and that of patients with positive findings. Single photon emission computed tomography is particularly useful in patients in whom tumoural lesions have not been already localized; it should be the first imaging modality in patients with gastro-enteropancreatic tumours: its initial use will result in more information and proper management.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2437256465", "source": "openalex"}

Pathological pH-MII results (RI and BI) were associated with lower BIL in the distal impedance channel. The BIL was significantly lower in infants compared to children >1 year regardless of the RI or BI.

The mean duration of reflux episodes per hour was longest in active sleep followed by wakefulness, indeterminate and quiet sleep. There was a strong positive correlation between duration of reflux and movement time for wakefulness, active and indeterminate sleep. Movement preceded 88% of all reflux episodes. Physiological reflux occurs in most newborn infants but is clinically inapparent. The results suggest that state and movement are related to the incidence and duration of reflux.

Our aim was to determine the correlation between OP pH and gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) events detected by multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH).Fifteen patients (11 males, median age 10.8 years) with suspected GER were prospectively evaluated with ambulatory 24-h OP pH monitoring (positioned at the level of the uvula) and concomitant esophageal MII-pH monitoring. Potential OP events were identified by the conventional pH threshold of <4 and by the following alternative criteria: (i) relative pH drop >10% from 15-min baseline and (ii) absolute pH drop below thresholds of <5.5, 5.0, and 4.5. The 2-min window preceding each OP event was analyzed for correlation with an episode of GER detected by MII-pH.A total of 926 GER events were detected by MII-pH. Application of alternative pH criteria increased the identification of potential OP pH events; however, a higher proportion of OP events had no temporal correlation with GER (45-81%), compared with the conventional definition of pH < 4 (40%). A total of 306 full-column acid reflux episodes were detected by MII-pH, of which 10 (3.3%) were also identified by OP pH monitoring.Use of extended pH criteria increased the detection of potential SEGR events, but the majority of decreases in OP pH were not temporally correlated with GER.

With placebo, oesophageal acid exposure was 16.3% of the 24 hours, 10 mg omeprazole/day reduced that to 6.3%, 20 mg/day lowered acid exposure to 0.9%, and 40 mg/day to 0.6%.

The Simulated Chemodynamical Properties of Several Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus-like Stellar Halos", "text": "Abstract The Milky Way (MW) stellar halo contains relics of ancient mergers that tell the story of our galaxy’s formation. Some of them are identified due to their similarity in energy, actions, and chemistry, referred to as the “chemodynamical space,” and are often attributed to distinct merger events. It is also known that our galaxy went through a significant merger event that shaped the local stellar halo during its first billion years. Previous studies using N -body only and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have shown that such a single massive merger can produce several “signatures” in the chemodynamical space, which can potentially be misinterpreted as distinct merger events. Motivated by these, in this work we use a subset of the GASTRO library, which consists of several smoothed particle hydrodynamics+ N -body models of a single accretion event in a MW-like galaxy. Here, we study models with orbital properties similar to the main merger event of our galaxy and explore the implications to known stellar halo substructures. We find that (i) supernova feedback efficiency influences the satellite’s structure and orbital evolution, resulting in distinct chemodynamical features for models with the same initial conditions; (ii) very retrograde high-energy stars are the most metal-poor of the accreted dwarf galaxy and could be misinterpreted as a distinct merger; (iii) the most bound stars are more metal-rich in our models, the opposite of what is observed in the MW, suggesting a secondary massive merger; and, finally, (iv) our models can reconcile other known apparently distinct substructures to a unique progenitor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8b0d", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4296280766", "source": "openalex"}

The data were collected between July 2010 and June 2011 (PY1) and July 2011 and January 2013 (PY2), respectively. During PY1, Lohmann Brown classic (LB classic, N = 450) was tested, while in PY2 two different genotypes (230 LB classic, 230 LB plus) were used. The hens were kept in two mobile stalls that were moved to a new position at regular intervals. In both PY1 and PY2, 20 individual faecal samples per stall were randomly collected at monthly intervals in order to calculate the number of internal parasite eggs per gram of faeces (EPG). At the end of the laying periods, approximately 10% (N = 42) or more than 50% (N = 265) of hens were subjected to post-mortem parasitological examinations in PY1 and PY2, respectively. No parasite eggs were found in the faecal samples during PY1, whereas almost all of the hens (97.6%) were infected with Heterakis gallinarum (36 worms/hen) at the end of the period. In PY2, nematode eggs in faeces were found from the third month onwards at a low level, increasing considerably towards the final three months. There was no significant difference between the two genotypes of brown hens neither for EPG (P = 0.456) or for overall prevalence (P = 0.177). Mortality rate ranged from 18.3 to 27.4% but did not differ significantly between genotypes or production years. Average worm burden was 207 worms/hen in PY2. The most prevalent species were H. gallinarum (98.5%) followed by Ascaridia galli (96.2%) and Capillaria spp. (86.1%). Furthermore, three Capillaria species, C. obsignata, C. bursata and C. caudinflata were differentiated. In conclusion chickens kept on free-range farms are exposed to high risks of nematode infections and have high mortality rates with no obvious link to parasite infections. Once the farm environment is contaminated with the nematode eggs, establishment and further spread of nematodes to the hens is a matter of time. This will latest be the case in the second production period, even if the hens are kept in a rotation system and in small herd sizes. This underlines the importance of nematode infections in all free-range systems.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2174462178", "source": "openalex"}

In order to prevent the overestimation of litter ingestion, we applied severe mitigation measures to avoid airborne contamination during the analyses, integrating a new approach for the correction of estimates of fibres abundance using control procedure. In this study, we assessed the anthropogenic litter ingestion in four elasmobranch species from the southern Tyrrhenian Sea: Scyliorhinus canicula (n= 27), Etmopterus spinax (n= 16), Galeus melastomus (n= 12) and Raja clavata (n= 6). The gastro-intestinal tract of each specimen was analysed by visual sorting and the polymers identified by FT-IR spectroscopy technique. Overall, 19 litter particles were found in the gastro-intestinal tract of 13 demersal elasmobranchs (%O= 21) and for the first time, evidence of litter ingestion by R. clavata in Mediterranean waters was also reported. In G. melastomus and R. clavata all anthropogenic particles were plastics, whereas in S. canicula other litter categories were also found. No litter ingestion was instead observed in E. spinax. More than 50% of litter particles belonged to microlitter category (< 5 mm). Polyamide was the only polymer typology found in all examined species. We described the procedures to control the airborne contamination applied at each step of laboratory analysis and, thanks to the application of our control method, it was possible to exclude the 95% of fibres found in samples from the assessment. Moreover, we compared fibres abundances observed in samples and controls. This study, combining an approach for minimizing the bias associated to airborne fibre contamination, provided a reliable assessment of marine litter ingestion in demersal elasmobranchs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00119", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3045533870", "source": "openalex"}

In the last decades, pharmacological levels of zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper have frequently been used as nutritional strategies to prevent post-weaning diarrhoea because of their antimicrobial activity. However, the use of ZnO was recently banned by the EU from 2022 because of the risk of promoting Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR). Beyond their role as essential micronutrients, vitamins share several remarkable activities (antimicrobial, immunological and antioxidative) often referred to amongst many of the non-antibiotic feed additives commonly proposed and used for pigs. However, very little research and scientific emphasis are devoted to vitamin nutrition and its role in the gut function and health of livestock. This review discusses how fat-soluble (A, D, E and K) and water-soluble (B-group and C) vitamins may influence gastrointestinal (GI) functionality in general and with specific importance on the challenges associated with the early life of pig gut health and disease prevention. On the basis of the literature review it is suggested that future research and development of alternative strategies to antibiotics and medicinal ZnO should pay attention to the role of vitamins for GI functionality and health of pigs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.114823", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3119819930", "source": "openalex"}

To achieve this, the European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group organized a meeting of specialists and experts from around the world, representatives from National Gastroenterology Societies and general practitioners from Europe to establish updated guidelines on the current management of Helicobacter pylori infection. The meeting took place on 21–22 September 2000. A ‘test and treat’ approach is recommended in adult patients under the age of 45 years (the age cut‐off may vary locally) presenting in primary care with persistent dyspepsia, having excluded those with predominantly gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug users and those with alarm symptoms. Diagnosis of infection should be by urea breath test or stool antigen test. As in the previous guidelines, the eradication of H. pylori is strongly recommended in all patients with peptic ulcer, including those with complications, in those with low‐grade gastric mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, in those with atrophic gastritis and following gastric cancer resection. It is also strongly recommended in patients who are first‐degree relatives of gastric cancer patients and according to patients’ wishes after full consultation. It is advised that H. pylori eradication is considered to be an appropriate option in infected patients with functional dyspepsia, as it leads to long‐term symptom improvement in a subset of patients. There was consensus that the eradication of H. pylori is not associated with the development of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in most cases, and does not exacerbate existing gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. It was agreed that the eradication of H. pylori prior to the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs reduces the incidence of peptic ulcer, but does not enhance the healing of gastric or duodenal ulcer in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. Treatment should be thought of as a package which considers first‐ and second‐line eradication therapies together. First‐line therapy should be with triple therapy using a proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine bismuth citrate, combined with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole. Second‐line therapy should use quadruple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline. Where bismuth is not available, second‐line therapy should be with proton pump inhibitor‐based triple therapy. If second‐line quadruple therapy fails in primary care, patients should be referred to a specialist. Subsequent failures should be handled on a case‐by‐case basis by the specialist. In patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, eradication therapy does not need to be followed by further antisecretory treatment. Successful eradica‐ tion should always be confirmed by urea breath test or an endoscopy‐based test if endoscopy is clinically indicated. Stool antigen test is the alternative if urea breath test is not available.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2002.01169.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061938579", "source": "openalex"}

We investigated PIF core peptide (PIF-CP) mRNA expression in tumour and benign tissue from patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer and in gastro-oesophageal biopsies for healthy volunteers. Tumour tissue and adjacent benign tissue were collected from patients with gastric and oesophageal cancer (n=46) and from benign tissue only in healthy controls (n=11). Expression of PIF-CP mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Clinical and pathological information along with nutritional status was collected prospectively. In the cancer patients, PIF-CP mRNA was detected in 27 (59%) tumour samples and 31 (67%) adjacent benign tissue samples. Four (36%) gastro-oesophageal biopsies from healthy controls also expressed PIF-CP mRNA. Expression was higher in tumour tissue (P=0.031) and benign tissue (P=0.022) from cancer patients compared with healthy controls. In the cancer patients, tumour and adjacent benign tissue PIF-CP mRNA concentrations were correlated with each other (P<0.0001, r=0.73) but did not correlate with weight loss or prognosis. Although PIF-CP mRNA expression is upregulated in both tumour and adjacent normal tissue in gastro-oesophageal malignancy, expression does not relate to prognosis or cachexia.

In recent years, it has been observed in several centers that there is a change in the causes of dyspepsia as revealed by UGIE. Our main objectives were: (1) To study the pattern of upper gastrointestinal pathology in patients with dyspepsia undergoing upper endoscopy; (2) Compare that with the pattern seen 10-15 years earlier in different areas of KSA.<b> Materials and Methods:</b> Retrospective study of all UGI endoscopies performed at Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Southern Saudi Arabia during the years 2005-2007 on patients above 13 years of age. Patients who underwent UGIE for reasons other than dyspepsia were excluded. The analysis was performed using the SPSS 14 statistical package. <b> Results:</b> A total of 1,607 patients underwent UGI endoscopy during the three-year study period (age range, 15-100). There were 907 males (56.4%) and 700 female (43.6%). Normal findings were reported on 215 patients (14%) and the majority had gastritis (676 = 42%), of whom 344 had gastritis with ulcer disease.

CCK-A, CCK-B, neurotensin, somatostatin and VIP receptors were localized by in vitro receptor autoradiography with iodinated radioligands on histological sections of surgical samples of 27 gastric and 25 colonic adenocarcinomas. CCK-A, CCK-B and neurotensin-1 receptors were found in a minority of both tumor types. Somatostatin receptors were found in 18/27 gastric and 2/25 colonic cancers. VIP receptors were found in 14/26 gastric and 23/25 colonic cancers; subtype characterization suggests VIP1 receptors. In addition, resected tumor samples contained non-malignant tissues (mucosa, smooth muscle, nerves or vessels) with high amounts of the various peptide receptors. Therefore, regulatory peptide receptors are expressed differentially in gastric and colonic cancers but also very frequently in \"contaminating\" non-malignant tissues. Since results using morphological techniques are superior to those using homogenates, we recommend that localization of these receptors to the tissues should always be attempted, to minimize receptor over-estimation in tumors and to prevent spurious results.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990505)81:3<376::aid-ijc11>3.0.co;2-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064121312", "source": "openalex"}

Results: Median 23-h gastric pH increased significantly from 1.5 at base line to 3.7 on day 3 and 2.8 after 3 months but decreased significantly from day 3 to month 3 of therapy. Median 23-h acid reflux time was reduced significantly by therapy, from 12.6% at base line to 6.2% on day 3 and 7.2% after 3 months, and there was no significant difference between day 3 and month 3.

Accordingly, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is now a standard first-line treatment option for patients with advanced HER-2-positive gastroesophageal cancer. Unfortunately, many patients with HER-2-positive cancer exhibit primary resistance to trastuzumab and the remainder will acquire resistance to the antibody; therefore, urgent investigation into novel agents which may circumvent resistance mechanisms is warranted. Small molecule inhibitors of HER-2, which commonly also target other members of the HER family of receptors, such as EGFR and HER-3, are currently undergoing evaluation in gastroesophageal cancer as first-line alternatives to trastuzumab and second-line salvage treatments for trastuzumab-resistant disease. Extrapolating the successful use of trastuzumab in the advanced disease setting, clinical trials are underway to assess the role of this antibody in the perioperative and adjuvant settings, where it is hoped that it will have a meaningful impact upon the currently poor survival rates.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1756283x12450246", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071222369", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2093629675", "title": "Gastro‐Oesophageal Reflux Disease in Infants and Children: New Insights, Developments and Old Chestnuts", "text": "Research into the physiology and pathophysiology of pediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has advanced markedly over the last decade through the use of technologies such as micro-manometry, non-invasive breath testing and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII). These techniques when used on their own or in combination have given us a much greater understanding of the mechanisms of ALL reflux (liquid, gas, acidic, weakly acidic and non acidic), oesophageal volume clearance and gastric emptying and how these mechanisms may be interrelated and altered in reflux disease. These techniques, above all, have demonstrated that transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation (TLOSR) is the predominant mechanism of all GOR in infants and children thus have clearly identified a therapeutic target for reflux inhibitor research, beyond current acid suppression based therapy. The impact of MII measurement on reflux diagnosis is potentially of great significance. This is because, in infants in particular, the pH of refluxate during majority of GOR episodes is above pH 4 due to gastric pH buffering related to frequent EBM/formula feeding (1). It is therefore impossible to detect ALL reflux using pH-based criteria. Intraluminal impedance measurement has been extremely useful in understanding reflux physiology and pathophysiology particularly during the early post-pradial period when GOR episodes and reflux symptoms occur most frequently. In this context MII measurement has clearly demonstrated the limitations of 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring for the global assessment of reflux. Despite these limitations, oesophageal pH monitoring is still performed in most centres due to the fact it is readily available, cost effective and the result of the test can be interpreted in relation to established normative values for oesophageal acid expose time. In support of the continued use of 24 pH monitoring, even though this technique fails to record ALL reflux episodes, existing evidence shows that acid reflux is a significant pathophysiological factor in GOR disease. This appears to be the case in all human age groups, even premature infants as it has been shown that (TLOSR triggered) acid GOR occurs more commonly in patients with GOR disease compared to asymptomatic controls (2). How useful, therefore, is MII measurement in the diagnosis of pediatric reflux disease? In this early phase of establishment of this technology as a routine clinical diagnostic test, the absence of normative data is a significant limitation, which is difficult to overcome because, due to the invasive nature of the test, it would be unethical to evaluate healthy infants and children. One possible exception would be premature infants who were asymptomatic for reflux, but require supplemental feeding via nasogastric tube. Such infants could be assessed using an impedance catheter incorporating a feeding lumen. However, the categorisation of these infants as 'normals' would no doubt be questioned by those who would consider them to be abnormal by virtue of their prematurity and related poor progression onto full oral feeding as indicated by the continued requirement for nasogastric feeding. The use of adult normative data is also problematic as it is well established that the degree of 'physiological reflux' is higher in infants, particularly in the first 6 months of life. In the absence of impedance-based normative data, the major advantage of impedance measurement of reflux over pH probe is that it enables, by virtue of measuring ALL reflux, the precise temporal association of reflux events with putative 'reflux-related symptoms'. For example, reflux as a cause of respiratory symptoms such as apnoea or cough, can be relatively easily determined by concurrent impedance measurement during polysomnographic assessment. The association of reflux with other symptoms such as irritability or crying could also be determined, provided that the recognition of symptoms was done objectively using time-coded video of audio recordings. Because impedance measurement is performed along the full length of the oesophagus, rather than at 1 or 2 positions as is the case with pH monitoring, it allows the proximal extent of reflux to be precisely determined. The occurrence of supra-oesophageal reflux that extends proximally into the pharynx and higher structures is more likely in infants due to a proportionately shorter oesophagus and lower ratio of oesophageal to gastric volume. Hence the likelihood of an interaction of refluxate with pharyngeal and laryngeal structures and the airways is increased. Such interactions will initiate neural reflexes that are protective against aspiration such as swallowing and/or glottal closure and these protective mechanisms are a potential cause of apnoea triggering. The ability to reliably determine super-oesophageal penetration of refluxate may therefore be a further advantage of impedance measurement over pH monitoring alone. An 'Old Chestnut', as the saying goes, is a story, idea or concept that is often repeated. In pediatric reflux research there are several Old Chestnuts relating to the physiology, pathophysiology and treatment of this disease. Often these are widely accepted, but based on empirical evidence when the hard scientific evidence is either inconclusive or incomplete. Such examples include the association of reflux with apnoea, the role of delayed gastric emptying (GE) in reflux disease and the role of manometry for the preoperative assessment of children undergoing antireflux surgery. With respect to these issues the published literature is substantial but on balance, negative or inconclusive. Frequent apnoea and bradycardia, particularly with feeding, is widely accepted to be a common clinical correlate of reflux disease. It is hypothesised that GOR may be a direct or indirect trigger for apnoeic episodes via the mechanisms related to poor coordination of swallowing with breathing and neural reflex mechanisms initiated by chemical stimulation of the larynx/pharynx or oesophageal distension. Alternatively the likelihood of GOR occurring may be exacerbated by a transient increase in the gastro-oesophageal pressure gradient resulting from airways obstruction. The evaluation of the temporal association between reflux and apnoea requires prolonged simultaneous monitoring of both reflux and respiratory events. Conflicting findings of either little or no association or an association between apnoea and GOR, recorded by either pH probe of MII, have been reported (3,4). Delayed gastric emptying is hypothesised to play a role in reflux disease, particularly a cause of regurgitation in those children with failure to thrive and/or vomiting. Both normal and delayed GE have been reported in children with GOR disease. More recent studies in infants suggest that GE was, if anything, faster in those infants with more severe GER disease (2). Studies that have examined the effect of posture on gastric emptying and/or GOR have consistently reported more rapid gastric emptying with right-side positioning compared to left-side positioning but, paradoxically, more reflux with right-side positioning compared to left-side positioning (5). No studies have similarly examined the relationship between GE and GOR in a setting of pharmacologically modified GE (eg erythromycin) although the GABA(b) agonist baclofen, which has been shown to delay gastric emptying in a mouse model (6), is known to reduce reflux through the inhibition of transient LES relaxation. On balance the literature on this issue suggests that gastric emptying and reflux poorly related, if at all. Fundoplication procedures mechanically increase the resistance to bolus flow across the lower oesophageal sphincter due to an elevated residual LOS pressure. This reduces the likelihood of reflux triggering during TLOSR but also places a greater demand on oesophageal peristalsis during bolus swallowing. The preoperative assessment of oesophageal motility in children may be useful to establish that oesophageal pressures initiated during peristalsis are normal and therefore sufficient to facilitate bolus flow across the fundoplicated sphincter. If a motility disorder is present, dysphagia may occur post operatively. Oesophageal manometry can be used for the diagnosis of a range of oesophageal motility disorders such as hypotensive peristalsis, non-specific motor disorder, diffuse oesophageal spasm and achalasia. Oesophageal manometry however cannot detect bolus flow and clearance, and therefore diagnostic assessments of oesophageal function based upon manometry alone rely upon the inference that oesophageal dismotility leads to ineffective oesophageal bolus transit. The most likely explains why manometric findings alone tend to be poorly predictive of the development of postoperative dysphagia. The concurrent assessment of manometry with bolus transit using MII improves the sensitivity and specificity of manometric assessments of oesophageal function. Recent studies have used MII to re-evaluate the minimal requirements for effective bolus propulsion by oesophageal peristalsis and suggest that effective passage of a bolus can be facilitated by oesophageal pressure waves of lower amplitude than defined previously based on fluoroscopic assessments of bolus flow (7,8). Indeed, up to one third of patients with oesophageal functional defects exhibit normal bolus transit (8). Thus, the combination of manometry and impedance for routine clinical oesophageal function testing may be better able to discriminate between normal and abnormal oesophageal function and therefore may be more predictive of dysphagia following anti-reflux surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.scs.0000180292.89483.cf", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2093629675", "source": "openalex"}

Results from population-based observational studies are, however, sparse and ambiguous. Methods This prospective population-based cohort study included all patients who had oesophagectomy for cancer in Sweden, excluding clinical T1 N0, recorded in the National Register for Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer, 2006–2014. Patients were stratified into three groups: surgery alone, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Results Neoadjuvant treatment was given to 521 patients (51·1 per cent) and 499 (48·9 per cent) received surgery alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased the risk of postoperative surgical complications compared with surgery alone (adjusted odds ratio 2·01, 95 per cent c.i. 1·24 to 3·25; P = 0·005). Postoperative mortality was significantly increased after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with surgery alone (odds ratio 2·37, 1·06 to 5·29; P = 0·035). Survival improved in patients with squamous cell carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy survival was significantly improved only in the subgroup with the highest performance status and without known co-morbidity. In adenocarcinoma there was a trend towards improved overall survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy did not offer a survival benefit. Stratified analysis including only patients with adenocarcinoma in the highest performance category without known co-morbidity showed a strong trend towards improved survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery alone (adjusted hazard ratio 0·47, 0·21 to 1·04; P = 0·061). Conclusion For patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction, neoadjuvant treatments seemed to increase long-term survival, but also the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality, compared with surgery alone. Neither neoadjuvant treatment option seemed to improve survival significantly among patients with adenocarcinoma, compared with surgery alone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10304", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2527723365", "source": "openalex"}

Until recently, no specific tool was available for assessing gastro-intestinal related quality of life (GI QOL) in patients with CF. As the Horizon2020 project MyCyFAPP aims to improve GI QOL by using a newly designed mobile application, a sensitive and reliable outcome measure was needed. We aimed to study the applicability of the existing child-specific Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Module (PedsQL GI) in children with CF. Methods A multicenter, prospective observational study was performed in 6 European centers to validate the PedsQL GI in children with CF during 3 months. Results In total, 248 children and their parents were included. Within-patient variability of PedsQL GI was low (24.11), and there was reasonable agreement between children and parents (ICC 0.681). Nine of 14 subscales were informative (no ceiling effect). The PedsQL GI and the median scores for 4 subscales were significantly lower in patients compared to healthy controls. Positive associations were found between PedsQL GI and age (OR = 1.044, p = 0.004) and between PedsQL GI and BMI z-score (OR = 1.127, p = 0.036). PedsQL GI correlated with most CFQ-R subscales (r 0.268 to 0.623) and with a Visual Analogue Scale (r = 0.20).

The total number of TLOSRs decreased significantly from 8.2 +/- 0.8 in the first to 5.7 +/- 0.5 in the second and 4.4 +/- 0.6 in the third 70-min recording period. The number of TLOSRs accompanied by liquid-containing reflux decreased from 4.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.4, while the numbers of TLOSRs with gas reflux remained unchanged (2.1 +/- 0.6-2.1 +/- 0.7-2.2 +/- 0.6). Besides, time after the meal, no differences were observed in the characteristics of TLOSRs with and without gastro-oesophageal reflux. We conclude that factors, other than TLOSR characteristics, are important of whether or not a TLOSR is reflux-related.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2006.00817.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2024313937", "source": "openalex"}

This paper focuses on health food that encourages consumption through the promise of health benefits. In this context, media representation of such food serves as a lens to explore the spread of consumer culture in Australia. Using a historical perspective, this paper asserts that in promoting such foods, food \"experts\" form an advisory nexus in an increasing context of \"gastro‐anomy\" that Fischler (1980) speaks of. Fifty years of advertising, editorial content and articles are examined from the Australian Women's Weekly. Warde's (1997) antinomies of tastes are used as a starting point to show how the anxiety and risks associated with food consumption are built up and allayed.

It is a chronic condition and follow-up studies indicate the presence of symptoms at least 20 years after initial diagnosis. In addition to lifestyle modifications, management usually involves the use of an acid suppressant from the H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor groups or a prokinetic agent at some stage. In terms of initial symptom resolution and mucosal healing the proton pump inhibitors are consistently superior to the other available agents. However, while it is possible to keep the majority of patients in remission while taking medications, almost all patients have a recurrence of symptoms within six months of stopping medications. The introduction of laparoscopic fundoplication has produced promising initial results but the long-term benefits of this procedure remain to be established.

In many countries, these interventions are thus being performed in the general clinical setting. The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence on the effect of endoscopic therapies for GORD. A systematic search of the literature on this subject in English, indexed in MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007) and in the Cochrane Library, was carried out. For the study selection, retrospective and prospective open-label and randomized, sham-controlled trials were taken into account. The exclusion criteria included the following: case series that included fewer than 10 patients, abstracts, studies involving children or those with a follow-up shorter than 3 months. For data extraction, two reviewers, using standardized forms, independently abstracted data on study design and methods, population, sample size, function studies (e.g. pH-metry), type of endoscopic treatment, follow-up, health-related and quality of life scores, outcomes and complications. Data synthesis involved the following: 43 studies, including four randomized, sham-controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria, out of 4182 citations. The primary end point in most studies was the reduction of the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) by more than 50%. In view of these findings, the majority of studies suggested the efficacy of endoluminal therapies for the control of symptoms in GORD. In the sham-controlled studies, the effect of placebo was, nevertheless, as high as 50%. Most studies were small feasibility studies, with follow-ups of less than 1 year. No study comparing endoscopic techniques with other established treatment options such as PPIs existed. All endoscopic therapies were associated with a small but important percentage of mild to severe complications, which included perforation, abscess and death. In conclusion, the data from most of the short-term follow-up and the few sham-controlled studies demonstrate that subgroups of patients experienced improvement or resolution of typical GORD symptoms and decreased PPI usage. Currently, however, there are not enough scientific and clinical data on safety, efficacy and durability to support the use of endoluminal therapies for GORD in routine clinical practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0b013e3282f16a21", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2047613269", "source": "openalex"}

The maximum hydrogen bond-forming capacity corrected for intra-molecular H-bonding (H b c ) and Lien's QSAR model were used in this study. The latest CQSAR software was utilized in calculating the logarithm of partition coefficient in octanol/water (Clog P) and in deriving all regression equations. For 51 compounds, a significant correlation was obtained between Caco-2 cell permeability (log Pcaco-2)and Hbc, octanol/PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4) distribution coefficient (log Doct), log MW and an indicator variable (I) for the charge, with a correlation coefficient of 0.797. When these compounds were divided into three subgroups, namely neutral, cationic and anionic compounds, much better correlations (r = 0.968, 0.915 and 0.931, respectively) were obtained using different combinations of various physicochemical parameters. A plot of human GI absorption vs. Caco-2 cell permeability obtained from different laboratories reveals that Caco-2 cell permeability cannot be used to precisely predict human GI absorption for compounds with Pcaco-2 below 5 x 10-6cm/s, due to interlaboratory and experimental variabilities, and the lack of a simple correlation between human GI absorption and Caco-2 cell permeability.

In these patients symptom relief and patient satisfaction with therapy are of fundamental importance. Cisapride has well-documented prokinetic effects and may be well suited for long-term therapy of GORD, but its effectiveness in purely symptomatic treatment is unknown. We therefore compared two dosage regimens of cisapride with placebo over a period of 6 months in patients with evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux, initially treated with antisecretory medication, with regard to maintaining symptom relief and satisfaction with treatment. Methods: Five hundred and thirty-five patients with reflux oesophagitis grade 1 (n = 293) or 2 (n = 124) or with no reflux oesophagitis but pathologic 24-h pH-metry (n = 118) achieved satisfactory symptom relief with an H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor within 4–8 weeks. In a double-blind randomized, parallel-group study, they were then treated with cisapride, 20 mg at night or 20 mg twice daily, or placebo and followed up for a maximum period of 6 months. Relapse was defined as dissatisfaction with therapy or an average consumption of more than two antacid tablets a day. Results: Median time to relapse was 63 days for cisapride, 20 mg twice daily; 59 days for cisapride, 20 mg at night; and 49 days for placebo. Time to relapse was not significantly different (P = 0.09). Presence and grade of oesophagitis at base line, type of therapy before randomization, and pattern of non-reflux symptoms at base line did not influence these findings significantly. Conclusion: The study indicates that cisapride is of limited value in maintenance therapy of GORD in patients in whom symptom relief has been accomplished with potent antisecretory medication. This ‘step-down’ approach to therapy seems disadvantageous in the long-term therapy of GORD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529709002988", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986108044", "source": "openalex"}

In patients with reflux oesophagitis, treatment with the acid pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has repeatedly been demonstrated to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and of erosive and/or ulcerative lesions in the oesophagus. Comparative trials have shown that an average of 82% of oesophagitis patients were maintained in endoscopic and symptomatic remission over a period of 12 months when treated with omeprazole, 20 mg once daily. This compares with only 36% of patients in remission when given 'full-dose' H2-receptor antagonist therapy (ranitidine, 300 mg daily). It is interesting to note that, in a recent trial, 62% of reflux oesophagitis patients were in remission after 12 months of treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg once daily, compared with the corresponding figure of 72% among those on 20 mg once daily. In patients poorly responsive to control of oesophagitis with H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole at a dose of at least 20 mg daily is required to achieve symptom resolution and endoscopic healing — and remission can be maintained for years with continued omeprazole treatment. Omeprazole has been shown to have a good long-term safety profile, as evaluated in these trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529409105368", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154753708", "source": "openalex"}

Thus, new formulations are needed in order to improve its oral bioavailability. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and characterize a gastro-resistant formulation of resveratrol for oral administration as a dietary supplement. Method: Resveratrol was encapsulated in Eudragit-coated pectin-alginate microparticles. Results: The microparticle size was about 1450 µm, with an encapsulation efficiency of 41.72% ± 1.92%. The dissolution assay conducted, as specified in the European Pharmacopoeia for delayed-release dosage forms, revealed that our microparticles were gastro-resistant, because the resveratrol percentage released from microparticles in acid medium was less than 10%. In addition, the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method developed for resveratrol content quantification in the microparticles was validated according to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q2 (R1) guidelines. Finally, the biological activity of resveratrol was investigated in 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, concluding that the encapsulation process does not affect the activity of resveratrol. Conclusion: In summary, the gastro-resistant microparticles developed could represent a suitable method of including resveratrol in dietary supplements and in functional foods used in obesity therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules23081886", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2884328829", "source": "openalex"}

Rates of complications and perioperative mortality have been reported in few mostly retrospective single-center series, but there has been no detailed analysis on risk factors for perioperative complications and mortality to date. Methods Data of patients with GEP-NENs operated between January 2015 and September 2018 were retrieved from EUROCRINE©, a European online endocrine surgical quality registry, and analyzed regarding rate and risk factors of surgical complications. Risk factors were assessed by logistic regression. Results Some 376 patients (211 female, 167 male; age median 63, range 15–89 years) were included. Most NENs were located in the small intestine (SI) ( n = 132) or pancreas ( n = 111), the rest in the stomach ( n = 34), duodenum ( n = 30), appendix ( n = 30), colon, and rectum ( n = 22), or with unknown primary ( n = 15). Of the tumors, 320 (85.1%) were well or moderately differentiated, and 147 (39.1%) of the patients had distant metastases at the time of operation. Severe complications (Dindo-Clavien ≥ 3) occurred in 56 (14.9%) patients, and 4 (1.1%) patients died perioperatively. Severe complications were more frequent in surgery for duodenopancreatic NENs ( n = 31; 22.0%) compared with SI-NENs ( n = 15; 11.4%) ( p = 0.014), in patients with lymph node metastases operated with curative aim of surgery ( n = 24; 21.4%) versus non-metastasized tumors or palliative surgery ( n = 32; 12.1%) ( p = 0.020), and in functioning tumors ( n = 20; 23.0%) versus non-functioning tumors ( n = 30; 13.5%) ( p = 0.042).

Several reports looking at gastro-oesophageal reflux after meals of different fat content have been controversial probably because of differences in caloric load, volume and osmolarity, factors which may independently influence reflux. Recent observations suggest that fatty meals do not promote gastro-oesophageal reflux nor alter the competence of the oesophagogastric junction in comparison to balanced meals, provided they contain the same energy load. The possibility that fat increases heartburn by modulating perception of acid reflux seems to have little relevance.

No significant differences were found for any of the motility variables, especially the number and the type of contractions, the peristaltic amplitude, duration, and propagation velocity did not show any changes. Separate analysis of motility variables before and after healing in the low and high grade oesophagitis groups yielded similar results. Oesophageal motor response to reflux was investigated by analysis of all contractions occurring in the two minute period after the onset of each reflux episode. Both motor response and oesophageal acid exposure (% time pH &lt; 4, number of reflux episodes) did not change after healing of oesophagitis, thus implying that acid clearance remained unchanged.

Microbial eco-system of the gastrointestinal tract of wild herbivorous animals. J. Appl. Anim. Res., 21: 207–230. The microbial eco-system of the gastro-intestinal tract plays a very significant role in bioconversion of lignocellulosic feeds into volatile fatty acids. Their role becomes more important when the diet given to the animals is of poor quality e.g. in the wild animals, which have to survive on the natural vegetation in the forests and in lean season the availability of nutritious feed is scarce. Thus the animals have to depend upon the efficiency of the microbial eco-system of the gastro-intestinal tract for extracting the maximum possible nutrients from such feeds. The literature available on the eco-system of wild animals is not much, but these studies conducted in different laboratories have been compiled and presented in this review. Most of the microbial groups reported in wild animals are similar to those found in the domestic animals, but there do exist some exceptions in which new species of protozoa, bacteria and fungi have been reported. Some of these microbes are host specific. Therefore, the studies of the microbial eco-system of the gastro-intestinal tract of wild animals is very important and interesting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2002.9706370", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030656631", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 17 mechanistic studies identified by the searches, 15 reported that a minority of reflux episodes occurred during stable sleep, but the prevailing sleep state at the onset of reflux in these studies remains unclear owing to insufficient temporal resolution of recording or analysis methods. Two studies, in healthy individuals and patients with GERD, analysed sleep and pH with adequate resolution for temporal alignment of sleep state and the onset of reflux: all 232 sleep period reflux episodes evaluated occurred during arousals from sleep lasting less than 15 s or during longer duration awakenings. Six mechanistic studies found that transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations were the most common mechanism of sleep period reflux.Contrary to the prevailing view, subjective impairment of sleep in GERD is unlikely to be due to the occurrence of reflux during stable sleep, but could result from slow clearance of acid reflux that occurs during arousals or awakenings from sleep.

What this study adds • This study provides the first data on the frequency of exacerbation and precipitation of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms amongst users of CAs. • It also provides evidence of the likely potential of the different CAs to cause such symptoms and highlights the need for a prospective study into CA therapy. • The data from the study should heighten prescribers' awareness of the potential of these agents to exacerbate/precipitate GORD, and to consider avoiding CAs in patients with GORD or withdrawing them in patients in whom GORD symptoms develop or worsen. Aims A cohort retrospective observational study was undertaken to determine the relationship between calcium antagonist (CA) use and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), as well the ability of CAs to precipitate or exacerbate noncardiac chest pain, an atypical symptom of GORD. Methods Eligible patients were those prescribed CAs for hypertension without a history of ischaemic heart disease or nitrate use. Patients were recruited through 15 pharmacies (hospital 1, community 14). Patients giving informed consent were administered a standard questionnaire to obtain information including history of reflux symptoms before and during treatment with CAs, and the management of these symptoms. Results Three hundred and seventy‐one participants were enrolled. Their mean age was 64 years (SD ± 12.7 years), 51.2% were females and 48.8% males. Of the 130 patients with pre‐existing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, 59 (45.4%) reported a worsening of reflux symptoms during CA therapy. Increases in both frequency and severity of symptoms were most common amongst patients on amlodipine (61.3%; P ≤ 0.0001) and least common amongst those taking diltiazem (12.5%). Reflux‐related symptoms developed in 85 (35.3%) of the 241 previously asymptomatic patients during CA therapy, with verapamil having the greatest number of reports (39.1%; P = 0.001) and diltiazem the least (30.7%). Conclusions Diltiazem appears the least likely of the CAs to precipitate or exacerbate reflux symptoms. Further research using a prospective design could test whether it may be more appropriate to use diltiazem in patients with ischaemic heart disease and could assess the appropriateness of CA therapy in patients with moderate to severe GORD. Increasing prescriber and pharmacist awareness of these adverse effects may result in better patient outcomes and potentially reduce treatment costs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2007.02851.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020774154", "source": "openalex"}

The phase II RTCMIENDOMETRE trial was designed to test the hypothesis that IMRT could reduce the incidence of grade 2 or more acute GI toxicity to less than 30% in patients irradiated post-operatively for an endometrial cancer.Patients with post-operative stage Ib G3, Ic or II endometrial carcinomas with no history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease were eligible. Guidelines for volume delineation and dose prescription were detailed in the protocol. The investigators were advised to use a web-based atlas developed for the RTOG 0418 study. The dose of the vaginal and nodal PTV was 45Gy in 25 fractions. To assess the ability of the participating centres to comply with the protocol guidelines, they were requested to complete a dummy run procedure before inclusion of their 1st patient. GI and genito-urinary (GU) toxicity were graded according to the CTCAE V 3.0 classification and were prospectively recorded every week during irradiation, as well as at time of brachytherapy insertions and during the follow-up visit at week 15 (W15). Special attention was given to note any changes to the grade of adverse events between W5 and W15.From May 2008 to April 2010, 49 patients from 6 centres were recruited for the trial. One patient could not be treated, one patient died of vascular stroke at W3 without toxicity, and 1 patient refused to be followed-up after treatment. Thus, 46 cases were available for analysis at W15. The distribution by stage was as follows: Ib 16.3%, Ic 64.2%, II 20.4%. Thirty six patients (75%) received an additional vaginal vault boost of 6-10Gy delivered by HDR brachytherapy in 1 or 2 fractions. Among the 47 patients who completed IMRT, 27% (95% CI 14.5-39.7%) developed at least 1 GI grade 2 adverse event (diarrhoea in 92% of cases), which mainly occurred at W4 and W5.

On the 15 th postoperative day however, our patient was readmitted in the Intensive Care Unit with severe bilateral basal pneumonia. Three days later a gastro-tracheal fistula was diagnosed upon gastroscopy and bronchoscopy. His good general condition allowed for an endoscopic primary approach which consisted in the insertion of a covered stent in the trachea along with clipping and glueing of the gastric fistular orifice. Two attempts proved unsuccessful. Conclusion After several weeks of conservative measures, surgical re-intervention through a right thoracotomy with transection of the fistula and closure by primary interrupted sutures of both fistular orifices along with intercostal muscle flap interposition led to excellent patient outcome. Oral feeding was started and our patient was discharged.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-4-69", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145228037", "source": "openalex"}

The relationship between these manifestations and disease severity, night‐time GERD and functioning has not been determined. Aim To determine if atypical manifestations are related to increased disease severity, night‐time GERD and decreased functioning. Methods A web survey among US adults was conducted, using a validated GERD screener. Frequency of night‐time and daytime typical symptoms (acid regurgitation and heartburn) and atypical manifestations were assessed. Respondents were classified as night‐time GERD or daytime GERD based on typical symptom frequency. Prevalence of frequent atypical manifestations (≥2 days or nights/week) was assessed. Results Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease cases had a higher prevalence of each atypical manifestation ( P &lt; 0.05 for all) compared with controls. Night‐time GERD respondents had a higher prevalence of atypical manifestations compared with daytime GERD respondents ( P &lt; 0.05 for most manifestations) and the prevalence of atypical manifestations increased with GERD symptom severity ( P &lt; 0.05 for most).

Most patients are treated empirically (without specific diagnostic evaluation e.g. endoscopy. Among patients who have an upper endoscopy, findings range from a normal appearance, mild erythema to severe oesophagitis with stricture formation. Patients without visible damage to the oesophagus have endoscopy negative reflux disease (ENRD). The pathogenesis of ENRD, and its response to treatment may differ from GORD with oesophagitis. Objectives Summarise, quantify and compare the efficacy of short‐term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), H2‐receptor antagonists (H2RA) and prokinetics in adults with GORD, treated empirically and in those with endoscopy negative reflux disease (ENRD). Search methods We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2008), EMBASE (January 1988 to November 2008), and EBMR in November 2008. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials reporting symptomatic outcome after short‐term treatment for GORD using proton pump inhibitors, H2‐receptor antagonists or prokinetic agents. Participants had to be either from an empirical treatment group (no endoscopy used in treatment allocation) or from an endoscopy negative reflux disease group (no signs of erosive oesophagitis). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Thirty‐two trials (9738 participants) were included: fifteen in the empirical treatment group, thirteen in the ENRD group and four in both. In empirical treatment of GORD the relative risk (RR) for heartburn remission (the primary efficacy variable) in placebo‐controlled trials for PPI was 0.37 (two trials, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.44), for H2RAs 0.77 (two trials, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99) and for prokinetics 0.86 (one trial, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01). In a direct comparison PPIs were more effective than H2RAs (seven trials, RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.73) and prokinetics (two trials, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87). In treatment of ENRD, the RR for heartburn remission for PPI versus placebo was 0.73 (eight trials, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.78) and for H2RA versus placebo was 0.84 (two trials, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95). The RR for PPI versus H2RA was 0.78 (three trials, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97) and for PPI versus prokinetic 0.72 (one trial, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92).

In the field of GERD, current data focusing on different locations of H pylori infection detect significant differences between antrum‐ and corpus predominant gastritis explainable by different changes in acid secretion in different gastric niches. High volume studies from Sweden and Brazil underline the safety of H pylori eradication concerning the risk of Barret's esophagus or adenocarcinoma. The relationship between H pylori infection and EOE remains uncertain, but current data supports the concept of expected positive and protective effects of H pylori exposure reducing the risk of EOE. Analyzing biomarkers might be helpful to identify subjects under risk for the development of precancerous lesions after H pylori infection, where microRNAs, IL‐9 and IL‐4, and also Tc17/9 and Th17/9 and microbiota profiles showed promising results to identify subgroups under risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/hel.12738", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2971966449", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pH and duodeno-gastro-oesophageal reflux in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease at night in the supine position. Design A prospective study of 113 patients with reflux symptoms [63 without erosive oesophagitis (group 1), 23 with erosive oesophagitis (group 2), 27 Barrett's oesophagus (group 3)] and 15 controls. Methods All subjects underwent 24 h ambulatory oesophageal pH and bilirubin and gastric pH monitoring. For the supine period, oesophageal pH during episodes of bile reflux was calculated, and the temporal relationship between individual oesophageal and gastric alkaline shift and oesophageal bile reflux episodes was established. The supine period was divided into four equal segments and the temporal patterns of acid and bile reflux and alkaline shift in each of the four supine time segments were investigated. Results Both acid and bile reflux are severe in Barrett's oesophagus, particularly at night. Nocturnal oesophageal bile reflux occurs mostly between pH 4 and 7 in all groups: 67.6%, 76.5% and 41.4% of the supine period for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (P< 0.001 vs. pH < 4 or > 7). Individual oesophageal bile reflux and oesophageal or gastric alkaline shift episodes rarely coincide. Acid reflux predominates in the first half of the night (P> 0.001), oesophageal bile reflux and alkaline shift continue throughout the night, gastric alkaline shift increases towards the end of the night (P > 0.001). Conclusion Duodenal contents in the oesophagus exist at a wide pH range, and may have passed through an acid or an alkaline stomach. This has implications for the damage which individual constituents are able to cause.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-199805000-00006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087841152", "source": "openalex"}

By multiple regression analysis it was found that the pressure in the distal oesophageal high pressure zone, the presence of a hiatal hernia, the intra-abdominal length of the high pressure zone, the amplitude of the contraction waves in the distal oesophagus and age all significantly participated in the determination of the amount of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The pressure in the distal oesophageal high pressure zone was the single variable that correlated most strongly to the amount of reflux. Although the amount of reflux increased significantly with increasing weight as measured by Broca's index, this variable did not participate in the determination of reflux by the multiple regression test. The study emphasizes the role of the pressure and intra-abdominal length of the distal oesophageal high pressure zone as the primary antireflux barrier.

Cost-effectiveness was assessed alongside the trial using a NHS perspective for costs and expressing health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).Follow-up was by annual postal questionnaire and selective hospital case notes review; initial recruitment in 21 UK hospitals.Questionnaire responders among the 810 original participants. At entry, all had documented evidence of GORD and symptoms for > 12 months. Questionnaire response rates (years 1-5) were from 89.5% to 68.9%.Three hundred and fifty-seven participants were recruited to the randomised comparison (178 randomised to surgical management and 179 randomised to continued medical management) and 453 to the preference groups (261 surgical management and 192 medical management). The surgeon chose the type of fundoplication.Primary: disease-specific outcome measure (the REFLUX questionnaire); secondary: Short Form questionnaire-36 items (SF-36), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), NHS resource use, reflux medication, complications.The randomised groups were well balanced. By 5 years, 63% in the randomised surgical group and 13% in the randomised medical management group had received a total or partial wrap fundoplication (85% and 3% in the preference groups), with few perioperative complications and no associated deaths. At 1 year (and 5 years) after surgery, 36% (41%) in the randomised surgical group - 15% (26%) of those who had surgery - were taking proton pump inhibitor medication compared with 87% (82%) in the randomised medical group. At each year, differences in the REFLUX score significantly favoured the randomised surgical group (a third of a SD; p< 0.01 at 5 years). SF-36 and EQ-5D scores also favoured surgery, but differences attenuated over time and were generally not statistically significant at 5 years. The worse the symptoms at trial entry, the larger the benefit observed after surgery. Those randomised to medical management who subsequently had surgery had low baseline scores that markedly improved after surgery. Following fundoplication, 3% had surgical treatment for a complication and 4% had subsequent reflux-related operations - most often revision of the wrap. Dysphagia, flatulence and inability to vomit were similar in the two randomised groups. The economic analysis indicated that surgery was the more cost-effective option for this patient group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surgery in the base case was £7028 per additional QALY; these findings were robust to changes in approaches and assumptions. The probability of surgery being cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per additional QALY was > 0.80 for all analyses.After 5 years, laparoscopic fundoplication continues to provide better relief of GORD symptoms with associated improved health-related quality of life.

Interestingly, prevalence rates appear to be increasing in these countries, with a remarkable increase of GERD‐related lethal and nonlethal complications. However, these complications are rare on a global scale. This review aims to summarize the current concepts of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that need to be considered whilst caring for patients with these disorders. GERD is defined by the augmented exposure of oesophageal mucosa to acidic content, and is associated with specific symptoms or mucosal lesions. A number of factors may contribute to the manifestation of GERD. Although recent studies emphasize the role of genetic factors, there are many other risk factors that play a pivotal role in the development of GERD and GERD complications. Some nutritional factors are believed to aggravate acidic reflux either by delaying gastric emptying or diminishing the pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincters. Patients are often advised to sleep with their heads elevated, but this advice is not easy to follow and has not been proven effective with regard to long‐term outcome. Other lifestyle modifications include changes to the patient's diet, which are important but not frequently sufficient. Thus, medication is usually necessary for symptom control. Proton pump inhibitors are now mainstream treatment for the reduction of acid secretion in patients with severe manifestations and 4‐week healing rates are approaching 90%.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02224.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072445469", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To discuss the clinical application of the impedance technique for the assessment of bolus transit and gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Methods Review of the literature on intra‐oesophageal impedance monitoring of bolus transit and gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Results Using impedance criteria, normal oesophageal bolus clearance can be defined as complete clearance of at least 80% of liquid boluses and at least 70% of viscous boluses. Impedance recording identifies oesophageal function abnormalities in non‐obstructive dysphagia patients and in patients with postfundoplication dysphagia. The impedance technique seems to be less suitable for the most severe end of the dysphagia spectrum like achalasia. Intra‐oesophageal impedance monitoring detects reflux events independent of the pH of the refluxate, which allows identification of non‐acid reflux episodes. In addition, use of impedance monitoring enables assessment of the composition (liquid, gas, mixed) and proximal extent of the refluxate. Combined impedance–pH monitoring is more accurate than pH alone for the detection of both acid and weakly acidic reflux. Furthermore, addition of impedance monitoring to pH increases the yield of symptom association analysis both in patients off and on proton pump inhibitor therapy. Conclusions Intra‐oesophageal impedance monitoring is a feasible technique for the assessment of bolus transit and gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Combined impedance–manometry provides clinically important information about oesophageal function abnormalities and combined impedance–pH monitoring identifies the relationship between symptoms and all types of reflux events regarding acidity and composition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03863.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115004414", "source": "openalex"}

Insidious productivity losses through reduced feed intake and decreased efficiency in feed utilization, associated with subclinical or chronic conditions of parasitic infections are often the cause of large economic losses. The objectives of this study were to: 1) assess the prevalence of GI parasitism in dairy cows in Thailand; 2) determine the species of existing GI parasites; and 3) compare GI parasitic rates of cows from different regions of Thailand. The study was conducted in four parts of Thailand. A total of 1,599 fecal samples were collected and subjected to ethyl-acetate centrifugation to identify the stages of any parasites. The overall prevalence of parasitic infection was 46.6 % (745/ 1599). Cows aged between 1 to 5 y had the highest infection rate (51.4 %). Cows older than 5 y and younger than 1 y had rates of 41.8 and 33.8 %, respectively. The highest percentage of infected cows by region was in the South (98.4 %). Cows in the North, Central, and Northeast were had infection rates of 66.4, 18.2 and 16.7 %, respectively. The herd infection rate of GI parasites in dairy farms in the South was the highest (14/14, 100 %) compared to the North (37/42, 88.1 %), Northeast (30/46, 65.2 %), and Central (28/60, 46.7 %). GI parasites were identified as Entamoeba, rumen fluke, coccidia, Strongyles, Fasciola, Moniezia, Trichuris, Strongyloides, and Giardia. The high incidence of parasitism of cows might have been due to the relative low influence of feeding behavior and a deworming program. In circumstances of very high infection, management and treatment is highly recommended.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2184250743", "source": "openalex"}

It impairs health related quality of life (HRQL). However, the impact on utility scores and work productivity in patients with moderate to severe GERD is not well known. Methods We analyzed data from 217 patients with moderate to severe GERD (mean age 50, SD 13.7) across 17 Canadian centers. Patients completed three utility instruments – the standard gamble (SG), the feeling thermometer (FT), and the Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI 3) – and several HRQL instruments, including Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD) and the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36). All patients received a proton pump inhibitor, esomeprazole 40 mg daily, for four to six weeks. Results The mean scores on a scale from 0 (dead) to 1 (full health) obtained for the FT, SG, and HUI 3 were 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.70), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.80), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.82) respectively.

The LMA® Gastro™ Airway, a novel dual channel supraglottic airway technique, has been described as such a device. Its utility alongside sedation with low flow nasal cannula and general anaesthesia (GA) with intubation for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures was evaluated. Methods Details of all the ERCPs performed in our institution from March 2017 to June 2018 were carefully recorded in the patients’ electronic case records. Data on the successful completion of ERCP through LMA® Gastro™ Airway; any difficulty encountered by the gastroenterologists; and adverse events were recorded. Episodes of hypoxia (SpO 2 &lt; 92%) and haemodynamic parameters were compared across the three groups: LMA® Gastro™ vs. sedation with low flow nasal cannula vs. GA with an endotracheal tube (ETT). Results One hundred seventy-seven ERCP procedures were performed during the study period. The LMA® Gastro™ Airway was employed in 64 procedures (36%) on 59 patients. Of these 64 procedures, ERCP was successfully completed with LMA® Gastro™ Airway in 63 (98%) instances, with only one case requiring conversion to an endotracheal tube. This instance followed difficulty in negotiating the endoscope through LMA® Gastro™ Airway. No episodes of hypoxia or hypercapnia were documented in both LMA® Gastro™ and GA with ETT groups. One sedation case with nasal cannula was noted to have hypoxia. Adverse intraoperative events were recognised in 2 cases of LMA® Gastro™: one had minimal blood stained secretions from the oral cavity that resolved with suctioning; the other developed mild laryngospasm which resolved spontaneously within a few minutes. Conclusion In patients undergoing ERCP, the LMA® Gastro™ airway demonstrated a high success rate for ERCP completion. Ventilation was well maintained with minimal intraoperative and postoperative adverse events. This technique may have a role in higher risk groups such as high ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) status, or those with potential airway difficulties such as high body mass index and those with known or suspected sleep apnoea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01019-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3025303146", "source": "openalex"}

Catheter‐based pH testing has several limitations, including issues of sensitivity, specificity, tolerability and the inability to record non‐acid reflux events. In an effort to improve upon these drawbacks, several devices have been introduced, including the Bilitec system for measuring duodenogastro‐oesophageal reflux; intraluminal impedance monitoring, which detects the distribution, composition and clearing of both acid and non‐acid oesophageal reflux; and a wireless pH monitoring device, the Bravo capsule. Initial investigations using the Bilitec system demonstrated that duodenogastro‐oesophageal reflux tracked very closely with acid reflux and decreased with proton‐pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, casting doubt on the clinical utility of Bilitec monitoring. Recent evidence revealed a possible role for duodenogastro‐oesophageal reflux in a subset of patients who continue to report reflux symptoms in the setting of normalized oesophageal acid exposure on high‐dose PPI therapy. When combined with pH monitoring, impedance monitoring enhances the detection and characterization of gastro‐oesophageal reflux and may have a role in the evaluation of certain specific gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms that persist despite acid suppression therapy. The utility of the Bravo wireless technology for GERD diagnosis has been validated in several studies, with improvements over catheter‐based pH monitoring in tolerability, accuracy and sensitivity, as well as the ability to record periods both off and on PPI therapy in a single study. All three diagnostic modalities have advanced the understanding of GERD pathogenesis, but their impact on the clinical management of GERD is still the focus of active investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02800.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992814544", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4232600673", "title": "Roles of Gastric Acid and pH in the Pathogenesis of Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease", "text": "In recent years, gastric acid has been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis, though it remains possible that defective oesophageal mucosal resistance may also play some part. Abnormally prolonged and/or frequent exposure of the distal oesophagus to a pH of less than 4 is the major defect; this results from frequent gastro-oesophageal reflux, the impact of which is magnified in about half of the patients by slow oesophageal acid clearance. Abnormal oesophageal acid exposure increases in severity from endoscopy-negative reflux disease through worsening grades of reflux oesophagitis. Pepsin activity has been shown to be a major determinant of the aggressiveness of refluxate and, in turn, the full activity of gastric pepsin requires a pH below 3. Thus, gastric acid probably exerts a predominantly indirect effect on the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis by determining peptic activity. Although bile and other components of small intestinal juice can injure the oesophageal mucosa, these factors are apparently important only in the exceptional patient with very severe reflux disease. Gastric acid hypersecretion is probably also unimportant in the majority of patients. Peptic activity, and hence the aggressiveness of refluxate, are reduced markedly between pH 3 and 4. Achievement of this threshold, pH 3–4, in the daytime is important as, contrary to traditional beliefs, daytime reflux, triggered by food intake, is of the greatest importance in most patients. It appears that the success of acid pump inhibition in the treatment of reflux disease results largely from a unique ability to control food-stimulated acid secretion, thereby maintaining gastric pH sufficiently high in the postprandial period to substantially reduce the oesophageal mucosal damage from food-induced reflux. Most reflux oesophagitis patients respond well to omeprazole, 20 mg once daily; however, in a small proportion of patients with severe oesophagitis this dose gives only an incomplete response. Evaluation of these patients indicates that treatment failure is associated with inadequate control of oesophageal acid exposure; in almost all patients, successful control and a complete response can be achieved with increased omeprazole dose.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529409105365", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4232600673", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1979776868", "title": "current practice and future perspectives in the management of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease", "text": "Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is primarily due to incompetence of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) and crural diaphragm, with transient LOS relaxation frequently accounting for daytime reflux. In the absence of drugs that adequately correct the motility defects of GERD, treatment is directed towards decreasing gastric acidity. Oesophageal healing is related to control of 24‐h intragastric acidity, the degree of acid suppression and duration of treatment. H 2 ‐receptor antagonists are generally less effective in GERD than in peptic ulcer disease. While providing symptomatic relief in non‐erosive GERD, they are often ineffective in healing erosive oesophagitis. Proton pump inhibitors provide more rapid and complete healing and symptom resolution. They are superior to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists in the long‐term management of erosive oesophagitis and in reducing recurrence of oesophageal stricture following mechanical dilatation. In Barrett's oesophagus, high‐dose proton pump inhibitors in combination with laser/photodynamic ablation therapy can produce metaplastic regression, although this does not preclude future emergence of adenocarcinoma. Surgical morbidity and mortality rates in GERD generally remain higher than those associated with long‐term pharmacotherapy. However, direct comparisons between laparascopic anti‐reflux surgery and proton pump inhibitor maintenance therapy remain to be performed. Although there is no evidence that H. pylori infection worsens the severity of oesophagitis or that H. pylori is carcinogenic in the metaplastic oesophageal mucosa, it has been suggested that H. pylori ‐positive patients requiring long‐term proton pump inhibitor therapy receive bacterial eradication therapy to reduce the risk of developing atrophic gastritis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.1997.00181.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979776868", "source": "openalex"}

However, a significant number of patients with GERD-related respiratory symptoms do not report improvement despite aggressive acid-suppressive therapy. Some of these refractory cases may be due to the recently appreciated entity of non-acid or weakly acidic reflux. The aim of our study is to assess the pH-impedance features of GER inducing airway symptoms, compared with GER inducing typical gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms.We prospectively enrolled infants and children with GERD-related respiratory symptoms from January 2015 to December 2015. Age- and sex-matched patients with GERD-related GI symptoms were enrolled as comparison group. The overall number, the acidity pattern, and the height of reflux episodes were compared between the two groups.Forty patients (M/F: 20/20; mean age: 58.3 months) were enrolled in the study group and 40 in the comparison group. The mean acid exposure index was 7.9% within the study group and 15.9% within the comparison group (p:0.026). Children with respiratory symptoms versus children with GI symptoms had a mean of 40.8 acid reflux episodes versus 62.4 (p:0.001), a mean of 2.2 weakly acid reflux episodes versus 20.1 (p:0.002), and a mean of 22.1 weakly alkaline reflux episodes versus 10.2 (P < 0.001). Separate analysis of both infants and children was performed.The main finding of this prospective, controlled study is that children >1 year with GERD-related respiratory symptoms showed a significantly higher number of weakly alkaline refluxes than children with GERD-related GI symptoms. This supports the hypothesis that respiratory symptoms are less related to acidity than GI symptoms.

However, the fate of its antioxidants after oral consumption is not yet reported. To explore this, we hypothesized that EBN antioxidants are released from their matrix when subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. EBN samples were extracted using hot water (100°C) with or without subsequent sequential enzymatic digestion using pepsin (10,000 units), pancreatin (36 mg) and bile extracts (112.5 mg). Additionally, pH changes (8.9 to 2 and back to 8.9) similar to the gut were applied, and a 10 KDa dialysis tubing was used to simulate gut absorption. The antioxidant capacities of the water extracts of EBN before and after digestion were then determined using ABTS and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays, while the protective effects of the EBN samples against hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity in HEPG2 cells were determined using MTT assay and acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Antioxidant assays (ABTS and ORAC) showed that the undigested EBN water extract had little antioxidant activity (1 and 1%, respectively at 1000 μg/mL) while at similar concentrations the digested samples had significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced antioxidant activities, for samples inside (38 and 50%, respectively at 1000 μg/mL) and outside (36 and 50%, respectively at 1000 μg/mL) the dialysis tubing, representing absorbed and unabsorbed samples, respectively. Cell viability and toxicity assays also suggested that the EBN extracts were non-toxic to HEPG2 cells (cell viabilities of over 80% at 1000 μg/mL), while AOPI showed that the extracts protected HEPG2 cells from hydrogen peroxide induced-toxicity. Based on the findings, it is likely that EBN bioactives are released from their matrix when digested in the gut and then absorbed through the gut by passive-mediated transport to exert their functional effects.

After a standardized 24-hour period of pH-monitoring, 39 patients had normal pH reflux scores (normal acid score: NAc-GOR) and 17 had abnormal pH reflux scores (pathological acid score: PAc-GOR). Then, following a 10-h fast, total saliva was collected during ten minutes in all patients and in the healthy control subjects. The composition of the saliva samples was analysed and the titration curve was determined on 200 microliters aliquots by successive addition of 5 microliters volumes of 0.1 N Hcl. The GOR patients had significantly lower salivary concentrations of Na+ and of both free and bound sialic acids and had higher salivary concentrations of inorganic phosphates than the controls.

In the beginning of the titration curve, PAc-GOR patients were significantly different from NAc-GOR patients and from controls. Saliva of both groups of patients presented significant differences in the acidic portion of the titrations curves, at high volumes of added HCl. These data show that the composition of saliva was modified in patients with GOR disease compared to that of normal subjects. A difference in titration curves was also observed with a higher acidic buffering capacity in these GOR patients. The modifications in saliva composition suggest a role for inorganic phosophates in the acid neutralization capacity observed in GOR, perhaps linked with a adaptation to chronic acid exposure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.105.1.19.13152", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063811640", "source": "openalex"}

In experiment 2, 20 piglets (24 days old) (in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement were offered the following diets for 7 days and then sacrificed: T1) basal diet; T2) basal diet + 15 g inulin per kg; T3) basal diet + 16 g lactic acid per kg and T4) basal diet + 15 g inulin per kg + 16 g lactic acid per kg. After slaughtering, tissue samples were taken from the duodenum, jejunum and ileum for morphological measurements. Digesta samples were taken from the ileum, caecum and colon for microbiology and volatile fatty acid analysis. In experiment 1, pigs offered diets containing lactic acid had improved daily gain ( P &lt; 0·01) and food efficiency ( P &lt; 0·05) from days 0 to 7 compared with pigs offered diets containing no lactic acid.

Therefore, we aimed to determine to which extent HRM findings can predict GERD.HRM measurements in 69 patients with GERD and 40 healthy subjects were compared and the predictive value of HRM for the diagnosis of GERD was explored.GERD patients had a significantly lower contraction amplitude (55 vs 64 mmHg; p = 0.045) and basal LES pressure (10 vs 13.2 mmHg; p = 0.034) than healthy controls. GERD patients more often had a hiatal hernia than healthy subjects (30% vs 7%; p = 0.005). Patients with reflux esophagitis had a lower DCI than patients without reflux esophagitis (558 vs 782 mmHg cm s; p = 0.045). No significant difference was seen in contractile front velocity, distal latency, number of peristaltic breaks, residual LES pressure and LES length. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, both esophagogastric junction type I (OR 4.971; 95% CI 1.33-18.59; p = 0.017) and mean wave amplitude (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90-0.98; p = 0.013) were found to be independent predictors of GERD. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these findings were low.Hiatal hernia, low contraction amplitude and LES pressure are associated with GERD, but do not predict the disease with sufficient accuracy. Routine esophageal HRM can therefore not be used to distinguish GERD patients from healthy subjects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12570", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998364734", "source": "openalex"}

Although initially ignored, Edkins’ observations eventually led to the enthusiastic investigation of gastrin and acid regulation in peptic ulcer disease, culminating in important therapeutic advances in the management of acid peptic disease. Following the improved understanding of gastric secretory physiology, and the development of acid suppressants with increasing efficacy, the use of surgical intervention for peptic ulcer disease was almost eliminated. Surgery became obsolete with the discovery of Helicobacter pylori . Three other advances are also influencing modern practice: the gastrotoxicity of aspirin and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs is now increasingly appreciated, the role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and therapy of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the use of intravenous acid‐suppressive agents.

Objectives To assess the efficacy of ANN in achieving a diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) using oesophagoscopy or pH-metry as a diagnostic gold standard and discriminant analysis as a statistical comparator technique in a group of patients with typical GORD symptoms and with or without GORD objective findings (e.g. a positive oesophagoscopy or a pathological oesophageal pH-metry). Methods The sample of 159 cases (88 men, 71 women) presenting with typical symptoms of GORD, were subdivided on the basis of endoscopy and pH-metry results into two groups: GORD patients with or without oesophagitis, group 1 (N=103), and pH and endoscopy-negative patients in whom both examinations were negative, group 2 (N=56). A total of 101 different independent variables were collected: demographic information, medical history, generic health state and lifestyle, intensity and frequency of typical and atypical symptoms based on the Italian version of the Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (Mayo Clinic). The diagnosis was used as a dependent variable. Different ANN models were assessed. Results Specific evolutionary algorithms selected 45 independent variables, concerning clinical and demographic features, as predictors of the diagnosis. The highest predictive performance was achieved by a 'back propagation' ANN, which was consistently 100% accurate in identifying the correct diagnosis compared with 78% obtained by traditional discriminant analysis.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2026290167", "title": "Laparoscopic Anti-Reflux Surgery is Effective in Obese Patients with Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease", "text": "INTRODUCTION Obesity has long been regarded as a risk factor for the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). It has been claimed that surgical efficacy of laparoscopic anti-reflux operations is decreased in obese patients. The aim of this study was to assess whether laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is effective in obese patients with GORD compared to non-obese patients. PATIENT AND METHODS A total of 366 patients (mean age 44 years; range, 12–86 years) underwent laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery between 1997–2003. Of these, 74 patients were considered obese; 58 patients had a body mass index (BMI) of 30–34 kg/m 2 and 16 were classified as morbidly obese with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 . Pre-operative symptomatic scoring, indications for surgery, pH studies, operative times and complications were compared between obese and non-obese patients. Symptomatic outcome and Visick score between the two groups were assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year following surgery. RESULTS Failure of medical treatment was the main reason for surgery in all groups. Operative time was longer in obese patients (mean time 93 min compared to 81 min; P = 0.0007), the main difficulty being gaining access because of their body habitus. All groups found the procedure to be effective in symptomatic outcome, 91% of obese patients compared to 92% of non-obese patients scored Visick I or II at 6 weeks' postoperatively. Similar Visick scoring was shown between the two groups at 6 months and 1 year, and in the morbidly obese group. CONCLUSIONS The outcome of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is similar between obese and non-obese patients with no trend towards a worse outcome in the obese or morbidly obese. Obesity should not be seen as a contra-indication, although it may be more technically challenging in this group of patients. Good results can be achieved in obese patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1308/003588407x205323", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026290167", "source": "openalex"}

Of the ducks examined, 167 (81.1 %) were infected by one/more species of gastro-intestinal helminths. A total of ten species of helminth parasites were recovered from gastrointestinal tract, of which four species were trematodes namely: Echinostoma revolutum, Notocotylus attenuatus, Hypoderaeum conoideum and Echinoparyphium recurvatum; two were nematodes, namely, Amidostomum anseris, Capillaria contorta; two were cestodes, viz, Hymenolepis coronula and Fimbriaria fasciolaris and two species belonged to acanthocephala such as, Arythmorhynchus anser and Filicollis anatis. Single double and mixed infections were found in 78 (46.7%), 46 (27.5%) and 43 (25.8%) ducks, respectively. Prevalence of gastrointestinal helminth was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in female ducks (82.7 %) than male ducks (77.6%). Ducks above six month to one year of age were more affected (53.9%) than the ducks &lt; 6 month (15.0%) and &gt; 1 year of age (31.1%). Helminth infection was significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower in rainy season (64.9%) in contrast to summer (75.7 %) and winter season (91.1 %). In heavy infections of E. revolutum haemorrhagic enteritis were noticed and parasites were firmly attached with the mucosa. E. recurvatum caused thickening of the serosal surface of intestinal wall. N. attenuatus produced catarrhal tryplitis characterized by thickening of the villi and formation of oeosinophilic granulomas. Massive infections with H. coronula produced inflammatory changes in the small intestine. Grossly petechial haemorrhages to ulcerative lesions were produced by A. anseris. In proventriculus circular ulcerative and necrotic areas with degeneration of the glandular tissues were seen. A. anser was also found in between the horney and muscular layer of the gizzard where they produced pin pointed haemorrhagic lesions and in severe case parasites were embedded into the mucosal layers of gizzard. For the control of helminths infections mass deworming is necessary. Keywords: Gastro-intestinal helminths; Ducks; Epidemiology; Pathology DOI: 10.3329/jbau.v7i1.4969 J. Bangladesh Agril.

Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic value of microenvironment and tumor inflammatory features (MoTIFs) in GEP-NENs. For this purpose, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 350 patients were profiled by immunohistochemistry for immune, inflammatory, angiogenesis, proliferation, NEN-, and fibroblast-related markers. A total of 314 patients were used to generate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) MoTIFs prognostic indices (PIs). PIs and additional variables were assessed using Cox models to generate nomograms for predicting 5-year OS and DFS. A total of 36 patients were used for external validation of PIs and nomograms' prognostic segregations. From our analysis, G1/G2 versus G3 GEP-NENs showed phenotypic divergence with immune-inflammatory markers. HLA, CD3, CD8, and PD-1/PD-L1 IHC expression separated G3 into two sub-categories with high versus low adaptive immunity-related features. MoTIFs PI for OS based on COX-2Tumor(T) > 4, PD-1Stromal(S) > 0, CD8S < 1, and HLA-IS < 1 was associated with worst survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12-2.96; p < 0.0001). MoTIFs PI for DFS was based on COX-2T > 4, PD-1S > 4, HLA-IS < 1, HLA-IT < 2, HLA-DRS < 6 (HR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.58-1.99; p < 0.0001). Two nomograms were developed including morphology (HR 4.83; 95% CI, 2.30-10.15; p < 0.001) and Ki-67 (HR 11.32; 95% CI, 5.28-24.24; p < 0.001) for OS, and morphology (PI = 0: HR 10.23; 95% CI, 5.67-18.47; PI = 5: HR 2.87; 95% CI, 1.21-6.81; p < 0.001) and MoTIFs PI for DFS in well-differentiated GEP-NENs (HR 6.21; 95% CI, 2.52-13.31; p < 0.001). We conclude that G1/G2 to G3 transition is associated with immune-inflammatory profile changes; in fact, MoTIFs combined with morphology and Ki-67 improve 5-year DFS prediction in GEP-NENs. The immune context of a subset of G3 poorly differentiated tumors is consistent with activation of adaptive immunity, suggesting a potential for responsiveness to immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cjp2.135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2948015593", "source": "openalex"}

The present study was aimed at analyzing the utility of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in evaluating GEJ adenocarcinoma stage and whether this modality added to EGD improves assessment of Siewert type. Methods The results of 51 patients studied by EGD plus EUS (EGD/EUS group) were compared with the results of 54 patients studied by EGD only (EGD group). Results A differentiation of pT1 tumors was attempted by measurement of the tumor length using 4 cm as a criterion. This goal was not achieved because of a high rate of advanced tumors less than 4 cm (sensitivity and specificity were 81.3% and 34.2%, respectively). Conversely EUS ability in pT1 assessment was very reliable (92%). The accuracy in defining the Siewert type was 72.5% and 64.8% for EGD/EUS and EGD groups, respectively ( P = 0.394). Some difficulties in distinguishing between type II and III tumors were observed in both groups with an extremely low specificity (44%) in classifying type II tumors by EGD group.

The release of insulin and glucagon in response to different secretagogues was monitored in vivo and in isolated islets 3–4 weeks after surgery. 2 GX animals responded to glucose with an impaired glucose tolerance and a poor increase in plasma insulin. Islets from GX or food-deprived mice displayed impaired insulin release to high glucose and enhanced glucagon release at low glucose. 3 After GX the insulinogenic index, Δ insulin (μU ml−1)/Δ glucose (mg ml−1), was suppressed by 65% after oral glucose and by 59% after i.v. glucose. The integrated insulin response after oral glucose was reduced by 90% in GX mice. After i.v. glucose the reduction was 67%. 4 Carbachol-induced insulin release in vivo was reduced after food deprivation and exaggerated after GX. Carbachol-stimulated glucagon secretion was suppressed after GX and after food deprivation. A similar pattern was found in vitro. 5 Cyclic AMP activation (by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine or the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin) induced a greater insulin response in GX or food-deprived mice than in sham-operated, fed mice. A similar pattern was found in vitro. The glucagon response was enhanced in vitro but not in vivo. 6 Crude extracts of rat oxyntic mucosa enhanced basal as well as glucose-induced insulin release from isolated islets, whereas glucagon release was markedly inhibited. The effects were dose dependent, the inhibition of glucagon release being achieved at lower concentrations than the potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release. The active principle was inactivated by incubation with trypsin or leucine aminopeptidase. 7 The data suggest that a circulating agent, probably a peptide, from gastric oxyntic mucosa stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion. It also suppresses glucagon secretion. The GX-evoked impairment of the insulin (and glucagon) response to glucose is partly compensated for by an enhanced insulin response to cholinergic and/or cyclic AMP activation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.579ae.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1972834808", "source": "openalex"}

The effect of Gaviscon DA on reflux and dyspepsia symptoms has not yet been demonstrated with a modern trial design. Aim A pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of Gaviscon DA compared with matched placebo for decreasing upper gastrointestinal symptoms in symptomatic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) patients. Methods A randomised, double‐blind, parallel group study was performed in 110 patients with symptoms of GERD . Patients received Gaviscon DA or placebo tablets for 7 consecutive days. The primary endpoint compared the change in overall Reflux Disease Questionnaire ( RDQ ) symptom score (combined heartburn/regurgitation/dyspepsia). Secondary endpoints assessed individual dimensions, GERD dimension (heartburn and regurgitation) and overall treatment evaluation ( OTE ). Results There was a greater decrease in overall RDQ symptom score in the Gaviscon DA group compared with the placebo group (Least Squares Mean difference −0.55; P = 0.0033), and for each of the dimensions independently.

Methods: One hundred and three patients were randomised to undergo either anterior (53) or posterior (50) fundoplication. Initial enrolment and subsequent clinical appointments were undertaken 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure using a standardized questionnaire. Ambulatory pH monitoring and manometry were undertaken both preoperatively and at approximately 3 months post‐procedure. Results: The mean operating time was similar in both groups (48 versus 52 min). Two operations in each group were converted to open surgery. Post‐operative dysphagia in the first month was higher in the posterior fundoplication group compared with the anterior group (at 1 month, P = 0.002; and at 3 months, P = 0.014). The number of individuals suffering from post‐operative heartburn was greater in the anterior fundoplication group (at 1 month, P = 0.008; at 3 months, P &lt; 0.001; and at 6 months, P = 0.002). Eight individuals required reoperation in the anterior group and two individuals in the posterior group ( P = 0.057). Conclusion: Anterior and posterior fundoplication each have their advantages and disadvantages. There is an increased risk of early post‐operative dysphagia after posterior fundoplication.

METHODS:One hundred and thirty-four patients with reflux symptoms of NERD and normal endoscopy were randomized to receive rabeprazole 10 mg or esomeprazole 20 mg once daily for 4 wk.Symptoms were recorded in a diary and changes in severity of symptoms noted. RESULTS:At 4 wk of treatment, rabeprazole 10 mg and esomeprazole 20 mg were comparable with regards to the primary endpoint of time to achieve 24-h symptomfree interval for heartburn 8.5 d vs 9 d and regurgitation 6 d vs 7.5 d.Rabeprazole and esomeprazole were also similarly efficacious in term of patient's global evaluation with 96% of patients on rabeprazole and 87.9% of patients on esomeprazole, reporting that symptoms improved (P = NS).Satisfactory relief of day-and night-time symptoms was achieved in 98% of patients receiving rabeprazole and 81.4% of patients receiving esomeprazole.Adverse events were comparable in both groups (P = NS). CONCLUSION:Rabeprazole 10 mg has a similar efficacy and safety profile in Asians with NERD as esomeprazole 20 mg.Further study is necessary to investigate whether the small differences between the two drugs seen in this study are related to the improved pharmacodynamic properties of rabeprazole.Both drugs were well tolerated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v11.i20.3091", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005350881", "source": "openalex"}

Differences are usually made on the basis of the proportion of ulcers healed at varying time intervals. It has been shown by meta-analysis that healing of duodenal ulcers with antisecretory drugs is directly correlated to the degree of acid suppression. More recently, sophisticated meta-analysis of 24-hour intragastric acidity data and clinical trials of antisecretory drugs has demonstrated that the optimal degree and duration of gastric acid suppression for healing duodenal ulcer can be achieved by an aggregate time above pH 3 of 18–20 hours/day. These conditions predict 100% ulcer healing at 4 weeks. Antisecretory drug regimens that approach these criteria should achieve faster healing than other agents, with a concomitant acceleration of symptom resolution. Regression analysis was performed on the healing-time curves for each drug class to determine the rate of ulcer healing per week. The mean proportion of ulcers healed, irrespective of treatment duration, was highest for omeprazole, which also provided a significantly faster rate of duodenal ulcer healing than all other drug classes (p < 0.001). It has recently been shown that healing of erosive oesophagitis with antisecretory drugs is directly correlated with both the duration of acid suppression over the 24-hour period (p < 0.05) and the elevation of intra-oesophageal pH above 4. Furthermore, oesophageal acid exposure time can be normalized by maintaining the intra-oesophageal pH above 4 for at least 96% of the 24-hour period. Such conditions might be expected to accelerate the healing of oesophagitis. Omeprazole showed significantly faster healing, as a proportion of patients healed per week, than placebo and all other drugs classes (p < 0.005). Alleviation of heartburn was also shown to be more rapid than with other treatments. There are, therefore, potential economic advantages to the use of omeprazole.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529409105369", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2038265392", "source": "openalex"}

Using anti-serum directed against the amino-terminal extracellular tail of the CCKB/gastrin receptor, 8/9 cell lines were shown to express immunoreactive proteins of either m.w. 70 or 40 kDa, or both. Both isoforms were found to be associated with intracellular, non-nuclear membranes, whereas only the 70 kDa protein was expressed in the plasma membrane. Receptor expression was related to gastrin production and secretion. Both progastrin and glycine-extended gastrin-17 were produced and secreted by the tumour cell lines; however, carboxy amidated gastrin was not detected by radioimmunoassay. A CCKB/gastrin receptor transfectant NIH3T3 cell line did not produce detectable gastrin and showed exclusive expression of the 70 kDa receptor on the plasma membrane. One cell line had <50 pg/ml cell-associated progastrin and no detectable receptor form. Cell lines expressing 50–150 pg/ml had both 40 and 70 kDa receptor forms. Those expressing >150 pg/ml progastrin had only the 40 kDa isoform, which was shown to be exclusively expressed on intracellular, non-nuclear membranes, in one of the cell lines. Of the 4 cell lines exclusively expressing the lower m.w. receptor, 3 had gastrin present within the cell, which was not secreted. Thus, if cell- associated gastrin induces a proliferative effect, it may be by an intracrine pathway. Our study has identified the presence of CCKB/gastrin receptor isoforms in different cellular locations and may help toward understanding the complex autocrine and intracrine pathways mediated by gastrin peptides.

Several structural and functional elements of the oesophageal epithelium provide for an inherent resistance against refluxed material. It is only when this defence is overcome that reflux‐induced damage ensues. The light microscopic changes in reflux oesophagitis are manifold. Early changes are confined to the epithelium and consist of reactive changes and inflammatory cell infiltration. When the epithelial integrity can no longer be maintained, erosions and ulcers develop. Recently, dilatation of the intercellular spaces was described as a sensitive early marker for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. This parameter was first identified by electron microscopy but can also be assessed by light microscopy in routinely stained tissue sections. Some of the changes occurring in early gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease can be reproduced by incubating oesophageal mucosal biopsies in gastrointestinal fluids or their components. Activated pepsin, trypsin and conjugated bile acids at an acidic pH have been identified as probable causes of reflux‐induced damage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03037.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1564231120", "source": "openalex"}

It modulates the host’s metabolism, maintains the gut barrier integrity, participates in the xenobiotics and drug metabolism, and acts as protection against gastro-intestinal pathogens through the host’s immune system modulation. The impaired gut microbiota, called dysbiosis, may be the result of an imbalance in this equilibrium and is linked with different diseases, including cancer.

MAb D612, a murine lgG 2a , was generated using a membrane‐enriched fraction of a human colon carcinoma biopsy as immunogen. Employing radioimmunoassays (RIAs) of biopsy extracts to a range of normal and neoplastic tissues, and both immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase assays on frozen sections of a range of normal and neoplastic tissues, we have shown that MAb D612 binds to 82% of colorectal carcinomas tested (n = 67) and to normal gastro‐intestinal epithelium, but does not bind similarly to either neoplastic or normal tissues from a wide range of other sites. Western blotting has shown MAb D612 to react with a high‐molecular‐weight antigen. Live cell RIAs and FACS analyses demonstrate the reactive epitope to be present on the surface of colon carcinoma cells. Immunohistochemical studies have shown intense membrane staining of colon adenocarcinomas with MAb D612; the vast majority of both primary and metastatic colon adenocarcinomas from a variety of sites were positive with many lesions showing homogeneous staining of virtually all cells present. Using human effector cells, we also showed that MAb D612 mediates antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of human colon carcinoma cells; this activity was enhanced in the presence of interleukin (IL‐2).

Bio-material property is essential information to develop endoscopic devices especially capsule type endoscope.

In order to develop the locomotive mechanism, the information of bio material property is required. Especially, the friction force between capsule endoscope and the tissues of the gastro-intestinal tract is very important information. In this paper, we propose the bio-material property measuring system which can supply the information for the design of the locomotive mechanism. By using the proposed measuring system, we evaluate the effects of design parameters such as velocity, diameter size and shape of capsule endoscope that influence the friction force to the capsule endoscope to get the dominant parameters. As a result, we can offer the useful information to design the locomotive mechanism of the capsule endoscope.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/robot.2005.1570295", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2165535452", "source": "openalex"}

Methods : Fourteen well‐trained athletes (13 men, one woman), who indicated suffering from either heartburn, regurgitation or chest pain during competition running, performed two experimental trials at 2‐week intervals using a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover design. During the 6 days preceding the trial and on the trial day itself either 20 mg of omeprazole or a placebo was administered. Two hours after a low‐fat breakfast and 1 h after the last study dose, the trial started with five successive 50‐min periods: rest, three running periods on a treadmill, and recovery. Reflux (percentage time and number of periods oesophageal pH &lt; 4) was measured with an ambulant pH system during these periods. Results : Compared to rest, reflux lasted significantly longer and occurred more frequently during the first running period, irrespective of the intervention, whereas during the second running period this effect was only observed with the placebo. Reflux occurred for longer and more frequently with the placebo than with omeprazole, but this was significant during the first two running periods only. Seven subjects reported heartburn, regurgitation and/or chest pain during exercise, irrespective of the intervention. Only a minority of the symptom periods was actually associated with acid reflux and in all cases this concerned periods with heartburn. Conclusions : Running‐induced acid reflux, but not symptoms, were decreased by omeprazole, probably because most symptoms were not related to acid reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00579.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026880855", "source": "openalex"}

Tumor size and localization usually represent the main drivers in the choice of the most appropriate surgical resection. In the presence of small (&lt;2 cm) and asymptomatic nonfunctioning NETs, a conservative treatment is usually recommended. For localized NETs measuring above 2 cm, surgical resection represents the cornerstone in the management of these tumors. As they are relatively biologically indolent, an extended resection is often justified also in the presence of advanced NETs. Surgical options for NET liver metastases range from limited resection up to liver transplantation. Surgical choices for metastatic NETs need to consider the extent of disease, the grade of tumor, and the presence of extra-abdominal disease. Any surgical procedures should always be balanced with the benefit of survival or relieving symptoms and patients' comorbidities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-14-0173", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054316488", "source": "openalex"}

To achieve that, the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) of horses harbors a broad range of various microorganisms, differing in each GIT segment, which are essential for efficient utilization of feed, especially to use nutrients that are not or little degraded by endogenous enzymes. In addition, like in other animal species, the GIT microbiota is in permanent interplay with the host's cells and is involved in a lot of functions among which inflammation, immune homeostasis, and energy metabolism. As for other animals and humans, the horse gut microbiome is sensitive to diet, especially consumption of starch, fiber, and fat. Age, breeds, stress during competitions, transportation, and exercise may also impact the microbiome. Because of its size and its complexity, the equine GIT microbiota is prone to perturbations caused by external or internal stressors that may result in digestive diseases like gastric ulcer, diarrhea, colic, or colitis, and that are thought to be linked with systemic diseases like laminitis, equine metabolic syndrome or obesity. Thus, in this review we aim at understanding the common core microbiome -in terms of structure and function- in each segment of the GIT, as well as identifying potential microbial biomarkers of health or disease which are crucial to anticipate putative perturbations, optimize global practices and develop adapted nutritional strategies and personalized nutrition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10122517", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4312194553", "source": "openalex"}

From 1996 to 2000, 36 patients were referred with gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumours. In these patients, no clinical, radiological or endoscopic diagnostic modalities had been able to identify the primary tumour. Twenty-nine patients had liver metastases. Of the others, one had skin and one had lymph node metastases, three had diffuse metastatic involvement and two had carcinoid syndrome. SRS was carried out with both whole-body and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) acquisition, 24 and 48 h after the intravenous administration of 111In-pentetreotide. SRS findings were suggestive of the possible site of the primary lesion in 14 patients (39%). Six patients underwent surgery on the basis of the SRS findings and, therefore, the final, i.e. pathological, diagnosis was reached. In two patients, the final diagnosis was obtained within 6 months of SRS by means of a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. In the remaining six patients, the final diagnosis was reached after at least 2 years of follow-up by means of clinical, radiological and/or nuclear medicine findings. In all eight patients, the primary site identified during follow-up was consistent with the SRS findings. It can be concluded that SRS modified management in the six patients who had surgery.

Barrett’s oesophagus is characterised by replacement of reflux-damaged oesophageal squamous epithelium with a columnar intestinal-like epithelium. We previously reported discovery of microRNAs that are differentially expressed between oesophageal squamous mucosa and Barrett’s oesophagus mucosa. Now, to better understand early steps in the initiation of Barrett’s oesophagus, we assessed the expression, location and function of these microRNAs in oesophageal squamous mucosa from individuals with ulcerative oesophagitis. Methods Quantitative real-time PCR was used to compare miR-21, 143, 145, 194, 203, 205 and 215 expression levels in oesophageal mucosa from individuals without pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux to individuals with ulcerative oesophagitis. Correlations between microRNA expression and messenger RNA differentiation markers BMP-4, CK8 and CK14 were analyzed. The cellular localisation of microRNAs within the oesophageal mucosa was determined using in-situ hybridisation. microRNA involvement in proliferation and apoptosis was assessed following transfection of a human squamous oesophageal mucosal cell line (Het-1A). Results miR-143, miR-145 and miR-205 levels were significantly higher in gastro-oesophageal reflux compared with controls. Elevated miR-143 expression correlated with BMP-4 and CK8 expression, and elevated miR-205 expression correlated negatively with CK14 expression. Endogenous miR-143, miR-145 and miR-205 expression was localised to the basal layer of the oesophageal epithelium. Transfection of miR-143, 145 and 205 mimics into Het-1A cells resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Conclusions Elevated miR-143, miR-145 and miR-205 expression was observed in oesophageal squamous mucosa of individuals with ulcerative oesophagitis. These miRNAs localised to the basal layer of the oesophageal epithelium. They reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, and may play roles in regulating epithelial restoration in response to injury caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230x-13-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066732958", "source": "openalex"}

To increase sensitivity and specificity, we applied three techniques to detect different conformations of aSyn in GI biopsies obtained from a longitudinal, clinically well-characterized cohort of PD patients and healthy controls (HC).With immunohistochemistry (IHC), we used antibodies reactive for total, phosphorylated and oligomeric aSyn; with aSyn proximity ligation assay (AS-PLA), we targeted oligomeric aSyn species specifically; and with paraffin-embedded tissue blot (AS-PET-blot) we aimed to detect fibrillary, synaptic aSyn.A total of 163 tissue blocks were collected from 51 PD patients (113 blocks) and 21 HC (50 blocks). In 31 PD patients, biopsies were taken before the PD diagnosis (Prodromal); while in 20 PD patients biopsies were obtained after diagnosis (Manifest). The majority of tissues blocks were from large intestine (62%), followed by small intestine (21%), stomach (10%) and oesophagus (7%). With IHC, four staining patterns were detected (neuritic, ganglionic, epithelial and cellular), while two distinct staining patterns were detected both with AS-PLA (cellular and diffuse signal) and with AS-PET-blot (aSyn-localized and pericrypt signal). The level of agreement between different techniques was low and no single technique or staining pattern reliably distinguished PD patients (Prodromal or Manifest) from HC.Our study suggests that detection of aSyn conformational variants currently considered pathological is not adequate for the diagnosis or prediction of PD.

Aim : To evaluate the influence of Helicobacter pylori on oesophageal acid exposure in patients with both non‐erosive and erosive reflux disease and in a group of controls. The pattern and distribution of chronic gastritis were also assessed. Methods : One hundred and twelve consecutive patients with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease agreed to undergo both upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 24‐h oesophageal pH‐metry. Patients were grouped as H. pylori ‐positive or H. pylori ‐negative on the basis of both CLO‐test and histology, and as cases with or without oesophagitis on the basis of endoscopy. The controls consisted of 19 subjects without reflux symptoms and with normal endoscopy and oesophageal pH‐metry. Results : H. pylori was positive in 35 patients (31%) and in six controls (31%); oesophagitis was found in 44 patients (39%) and non‐erosive reflux disease in 68 (61%). The prevalence of chronic gastritis in the antrum and corpus was higher in H. pylori ‐positive than in H. pylori ‐negative patients ( P &lt; 0.001), but was more frequently mild ( P &lt; 0.001) than moderate or severe. The percentage total time the oesophageal pH &lt; 4.0 was higher in patients than in controls ( P &lt; 0.008–0.001), but there was no difference between H. pylori ‐positive and H. pylori ‐negative patients (12.3% vs. 12%, P = 0.43) or H. pylori ‐positive and H. pylori ‐negative controls (1.07% vs. 1.47%, P = 0.19). Conclusions : H. pylori infection had the same prevalence in reflux patients and in controls. It did not affect oesophageal acid exposure, as there was no difference between H. pylori ‐positive and H. pylori ‐negative individuals. The high prevalence of mild body gastritis in H. pylori ‐positive patients suggests that H. pylori eradication is unlikely to lead to gastric functional recovery, which might precipitate or worsen symptoms and lesions in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.01547.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975472383", "source": "openalex"}

In one such area, the Buea district, in south-western Cameroon, two cross-sectional surveys, together covering 263 apparently healthy schoolchildren aged 4-12 years, were recently conducted. The prevalences of fever, malarial parasitaemia and intestinal helminth infections, the seroprevalences of anti-Plasmodium falciparum IgG and IgE and anti-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (anti-GPI) IgG, plasma concentrations of total IgE, and the incidence of anaemia were all investigated. The mean (S.D.) age of the study children was 7.56 (1.82) years. Overall, 156 (59.3%) of the children were found parasitaemic, with a geometric mean parasitaemia of 565 parasites/microl. Parasitaemia and fever were significantly associated (P=0.042). The children who lived at low altitude, attending schools that lay 400-650 m above sea level, had significantly higher parasitaemias than their high-altitude counterparts (P<0.01). At low altitude, the children attending government schools had significantly higher parasitaemias than their mission-school counterparts (P=0.010). Of the 31 children (11.9%) found anaemic, 22 (70.4%) had mild anaemia and none had severe anaemia. A significant negative correlation (r=-0.224; P=0.005) was observed between haemoglobin concentration and level of parasitaemia. Infection with Plasmodium appeared to reduce erythrocyte counts (P=0.045), a condition that was exacerbated by co-infection with helminths (P=0.035). Plasma concentrations of total IgE were higher in the children found to be excreting helminth eggs than in those who appeared helminth-free, while levels of anti-P. falciparum IgE were higher in the children with low-grade parasitaemias than in those with more intense parasitaemias. Levels of anti-GPI IgG increased with age and were relatively high in the children who lived at low altitude and in those who were aparasitaemic. The survey results confirm that asymptomatic malarial parasitaemia frequently co-exists with helminth infections in schoolchildren and indicate links with fever, altitude and school type. Immunoglobulin E may play a role in immune protection against helminthiasis whereas anti-GPI antibodies may be important in the development of antimalarial immunity in such children. In Cameroon, as in other areas with endemic malaria, control programmes to reduce the prevalences of infections with intestinal helminths and malarial parasites in schoolchildren, which may effectively reduce the incidence of anaemia, are clearly needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1179/136485908x252287", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2081927236", "source": "openalex"}

When pigs were fasted for more than 36 h and then fed, the plasma calcium concentration decreased by 6·1% over a period of 60–120 min after a meal. Since in thyroidectomized pigs the plasma calcium concentration increased by 7·2% when they were fed after a fast of 36 h it is suggested that increased CT secretion assists in the control of postprandial hypercalcaemia. Direct measurement of CT in peripheral plasma supported this suggestion. Because the plasma calcium concentration in an intact pig on a normal feeding regime does not change after a meal, the possibility of the involvement of one or more humoral factors in the stimulation of thyroid C-cells was investigated. Exogenous gastrin and endogenous gastrin stimulated by meat extract were both previously shown by us to increase CT secretion rate. This observation has now been extended to include other stimuli to endogenous gastrin, e.g. glycine and gastric distension. Furthermore, partially purified enteroglucagon increased CT secretion rate from perfused thyroid glands, isolated in situ . Stimulation of endogenous entero-glucagon by the intraduodenal administration of glucose, and probable stimulation of endogenous pancreozymin by intraduodenal fat, were both associated with an increased CT secretion rate from the thyroid gland. These results support the concept of a gastroentero-thyroid C-cell system which serves to stimulate CT secretion and thus to protect the skeleton from excessive bone resorption during periods of dietary sufficiency.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.0590217", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2055713437", "source": "openalex"}

Using fecal samples for parasite analyses, I identified 10 parasite species, including 6 nematodes (Lemuricola vauceli, Trichuris sp., 2 species of Callistoura, 1 trichostrongylid, and 1 strongyloid), 1 anoplocephalid cestode, a dicrocoeliid trematode, as well as 2 protozoans (Entamoeba sp. and Balantidium coli). The population in Kirindy Forest had the highest prevalence and number of parasite species ever recorded for species of lemurs. Additionally, prevalence of some parasite species differed between the social groups studied. These findings lead to 2 conclusions. First, it is important to extend a parasitological study to several social groups of a host population, since groups may differ in parasite fauna as a result of minor microclimatic or habitat parameters, and, second, short-term assessments of lemur health might underestimate the real parasite burden.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1645/ge-2258.1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066392151", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this prospective, randomized multicentre study was to compare stent placement and brachytherapy regarding health economy and clinical outcomes. Methods Patients with incurable cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction were randomized to receive a self-expandable metallic stent or 3×7 Gy brachytherapy. At clinical follow-up visits, dysphagia was scored and health care consumptions were recorded. Costs were based on hospital debits. Total lifetime healthcare consumption costs and costs for the initial treatments were calculated and a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results Thirty patients were randomized to each treatment group. There was no difference in survival or complication rates between the two treatment strategies. There was a significant difference in the change of dysphagia scores between the time of inclusion and the 1-month follow-up visit, in favour of the stented group (P=0.03). This difference had disappeared at 3 months. Median total lifetime costs were €17 690 for the stented group compared with €33 171 for the brachytherapy group (P=0.005). This difference was due to higher costs for the initial treatment (€4615 versus €23 857, P<0.0001). Sensitivity analyses showed that the charges for a brachytherapy session had to be reduced from €6092 to €4222 (31%) to make this therapeutic concept cost-competitive. Conclusion Stenting is currently more cost-effective compared with fractionated 3×7 Gy brachytherapy for patients with incurable cancer of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200512000-00017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983746428", "source": "openalex"}

The risk of lymph node metastases is low in mucosal carcinoma but increases with the depth of infiltration into the submucosa.This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry.New technologies such as narrow-band imaging have improved the endo- scopic diagnosis and staging of early gastro-esophageal cancer. The development of endoscopic submucosal dissection has led to a higher R0 resection rate, a lower risk of recurrence, and an increase in the number of endoscopic resections that are performed with curative intent. In squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, surgical oncological esophagectomy is indicated if the cancer infiltrates into the third mucosal layer (T1a, m3) or deeper. In esophageal adenocarcinoma, the prevalence of lymph node metastases is low if the cancer is restricted to the mucosa and in- creases only when the submucosa is infiltrated. In the current German S3 guideline, endoscopic resection is recommended for intramucosal adenocarcinoma as long as there are no further histopathological risk factors. Lymph node metastasis in gastric carcinoma begins in the deep mucosal infiltration stage (m3). If certain special con- ditions (\"extended criteria\") are met, carcinoma expanding into the first submucosal layer (sm1) can be removed endoscopically. All further stages must be treated with total or subtotal gastrectomy with systematic D2 lymphadenectomy.Borderline cases between endoscopic and surgical resection of early carcinoma of the esophagus or stomach must be managed with an interdisciplinary treatment algorithm. If there is a risk of lymph node metastasis, surgical oncological resection is indicated. Such resections of gastroesophageal cancer in the locally advanced stage should always be part of a multimodal treatment approach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2018.0513", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2883701630", "source": "openalex"}

Non‐invasive methods of diagnosing EAI are potentially useful in guiding therapy, particularly in conditions such as chronic cough, for which corticosteroids may not be the first‐line treatment. Methods: The value of exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) in the diagnosis of EAI was prospectively investigated in a cohort of 116 patients with chronic cough of varying aetiology. An optimum cut‐off value was derived for differentiating between EAI and non‐EAI causes of chronic cough. As the diagnosis was gastro‐oesophageal reflux in 70 patients (60.3% of the total), the possible relationship between ENO and EAI in the presence or absence of reflux was subsequently investigated. Results: The optimum value of ENO for differentiating EAI (32% of patients) from non‐EAI causes of cough was 33 parts per billion (sensitivity 60.5%, specificity 84.6%). In the subgroup of patients with reflux, ENO was highly specific for the diagnosis of EAI (sensitivity 66%, specificity 100%). Conversely, in the patients without reflux, ENO did not discriminate between cough due to EAI or other causes (sensitivity 100%, specificity 28.9%). Conclusions: These results suggest that the presence or absence of reflux should be taken into consideration when interpreting ENO measurements in the diagnosis of chronic cough associated with EAI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02010.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1763057456", "source": "openalex"}

Methods A total of 12 focus groups and 65 face-to-face interviews were conducted in the USA, UK, France and Germany, and involved 164 participants, who had either been diagnosed with GORD or were identified as having GORD in the community, using a random digit dialling telephone method. Transcripts of focus groups and interviews were analysed thematically, using a constant comparative approach, to identify key factors associated with healthcare seeking. Results Patients' descriptions of GORD symptoms were often vivid, with the use of unexpected imagery and unusual beliefs about causality. We were able to identify four factors associated with healthcare seeking for GORD which were: the characteristics of symptoms (intensity and control), the perceived seriousness of symptoms, interference by symptoms with daily life and views about medicines and the medical profession. Conclusion Patients with GORD, using both self care and formal medical care, have a surprising range of ideas about the causes and best treatments of their symptoms.

Aim: To compare the effectiveness of once and twice daily dosing of lansoprazole and esomeprazole in controlling intragastric acidity (target gastric pH &gt; 4.0) over a 24‐hour period. Methods: In an open‐label, two‐way crossover study, 45 Helicobacter pylori ‐negative patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were randomized to receive one of two regimens: 30 mg lansoprazole or esomeprazole 40 mg once daily. Intragastric pH was assessed by 24‐hour pH monitoring on day 5 of each regimen. Dosing was increased to twice daily and pH was reassessed on day 10.

Gastrostomy feeding is now the preferred method of providing nutritional support to children with NI who are unable to feed adequately by mouth. Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement and the development or worsening of gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported. This has led to the frequent use of surgical anti‐reflux treatment in the form of a fundoplication, or other Anti‐Reflux Procedures. Fundoplication is associated with a high recurrence rate, surgical failure and significant morbidity and mortality. Since Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced in the 1990s they have come to play a larger part in the medical management of GOR in children with NI. Uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate treatment for GOR. Other agents currently used include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs, acid buffering agents, gut motility stimulants and sodium alginate preparations. There are risks and benefits associated with both surgical and medical interventions and further comparison is necessary to determine the optimal treatment choice.

During July- 2015 to June- 2016, we conducted a cross sectional study within seven topographic zones of Bangladesh to explore the level of infection and associated risk factors of GINs infections of goats. The study followed standard flotation and modified McMaster techniques. Among 1998 samples from goats; 1241 (62.1%) were found to be infected with one or more species of GINs by fecal examination for nematode eggs. The identified nematodes were strongyles (51.9%), Strongyloides sp. (19.0%) and Trichuris spp. (2.9%). By coproculture, we identified Haemonchus spp., Oesophagostomum spp., Trichostrongylus spp. and Bunostomum spp. in the different topographic zones. According to univariate analysis; young age, other breed than Black Bengal, animals in poor condition, backyard rearing system, muddy housing, illiterate farmers and rainy season were found significantly associated with GINs infections. Besides, other breed than Black Bengal, animals in poor condition, backyard rearing system, muddy housing and illiterate farmers were identified as the risk factors of GINs infections in goats. This is the first detailed epidemiological investigation of GINs of goats in Bangladesh. The epidemiological findings are expected to help formulate effective control strategies against GINs infections in goats by improving health status of animals, management system and education level of the farmers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2020.e00146", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3014841053", "source": "openalex"}

Despite progress in understanding and treatment of the disease, strategies for capitalizing on these advances are less well developed. In many practices, H 2 ‐receptor antagonists still remain the most widely prescribed treatment for GERD, despite the availability of the more effective acid‐suppressant proton pump inhibitors. This review examines the relative efficacies of acid‐suppressant drugs in minimizing oesophageal acid exposure and outlines the evidence for the superiority of proton pump inhibitors over standard‐dose H 2 ‐antagonists in symptom relief, erosion healing and prevention of relapse in GERD. Current prescribing patterns and considerations for the general practitioner are also examined. The availability and impact of over‐the‐counter H 2 ‐antagonists on the treatment of GERD and their relative cost‐effectiveness vs. proton pump inhibitors are also addressed. A hierarchy of drug efficacy (full‐dose proton pump inhibitor &gt; half‐dose proton pump inhibitor &gt; high‐dose H 2 ‐antagonist &gt; standard‐dose H 2 ‐antagonist or prokinetic) applies in principle to all GERD patients, (with or without oesophagitis). The most effective initial therapy for GERD is also likely to be the most cost‐effective one, if treatment failure leads to higher utilization of medical resources. The application of these recommendations to the management of non‐endoscoped GERD, endoscopy‐negative GERD and low‐grade oesophagitis as well as higher grade oesophagitis is also reviewed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2001.00985.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090789067", "source": "openalex"}

However, few studies have examined their long‐term natural history, or impact on survival. Aim To examine these issues in individuals recruited into a community‐based screening programme for H elicobacter pylori in 1994. Methods Data on mortality and cause of death at 10 years were obtained from the Office for National Statistics. Baseline demographic data, lifestyle factors, gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were recorded at study entry. The effect of all these factors on persistent and new‐onset GERS , and 10‐year mortality, were examined using univariate and multivariate analysis, with results expressed as odds ratios ( OR s) or hazard ratios ( HR ) with 99% confidence intervals ( CI ). Results Of 3967 individuals providing complete GERS data at baseline and 10 years, 549 (13.8%) had GERS at baseline. Of these, 183 (33.3%) had persistent symptoms. Among 3418 individuals asymptomatic at baseline, approximately 0.8% per year developed new‐onset GERS . No predictors of persistent GERS were identified. New‐onset symptoms were associated with lower quality of life or presence of irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) at baseline, and higher body mass index ( BMI ) at 10 years. There were 8331 (99.1%) of 8407 subjects providing complete GERS data at baseline, 1289 (15.5%) of whom were symptomatic. Presence of GERS at baseline did not affect survival ( HR : 0.84; 99% CI : 0.44–1.59). Conclusions Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms persisted in one‐third of individuals, whilst new‐onset gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms were associated with poor quality of life, irritable bowel syndrome and higher body mass index.

Aim To evaluate safety and efficacy of LES‐EST in GERD patients with incomplete response to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in a prospective, international, multicentre, open‐label study. Methods GERD patients, partially responsive to PPIs, received LES‐EST. GERD health‐related quality of life (GERD‐HRQL), daily symptom diaries, quality of life scores, oesophageal acid exposure, and LES resting and residual pressure were measured before and after initiation of LES‐EST. Stimulation sessions were optimised based on residual symptoms and oesophageal acid exposure. Results Forty‐four patients were enrolled and 6‐month data from 41 patients are available. Hiatal repair was performed in 16 patients. One device‐related, one procedure‐related and one unrelated severe adverse event were reported. GERD‐HRQL improved from 31.0 (IQR 26.2–36.8) off‐PPI and 16.5 (IQR 9.0–22.8) on‐PPI to 4 (IQR 1–8) at 3‐month and 5 (IQR 3–9) at 6‐month follow‐up ( P &lt; 0.0001 vs. on‐ and off‐PPI).

Conclusions These interim results show an acceptable safety record of LES‐EST to date, combined with good short‐term efficacy in GERD patients who are partially responsive to PPI therapy.

Study design Patients (18-84 years old;n= 433) with healed GORD II or III were included in this prospective multi-centre, randomized, parallel, double-blind study. Pantoprazole was administered once daily for up to 1 year as either a 20 mg or 40 mg enteric-coated tablet to 221 and 212 patients, respectively. Symptoms of GORD were assessed every 3 months. Endoscopy was performed at entry, after 6 and 12 months, or when symptoms of GORD were perceived on at least three consecutive days. The primary efficacy parameter was the time until endoscopically proven relapse of GORD occurred (stage I or greater); the secondary parameters included tolerability, safety, and time until symptomatic relapse occurred. Results In the 20 mg treatment group, 87% and 75% of patients were in endoscopic remission after 6 and 12 months, respectively; the corresponding rates in the 40 mg treatment group were 91% and 78%. In both treatment groups, GORD stage I accounted for about 50% of endoscopic relapses. The symptomatic remission rates in the 20 mg group were estimated as 85% and 77% after 6 and 12 months, respectively; the corresponding values in the 40 mg group were 87% and 76%. No correlation was seen either between the endoscopically proven relapse and perception of symptoms, or between the severity of the pre-treatment stage of GORD and the maintenance dose of pantoprazole. Both doses were well tolerated. Conclusions Both the 20 mg and 40 mg doses of pantoprazole are safe and effective in maintaining patients with healed reflux oesophagitis in remission. Moreover, for the majority of patients, the 20 mg dose provides adequate long-term therapeutic efficacy at a minimal drug exposure and lower costs.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol12:425-432 © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology 2000, 12:425-432", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200012040-00010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2008339005", "source": "openalex"}

This was achieved by a study of an en bloc resection of the gastro‐oesophageal junction (GOJ) harvested from a human cadaver. The excised tissue block was suspended in a cage to preserve anatomical relationships, fixed in formalin and embedded in wax. The tissue block was then processed by a custom‐built extended‐volume imaging system to obtain the microstructural information using a digital camera which acquires images at a resolution of 8.2 μm/pixel. The top surface of the tissue block was sequentially stained and imaged. At each step, the imaged surface was milled off at a depth of 50 μm. The processing of the tissue block resulted in 650 images covering a length of 32.25 mm of the GOJ. Structures, including the different muscle and fascial layers, were then traced out from the cross‐sectional images using color thresholding. The traced regions were then aligned and assembled to provide a three‐dimensional representation of the GOJ. The result is the detailed three‐dimensional microstructural anatomy of the GOJ represented in a new way. The next stage will be to integrate key physiological events, including peristalsis and relaxation, into this model using mathematical modeling to allow accurate visual tools for training health professionals and patients.

We conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled study to examine the effects of a pediatric weaning food supplemented with oligofructose (OF). Non breast-feeding infants aged 4 months to 24 months and attending daycare in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area were recruited and randomized to one of two groups, both receiving a standard infant cereal (Gerber, U.S.A.) for 6 months with only one group supplemented with OF (0.55 gram per 15 grams of cereal). Outcomes of this part of the study were incidence of diarrheal disease, incidence of associated symptoms such as vomiting and fever as well as symptoms not associated with diarrhea such as perceived bowel movement (BM) discomfort, vomiting, regurgitation, flatulence, stool consistency and diaper rash. The data was collected on a weekly basis by phone interview with the caregiver as well as by daycare observations.

The localisation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) was determined in 66 patients; 60 with adenocarcinomas and six cases with Barrett's oesophagus. uPAR was expressed in nearly all cases of invasive adenocarcinomas by populations of cancer cells, macrophages and myofibroblasts at both the invasion front and the tumour core. In areas with high-grade dysplasia or with Barrett's metaplasia adjacent to the tumour tissue, no uPAR-immunoreactivity was found. High local expression of uPAR, therefore, appears to be a characteristic marker for invasive behaviour in this tumour, suggesting that uPAR's contribution to matrix degradation during invasive growth is a late event in carcinogenesis. Using a scoring system for semiquantitative estimation of uPAR-positivity on immmunohistochemically stained specimens, a significant association was found between poor overall survival and high uPAR-score for cancer cells in the tumour core and for macrophages peripherally at the tumour invasion zone. In multivariate analysis, these two uPAR-scores were confirmed as highly significant prognostic parameters independent of Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM)-stage and World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The proteolytic action of these malignant and nonmalignant accessory cells thus seemed to follow two main patterns: one dominated by uPAR positive cancer cells and one by uPAR-positive macrophages.

Gastro‐oesophageal reflux has an important role in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a multifactorial, acid‐peptic disorder that results from the reflux of noxious material from the stomach into the oesophagus. The refluxed material causes the occurrence of oesophageal inflammation which creates a condition that is called reflux oesophagitis. The prevalence of this disease has increased dramatically in recent decades, mostly in the western world, where it affects about 10% to 30% of the population. The aetiology of oesophageal mucosal damage is complicated. Many inflammatory mediators are produced within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but their contributions in pathophysiology and disease pathogenesis have not been well investigated. Despite the protective barrier provided by the oesophageal mucosa, refluxed materials can cause oxidative injury and in?ammatory responses that involve the epithelium and immune cells. The analysing cellular events in gastro‐ oesophageal reflux disease and physiological responses to such conditions are important and necessary for a better grasp of the pathogenesis of GERD and the expansion of new treatments. Therefore, we want to discuss some of the important and key factors of GERD disease in this article.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.13939", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2897691335", "source": "openalex"}

Our aim was to relate endoscopic observations in reflux oesophagitis with the severity of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Methods: On endoscopy of 64 consecutive untreated patients with uncomplicated reflux oesophagitis, accurate records were made prospectively of the following variables: axial extent of endoscopic changes, width of the lesions, presence of whitish exudate in the lesions, and presence and length of a hiatal hernia. Multiple linear regression analysis examined which of these factors were significantly related, at the 5% level, with gastro-oesophageal reflux as measured at intra-oesophageal 24-h pH-metry. Results: Presence of whitish exudate and width of lesions were significantly associated with severity of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Median fraction of the recording period with pH <4 was 5.9% in patients with narrow red lesions, 12.5% in patients with narrow, whitish lesions, and 20.3% in patients with broad lesions (P < 0.0001). The mean duration of reflux episodes was significantly longer and the number of nocturnal episodes lasting more than 5 min was significantly higher in patients with broad lesions. Conclusion: Red spots and streaks, even without whitish exudate, are significantly related to pathologic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Whitish exudate is related to more severe reflux, and broad lesions to a longer mean duration of the episodes. The presence of whitish exudate in lesions and the width of the lesions are important observations to use in the classification of reflux oesophagitis.Key Words: Endoscopygastric aciditygastro-oesophageal refluxpH-metryreflux oesophagitis", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529708996531", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066007374", "source": "openalex"}

This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of a nasogastric tube (NGT) incorporating a low-pressure oesophageal balloon on GOR and bronchoaspiration in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Fourteen patients were studied in a semi-recumbent position for 2 consecutive days. Inflation or deflation of the oesophageal balloon was randomised. Samples of blood, gastric content, and oropharyngeal and bronchial secretions were taken every 2 h over a period of 8 h. A radioactively labelled nutritional solution was continuously administered through the NGT. The magnitude of both the GOR and bronchoaspiration was measured by radioactivity counting of oropharyngeal and bronchial secretion samples, respectively. Inflation of the oesophageal balloon resulted in a significant decrease of both GOR and bronchoaspiration of gastric content. This protective effect was statistically significant from 4 h following inflation throughout the duration of the study. This study demonstrates that an inflated oesophageal balloon delays and decreases gastro-oesophageal and bronchial aspiration of gastric content in patients carrying a nasogastric tube and receiving enteral nutrition during mechanical ventilation.

A series of oesophageal function tests were performed, starting 90 minutes after oral intake of ranitidine or placebo. Gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure was measured using a perfused catheter system and a continuous pull-through technique. No changes in sphincter pressure could be demonstrated. Peristaltic amplitude in the body of the oesophagus as well as the duration and velocity of the peristalsis were measured after wet swallows (bolus 5 ml of water).

All patients who completed pre‐ and postoperative HRM, GERD health‐related quality of life (GERD‐HRQL) questionnaire, and functional outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) questionnaire were included in the study. Key Results Forty‐five out of 304 patients were included. At a median follow‐up of 12 months (IQR 10) after surgery, a statistically significant increase of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) total length ( P = .002), intra‐abdominal length ( P = .001), integrated relaxation pressure (IRP), intrabolus pressure (IBP), and esophagogastric contractile integral (EGJ‐CI) was noted ( P &lt; .001). Distal esophageal amplitude ( P = .004), mean distal contractile integral (DCI) ( P &lt; .001), post multiple repeated swallows DCI ( P = .001), and the percent of normal peristalsis increased ( P = .040). All patients were relieved of reflux symptoms. Ineffective esophageal motility reversed to normal in 36% of patients after surgery. The only factor significantly associated with postoperative dysphagia was preoperative dysphagia ( P = .006). Postoperatively, a significant correlation between IRP and DCI ( r = 0.361 and P = .019) and between IBP and DCI ( r = 0.443 and P = .003) was found. Conclusions and Inferences The Linx procedure had a remarkable effect on esophageal motility in the short‐term follow‐up.

There may be important differences between NERD and ERD in terms of pathophysiology and management. Thus, NERD patients appear relatively resistant to proton pump inhibitors and may not be good surgical candidates. The clinician caring for patients with GERD must therefore be aware of the full spectrum of GERD and of the pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of NERD. Recent twin studies have revealed that genetic factors play a role in GERD and form the basis for future studies on the role of inheritance in the various manifestations of GERD. Several recent investigations have reaffirmed the primacy of acid reflux in the pathogenesis of GERD and have also provided insights into the pathophysiology of postprandial heartburn. Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and hiatal hernias have emerged as major and interacting factors in the genesis of reflux events and in the potentiation of acid exposure; the former are attracting considerable attention as a potential therapeutic target.

Recently the relationship between the severest degrees of cardial incontinence and hiatus hernia has been emphasized, which causes the impairment of the mechanical properties of the gastro–oesophageal barrier and of oesophageal acid clearing. Among different types of hiatus hernia, those characterized by the permanent axial orad migration of the oesophago‐gastric (EG) junction (nonreducible hiatus hernia) are correlated with severe GERD. Barium swallow may adequately differentiate hiatal insufficiency, concentric hiatus hernia and short oesophagus which are the steps of migration across or above the diaphragm. When associated with panmural oesophagitis and fibrosis of the oesophageal wall, these conditions may be the cause of recurrence of hiatus hernia and reflux after laparoscopic standard anti‐reflux surgical procedures; in the presence of nonreducibility of the EG junction below the diaphragm without tension, dedicated surgical procedures are necessary. It is currently agreed that surgical therapy is indicated for patients affected by severe GERD who are not compliant with long‐term medical therapy, require high dosages of drugs and are too young for lifetime medical treatment. While the existence of severe GERD correlated with an irreversible anatomical disorder represents an elective indication for surgery, warrants further investigation. Accurate identification of the functional and anatomical abnormalities underlying GERD is mandatory in order to decide whether medical or surgical therapy should be implemented, and to tailor the surgical technique, laparoscopic or open, to each patient.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.17.s2.4.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976010729", "source": "openalex"}

Results After saline, ingestion of a meal induced an acid pocket, with a mean pH drop of 2.26 (compared to 0.25 before the meal, P < 0.05) and a nadir pH of 2.71. The acid pocket persisted 30 and 50 min postprandially (pH drops 1.59 and 1.68 and nadir pH 3.17 and 2.52 respectively). Compared with saline, erythromycin significantly suppressed the pH drop and nadir pH (on average 0.66 and 3.4 at 10 min; comparable patterns at 30 and 50 min). After sumatriptan a significantly lower nadir pH was observed at 30 and 50 min (respectively 2.02 and 1.74, P < 0.05 compared with saline). A postprandial bile pocket was noted in 50% of pull-throughs after saline, compared to 78% after erythromycin and 31% after sumatriptan. Conclusions The presence of a bile pocket in a subset of the subjects confirms the heterogeneity of postprandial intragastric contents. Erythromycin disrupts the acid pocket but increases the presence of bile, while sumatriptan has opposite effects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04664.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1546152588", "source": "openalex"}

In unadjusted analysis, all forms of hormone use (oestrogen-only, tibolone, combined HRT and progestogen) were statistically significantly associated with GORD. In adjusted models, this association remained statistically significant for oestrogen-only treatment (OR 1.49; 1.18–1.89).

A more precise estimate of the association of GER symptoms with the risk of BE would be important to prioritize endoscopic screening. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to examine this issue. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic were searched to identify cross‐sectional studies that reported the prevalence of BE based on presence of GER symptoms. The prevalence of BE was compared according to presence or absence of GER symptoms using an odds ratio (OR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Specificity and sensitivity of GER symptoms for predicting BE was calculated. Results Of 10,463 citations evaluated, 19 studies reported the prevalence of BE in 43,017 subjects. The pooled OR among individuals with weekly GER symptoms compared with those without was 1.67 (95% CI 1.30–2.15) for endoscopically suspected BE, and 2.42 (95% CI 1.59–3.68) for histologically confirmed BE. No significant association was found between weekly GER symptoms and the presence of short segment BE (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.86–1.97), whereas a strong association was present with long segment BE, with an OR of 6.30 (95% CI 2.26–17.61). Conclusions Gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms are associated with an increased odds of BE, with a further increase when weekly symptoms are present.

There is now an increasing tendency in many countries to utilise surgery in the earlier stages of the disease.1 This change in clinical practice is partly due to advances in surgical technique (laparoscopic approach) but paradoxically is also probably due to improvement in medical therapy.2,3 With the efficacy and availability of modern medical therapy, the focus, as well as the opportunities of therapy in GORD, have changed but also the recognition of the magnitude of the impairment in quality of life of GORD patients who are not adequately treated.4 This increased awareness may be the most pregnant cause of the suggested increase in prevalence of the disease in the adult population. An important background factor for the significant but not eminent strategic decisions to be taken in the long term management of GORD patients is the fact that there are shortcomings and drawbacks with pharmacological maintenance therapy. GORD is a disease of a chronic nature where medical therapies are entirely targeting the control of acid reflux and not correcting the underlying motor abnormalities of the upper alimentary canal.5 Low dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and full dose H2 receptor antagonists insufficiently interfere with food stimulated acid production and the latter also have a significant tachyphylaxis problem.6–8 A profound and sometimes prolonged acid rebound phenomenon is perhaps a greater problem after PPI therapy in Helicobacter pylori negative subjects than previously recognised.

If this hypothesis is correct, the effects of H. pylori induced gastritis may be an important factor determining the earlier lower prevalence of oesophagitis in Japan, where this infection is especially common. In support of this idea a reduced prevalence of H. pylori infection in Japan, as is now being observed in young Japanese adults, may be, at least in part, responsible for the upsurge in the number of cases of reflux disease in Japan.

In acidic gastric juice, this nitrite can generate potentially carcinogenic N-nitrosocompounds. However, ascorbic acid secreted by the gastric mucosa can prevent nitrosation by converting the nitrite to nitric oxide. Methods: To study the potential for N-nitrosocompound formation in a model simulating salivary nitrite entering the acidic stomach and the ability of ascorbic acid to inhibit the process. Concentrations of ascorbic acid, total vitamin C, nitrite, nitrosomorpholine, oxygen and nitric oxide were monitored during the experiments. Results: The delivery of nitrite into HCl containing thiocyanate resulted in nitrosation of morpholine, with the rate of nitrosation being greatest at pH 2.5. Under anaerobic conditions, ascorbic acid converted the nitrite to nitric oxide and prevented nitrosation. However, in the presence of dissolved air, the ascorbic acid was ineffective at preventing nitrosation. This was due to the nitric oxide combining with oxygen to reform nitrite and this recycling of nitrite depleting the available ascorbic acid. Further studies indicated that the rate of consumption of ascorbic acid by nitrite added to natural human gastric juice (pH 1.5) was extremely rapid with 200 μmol/l nitrite consumed 500 μmol/l ascorbic acid within 10 s. Conclusions: The rapid consumption of ascorbic acid in acidic gastric juice by nitrite in swallowed saliva indicates that the potential for acid nitrosation will be maximal at the GO junction and cardia where nitrite first encounters acidic gastric juice. The high incidence of mutagenesis and neoplasia at this anatomical location may be due to acid nitrosation arising from dietary nitrate.KeywordsAscorbic AcidBarrett OesophagusCardia CancerIntestinal MetaplasiaNitrateNitric OxideNitriteNitrosoaminesNitrosationOesophageal CancerVitamin C", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/003655202317284147", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2098790181", "source": "openalex"}

Drug-induced atropine-like effects in humans (including dry mouth, constipation and paralytic ileus) are described and related to animal experiments. Radiological investigations in mice indicate that alcohol delays the passage of barium along the gut, and this effect is enhanced by psychotropic drugs. Related drug interactions may result in prolonged or delayed adverse reactions. Late (delayed) deaths, recently recorded in humans and animals, may be associated with the inhibition of gastro-intestinal motility by ethical psychotropic agents, particularly when taken together with alcohol.

The data set comprised faecal egg counts (FECs) measured on 830 naturally challenged (predominant species Teladorsagia circumcincta), crossbred cashmere-producing goats over 5 years (1993-1997) and production traits (fibre traits and live weight) on 3100 goats from the same population in Scotland, over 11 years (1987-1997). Egg counts comprised repeated measurements (4 to 11) taken at 12 to 18 months of age and production traits, i.e. live weight and fibre traits, were measured at approximately 5 months of age. The goats for which FECs were available were subdivided into a line selected for decreased FECs, using the geometric mean FEC across the measurement period and goats not selected on the basis of FECs, acting as controls. The selected line had significantly lower FECs, compared with the control, in 4 out of 5 years (back transformed average proportional difference of 0·23). The heritability of a single FEC measurement (after cubic root transformation) was 0·17 and the heritability of the mean FEC was 0·32. The heritabilities of the fibre traits were moderate to high with the majority in excess of 0·5. The heritability of live weight was 0·22. Genetic correlations between FECs and production traits were slightly positive but not significantly different from zero. Phenotypic and environmental correlations were very close to zero with the environmental correlations always being negative. It is concluded that selection for reduced FEC is possible for goats. Benefits of such selection will be seen when animals are kept for more than 1 year of productive life.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s135772980005236x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2168478227", "source": "openalex"}

Oesophagitis is less common, affecting 2% of individuals. Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) have similar incidence rates of Helicobacter pylori infection as do controls. Some groups have reported that there is a lower incidence, deducing that infection does not cause, and in some way confers protection against GORD. Additional supportive evidence is available from reports of GORD development following successful H pylori eradication. The mechanisms involved are complicated. Individuals with H pylori induced pangastritis and subsequent hypochlorhydria may be protected whereas those with an antral predominant gastritis, as in duodenal ulcer disease, with an increased acid output may be prone to development of GORD. Recent evidence has linked H pylori infection with the development of inflammation of the gastric cardia---carditis. Reports are available which show that carditis is a frequent finding in patients with GORD. The incidence of both cardia and oesophageal carcinoma is increasing. The relation between GORD, carditis, intestinal metaplasia, and cardia carcinoma is unclear. Intestinal metaplasia may result from multifocal atrophic gastritis, linked to H pylori infection or from GORD and the development of Barrett's oesophagus. Long term follow up studies will be required to assess the malignant potential of these histological entities and whether or not H pylori infection has an aetiological role.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.45.2008.i13", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2055107433", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of timing of the 40 mg omeprazole once daily regimen. Methods : We evaluated the difference in effect of 40 mg omeprazole, given as a morning or evening dose, in 17 patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Gastric and oesophageal pH was recorded by portable 24‐h two‐channel pH‐metry in a cross‐over design of 14 days of morning and 14 days of evening administration. Results : In five patients pathological reflux was abolished by both regimens, four only during morning dosage, and three only during evening dosage. In the remaining five patients abolition of pathological reflux was not achieved. The therapeutic outcome and patient preference for morning or evening administration were closely related to the individual oesophageal pH curves. Patients with reflux induced by physical activity had a clear preference for morning dosage, patients with nocturnal reflux showed a clear preference for evening dosage. Gastric pH profiles showed a high inter‐individual variation; paired statistics, however, revealed a significant impact of dosage timing on the gastric pH profile. After morning dosage the work‐day part (the first 7 h) of the gastric pH profile is 0.72 ± 0.91 (mean difference of pairs ± s.d.) higher than after evening dosage ( P &lt; 0.01). After evening dosage the gastric pH during the supine period is 0.64 ± 0.83 (mean difference of pairs ± s.d.) higher than after morning dosage ( P = 0.02).

This subgroup typically contains alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase-RAS pathway, for example EGFR or HER2 gene amplifications leading to protein overexpression. In clinical practice, HER2 overexpressing metastatic gastric cancer is known to respond to treatment with anti-HER2 antibodies. By contrast, anti-EGFR antibodies have not been able to provide survival benefit in clinical trials, which, however, have not included patient selection based on the histological subtype or EGFR gene copy number analysis of the tumours. To examine the role of EGFR as a potential biomarker, we studied the prevalence, clinicopathological associations as well as prognostic role of EGFR and HER2 expression and gene amplification in intestinal adenocarcinomas of the stomach, gastro-oesophageal junction and distal oesophagus.Tissue samples from 220 patients were analysed with EGFR and HER2 immunohistochemistry. Those samples with moderate/strong staining intensity were further analysed with silver in situ hybridization to quantify gene copy numbers. The results were associated with clinical patient characteristics and survival.Moderate/strong EGFR protein expression was found in 72/220 (32.7 %) and EGFR gene amplification in 31/220 (14.1 %) of the tumours, while moderate/strong HER2 protein expression was detected in 31/220 (14.1 %) and HER2 gene amplification in 29/220 (13.2 %) of the tumours. EGFR and HER2 genes were co-amplified in eight tumours (3.6 %). EGFR gene amplification was more common in tumours of distal oesophagus/gastro-oesophageal junction/cardia than in those of gastric corpus (p = 0.013). It was associated with shortened time to cancer recurrence (p = 0.026) and cancer specific survival (p = 0.033).EGFR gene amplification is relatively common in intestinal adenocarcinomas and associates with decreased survival. It is rarely concurrent with HER2 gene amplification, suggesting that anti-EGFR therapies might be applicable to some patients not eligible for anti-HER2 treatment.

The best defined disorder is oesophagitis, but it is now evident that proton pump inhibitor therapy can resolve oesophagitis in virtually every case. The same cannot be said for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms, however, thus moving the frontier to symptom control. Endoscopy‐negative reflux disease is a heterogeneous group, no longer bound by the common denominator of endoscopic findings. In fact, three distinct patient subgroups emerge: (i) individuals who in essence have oesophagitis, but are either in remission or simply fail to meet the endoscopic criteria; (ii) patients with hypersensitivity to oesophageal stimuli; and (iii) patients with ‘functional heartburn’ whose symptoms are not related to reflux. Given this heterogeneity, it is not surprising that the efficacy of antisecretory drugs is less impressive. This has led to new therapeutic approaches beyond acid control: mucosal protective agents, either central nervous system or peripherally acting compounds aimed at normalizing hyperalgesia, and reflux inhibitors and serotonergic agents, such as tegaserod.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02185.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014123077", "source": "openalex"}

Results: After 5 years, relapse rates in both rabeprazole groups were significantly lower than with placebo (rabeprazole 20 mg, 11%; 10 mg, 23%; placebo, 63%; P &lt; 0.001 for rabeprazole vs. placebo; P = 0.005 for rabeprazole 20 mg vs. 10 mg). Both rabeprazole doses were significantly superior to placebo in preventing relapse of heartburn frequency and improving patient quality of life. Analyses of adverse events, biopsy findings and laboratory values showed no evidence of clinically significant effects. Conclusions: Five‐year maintenance therapy with rabeprazole is effective in preventing relapse of erosive or ulcerative GERD and is well tolerated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02555.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2018713675", "source": "openalex"}

Kling and Levaditi in Europe carried out experiments from 1929 to 1933, which led them to the conclusion that the digestive tract affords a ready entrance of the virus of the disease into the body. They believe that the substitution of Macacus cynomolgus for Macacus rhesus as the animal of choice for the tests supports this point of view. Toomey in the United States has arrived at a similar conclusion, not by employing a particular species of monkey for experiment, but by the use of drastic measures of inoculation, which insure that the virus makes contact with the unmyelinated nerve fibers embedded in the intestinal wall. Toomey's methods are so severe and artificial that his results cannot be regarded as simulating a natural mode of infection. We have repeated the tests of Kling and Levaditi, but in a far more comprehensive manner than was followed by them, and, like Clark and his associates who early repeated them, we have failed to confirm them. Indeed, we do not find Macacus cynomolgusand rhesus to differ in any essential way in their response to the presence of the virus of poliomyelitis in the body. Cynomolgido not respond to virus introduced into the stomach when contamination of the buccal and nasal cavities is avoided; they respond, as do rhesi, to virus directly injected into the intestine when virus passes into the intestinal wall and makes the necessary nerve fiber contact. Both Macacus cynomolgus and Macacus rhesus which have resisted feedings of virus are subject to nasal instillations of the same strains of virus and in the same degree. On the basis of the experiments reported in this paper we can reaffirm the conclusion previously arrived at by ourselves, and confirmed independently by investigators in Europe and America, namely that the only established portal of entry of the virus of poliomyelitis into the central nervous system of man is the nasal membrane, and especially the olfactory nervous areas in that membrane.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.63.2.209", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984829085", "source": "openalex"}

The sequences of the released peptides in the intestinal digestion phase were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight MS (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). According to the antithrombotic activity analysis, the inhibitory ratio of oyster peptides showed an increasing trend, reaching up to 35.80% for a digestion period of 4 h. The APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) and TT (thromboplastin time) were increased by oyster peptides for human serum in vitro. Oyster peptides showed a competitive inhibition effect on thrombin, based on Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis. Molecular docking between the antithrombotic peptides and thrombin (PDB: ) was conducted using Discovery Studio 2017. Potential inhibitors against thrombin and the mechanism of antithrombotic activity were predicted using the algorithm of CDOCKER. There are fourteen potential antithrombotic peptides, whose affinity with thrombin is higher than that of hirudin, as indicated by the \"-CDOCKER energy\" score (181.491). Peptide LSKEEIEEAKEV is similar in sequence to thrombin inhibitors. The binding sites of potential antithrombotic peptides against thrombin at the S1 pocket were compared with hirudin variant-2 (GDFEEIPEEYLQ). In addition, the peptides containing the RG/RGD sequence were identified, which can be hydrolyzed by thrombin as a substrate. Consequently, the oyster peptides released in simulated gastrointestinal digestion probably inhibit thrombin in two ways, not only as the inhibitor against the active site, but also as the substrate of thrombin. These results maybe be attributed to the potentially strong antithrombotic activity in the human digestive system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1039/c9fo01433k", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2964673677", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, a new PPI, ilaprazole, has been developed and used in GERD patients.Areas covered: The present review provides an update on the following points: current knowledge of GERD mechanisms; limitations of actual therapies; pharmacokinetic profile and metabolism of ilaprazole; initial studies on the therapeutic efficacy of ilaprazole in GERD.Expert opinion: Compared with all other approved PPIs, ilaprazole has shown an extended plasma half-life, a metabolism not significantly influenced by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism and similar safety. This characteristics account for a low inter-individual variability, particularly in Asian populations, a higher suppression of gastric acid secretion, a more rapid acid control and consequent quicker symptom relief and a better effect on nocturnal acidity. However, clinical investigations assessing the efficacy of ilaprazole in the management of GERD are lacking and therefore the potential improvements achievable with ilaprazole in the current standard of care for acid-suppressing treatment must be confirmed in large and randomly controlled clinical trials enrolling patients with both erosive and non-erosive reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2016.1232389", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2509357350", "source": "openalex"}

Defective DNA mismatch repair is implicated in a variety of gastrointestinal and other cancers; however, its role in the tumorigenesis of carcinoids has not been assessed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archivial pathology tissues from 16 neuroendocrine tumors and 9 related metastases were studied by microdissection and microsatellite analysis of extracted DNA to evaluate the degree of microsatellite instability, a marker of defective mismatch repair. The carcinoid tumors analyzed display no microsatellite instability, but, interestingly, show a number of allelic deletions scattered throughout the genome. Particularly, the vast majority of pancreatic derived tumors display loss of heterozygosity on the short arm of chromosome 8. These results suggest that genomic instability is probably not involved in neuroendocrine carcinogenesis and a tumor suppressor gene involved in pancreatic carcinoid tumorigenesis could probably be localized on chromosome 8p12-22.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.15.2.361", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1996584766", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Seventy‐eight patients with endoscopically proven oesophagitis were followed for 5 years. Biopsies taken at the start of the study, during follow‐up and after 5 years were available for 73 patients. Results: The total endoscopic relapse rate was 14.1%.

Regressive changes in LNs (nodular and/or hyaline fibrosis, sheets of foamy histiocytes or acellular mucin) were assessed by histology. In total, regressive changes were observed in 128 of 480 patients. LNs were categorised according to the absence or presence of both residual tumour and regressive changes (LN−/+ and Reg−/+). 139 cases were LN−/Reg−, 28 cases without viable LN metastases revealed regressive changes (LN−/Reg+), 100 of 313 cases with LN metastases showed regressive changes (LN+/Reg+), and 213 of 313 metastatic LN had no signs of regression (LN+/Reg−).

When ultrasound and computed tomography were combined the sensitivity increased to 83% and the specificity decreased to 81%. There was no significant difference in the assessment of supraclavicular metastases (p = 0.8), coeliac metastases (p = 1.0) or liver and other non-lymphatic abdominal metastases (p = 1.0) on ultrasound or computed tomography.

The recent recognition of carditis as a sensitive marker for GERD raises the possibility for patients with mild disease to have normal esophageal acid exposure but inflamed cardiac mucosa on biopsies of the cardia, which may be an early sign of GERD. To test this hypothesis, 171 consecutive patients evaluated for symptoms of GERD and no increased esophageal acid exposure, Barrett's esophagus or erosive esophagitis were divided into those with and without carditis. Esophageal acid exposure and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) characteristics were compared between the two groups. Comparisons were done using the Mann–Whitney U-test for non-parametric data. There were 82 patients with histologic evidence of carditis and 89 patients without carditis. Patients with carditis had a more deteriorated sphincter, determined by overall and abdominal length and resting pressure, and significantly higher esophageal acid exposure (P < 0.05). Patients with symptoms of GERD and histologic evidence of carditis may have early or mild reflux disease, which is confined to the sphincter.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-2050.2001.00191.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125058180", "source": "openalex"}

In patients with acid exposure time between 4% and 6%, GERD diagnosis has been considered inconclusive. In these cases, mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) and post‐reflux swallow‐induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index may either confirm or refute GERD diagnosis and represent predictors of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) response. Aims To investigate the diagnostic yield of MNBI and PSPW index and their relationship with PPI response in patients with inconclusive GERD diagnosis. Methods Review of impedance‐pH tracings from PPI responder/non‐responder patients with typical reflux symptoms. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the association of MNBI and PSPW index to PPI response. Results Among 233 patients evaluated, 145/233 (62.2%) were PPI responders; 62 had conclusive and 65 inconclusive evidence of GERD, 46 had reflux hypersensitivity, and 60 functional heartburn. Abnormal MNBI and PSPW index were significantly more frequent in inconclusive GERD as compared to the functional heartburn group ( P &lt; 0.001). Within the inconclusive GERD group, 35/65 (54%) patients were PPI responders and displayed a significantly higher proportion of cases with pathological MNBI or PSPW index as compared to non‐responders (32/35 [91.4%] and 30/35 [85.7%] vs 9/30 [30%] and 7/30 [23.3%], P &lt; 0.001).

This study presents a novel methodology for the quantitative assessment of GEJ and proximal gastric morphology from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Based on this data we propose a new conceptualization of the hypothesis that a flap valve mechanism contributes to reflux protection. Methods 3D models of the GEJ and proximal stomach were reconstructed from MR images in 12 healthy volunteers during respiration and on eating a test meal to maximum satiation. A rotating plane analysis measured the gastro‐esophageal insertion angle and span of contact. An ellipsoid fit provided quantitative assessment of gastric shape and orientation relative to a fixed anatomical reference point. Position of the esophageal insertion on the ‘gastric ellipse’ was noted. An ellipsoid‐cylinder model was designed to analyze the relationships among parameters describing the GEJ morphology. Key Results The insertion angle became more acute on expiration, but did not change with meal ingestion. In contrast the span of contact did not vary with respiration, but increased with gastric filling. Changes in gastric morphology with distension further augmented the span of gastro‐esophageal contact in almost 70% of the studies.

Among those who do consult physicians, only a minority present with the classical clinical symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation: more often the pattern is a nonspecific combination of upper gastrointestinal complaints that do not permit confident clinical diagnosis. Oesophagitis is now found in less than 50% of GERD patients and those without oesophagitis are sometimes said to have ‘non‐erosive reflux disease’. If a patient's clinical history is inadequate for diagnosis and the oesophageal endoscopic appearances are normal, ambulatory pH monitoring may be required if the diagnostic uncertainty is to be resolved. Despite initial enthusiasm, the ‘Proton Pump test’ for GERD has proved unreliable and has fallen from favour. Intraluminal impedence measurement is currently considered a research tool only.

Methods Analysis of retrospective data of patients treated with MAGIC style therapy between May 2006 and August 2008 with potentially operable gastro‐esophageal adenocarcinoma. Results One hundred patients underwent peri‐operative chemotherapy according to the MAGIC protocol. Median age was 66 years, with 39% above the age of 70 years. The tumours were evenly distributed between the lower esophagus, gastro‐esophageal junction and stomach. Seventy‐nine percent completed all pre‐operative cycles of chemotherapy and 81% proceeded to surgery, whilst 24% did not receive curative surgery. The median survival on an intention to treat analysis is 31.7 months from diagnosis. The median survival of patients who underwent resection has not yet been reached after a median follow‐up of 41.4 months. Conclusion Our patient population is older than the patients in the MAGIC trial (age 66 years vs. 62 years) with a much higher proportion of esophageal and GEJ tumours.

This was evident against both protein and collagen substrates using two distinct colorimetric assays. GA was able to retard the diffusion of pepsin and multiple bile acids using a Franz cell model. Using the raft-forming mode of action GA was able to remove both pepsin and multiple bile acids from a simulated reflux event.

If patients fail to respond, the dose is increased in several consecutive steps or the initial regimen is changed to a more potent medication until the patients become asymptomatic. Although such treatment strategy is widely recommended, its impact on health expenditures has not been evaluated. Methods : The economic analysis compares the medication costs of competing medical treatment strategies, using two different sets of cost data. Medication costs are estimated from the average wholesale prices (AWP) and from the lowest discount prices charged to governmental health institutions. A decision tree is used to model the step‐wise treatment of GERD. In a Monte Carlo simulation, all transition probabilities built into the model are varied over a wide range. A threshold analysis evaluates the relationship between the cost of an individual medication and its therapeutic success rate. Results : In a governmental health care system, a step‐wise strategy saves on average $916 per patient every 5 years (range: $443–$1628) in comparison with a strategy utilizing only the most potent medication. In a cost environment relying on AWP, the average savings amount to $256 (–$206 to +$1561). The smaller the cost difference between two consecutive treatment steps, the longer one needs to follow the patients to reap the benefit of the small cost difference. However, even a small cost difference can turn into tangible cost savings, if a large enough fraction of GERD patients responds to the initial step of a less potent but also less expensive medication. Conclusions : The economic analysis suggests that a step‐wise utilization of increasingly more potent and more expensive medications to treat GERD would result in appreciable cost savings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.1999.00590.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1977811105", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we aimed to explore the link between exercise and regulation of kynurenine (Kyn) metabolism and inflammation in patients with operable gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer patients, who improved significantly in depression score with exercise training.Material and Methods: Fifty GEJ cancer patients were allocated to 12 weeks of supervised training twice weekly including interval-based aerobic exercise and resistance training, or standard care. Depression score was evaluated by HADS, and blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected for determination of Kyn metabolism and inflammation across the intervention.Results: Depression scores decreased by −1.3 points in the exercise group (p < 0.01), whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Plasma 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK), a Kyn metabolite giving rise to other neurotoxic metabolites, increased by 48% (p <0.001) in the control group, while exercise training attenuated this accumulation. The production of HK is induced by inflammation, and while we observed no differences in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, exercise training ameliorated the treatment-induced intramuscular inflammation. Moreover, exercise has been suggested to convert Kyn to the neuroprotective metabolite, kynurenic acid (KA), but despite marked functional and muscular exercise-mediated adaptations, we did not observe any enhancement of KA production and related enzyme expression in the muscles of GEJ cancer patients.Conclusion: Exercise training reduced symptoms of depression in patients with GEJ cancer, and this effect was associated with an exercise-dependent attenuation of the inflammation-induced conversion of Kyn to neurotoxic metabolites.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2018.1558371", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2913459377", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To develop and validate an instrument, the Nocturnal Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Symptom Severity and Impact Questionnaire (N‐GSSIQ), to assess severity and impact of nocturnal GERD symptoms. Methods Two focus groups and 16 cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted among GERD patients to identify key issues about nocturnal symptoms. A draft instrument was tested in 196 patients at 11 clinics in the US to evaluate psychometric properties. Exploratory factor and item response theory analyses were conducted to finalize items and subscales. Internal consistency reliability, reproducibility and construct validity were examined. Results Mean age was 45 (s.d. = 13.8) years; 76% were female and 68% were Caucasian. Patient‐rated severity was mild–moderate for 69% of participants; 48% reported symptoms on two to three nights the past week. The final questionnaire includes 20 items and three subscales: Nocturnal GERD Symptoms, Morning Impact of Nocturnal GERD and Concern about Nocturnal GERD. The subscales demonstrated internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha 0.84–0.94) and were significantly correlated with similar measures and disease severity (0.41–0.81; P &lt; 0.0001).

A few studies have shown that lithium has a protective effect against gastric damage with an unknown mechanism. Some of the actions of lithium are mediated through nitric oxide (NO), which has an important role in the regulation of gastric wall blood flow as well as gastric mucosal integrity. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis if the gastro-protective effect of lithium is mediated through NO.Male Wistar rats were pre-treated with either a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, 10mg/kg), a selective inducible NO synthase inhibitor (aminoguanidine, 100mg/kg) or saline. Lithium carbonate (10, 20, 50 and 100mg/kg) was then administered intraperitoneally 1h before the induction of gastric mucosal damage. Gastric damage was induced by either water immersion stress or ethanol gavage in rats.Lithium had a significant protective effect in both stress and ethanol-induced gastric damage, but it needed in ethanol-induced gastric damage a higher dose than in the stress induced lesion. Lithium carbonate doses 20 and 50mg/kg produced plasma concentrations that were in the range of human therapeutic Li levels (0.6-1.0muM). Pre-treatment of animals with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (20 and 40mg/kg) reduced the protective effect of lithium against ethanol-induced gastric damage, but not in stress-induced damage. Aminoguanidine administration showed no effect on the damage reduction either in control or lithium treated rats.The results indicate that NO might play a role in the gastro-protective effect of lithium against ethanol-induced gastric damage in rats.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pathophys.2006.02.001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067296378", "source": "openalex"}

Both terms together, indicating complete remission, are intuitively a more realistic clinical endpoint but are assessed less often. Aim To explore this concept, we formally compared the efficacy of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) pantoprazole and esomeprazole using rates of complete remission judged against rates of healing and symptom relief separately. Methods Five hundred and eighty‐two patients with erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were randomized to treatment for 4, 8, or 12 weeks with either pantoprazole or esomeprazole 40 mg daily. Symptom relief was assessed with the validated ReQuest™‐GI subscale. Results Approximately 75% of patients were free of symptoms or had no oesophageal lesions after 4 weeks’ treatment, rising to about 93% and 96%, respectively, at 12 weeks. Complete remission rates were, however, lower at these time points; approximately 60% and about 90%, respectively. Both PPIs had similar efficacy. Conclusions Endoscopically confirmed healing and symptom relief assessed separately over‐estimated the benefits of both drugs. In contrast, complete remission indicates that patients may be treated inadequately when given the standard 4‐ to 8‐week treatment. We suggest that complete remission is a more reliable and clinically relevant endpoint of treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03337.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1524204692", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1970924828", "title": "Surgical management of refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux", "text": "Surgery in the management of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is controversial; its availability and frequency show variability between, and even within, countries. GORD is a common chronic condition, with some 20 per cent of the population in Western countries experiencing symptoms of reflux at least once a week1. When gastric juice flows back into the oesophagus, it causes heartburn and acid regurgitation (so-called ‘typical’ symptoms) and/or a variety of symptoms often referred to as ‘atypical’. Atypical symptoms include cough, hoarseness, dental erosions and angina-like chest pain.The regurgitated gastric contents may damage the oesophageal mucosa, inducing erosions, ulcers and even metaplastic change (Barrett’s oesophagus). Most patients with GORD are treated effectively by non-prescription medication or acid-suppressing drugs (proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)), or a combination of the two. Although effective2, surgery has a relatively marginal role. It is generally reserved for those few patients who are unwilling to take drugs or whose condition is considered ‘refractory’ to such treatments (patients whose symptoms or mucosal damage persist or are cured only partially by PPIs)3. When faced with a patientwith refractory disease it falls to the surgeon to decide whether or not an antireflux procedure will confer benefit. As will be shown below, the present difficulty in defining the role of surgery in the management of refractory GORD stems partly from the currently accepted Montreal definition of GORD as ‘a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or syndromes’4. According to this symptom-focused definition, all patients with typical or atypical symptoms related to acid or nonacid reflux have the disease. These patients may be prescribed a trial of medical therapy, even if their overall oesophageal exposure to gastric contents is normal. Four groups of refractory patients who might request surgery can be identified. The first group consists of poorly compliant patients, or those having an inappropriate PPI consumption because of poor timing and/or frequency of dosing. This is probably the largest group and these patients are the simplest to treat, either by correcting themedical treatment (enforcing compliance, modifying the timing and/or frequency of dosage) or, if necessary, by antireflux surgery. The second group contains patients whose refractory symptoms are different to their initial symptoms. PPIs often resolve the severe heartburn felt in the initial stages of GORD but fail to reduce volume reflux and regurgitation while stooping or straining. Cough (especially at night), episodes of wakening and choking, and poor sleep pattern are common refractory symptoms that prompt a patient to seek surgical intervention. The third group of patients have symptoms that are unresponsive to PPIs. Themain reason is a persistence of alkaline or weakly acidic reflux of duodenal contents (bile and pancreatic juice). In this situation PPIs have reduced gastric acid output, but are ineffective with respect to the alkaline component of the refluxate. The final group comprises those whose refractory symptoms are due to an altered sensitivity of the oesophageal mucosa. This results in an abnormal perception of otherwise normal events, often described as ‘acid-sensitive oesophagus’ or ‘functional heartburn’. Although no exact figure is available, it has been estimated that these last two groups account for 10–20 per cent of refractory GORD. Without refractory symptoms, there is little evidence to promote antireflux surgery, except for Barrett’s oesophagus with severe reflux requiring progressively increasing doses of PPI, or when there is an associated large paraoesophageal hernia (to prevent future strangulation or respiratory complications). For a surgeon to operate, something more than a purely symptombased definition ofGORDis required; a trial of treatment by operation is not acceptable if the chance of successful outcome is minimal. An accurate definition of disease before surgery requires the measurement of acid reflux (by 24-h pH monitoring after suspension of PPI therapy) and exclusion of dysmotility disorders (achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm). If acid exposure is abnormal, GORD may be regarded as present and surgery as justified, if symptoms warrant it. This diagnostic approach, however, does not deal satisfactorily with the last two of the four groups described above.

Alcohol was given in various doses to 56 rats, and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) assayed in liver, bile, colon, stomach and small intestine. Results were compared with 13 controls and rats given either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Results of our experiments clearly show that the activity of ADH and LDH in liver, stomach and small intestine significantly increases with administration of single and repeated doses of alcohol, and the effect persists for a significant time. The effect of alcohol appears to be specific, as increased activity in enzymes not involved in its metabolism was not found. Increased ADH activity could be blocked by actinomycin and cycloheximide which suggests that alcohol induced de novo synthesis of this enzyme protein. The increase in activity of the rate‐limiting enzyme, ADH, by its substrate ethanol, provides a plausible explanation for the observed tolerance in both rats and man conditioned by prior administration of alcohol. The increase in LDH, a terminal enzyme involved in ethanol metabolism, provides further indirect evidence that ethanol can be metabolized at a faster rate through the normal pathway. The finding of both ADH and LDH in significant amounts in stomach and small intestine in both normal and alcohol‐fed rats suggests that ethanol can be metabolized to a significant extent in extrahepatic sites. This is contrary to the current view that alcohol is metabolized entirely by the liver, and that the multiple metabolic derangements in the alcoholic are the consequence of its obligatory metabolism in that organ.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.1969.18.3.227", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2412374031", "source": "openalex"}

Postoperatively, reflux symptoms were present in only 12 per cent of patients but pH studies were still abnormal in 36 per cent and oesophagitis was observed in 32 per cent. Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was unaffected by vagotomy. Gastro-oesopheageal reflux is common in pre-operative duodenal ulcer patients and is not significantly reduced by vagotomy. Careful pre-operative oesophageal assessment is necessary to determine which duodenal ulcer patients require an anti-reflux procedure in addition to vagotomy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800721010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020784674", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to see if there is any correlation between the incidence of GO-reflux at night and nocturnal asthma. Thirty-seven adult patients with a history of nocturnal asthma for more than one hundred days a year and of reflux disease were evaluated using 24 h pH-monitoring of the oesophagus and measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate every hour when awake. Half of the patients suffered from severe GO-reflux at night, whilst the other half had no nocturnal reflux. Respiratory symptoms and inhalation of beta-2 agonists were recorded during the night and PEF was recorded when the patients awoke in the morning. A significant correlation was found between reflux at night and the degree of bronchial obstruction in the early morning, but not between night-time reflux and nocturnal respiratory symptoms.

Aim To discuss the techniques by which non‐acid reflux can be measured and to evaluate the clinical relevance of such measurements. Methods Review of the literature on non‐acid reflux monitoring. Results Ambulatory oesophageal impedance monitoring (using a catheter with ring electrodes) allows one to detect all types of gastro‐oesophageal reflux, acid as well as non‐acid. Measurement of intra‐oesophageal bilirubin concentration also detects reflux irrespective of the pH, but only when there is bilirubin in the gastric juice and technical short‐comings limit the applicability of this technique. In untreated subjects, about 50% of reflux episodes are non‐acid (nadir pH &gt; 4). In patients on acid inhibition, up to 95% of reflux episodes are non‐acid. Treatment with an acid inhibitor leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of acid reflux episodes, but not to a reduction in the total number of reflux episodes. This shift is associated with a shift in symptoms from heartburn to regurgitation. With impedance monitoring, the temporal association between symptoms that persist during inhibition of acid secretion and non‐acid reflux events can be demonstrated. In a proportion of patients with chronic cough, the coughing episodes are preceded by non‐acid reflux. Conclusions Intraluminal impedance monitoring of gastro‐oesophageal reflux is a feasible technique, which provides clinically important information about the relationships between symptoms and non‐acid reflux events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03527.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1719359897", "source": "openalex"}

Constant gastric insufflation with air (80 ml/min) was used to evoke TLOSR in unsedated, fasting animals. Oesophageal motility was monitored with a perfused manometric sleeve catheter assembly. Gastro‐oesophageal flow was recognized manometrically and by oesophageal pH recording. TLOSR occurred significantly less frequently in three recumbent positions (right lateral, left lateral and supine) than when the dog stood on four legs, but was more likely to be associated with acid reflux when they occurred in recumbent positions. Aspiration of the gastric pool was found to have no effect on triggering of TLOSR although it reduced the frequency with which acid reflux was associated with TLOSR. It is concluded that the low rate of occurrence of TLOSR in recumbent positions is unlikely to be explained by the presence of a gastric pool of liquid in proximity to the lower oesophageal sphincter.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.1989.tb00806.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084948653", "source": "openalex"}

Antireflux surgery is cost-effective and is preferred by many patients. A total (360o or Nissen) fundoplication is the traditional procedure, but other variations including partial fundoplications are also commonly performed, with the aim of achieving durable reflux control with minimal dysphagia. Many RCTs and some pairwise meta-analyses have compared some of these procedures but there is still uncertainty about which, if any, is superior. Network meta-analysis allows multiple simultaneous comparisons and robust synthesis of the available evidence in these situations. A network meta-analysis comparing all antireflux procedures was performed to identify which has the most favourable outcomes at short-term (3–12 months), medium-term (1–5 years) and long-term (10 years and more than 10 years) follow-up. Methods Article databases were searched systematically for all eligible RCTs. Primary outcomes were quality-of-life measures and dysphagia. Secondary outcomes included reflux symptoms, pH studies and complications. Results Fifty-one RCTs were included, involving 5357 patients and 14 different treatments. Posterior partial fundoplication ranked best in terms of reflux symptoms, and caused less dysphagia than most other interventions including Nissen fundoplication. This was consistent across all time points and outcome measures. Conclusion Posterior partial fundoplication provides the best balance of long-term, durable reflux control with less dysphagia, compared with other treatments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10924", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2883392940", "source": "openalex"}

It has become clear that TGF-α has increased expression in metaplastic, dysplastic and neoplastic tissue of the oesophagus compared with normal mucosa. The degree of abnormal expression becomes more marked as dysplasia increases. TGF-α expression is also increased in gastric neoplasias. EGF has a different pattern of expression, being decreased in oesophagitis and increased in gastritis. Although EGF is present in Barrett's oesophagitis, the expression of EGF does not discriminate between dysplastic and neoplastic epithelium. EGF-R is normally expressed on all gastrointestinal epithelia, but its expression is increased in Barrett's epithelium, as well as in adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and the stomach. The two peptides bind to their receptors on the mucosal cell membranes, and the co-expression of peptide and receptor is positively associated with varying degrees of cellular proliferation. The density of receptor expression may modulate the proliferative stimulus, leading to either mitogenic (regulated) or oncogenic (unregulated) growth.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000171396", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1982005872", "source": "openalex"}

An unanswered question is whether these changes may regress under long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). This fact prompted us to investigate the effect of PPI treatment on the histological changes observed in the lower oesophagus. Methods: 295 patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive GORD were investigated by endoscopy/biopsy prior to and during the course of a 12-month PPI treatment regimen (8 weeks acute treatment with 30 mg lansoprazole/day followed by long-term treatment with 15 or 30 mg lansoprazole or 20 mg omeprazole/day). The parameters studied were the frequency of ulcers and erosions and the hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae prior to treatment and on day 56 (D56), after 6 months (M6) and after 12 months (M12) of treatment. Results: In the various treatment groups, the results showed no statistically significant differences. Ulcers and erosions (prior to treatment 21% and 31%, respectively) were detected statistically significantly less frequently under PPI treatment (ulcers, D56: 1%, M6 and M12, 0%; erosions, D56: 2%, M6: 4%, M12, 3%). While high-grade hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae was found in 51% of the cases prior to treatment, the corresponding figures were only 3% (D56, M6) and 2% (M12). In contrast, the percentage of cases with normal oesophageal epithelium increased from 8% before treatment to 55% (D56), 66% (M6) and 63% (M12). Conclusions: Our study shows not only that erosions and ulcers heal under PPI treatment, but also that hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation of papillae in the squamous epithelium of the oesophageal mucosa may normalize, and are thus presumably not 'normal physiological variants'.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/003655200750056574", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130110001", "source": "openalex"}

Ratio of Gelucire 43/01 to HPMC K4M (X1) and the type of filler (X2) were selected as independent variables while buoyancy lag time (BLT), drug release at 1h (Q1), 6h (Q6), and the 12h (Q12) were selected as dependent variables. Materials and Methods: Gastro-retentive tablets of famotidine were prepared by a solvent free melt granulation technique using Gelucire 43/01 as a hydrophobic meltable binder. HPMC K4M and sodium bicarbonate were used as matrixing agent and gas-generating agent, respectively. Prepared tablets were evaluated for in vitro dissolution, in vitro buoyancy, friability, hardness, drug content and weight variation. Dissolution data were fitted to various models to ascertain kinetics of drug release. The data were analyzed using regression analysis and analysis of variance. Results: All formulations (F1-F9) showed floating within 3min and had total floating time of more than 12h. It was observed that a type of filler and the ratio of Gelucire 43/01 to HPMC K4M had significant influence on buoyancy lag time (P = 0.037) and Q6 (P = 0.011), respectively without significant influence on Q1 and Q12.

Interrogating the intersections of food, gender, race, sexuality, and performance, this essay explores how the cable-television show, Down Home with the Neelys, depicts a nouveau gastro-porn anchored in the perceived pornographic level of blackness itself. The author reveals the ways that food and performances of food become a medium of gendering and racialization employed by American popular media. Through the lens of reality television, shows like Down Home (re)produce a certain type of black heterosexuality and gendered enactments of domesticity and space, while challenging dominant televisual reflections of black love and labor. The author argues that the Neelys self-consciously employ a vernacular aesthetic performative of \"down home\" (a uniquely classed, temporally–spatially situated, and sexualized blackness) to exploit the phenomenon of gastro-porn in a highly lucrative performance that signals the entangled artifice of gender, race, and sexuality. More than offering culinary expertise and education, such cooking instruction reveals the pedagogy of gender, race, and sexuality as visual lessons of a complex and contradictory authenticity. This essay reveals television cooking shows as critical sites for considering the domestic laboring of gendered and racialized sexualities. In particular, shows like Down Home evince the ways that race continues to be rendered in visual terms and the enduring edibility of blackness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/0740770x.2013.853916", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031854039", "source": "openalex"}

HRQL was assessed yearly with the Short‐Form 36 and the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD) questionnaires. Associations between patient characteristics and changes in HRQL were analysed using multiple logistic regression models. Results After 5 years, data on HRQL were available for 4597 (74%) patients. Both generic and disease‐specific HRQL improved after baseline and remained well above baseline levels in the following years. A clinically relevant decrease in QOLRAD scores was reported by 3–5% of patients.

In addition, abomasal and duodenal pH, flow rate of digesta of the duodenum, and faecal water content were determined. The 80–90 min cycles of antral contractions were shortened for at least 3 weeks after infection. This was accompanied by a 26% increase in the number of duodenal migrating myoelectric complexes/day during the intra-parietal development of the larvae (10–12 days). Concomitantly, the duodenal flow of digesta increased from 215 ± 22 ml/h to 318 ± 15 ml/h 4 days after infection and was associated with a higher water content of the faeces. The frequency of the migrating myoelectric complexes, but not the duration of antral motor cycles (or the duodenal flow rate), was correlated with both gastric (P &lt; 0·01) and duodenal (P &lt; 0·05) pH after the first and second infections. The duodenal flow rate was correlated with the Cl− concentration of the abomasal contents (P &lt; 0·01) and with the duodenal pH (P &lt; 0·05). It is concluded that, (i) the duodenal motor disturbances associated with experimental H. contortus infection are related to the alterations in abomasal gastric acid secretion which occurs during the histotrophic phase of larval development and (ii) the increased duodenal flow is a consequence of ionic permeability changes of the gastro-intestinal mucosae.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182000044905", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022548702", "source": "openalex"}

This reflux becomes pathological when it leads to symptoms severe enough for the patient to seek medical help or results in reflux oesophagitis or its complications. Damage to the oesophageal mucosa develops when the balance between aggressive and defensive factors is no longer in equilibrium. The main aggressive factor is acid-pepsin or alkaline bile secretion. Defence against this aggression is based on rapid removal of the refluxate from the oesophagus (oesophageal clearance) and on poorly understood mucosal resistance. The length of time acid is in contact with the oesophageal mucosa is shortened by adoption of an upright position, by swallow-induced oesophageal peristalsis and saliva. Treatment of pathological reflux aims (1) to decrease acid aggression by means of H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors; (2) to strengthen the anti-reflux barrier and improve oesophageal clearance by prokinetic drugs that increase the LOS pressure and enhance peristaltic contractions; and (3) to boost mucosal resistance by sucralfate or prostaglandin analogues. Initial treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease may be symptomatic provided that there are no alarming symptoms, such as dysphagia, anaemia or weight loss. Usually either H2-receptor blockers or prokinetic drugs are used. Endoscopy is indicated whenever alarming symptoms are present and when there is insufficient symptomatic improvement after a 4-6-week therapeutic trial. Moderate oesophagitis may be treated in the same way. Severe oesophagitis often requires more vigorous treatment, e.g. by proton pump blockers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365528909091225", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2026685363", "source": "openalex"}

The current perception is that reflux disease is an entirely acid‐mediated condition, and antisecretory therapies, particularly proton pump inhibitors, are the treatment of choice for patients with erosive and non‐erosive reflux disease. A positive patient response to an empiric trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, or the ‘PPI test’, is commonly suggested as a method of GERD diagnosis. Recent studies have modified our understanding of the relationship between oesophageal acid exposure and GERD pathology, manifestations and symptoms. Whereas the use of PPIs to reduce oesophageal acid exposure in patients with erosions is associated with increased healing rates, non‐erosive reflux disease patients are less likely to have an abnormal oesophageal pH profile. Patterns of oesophageal acid exposure, particularly nocturnal oesophageal acid exposure, have been linked to increased disease severity. Non‐acidic reflux and the effect of PPIs on this parameter, including bile reflux and the toxicity of bile acids, may also be an important factor in GERD. This article explores some of these assumptions, practices and relationships, including: the association between oesophageal acid exposure and erosive and non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease; the effect of PPIs on oesophageal acid exposure in erosive oesophagitis patients; the influence of nocturnal acid secretion in GERD and the use of PPIs to control this parameter; the relevance of the PPI test for reflux disease diagnosis; and PPI influence on non‐acidic reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02802.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2052569066", "source": "openalex"}

However, there exists a possibility that this serendipitous occurrence will undermine the impact of the Cochrane Review findings. Essentially, the outcome of the study was negative, with no benefits being shown for cisapride in improving the symptoms of GOR in children. In addition, the authors of the report were critical of the quality of data available, noting in particular evidence for substantial publication bias in favour of studies with a positive outcome. Both the immediate and wider implications of the findings of Augood and colleagues1 are deserving of comment. GOR in young children is a common occurrence. In the vast majority of children reflux is harmless, self limiting, and can be viewed as a physiological variant rather than a disease. This form of GOR is best managed with reassurance and ongoing clinical monitoring. In a minority of cases GOR is complicated by oesophagitis, respiratory symptoms, Sandifer syndrome or failure to thrive, and it is then referred to as GOR disease (GORD). Under such circumstances, medical and/or surgical intervention is usually necessary. The pathophysiology of GOR in children is still poorly understood.

The risk factors for OS also included old age, gastric tumor location, and poor differentiation. In conclusion, although PTR prolonged OS in all GEP‐NEN patients presenting with LM, surgical recipients should be considered carefully.

First generation cross of Sumatra × Barbados Blackbelly had lowest eggs per g of faeces (EPG) followed by Sumatra, St Croix, Sumatra × St Croix Fl and F2 and Sumatra × Java Fat tail. Lambs born in February-March when rainfall was low had lower EPG (V &lt; 0·05) than those born in May-June or August-September.

This study was designed to investigate the interrelation between oesophageal acid and both resting and stimulated salivary secretion. In 10 healthy volunteers, the acid clearance times after bolus infusion of 20 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid were measured by means of ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. With a constant swallowing rate and resting salivary flow, the acid clearance time was significantly longer with dry as opposed to wet swallows (12.6 ± 2.6 vs. 6.9 ± 1.9 min; p = 0.01). When the salivary flow was doubled by chewing a gum base (26.0 ± 3.4 vs. 13.2 ± 2.0 ml/l5 min; p = 0.005), the acid clearance time was markedly shortened (6.9 ± 1.9 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2 min; p = 0.02).

At 95% specificity, tumor detection was possible by the best single marker in colorectal cancer patients in 48% (Tumor M2-PK), in gastric cancers in 61% (CA72-4) and in esophageal cancers in 56% (Tumor M2-PK). A fuzzy logic rule-based system employing a tumor marker panel increased sensitivity significantly in colorectal cancers (p<0. 001) to 63% (Tumor M2-PK and CEA), in gastric cancers (p<0.001) to 81% (Tumor M2-PK and CA 72-4) and in esophageal cancers (p<0.02) to 74% (Tumor M2-PK and CA72-4). Adding a third marker further improved the sensitivity only marginally. Fuzzy logic analysis has proven to be more powerful than measurement of single markers alone or combinations using multiple logistic regression analysis of the markers. Therefore, with the fuzzy logic method and a tumor marker panel (including Tumor M2-PK), a new diagnostic tool for the detection of gastro-intestinal cancers is available.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2185047227", "source": "openalex"}

Possible complications include oesophagitis, ulcer, stricture and Barrett’s oesophagus. Evidence suggests that the intraoesophageal pH correlates directly with the degree of mucosal injury. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the first choice of therapy because they are significantly more effective than histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RAs) in achieving and sustaining an intragastric pH above 4.0. Numerous trials have shown that PPIs provide superior and faster relief of heartburn compared with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RAs. PPIs have also been shown to be superior to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RAs in healing oesophageal ulcers and improving the clinical outcome of patients with stricture formation. Unfortunately, even higher-than-standard doses of PPIs do not provide a complete regression in the length of Barrett’s oesophagus, which is the most serious complication of GORD. Although the majority of patients with oesophagitis relapse within 6 months of stopping PPI therapy, maintenance PPI therapy prevents this in more than 80% of cases. Surgical and endoscopic procedures are alternative approaches to managing GORD. Surgery is successful but is not without risk. Endoscopic procedures are promising, but comparative and longer-term efficacy and safety data are needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000076371", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010274194", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence suggests that microbially produced neuroactive molecules, like γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can modulate the gut-brain axis. Two natural strains of Lactococcus lactis and one mutant were characterized in vitro for their GABA production and tested in vivo in rat by oral gavage for their antinociceptive properties. L. lactis NCDO2118 significantly reduced visceral hypersensitivity induced by stress due to its glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity. L. lactis NCDO2727 with similar genes for GABA metabolism but no detectable GAD activity had no in vivo effect, as well as the NCDO2118 ΔgadB mutant. The antinociceptive effect observed for the NCDO2118 strain was mediated by the production of GABA in the gastro-intestinal tract and blocked by GABA B receptor antagonist.

Ambulatory 24‐h pH manometry was performed and gastric emptying was assessed by the 13 C‐octanoic acid breath test on the seventh day of treatment. Results : A significant decrease was found in the mean (± s.e.) percentage of reflux time (intra‐oesophageal pH &lt; 4) for ABT‐229 5 mg b.d. and 10 mg b.d., but not for 2.5 mg b.d., compared with placebo.

The notion behind this proposed change in current practice is that antireflux surgery (ARS) is more “cost effective” than medical therapy and possibly safer with regard to the long term effects of acid suppression and occurrence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus in patients with severe chronic GORD. Our position challenges this view, which in our opinion is not supported by scientific evidence and data in the recent literature. If it is assumed that modern drug therapy and ARS are both effective in the treatment of GORD, a comparison between them should concentrate on several end points that have been recognised as major goals of antireflux therapy. Hence in addition to healing of oesophagitis, emphasis now needs to be given to complete symptom relief, return to a normal quality of life, and long term control of the disease (that is, prevention of recurrences and complications). Tolerance, safety, and costs are also important issues. Comparison is limited by lack of randomised trials between laparoscopic surgery and modern drug therapy (that is, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)). Although Spechler1 first reported that open ARS was significantly better than medical therapy after two or three years of follow up, the comparison involved drugs which are no longer considered as optimal therapy for GORD.

Here, we describe successful arterial reconstruction using the middle colic artery in a patient who had undergone esophageal reconstruction with a gastric tube and whose right gastro-omental artery had been resected.A 70-year-old man underwent subtotal esophagectomy and reconstructive surgery with a retrosternal gastric tube for esophageal cancer. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a tumor on the pancreatic head that was adjacent to the right gastro-omental artery. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) was subsequently performed. The gastro-omental artery was resected along with the tumor, creating a 7-cm deficit. The anastomosis was performed between the right branch of the middle colic artery and the distal end of the right gastro-omental artery. No complications that involved blood flow to the reconstructed esophagus were postoperatively observed. Four months after surgery, the blood flow to the gastric tube was confirmed by a contrast CT scan.We reconstructed the right gastro-omental artery using the middle colic artery, and not a vein graft, as that would have required vessel anastomosis at two locations. The middle colic artery branches on the posterior surface of the pancreas, which is located close to the right gastro-omental artery.The middle colic artery provides sufficient blood supply to the pulled-up gastric tube.

The aim of this study is to investigate the direct effects of luminal RNOS on the adjacent gastric barrier function using an ex vivo chamber model.A chamber model in which the rat gastric mucosal membrane was mounted between the two halves of a chamber was designed to simulate the microenvironment of the lumen and the adjacent mucosa of the gastro-oesophageal junction. On the mucosal side of the chamber, RNOS were generated by the acidification of physiological concentrations of sodium nitrite. The epithelial barrier function was evaluated by electrophysiological transmembrane resistance, and membrane permeability with [3H]mannitol flux. The expression of occludin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Dinitrosyl dithiolato iron complex (DNIC) was also measured by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to confirm the diffusion of RNOS from the mucosal lumen into the mounted mucosa.The administration of acidified nitrite to the mucosal lumen caused both a decrease in transmembrane resistance and an increase in epithelial permeability, suggesting a disturbance of the gastric barrier function. These changes were accompanied by a derangement of the expression of occludin. The diffusion of luminal RNOS into the mounted membrane was confirmed by showing the generation of DNIC within the tissue.Simulating the microenvironment of the human gastro-oesophageal junction, this study demonstrated that RNOS generated luminally at the human gastro-oesophageal junction can derange the barrier function of the adjacent tissue by disrupting the tight junction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2007.128074", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035666237", "source": "openalex"}

When the condition causes pathological symptoms and/or complications it is considered gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). It appears to be increasingly diagnosed and causes great distress in the first year of infancy. In New South Wales (NSW), residential parenting services support families with early parenting difficulties. These services report a large number of babies admitted with a label of GOR/GORD. The aim of this study was to explore the maternal and infant characteristics, obstetric interventions, and reasons for clinical reporting of GOR/GORD in NSW in the first 12 months following birth (2000-2011).A three phase, mixed method sequential design was used. Phase 1 included a linked data population based study (n = 869,188 admitted babies). Phase 2 included a random audit of 326 medical records from admissions to residential parenting centres in NSW (2013). Phase 3 included eight focus groups undertaken with 45 nurses and doctors working in residential parenting centres in NSW.There were a total of 1,156,020 admissions recorded of babies in the first year following birth, with 11,513 containing a diagnostic code for GOR/GORD (1% of infants admitted to hospitals in the first 12 months following birth). Babies with GOR/GORD were also more likely to be admitted with other disorders such as feeding difficulties, sleep problems, and excessive crying. The mothers of babies admitted with a diagnostic code of GOR/GORD were more likely to be primiparous, Australian born, give birth in a private hospital and have: a psychiatric condition; a preterm or early term infant (37-or-38 weeks); a caesarean section; an admission of the baby to SCN/NICU; and a male infant. Thirty six percent of infants admitted to residential parenting centres in NSW had been given a diagnosis of GOR/GORD. Focus group data revealed two themes: \"It is over diagnosed\" and \"A medical label is a quick fix, but what else could be going on?\"Mothers with a mental health disorder are nearly five times as likely to have a baby admitted with GOR/GORD in the first year after birth. We propose a new way of approaching the GOR/GORD issue that considers the impact of early birth (immaturity), disturbance of the microbiome (caesarean section) and mental health (maternal anxiety in particular).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-0999-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2797402486", "source": "openalex"}

However, the long-term effects of this hydrolysate and its fractions on blood pressure are not known. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to determine the effects of long term administration of fried whole egg hydrolysate and its fractions (i.e. egg white and egg yolk) on regulation of blood pressure and associated factors in cardiovascular disease such as plasma lipid profile and tissue oxidative stress. Methods and Results We used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of essential hypertension. Hydrolysates of fried egg and its fractions were prepared by simulated gastro-intestinal digestion with pepsin and pancreatin. 16–17 week old male SHRs were orally administered fried whole egg hydrolysate, non-hydrolyzed fried whole egg, egg white hydrolysate or egg yolk hydrolysates (either defatted, or not) daily for 18 days. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were monitored by telemetry. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the treatment for vascular function studies and evaluating plasma lipid profile and tissue oxidative stress. BP was reduced by feeding fried whole egg hydrolysate but not by the non-hydrolyzed product suggesting a critical role for in vitro digestion in releasing anti-hypertensive peptides. Egg white hydrolysate and defatted egg yolk hydrolysate (but not egg yolk hydrolysate) also had similar effects. Reduction in BP was accompanied by the restoration of nitric oxide (NO) dependent vasorelaxation and reduction of plasma angiotensin II. Fried whole egg hydrolysate also reduced plasma levels of triglyceride although it was increased by the non-hydrolyzed sample. Additionally the hydrolyzed preparations attenuated tissue oxidative stress. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that fried egg hydrolysates exert anti-hypertensive effects, improve plasma lipid profile and attenuate tissue oxidative stress in vivo.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035423221", "source": "openalex"}

Infections often arise through consumption of contaminated foods, where high intrinsic resistance to food processing practises permit survival and growth. Several practises, including refrigeration, acidification and oxygen limitation are ineffective in controlling L. monocytogenes, therefore foods which do not undergo thermal processing, e.g. ready-to-eat products, are considered high risk. While the responses to several food processing practises have been investigated, there are few reports on the responses of L. monocytogenes to oxygen limitation. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oxygen limitation on stress response andsurvival capacity during simulated gastro-intestinal transit.Anaerobiosis induced an acid tolerance response, causing cells to be more resistant to organic and inorganic acids than aerobically grown counterparts (p < 0.05). Using a gastro-intestinal transit model it was found that anaerobic growth induced an acid tolerance response which enhanced resistance to pH 2.5 simulated gastric juice (SGJ) compared to aerobically grown cells (p < 0.05). This response was most pronounced in exponential phase cells. However, exposure of stationary phase cells to pH 3.5 SGJ enhanced bile tolerance, suggesting a link between acid and bile tolerance.The responses of L. monocytogenes to oxygen limitation are not extensively studied. These findings provide an initial insight into the effects of anaerobiosis on stress response and survival potential in L. monocytogenes. While it appears anaerobiosis may impact these, further work is required to confirm these findings are not strain specific.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-015-0058-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056060442", "source": "openalex"}

The accuracy of tumour and nodal staging using both modalities was compared to the final histological staging of the resected specimens. In staging depth of tumour growth, EUS was significantly more accurate (87% of lesions correctly staged) than CT (40% correctly staged). In staging nodal involvement, EUS was again significantly more accurate (73% correctly staged) than CT (33%). Two‐thirds of the lesions were traversable with the endoscopic probe, but most of the nontraversed lesions were correctly staged on EUS. In this study, CT has performed poorly as a staging modality for carcinoma at the gastro‐oesophageal junction. Other studies have shown CT to be less accurate at this location than at other oesophageal sites. The orientation of the gastro‐oesophageal junction, lack of surrounding fat planes, proximity of adjacent organs and patient motion contribute to the poor staging performance of CT at this location. In contrast, EUS has been an accurate staging modality at the gastro‐oesophageal junction in this study and compares well with other studies evaluating EUS in the more proximal oesophagus. Endoscopic ultrasound is therefore a necessary modality if accurate pre‐operative staging of gastro‐oesophageal junction carcinoma is to be achieved.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1673.1996.tb00386.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2041333915", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To determine histopathology and electron microscopic changes in oesophageal and laryngeal epithelium in chronic laryngitis. Methods In this prospective blinded study, we enrolled 53 participants: 15 controls, 20 patients with GERD and 18 patients with chronic laryngitis. The latter two groups were subsequently treated with lansoprazole 30 mg bid for 12‐weeks. Baseline and postacid suppressive therapy biopsies were obtained from distal oesophagus and laryngeal postcricoid areas. Biopsy specimens were evaluated for histopathology and dilated intercellular space changes. Results There was no significant increase in oesophageal or laryngeal epithelium intercellular spaces among GERD or laryngitis patients compared with controls at baseline or postacid suppressive therapy. Only patients with GERD had significantly ( P = 0.03) higher proportion of moderate‐to‐severe oesophageal spongiosis and basal cell hyperplasia, which normalized postacid suppressive therapy.

A short trial of acid suppression with a proton‐pump inhibitor is often used in clinical practice as a diagnostic test for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. If there is a significant improvement in symptoms, the patient is considered to have gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Several studies have evaluated the administration of proton‐pump inhibitors as a diagnostic test for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. A recent meta‐analysis found that response to a proton‐pump inhibitor had limited value as a diagnostic test. Likelihood ratios for a positive test ranged from 0.45 to 1.86. The positive predictive value of the test ranged from 0.17 to 0.90 and the negative predictive value from 0.17 to 1, depending on the gold standard against which comparisons were made. These results may be explained by the inadequacy of the gold standard against which the proton‐pump inhibitor test is compared or by the inability of acid suppression to differentiate between gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease or dyspepsia. Although a trial of acid suppression may have pragmatic value in clinical practice, the proton‐pump inhibitor test is not an accurate test for the diagnosis of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02612.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007163820", "source": "openalex"}

Underlying mechanisms are not understood, but vascular shunting away from the gut could be responsible. Therefore, blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and hepatic portal vein (HPV) was examined at sea level (SL) and after ascent to 4392 m (HA).Twelve subjects [eight male, mean age 40 (22-72) years] were studied following an overnight fast and a standard meal. Cross-sectional vessel area and blood velocity were measured by ultrasound, systolic and diastolic flow calculated for the SMA (HR x vessel area x velocity, cm(3) min(-1)) and mean flow for the HPV.All subjects experienced reduced appetite at HA. Blood flow in the SMA and HPV increased following food at SL (mean SMA systolic flow 1024 vs. 3316 cm(3) min(-1), P < 0.001; HPV 505 vs. 1789, P < 0.001) and at HA (2020 vs. 3767, P < 0.001; HPV 708 vs. 1727, P < 0.001). Pre-prandial flow in the SMA and HPV was significantly increased at HA compared with SL. The changes were due to increased vessel diameter and increased flow velocity. There was no difference in post-prandial flow between SL and HA in the HPV, although the increase in post-prandial flow was greater at SL than HA (254% increase vs. 144%).These results show that resting blood flow in the gastrointestinal tract is increased during exposure to high-altitude hypoxia, and that the vascular response of increased blood flow following food ingestion is maintained.

We tested observational and MR-based associations between GORD and four adiposity measures [body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), a metabolically favourable higher body-fat percentage and waist circumference], smoking status, smoking frequency and caffeine consumption.Observationally, all adiposity measures were associated with higher odds of GORD. Ever and current smoking were associated with higher odds of GORD. Coffee consumption was associated with lower odds of GORD but, among coffee drinkers, more caffeinated-coffee consumption was associated with higher odds of GORD. Using MR, we provide strong evidence that higher WHR and higher WHR adjusted for BMI lead to GORD. There was weak evidence that higher BMI, body-fat percentage, coffee drinking or smoking caused GORD, but only the observational effects for BMI and body-fat percentage could be excluded. This MR estimated effect for WHR equates to a 1.23-fold higher odds of GORD per 5-cm increase in waist circumference.These results provide strong evidence that a higher waist-hip ratio leads to GORD.

The current \"gold-standard\" for diagnosing BE is endoscopy which remains prohibitively expensive and impractical as a population screening tool. We aimed to develop a pre-screening tool to aid decision making for diagnostic referrals. Methodology/Principal Findings A prospective (training) cohort of 1603 patients attending for endoscopy was used for identification of risk factors to develop a risk prediction model. Factors associated with BE in the univariate analysis were selected to develop prediction models that were validated in an independent, external cohort of 477 non-BE patients referred for endoscopy with symptoms of reflux or dyspepsia. Two prediction models were developed separately for columnar lined epithelium (CLE) of any length and using a stricter definition of intestinal metaplasia (IM) with segments ≥2 cm with areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.67–0.77) and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.76–0.86), respectively.

This latter effect may, in turn, result in an increase in the number of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLOSRs) elicited through a vago–vagal reflex originating in the mechanoreceptors located in the subcardial area.3TLOSRs are considered to be the main motor mechanism associated with the occurrence of reflux episodes both in asymptomatic subjects and reflux patients with or without oesophagitis.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2332855464", "title": "Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy and Gastro-Esophageal Reflux: Are We Correctly Addressing the Question?", "text": "Since its first use in children in 1980 by Gauderer et al., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been increasingly used for long-term enteral nutrition in children to supplement nutrition in a variety of chronic conditions. Several early and late complications, including gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), have been reported using both gastrostomy tubes and buttons (1). However, despite this increasing experience, the relationship between PEG and GER is still a matter of debate and remains an incompletely answered question: can PEG placement lead to the development or worsening of GER? WHAT ARE THE INCIDENCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF GER BEFORE PEG PLACEMENT IN CHILDREN UNDERGOING PEG? Conditions for which PEG is required in children are associated with a high rate of GER: neurologic impairment (15–75%), myopathy (36%), cystic fibrosis (25–76%), and chronic respiratory failure (up to 85%). Psychomotor retarded persons, in whom more than 50% of all indications of PEG are present, are predisposed to GER due to the following causes, which can be associated in the same child: dysmotility of the esophagus; lowered esophageal sphincter pressure; gastric emptying abnormalities; and increased abdominal pressure because of spasticity, seizures, scoliosis, constipation, or abnormal posturing. In the disabled child, GER is frequently associated with recurrent vomiting, esophagitis, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and malnutrition (2). WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PEG AND GER? Several factors may contribute to the occurrence or worsening of GER after gastrostomy placement: severity of the underlying disease; increase of trans-diaphragmatic pressure by the forced expiration of coughing and wheezing in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; type and location of the gastrostomy tube; and type of feeding (bolus versus continuous). In adults, using scintigraphic and manometry techniques, it has been shown that rapid intragastric bolus infusion leads to a reduction in lower esophageal sphincter pressure to an incompetent level and reduced gastroesophageal reflux. Continuous gastrostomy feedings did not alter LES pressure or show free gastroesophageal reflux by scintigraphy (3). Malnutrition has also been suggested to have a deleterious effect on GER (4). In some children, nutritional restitution has been associated with the complete cessation of vomiting attributed to GER (4). Nutritional restitution in children related to enteral nutrition throughout GPE has been associated with significant decreases in the number of episodes of GER, as well as the frequency of esophagitis. Surgical gastrostomy worsens GER (5–8), and this effect could be more frequent than that seen following PEG (9). Anatomically, this is caused by increasing the angle of the lower esophageal sphincter (8). However, most of the studies on surgical gastrostomy performed during the 1980s were retrospective, and frequently relied only on clinical parameters for assessing GER. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study comparing the effect of surgical gastrostomy and PEG on GER. In the study published in the present issue of the journal, Razeghi et al. (10) interestingly found that location of PEG in the antrum was significantly associated with an increase of GER, thus suggesting that the location of the tube might influence the occurrence or worsening of GER (10). However, because the location of the PEG tube was not prospectively randomized but instead was influenced by the individual anatomy of the stomach, we cannot therefore rule out that other underlying factors, such as spinal deformity, could have influenced both the location of the tube and the occurrence of GER. WHY IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEG AND GER STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE? Contradictory data exist in the literature on the relationship between PEG and GER. Sulaeman et al. (11), Launay et al. (9), and Samuel et al. (12) have previously shown that GER does not worsen after PEG, but these results conflict with those of others (13–15). However, most of the published studies included children with a very wide age range—sometimes adolescents and young adults—and different underlying diseases. The inclusion criteria differed from study to study: some criteria included all the children requiring PEG, whereas others included only children with signs of GER. Methods for diagnosing GER were also different among the studies and might have influenced the results and the conclusions. Thus, some of the studies released only clinical symptoms, whereas others were based on pH-metry, on manometry or even on endoscopy, which cannot affirm GER diagnosis. Gastroesophageal scintigraphy has rarely been used to assess the incidence of GER and lung aspiration after the insertion of PEG. The study by Dr. Razeghi et al. (10), introduced above, is one of the largest on this topic. It included 68 children, adolescents, and young adults, who were studied prospectively before and after PEG placement. The children were not treated for GER before PEG placement. However, 15 of the 68 patients presented with GER at pH-metry. The study clearly shows that PEG does not provoke GER, and nor did it worsen GER in the 15 patients with abnormal pH-metry findings before PEG placement. The conclusions of this study are limited to selected patients with no or mild GER. Indeed, more than 200 of the 290 patients who had undergone PEG during the study period were not included because of treatment with omeprazole or cisapride before PEG placement. Little new information was provided by this study on the evolution of pre-existing GER after PEG. This situation contrasts with most of the other studies published in the literature, which included both patients with and without preexisting GER. Several limitations—also applicable to most of the other published studies—can be observed in Razeghi's study: the highly variable delay between PEG and control pH-metry (3–1454 days); the high range of ages (from newborn to 24 years); the high variety of underlying diseases; and the arbitrary definition of GER at pH-metry, when the reflux index was considered to be abnormal if it was greater than 10% before the age of 12 months, and greater than 4% for older children. WHAT HAS BEEN ADVISED IN THE PAST IN CASE OF GER BEFORE PEG PLACEMENT? The presence of GER before PEG and/or aggravation of GER after PEG in some groups of children (especially those with neurologic impairment) has led some teams to perform systematic antireflux surgery at the time of gastrostomy (6). However, such surgery is frequently complicated in disabled children. A high rate of perioperative and late complications, and a recurrence of complaints results in an operative failure rate of about 25%, with reoperation being required in up to 50% of the patients. While serious perioperative and postoperative complications are uncommon following fundoplication, significant long-term postoperative morbidity is quite common in children with profound neurologic impairment. Fundoplication is the most common cause of the postoperative dumping syndrome in children (16). Persistent gazing and/or retching, severe aerophagia associated with abdominal pain following fundoplication can be extremely persistent, and may be seen in conjunction with rapid and profound deterioration in oral function. Clinically significant GER that required an antireflux procedure developed in 3 to 11% of all children who underwent PEG insertion in one series (17). WHAT SHOULD WE DO IN PRACTICE? Several parameters should be taken into account and clinical action needs a multidisciplinary approach: nutritional status, etiology and prognosis of underlying disease, and respiratory status must all be considered. Such a pragmatic attitude has only rarely been evaluated (11,18). The concept of systematic prophylactic fundoplication associated with PEG placement should obviously be ruled out. However, a detailed evaluation of the clinical history and associated symptoms provides valuable guidance in determining the significance and the importance of GER disease. In all cases, patients should be evaluated at least clinically to determine the presence of GER and its importance before PEG placement. Esophagoscopy concomitant to PEG may also help to assess the presence of esophagitis, which indirectly proves the preexistence of GER before PEG. If GER is absent or is controlled by early medical treatment including proton pump inhibitors, PEG should be performed. Careful follow-up is therefore needed to diagnose GER and/or complications related to GER such as lung aspiration. If GER occurs or worsens after PEG, medical treatment should be adapted first, such as the use of proton pump inhibitors and/or replacement of bolus feeding with continuous enteral nutrition. Fundoplication or gastro-jejunostomy should be proposed in case of failure. If a severe GER associated with impaired pulmonary function is present before PEG feeding is decided, or when GER is not controlled by medical treatment, alternatives to PEG should be discussed, such as gastrostomy associated with fundoplication or with the esophago-gastric dissociation recently proposed by Bianchi (19,20). Percutaneous gastro-jejunostomy (PEJ) should also represent an alternative to surgery in these cases, but its efficiency and tolerance during long-term follow-up needs to be evaluated. Experience with PEJ remains limited in children. In a recent study, published in this journal, among 58 patients requiring enteral nutrition, seven presented with obvious aspiration or severe GER. They all successfully received a PEJ with acid suppression and prokinetic drugs, and none of them needed fundoplication (18). Further studies prospectively conducted in large numbers of patients should confirm the place of these new alternatives to antireflux surgery (PEJ and esophago-gastric dissociation) (21). WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE? To properly answer the question of the relationship between PEG and GER, future studies should address the following points, which are still a source of confusion or debate: Can we rely on pH-metry to study GER in such patients, since the use of continuous enteral feeding can lead to the presence of buffered gastric material that makes the diagnosis of acid GER very difficult? Has the location of gastrostomy (antral versus fundus) any effect on the occurrence or worsening of GER? What is the exact influence of the type of enteral nutrition (continuous versus bolus)? Is PEG by itself the main factor influencing the outcome of GER, or do other factors (enteral nutrition modalities or nutritional rehabilitation) also play a role in this relationship?", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00005176-200207000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2332855464", "source": "openalex"}

Furthermore, the recovery of the virus from the gastro-intestinal tract with as great or greater frequency as from the upper respiratory tract, need not, it appears to us, alter our concept of the mode of entrance of the virus into the body, namely, by way of the upper respiratory tract. If the presence of the virus is conceded, then a consideration of the physiologic passage of nasal and oral secretions into the gastro-intestinal tract by reflex swallowing would serve to explain adequately the presence of the virus in those organs. It might even be further predicated that since the gastro-intestinal tract functions as a temporary reservoir for secretions from the upper respiratory tract, the gut should, after a time, contain the virus in higher concentration than any single sample of secretion obtained from the upper respiratory tract by nasal washing. It appears to us that failures to detect the virus in the gastro-intestinal tract are perhaps more indicative of inadequate procedures for its detection than of its absence. The recovery of the virus from the feces 7 and 9 days after the onset of illness takes on added significance. It indicates first, that the virus withstands the gastric acidity which under normal physiological conditions tends to keep gastric contents relatively free of bacteria. It further suggests that improper disposal of feces from patients with poliomyelitis may have serious public health consequences, particularly in smaller communities where inadequate sewage disposal may result in contamination of surrounding beaches or even local water systems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.69.1.49", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150834290", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: During this pilot study 15 patients with H. pylori positive FD received 3 g/d ginger powder as three 1-g tablets for 4-weeks. Dyspepsia symptoms were asked before and after the intervention using a questionnaire based on the Rome III criteria. H. pylori eradication was also assessed by a non-invasive stool antigen (HpSAg) test. Results: Ginger consumption accompanied by significant H. pylori eradication rate of 53.3% (P = 0.019) and the odds ratio (95% CI) was 8 (1.07 to 357.14). Moreover, our results showed significant changes in most of the dyspepsia symptoms after ginger supplementation. Conclusion: According to our findings, Z. officinale can be considered as a useful complementary therapy for FD. However, due to the small number of clinical trials in this area, further welldesigned clinical trials are needed to explicitly talk about its effectiveness especially about the eradication of H. pylori.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15171/apb.2019.038", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2948147678", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, PEDro) and reference lists of articles and narrative reviews were searched. Articles were included when infants and small children underwent oesophageal pH monitoring or pH-multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring while respiratory physiotherapy was administered. Descriptive analysis was performed and two researchers scored the methodological quality of these studies. Results Out of 985 articles, seven (six English, one French) have been included, In total 277 patients were involved, 71 with cystic fibrosis. Depending on the technique used, four studies showed GOR to be aggravated during therapy, three studies reported no effect. Conclusion The evidence is not conclusive on whether respiratory physiotherapy induces or aggravates GOR in infants and small children. Age, disease, and treatment options play an important role. More specific research, also focussing on the influence of respiratory physiotherapy on non-acid reflux and the impact of recently developed airway clearance techniques (ACT's) on GOR is necessary.

Over the last two decades, a number of studies have indicated that urgent colonoscopy may facilitate the identification and treatment of bleeding lesions; however, studies comparing this approach to elective colonoscopy for LGIB are limited.To determine the utility and assess the outcome of urgent colonoscopy as the initial test for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute LGIB.Consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy at our institution for the initial evaluation of acute LGIB between January 2011 and January 2012 were analysed retrospectively. Patients were grouped into urgent vs. elective colonoscopy, depending on the timing of colonoscopy after admission to the ICU. Urgent colonoscopy was defined as being performed within 24 hours of admission and those performed later than 24 hours were considered elective. Outcomes included length of hospital stay, early re-bleeding rates, and the need for additional diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with increased transfusion requirements.Fifty-seven patients underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of suspected LGIB, 24 of which were urgent. There was no significant difference in patient demographics, co-morbidities, or medications between the two groups. Patients who underwent urgent colonoscopy were more likely to present with hemodynamic instability (P = 0.019) and require blood transfusions (P = 0.003). No significant differences in length of hospital stay, re-bleeding rates, or the need for additional diagnostic or therapeutic interventions were found. Patients requiring blood transfusions (n = 27) were more likely to be female (P = 0.016) and diabetics (P = 0.015). Fourteen patients re-bled at a median of 2 days after index colonoscopy. Those with hemodynamic instability were more likely to re-bleed [HR 3.8 (CI 1.06-13.7)], undergo angiography [HR 9.8 (CI 1.8-54.1)], require surgery [HR 13.5 (CI 3.2-56.5)], and had an increased length of hospital stay [HR 1.1 (1.05-1.2)].The use of urgent colonoscopy, as an initial approach to investigate acute LGIB, did not result in significant differences in length of ICU stay, re-bleeding rates, the need for additional diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, or 30-day mortality compared with elective colonoscopy.

The somatostatin infusion increased the concentration of somatostatin in venous plasma within the physiological range from 10 to 76 ng/l, decreased plasma concentrations of prolactin and thyroxine, but had no effect upon plasma concentrations of insulin and glucagon. It had no effect upon digesta-free weight of the rumen and omasum but consistently decreased the weight of all post-ruminal segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The infusion increased the accumulation of digesta in the abomasum and caecum. Total MRT of all three markers in the entire GI tract was unaffected by somatostatin infusion, but the proportion of total MRT spent in the abomasum + small intestine + caecum increased and the proportion spent in the large intestine and rumen decreased. Somatostatin infusion decreased apparent endogenous abomasal secretion, increased water flow from the rumen and into the abomasum and decreased voluntary water consumption. It is proposed that the prime site of somatostatin action was in the abomasal to caecal region, where somatostatin-secreting D cells are found in greatest concentration, that effects observed in the large intestine and rumen may represent secondary compensatory mechanisms and that the effects observed were due to direct action of somatostatin and were not mediated by other GI hormones.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1071/bi9850393", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2414742110", "source": "openalex"}

This research presents a unique method for fabricating gastro-floating tablets (GFT) using SSE. Paste-loaded famotidine with a matrix made of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were prepared. Nine 3D printed tablets were developed with different HPMC concentrations and infill percentages and evaluated to determine their physicochemical properties, content uniformity, dissolution, and floating duration. The crystallinity of the drug remained unchanged throughout the process. Dissolution profiles demonstrated the correlation between the HPMC concentration/infill percentage and drug release behavior over 10 h. All the fabricated GFTs could float for 10 h and the Korsmeyer-Peppas model described the dissolution kinetics as combination of non-Fickian or anomalous transport mechanisms. The results of this study provided insight into the predictability of SSE 3D printability, which uses hydro-alcoholic gel-API blend materials for GFTs by controlling traditional pharmaceutical excipients and infill percentages.

However, recent papers have suggested that it may protect against gastro-oesophageal reflux, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal cancer. Furthermore, the rapid increase in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus in the developed world has been attributed by some to the falling prevalence of H. pylori. These considerations have led to the suggestion that H. pylori infection should not necessarily be treated, especially in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Conversely, data from prospective randomized studies have shown that H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in patients with duodenal ulcer or in the normal population, nor does it worsen the outcome of pre-existing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Therefore, although H. pylori is negatively associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, its eradication does not induce the disease. A hypothesis is presented suggesting that the increased prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a result of rising acid secretion in the general population, which, in turn, is a consequence of the increased linear height (a predictor of acid secretion). The greater acid secretion could also explain the decline in the prevalence of H. pylori and perhaps account for the inverse relationship between H. pylori and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. These considerations are explored in discussing whether H. pylori infection should be treated in infected patients presenting with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.01847.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973358139", "source": "openalex"}

The main components of the defense mechanisms required to avoid infection and inflammation due to pathogenic bacteria penetration are barrier functions in the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune cells. Probiotics can increase the integrity of the epithelial lining and induce tight connections among epithelial cells forming a functional barrier. They can reinforce this barrier through increasing mucins, tight junction protein expression and localization, and increase the goblet and Paneth cells. Also, probiotics increase intestinal epithelial barrier function by producing cytoprotective substances and inhibiting epithelial damage caused by cytokines and oxidants improving cell viability. Some important mechanisms underlying the actions of probiotics include modulating the microbiota of the gut, binding to adhesion sites of epithelial surfaces and competitive exclusion of pathogens, immunomodulation, epithelial obstruction, and regulating intestinal epithelial permeability. The benefits and therapeutic role of probiotics are not equal, and they may vary based on strain-particularity, formulation, dosage, and duration of treatment. The actual beneficial prophylactic and/or biotherapeutic effects of probiotics on digestive tract diseases are revealed from the study of clinical features found in probiotic strains and their action mechanisms. The aim of this chapter is to investigate the functional mechanisms of probiotics, including how they strengthen and boost the intestinal epithelial barrier; how they modify and modulate the intestinal microbiota or maintain the balance; how they produce antimicrobial compounds; how they competitively inhibit the pathogens or suppress the growth of pathogenic microorganisms; how they attach, bind, and interact with the host; how they control and regulate the immune system; and how they regulate signaling pathways.

This results in a mucosa less able to cope with even a reduced acid load. The presence of acid appears to be a conditio sine qua non for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-injury, which is in fact pH-dependent. The acute damage induced by acid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like aspirin, can be markedly reduced or even prevented by raising intragastric pH with antacids or antisecretory compounds. Animal studies have clearly shown that not only the degree, but also the duration, of acid inhibition is an important factor for prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced mucosal damage. As a consequence, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) appear to be more effective that H2-receptor antagonists both in preventing and treating gastro-duodenal lesions. While acid suppression seems to be the only effective mechanism for ulcer healing, prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-injury might also rely on the mucosal protective activity of these compounds. Clinical pharmacological studies, performed in healthy volunteers, have shown that--as in laboratory animals--elevation of intragastric pH by means of antacids or antisecretory compounds protects against acute NSAID-induced damage. Unlike H2-blockers, PPIs protect from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-injury not only the duodenum, but also the stomach, where the majority of mucosal lesions are usually located. Although elevation of intragastric pH affects non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in laboratory animals, a lack of drug-to-drug interaction between PPIs and some of these compounds has been reported in humans. To summarize, clinical and experimental pharmacology support the use of PPIs for the prevention and treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastro-duodenal damage. Acid suppression could, however, represent only one of the many mechanisms by which these compounds protect gastro-duodenal mucosa. Further studies are, therefore, needed to better elucidate the respective role of the various pharmacological actions in their mucosal protective activity as well as to assess the clinical relevance of each of them.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2462784636", "source": "openalex"}

The protein of cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA) is assumed to be a virulence factor of H. pylori. CagA positive strains may induce severe gastroduodenal peptic ulcer disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between H. pylori strains expressing CagA and GORD.Nine hundred and thirty patients were examined by endoscopy. Antral and corpus biopsies for the urease test and serum samples for the detection of IgG antibodies to CagA were taken. Serum samples were assayed by using the western blot technique.The results from 811 patients were analysed statistically. This study population consisted of 264 H. pylori infected patients (264/811, 32%). The H. pylori prevalence was 33% (89/266) in patients with reflux oesophagitis and did not differ from those patients without oesophagitis (175/545, 32%). In contrast, patients with Barrett's oesophagus showed a significantly lower prevalence of H. pylori infection than the other three groups (8/35, 23%). There was no significant influence of CagA, as one of the H. pylori virulence factors, on GORD. Antibodies against CagA were slightly, but insignificantly, more frequent in patients with oesophagitis (55/89, 62%) than in patients without oesophagitis (94/175, 54%).In a large cohort of GORD patients no significant difference in the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with and without GORD was found. In addition, there is no correlation between patients carrying CagA positive strains and development of reflux oesophagitis.

The main alternatives for treatment of severe GORD are continuous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor and surgery with fundoplication; which is the more effective is not clear. The treatment decision largely depends on the recommendations of the clinician. We did a systematic literature search of Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science to identify relevant randomised clinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews, using the search terms gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, proton pump inhibitors, and fundoplication. Although severity of GORD was not always specified, patients eligible for long term proton pump inhibitor or fundoplication typically have severe GORD. From the identified studies, we did backward and forward citation tracking to identify other relevant articles. ### Reflux control A Cochrane systematic review of a large patient sample (n=1232) from four randomised clinical trials comparing proton pump inhibitors and fundoplication found that reflux symptoms were less frequent after fundoplication compared with proton pump inhibitor treatment, but surgical patients more often had dysphagia.2 Two of the trials included in the Cochrane review measured recurrence of GORD, defined as the need for and an inadequate response to increased drug treatment or the need for added proton pump inhibitor after surgical treatment.

Intestinal decompression is a key treatment, but conventional method including a trans‐nasal small intestinal tube is invasive and painful. Therefore, a less invasive and tolerable new decompression method is urgently desired. We conducted a pilot study and assessed the efficacy and safety of percutaneous endoscopic gastro‐jejunostomy ( PEG ‐J) decompression therapy in CIPO patients. Methods Seven definitive CIPO patients (2 males and 5 females) were enrolled. All patients received PEG ‐J decompression therapy. The number of days with any abdominal symptoms in a month ( NODASIM ), body mass index ( BMI ), serum albumin level (Alb), and small intestinal volume before and after PEG ‐J were compared in all patients. Results Percutaneous endoscopic gastro‐jejunostomy was well tolerated and oral intake improved in all patients. NODASIM has significantly decreased (24.3 vs 9.3 days/months) and BMI /Alb have significantly increased (14.9 vs 17.2 kg/m 2 and 2.6 vs 3.8 g/dL, respectively), whereas total volume of the small intestine has not significantly reduced (4.05 vs 2.59 L, P =.18). Reflux esophagitis and chemical dermatitis were observed in one case but was successfully treated conservatively. Conclusions &amp; Inferences Percutaneous endoscopic gastro‐jejunostomy decompression therapy can contribute greatly to improvement of abdominal symptoms and nutritional status in CIPO patients. Although sufficient attention should be paid to acid reflux symptoms, PEG ‐J has the potential to be a non‐invasive novel decompression therapy for CIPO available at home.

It comprised immunoglobulin constituents CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD20, CD23, CD24, CD30, CDw32, CD38, CD39, CDw75, CD76, and vimentin. These antigens yield characteristic immunoprofiles for the following B‐cell compartments of the MALT, per se closely linked to cytologically distinct B‐cell phenotypes: mantle zone (MZ), extrafollicular compartment (EF), follicle center (FC), and plasma‐cell compartment (PC). An unselected series of 31 MALT B lymphomas (13 of low and 18 of high grade malignancy) was classified histologically in routine preparations and subsequently characterized immunohistochemically using fresh frozen tissue, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the antigen panel listed above, and an indirect immunoperoxidase method. The final classification considered both morphology and immunoprofile of tumor cells. Ten tumors were “typical” in both respects: 2 closely corresponded to MZ, 5 to EF, 2 to FC and 1 to PC. The remaining 21 cases were characterized as “atypical” because of anaplastic cytology and/or abnormal co‐expression and/or loss of antigens. A hybrid EF/FC phenotype was most frequently observed together with centrocyte‐like or centrocytic anaplastic cytology of tumor cells. We conclude that MALT B‐cell neoplasia comprises a broad spectrum of histo‐ and immunophenotypes ranging from well differentiated forms closely mimicking normal B‐cell development to highly abnormal tumors which cannot be subclassified.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910470304", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005457618", "source": "openalex"}

Twice-daily dosing of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), the standard therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is an effective therapy for GERD in SSc. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of omeprazole in combination with domperidone vs in combination with algycon in reducing the severity and frequency of reflux symptoms of PPI partial response (PPI-PR) GERD in SSc. Methods. Adult SSc patients having PPI-PR GERD were randomly assigned to receive domperidone plus algycon placebo or algycon plus domperidone placebo in a 1:1 ratio plus omeprazole for 4 weeks. The assessment included severity of symptom grading by visual analogue scale, frequency of symptoms by frequency scale for symptoms of GERD and quality of life (QoL) by EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire scoring. Results. One hundred and forty-eight SSc-GERD patients were enrolled, of whom 88 had PPI-PR. Eighty cases were randomized for either domperidone (n = 38) or algycon (n = 37) therapy. The majority in both groups had the diffuse SSc subset. At the end of the study, no significant difference in symptom grading was found between groups. After treatment and compared with baseline, the severity of symptoms, frequency scale for symptoms of GERD and QoL significantly improved in both groups. Five (13.2%) and 8 (21.6%) respective cases in the domperidone and algycon groups did not respond. Conclusion. The prevalence of PPI-PR GERD is common. Domperidone and algycon are equally effective treatments in combination with omeprazole. However, ∼17% of patients were non-responsive, so the effectiveness of domperidone, algycon and PPI combination therapy should be further investigated.

In this investigation, prevalence of parasites in relation to age, sex and seasonal dynamics was also studied. Significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher prevalence of gastro-intestinal parasites was observed in rainy season followed by summer and winter seasons. Males and females were almost equally (odd ratio 1.08) susceptible to gastro-intestinal parasitic infection.

Disruption of the colonic microbiome and its attendant consequences—the loss of gut barrier integrity and increased generation of uremic toxins—has become well‐recognized. However, less attention has been paid to characterizing the mechanisms behind dysfunction of the upper GI tract, largely owing to the difficulty of studying small bowel function in vivo . This present study was designed to comprehensively describe upper GI function in those with advanced renal impairment. Methods Thirty‐five non‐diabetic subjects (12 CKD stage 4/5 patients, 23 healthy controls) underwent detailed GI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in both fasted and fed states. Upper GI function was assessed by quantification of gastric emptying and intra‐luminal small bowel water. Characterization of hydration and cardiovascular status was performed at baseline. Gut barrier integrity was assessed using serum endotoxin level. Results Chronic kidney disease was associated with dysmotility (gastric half‐emptying time 96 ± 32 vs 74 ± 27 min, P = 0.04) and reduced fasting and post‐prandial small bowel water (36 ± 22 mL vs 78 ± 42 mL, P &lt; 0.001), reflecting abnormal digestive secretion, and absorption. This was related to the degree of endotoxemia ( r = −0.60, P = 0.04) and poorer symptom scores, but not to disease severity, arterial stiffness or hydration status. Conclusion Chronic kidney disease adversely affects digestive function. Abnormalities in digestive secretion and absorption may potentially have a broad impact in the prevention and treatment of both CKD and its complications.

NRP-2 has been detected on the surface of several types of human cancer cells, but its expression and function in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells remains to be determined. We sought to determine the function of NRP-2 in mediating downstream signals regulating the growth and survival of human gastrointestinal cancer cells. In human gastric cancer specimens, NRP-2 expression was detected in tumor tissues but not in adjacent normal mucosa. In CNDT 2.5 cells, shRNA mediated knockdown NRP-2 expression led to decreased migration and invasion in vitro (p<0.01). Focused gene-array analysis demonstrated that loss of NRP-2 reduced the expression of a critical metastasis mediator gene, S100A4. Steady-state levels and function of β-catenin, a known regulator of S100A4, were also decreased in the shNRP-2 clones. Furthermore, knockdown of NRP-2 sensitized CNDT 2.5 cells in vitro to 5FU toxicity. This effect was associated with activation of caspases 3 and 7, cleavage of PARP, and downregulation of Bcl-2. In vivo growth of CNDT 2.5 cells in the livers of nude mice was significantly decreased in the shNRP-2 group (p<0.05).

The longer-term cost-effectiveness is, however, uncertain. This study evaluated the long-term health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication compared with continued medical management in patients with GORD. Methods Individual patient data were used from the 5-year follow-up of the REFLUX trial, a large multicentre, pragmatic, randomized trial in which 357 patients with GORD for at least 12 months at trial entry were allocated randomly to early laparoscopic fundoplication or continued medical management. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A UK National Health Service perspective was used for costs. Results The group randomized to surgery experienced better health outcomes in each year of follow-up, but the difference narrowed over time. At 5 years, the surgery group had experienced 0·216 (95 per cent confidence interval 0·021 to 0·412) more QALYs but also accrued €1832 (1214 to 2448) more costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €8481 per QALY gained. The probability that surgery is the most cost-effective intervention was 0·932 at a threshold of €24 134/QALY (£20 000/QALY). Results were robust to most sensitivity analyses, except where patients with missing data randomized to surgery were assumed to have worse health outcomes. Conclusion Laparoscopic fundoplication is a cost-effective alternative to continued medical management over 5 years. No evidence was found to suggest that the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication diminishes over time.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9190", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1934761576", "source": "openalex"}

The glycoprotein chromogranin family has proved useful in screening for neuroendocrine tumours. In patients with midgut carcinoid tumours, chromogranin A is more sensitive than urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid but by combining these two biochemical markers most GEP tumours can be diagnosed. Chromogranin A is also a prognostic marker for survival in patients with midgut carcinoid tumours. Pancreastatin constitutes a part of the chromogranin A molecule and is a less sensitive general screening marker for neuroendocrine gut and pancreatic tumours, but levels, in combination with chromogranin A, might give some insight into tumour biology. Specific markers such as gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, insulin, neuropeptide K and substance P should be used to further characterise hormone production in neuroendocrine tumours. However, in some patients, confirmation of diagnosis requires provocation tests, such as the secretin or meal provocation tests. Staging information can be obtained by new investigations such as intra-operative or endoscopic ultrasound, octreoscan, and positron emission tomography. We combine the biochemical characterisation of neuroendocrine tumours with studies of growth factors/receptors, adhesion molecules, proliferation markers, somatostatin receptor content, induction of the enzymes p68 kinase and 2'5'-A-synthetase, and apoptosis, to establish a sound rationale for therapeutic decisions, enabling every patient to receive individualised treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000201394", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2022332900", "source": "openalex"}

Traditionally, the PIP is ascribed to transition of the pressure sensor from the abdominal to the thoracic cavity. We used high-resolution manometry to investigate the validity of this concept in six healthy volunteers and six patients with a sliding hiatus hernia. Methods: In the analysis, the position of the PIP was identified. When there was a second, more distal, PIP, its position was also noted. The amplitude of the respiratory-associated pressure variations, defined as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory pressure, was measured. Results: Double PIPs were found both in healthy controls (23 ± 8% of time) and in patients (38 ± 9% of time). Amplitudes of the respiratory-associated pressure variations were significantly higher at the proximal and distal border of the PIP (3.36 ± 0.2 &#114 kPa and 2.29 ± 0.2 &#114 kPa) than in the oesophageal body (0.54 ± 0.03 &#114 kPa, P &#114 < &#114 0.001) and in the stomach (0.54 ± 0.03 &#114 kPa, P &#114 < &#114 0.001). We also observed a relationship between the localization of the highest end-expiratory pressure and the position of the PIP. During TLOSRs respiratory variation amplitudes at the proximal and distal border of the PIP decreased to 0.61 ± 0.02 &#114 kPa and 0.29 ± 0.01 &#114 kPa, approximating respiratory pressure variation in oesophagus and stomach. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the PIP is caused by sliding of the high-pressure zone along pressure sensors rather than by the transition from the thoracic to the abdominal compartment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00365520310003958", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076097061", "source": "openalex"}

Results: The primary presenting symptom was dysphagia, which was self-reported by 41%, 39% and 48% of patients with OAC, GOJAC and OSCC, respectively. Less common symptoms were reflux, chest pain, bleeding and weight loss. All patients underwent endoscopy, most had a staging computed tomography scan (OAC 93%, GOJAC 95% and OSCC 93%), and about half had positron emission tomography scans (OAC 51%, GOJAC 44% and OSCC 42%). Pretreatment tumour stage was reported in 25% of records, and could be derived from results of investigations in a further 23%, but the remaining half lacked sufficient information to ascribe a pretreatment stage.

However, this procedure is not well known and the literature available is still fairly limited. This observational study was conducted to evaluate our experience using this method as an alternative long-term tube feeding procedure when gastrostomy is not suitable. Methods: A total of 15 patients (10 males and 5 females) who underwent PTEG at our institution from 2012 to 2016 were observed and analyzed in this study. Results: The average age was 80.1 (71–93) years. Underlying conditions that required PTEG were previous gastric resection in 11 patients, left diaphragm disorder in 2 patients, interposing transverse colon between the abdominal wall and anterior gastric wall in 1 patient, and severe gastrostomy site leakage in 1 patient. Tube placement was successful in all patients by approaching the left side of the neck, using a 15 Fr size tube. The mean postoperative length of stay was 22 (8–48) days. Postoperative adverse events included accidental tube dislodgement in three patients, tracheoesophageal fistula in one patient, inferior thyroid artery injury in one patient and thyroid gland mispuncture in one patient. There was no procedure-related mortality nor mortality at 30 days. Eight patients were discharged with some oral intake.

In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, recombinant baculovirus-derived GA733-2E antigen was superior to anti-idiotypic antibodies at modulating specific immune responses. Our aim was to evaluate the immunogenicity and potential toxicity of alum-precipitated GA733-2E in a phase I trial in patients with resected CRC or pancreatic cancer. Six patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma and 6 with CRC Dukes' stage A, B or C received between 4 and 7 doses of alum-precipitated GA733-2E at 50, 200 or 800 μg/dose at monthly intervals. Antibody binding to GA733-2E or antigen-positive CRC cells was determined, as were antigen-specific proliferative, cytolytic T-lymphocyte and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4244511973", "title": "Medical versus surgical management for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in adults", "text": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is also known as GORD and the most common symptoms are heartburn, acid regurgitation and difficulty swallowing. Treatments cover a range of options and for most people, who have only mild symptoms, changes to diet or acid suppression tablets will probably be sufficient. These tablets are usually proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, patients with severe symptoms of GORD, where PPIs do not work, require an operation called a fundoplication. This involves wrapping part of the stomach around the lower part of the gullet or oesophagus and, since the 1990s, it has been done by keyhole, or laparoscopic, surgery. However, it's unclear whether surgery or medical treatment is better for patients with persistent GORD, whose symptoms place them in between the mild and severe groups. Therefore, we did our Cochrane review to compare medical versus laparoscopic fundoplication surgery, with a particular focus on the effects on the patient's quality of life (1). We found that fundoplication performed by keyhole surgery was more effective than medical treatment, at least for the first year after treatment. Whilst taking acid suppression tablets is generally assumed to be safe, PPIs can cause short-term symptoms such as headaches, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. More importantly, their long-term use may cause high blood levels of gastrin, known as hypergastrinaemia. Conditions associated with persistent hypergastrinaemia and low stomach acid levels have been linked to a long-term increased risk of gastic cancer. These risks have led to much interest in surgery as an alternative to the long-term use of acid suppression tablets, especially since the introduction of the keyhole operation. Fundoplication is thought to produce relief of GORD symptoms for over 90% of patients, but there are also concerns about its possible risks, as well as the general side effects of surgery. Therefore, choices between surgical and medical treatments need to be informed by evidence on their relative benefits and harms. Although there have been a number of studies comparing medical versus surgical treatment for GORD; only four studies, which involved about 1200 participants, have looked specifically at the keyhole approach to fundoplication. These studies were published between 2005 and 2009 and took place across a number of international centres. Two were performed in multiple centres across the UK, one was conducted in 11 European countries and the final study was done in a single centre in Canada. We were able to draw conclusions about the period up to one year after treatment. Our main finding is that there was significantly more improvement in both health-related and GORD specific quality of life at three months and one year after surgery, compared to medical treatment. All four studies showed that heartburn, reflux and bloating were improved after surgery compared to medical treatment, although a small proportion of participants still had persistent difficulty with swallowing after the operation. The results also showed that complications after surgery were low but not non-existent, and that the cost of surgery over one year is considerably higher than the cost of medical treatment. In summary, fundoplication operations performed by keyhole surgery were more effective at reducing the symptoms of GORD over one year, but little data are currently available to show whether these benefits are sustained over longer periods. We know that at least two of the four studies are following up participants over the longer term, and we hope that the next update of our review will provide a more conclusive answer as to which treatment is the best for controlling persistent symptoms of GORD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-5391.2010.01095.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4244511973", "source": "openalex"}

This is because almost all the drug is converted to metabolites which are readily excreted in urine. The evidence suggests that, at the recommended therapeutic dosages, there is unlikely to be any significant accumulation of fenoprofen or its metabolites with chronic administration. Possible pharmacodynamic interactions between fenoprofen and other drugs, e.g. aspirin and phenobarbital, are discussed, and the evidence is reviewed that at equi-effective doses fenoprofen causes less gastro-intestinal microbleeding than does aspirin.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1185/03007997409115254", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150669720", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to determine GERD symptoms and their underlying pathophysiologic characteristics in T2D patients. Methods This “retro-pro” study compared 65 T2D patients to a control group of 130 age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. GERD was confirmed by gastroscopy, manometry, pH-metry and barium swallow. Results In patients with T2D compared to controls, dysphagia (32.3% vs. 13.1%; p = 0.001) and globus sensation (27.7% vs. 13.8%; p = 0.021) were found more frequently, whereas heartburn (76.9% vs. 88.5%; p = 0.046) and regurgitation (47.7% vs. 72.3%; p = 0.001) were predominant in non-diabetics. Despite higher body mass indices (31.1 ± 5.2 vs. 27.7 ± 3.7 kg/m 2 ; p &lt; 0.001), hiatal hernia was less frequent in T2D patients compared to controls (60.0% vs. 90.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was higher in patients with T2D (median 10.0 vs. 7.2 mmHg, p = 0.016). DeMeester scores did not differ between the groups. Helicobacter pylori infections were more common in T2D patients (26.2% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.001). Barrett metaplasia (21.5% vs. 17.7%), as well as low- (10.8% vs. 3.8%) and high-grade dysplasia (1.5% vs. 0%) were predominant in T2D patients. Conclusions T2D patients exhibit different GERD symptoms, higher LES pressures and a decreased prevalence of hiatal hernia than non-diabetics, which may be related to worse oesophageal motility and, thus, a more functional rather than anatomical cause of GERD.

Dysphagia develops in about 50% of patients and may be a reflection of both central nervous system and enteric nervous system disorder. Gastroparesis can cause a variety of symptoms, including nausea, and also may be responsible for some of the motor fluctuations observed with levodopa therapy.

We performed an analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of RAM from a Chinese perspective and recognized the range of drug costs. Methods By building a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs) and lifetime costs. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were estimated for the published literature, Chinese health care system and local price setting. We performed threshold analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the uncertainty of the model. Results Compared with PLA strategy, RAM strategy provided an incremental survival benefit of 1.22 LYs and 0.64 QALYs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that when RAM costs less than $151 or $753 per 4 weeks, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) approximated the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP), suggesting that there was 50% likelihood that the ICER for RAM + PAC would be less than $44528.4 per QALY or $48121 per QALY, respectively.

Methods: 20 GERD patients received two 7‐day treatments of RB in the morning (a.m.) or in the evening (p.m.) hours. The regimens were randomized in a double‐blind fashion and separated by a 7‐day washout period. The tablets were taken 30 min before standardized meals. A combined (oesophageal &amp; gastric) 24‐hour pH monitoring was performed before and on day 7 of each treatment. Results: Total oesophageal acid exposure was normalized in 10/14 (71.4%) patients with RB p.m. and in 6/15 (42.8%) with RB a.m. RB p.m. significantly decreased the nocturnal supine oesophageal acid exposure vs. RB a.m., 0.2% vs. 3.4%. The mean NGAB duration was significantly shortened with RB a.m. and p.m. vs. the baseline recording, 4.1±1.8 and 3.4±1.5 hours vs. 7.8±1.7 hours. Conclusions: Rabeprazole significantly reduced the NGAB duration and significantly increased the mean nocturnal gastric pH; RB p.m. normalized more effectively the total oesophageal exposure than RB‐a.m.; RB p.m. provided significantly better control of nocturnal supine gastro‐oesophageal reflux than a.m. dosing.

Pulsion, or false, diverticula are the most commonly encountered type of esophageal diverticula noticed at the level of cricopharyngeus muscle, occur as a localized outpouchings that lacks a muscular coat, and as such their wall is formed entirely by mucosa and submucosa. True, or traction, esophageal diverticulum (TED) is seen in the middle one third of the thoracic esophagus in a peribronchial location, occurs secondary to mediastinal inflammatory lesions such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. The resultant desmoplastic reaction in the paraesophageal tissue causes full thickness pinching on the esophageal wall, producing a conical, broad-mouthed true diverticulum. They often project to the right side because subcarinal lymph nodes in this area are closely associated with the right anterior wall of the esophagus. TED usually presents with symptoms such as dysphagia, postural regurgitation, belching, retrosternal pain, heartburn, and epigastric pain. As in patients with pharyngoesophageal (Zenker's) diverticula, pulmonary symptoms are often present but underestimated in TED patients. These symptoms range from mild nocturnal cough to life-threatening massive aspiration. In this particular report we describe a rare case of TED presenting as a symptomatic upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnostic evaluation of TED includes chest X-ray, barium esophagogram and manometry. A significant proportion of lower esophageal diverticula are associated with motility disorders.

Given the similarities between laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery it is unlikely that randomized controlled trials would be conducted to disclose any differences between these two technical instruments. Thus, skepticism remains due to lack of any definitive conclusions in the literature. Aims The aim of the study was to disclose any difference in outcome after robot-assisted (RNF) versus conventional laparoscopic (LNF) Nissen fundoplication for gastro-esophageal reflux disease in children. Materials and Methods A literature review was carried out. Only studies comparing the two modalities were included. Operative time, duration of hospital stay, 30 days morbidity, mortality, conversion, recurrence and complication rates were analyzed. Review Manager 5.1.6 software, from the Cochrane library, was used for statistical analysis. Results Three case series fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review. Data on 174 children were identified; 89 were operated on using the computer-assisted technology and 85 controls were operated on using the conventional laparoscopic technique. Data showed no significant difference between these two modalities. Discussion This literature review demonstrates no significant difference between patients operated on with robot-assisted surgery and those undergoing conventional laparoscopic surgery regarding the parameters studied. Conclusion The robot-assisted Nissen fundoplication in children is a safe alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. No data support the need for case selection to one of these two minimally invasive procedures.

The mechanisms that underlie the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) must explain its two unique features; age at death and death during apparent sleep. 2. The occurrence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) during active sleep in infants presenting with apparent life threatening episodes (ALTE) and their similar age distribution to SIDS infants, suggested that reflux could be a cause of asphyxia. 3. Sleep related GOR was found to be a physiological and not a pathological event in normal, healthy term infants. 4. In healthy term infants, those infants that were formula‐fed (who have a higher incidence of SIDS) had significantly longer oesophageal clearance times for acid reflux and significantly more active sleep compared with breast fed infants. 5. In very preterm infants (who are at increased risk for SIDS), both the frequency and duration of reflux during active sleep was significantly less at term equivalent age compared with healthy term infants, suggesting additional factors must operate to promote an ALTE. 6. One mechanism which may explain the pathogenesis of GOR could be that the reflux reaches the level of the pharynx and this, in turn, stimulates laryngeal receptors to produce apnoea. 7. Simulated reflux to the level of the pharynx in the sleeping piglet evoked airway protective responses, namely swallow, arousal and occasionally expectoration, but neither apnoea nor oxygen desaturation. 8. In the same piglets treated with pentobarbitone sodium, swallowing was impaired and arousal depressed. Simulated reflux to the pharynx produced significant apnoea and oxygen desaturation and death in two of five piglets. 9. In the infant, the co‐existence of reflux to the level of the pharynx during sleep, together with impaired swallowing, depressed arousal or both, is one mechanism that may lead to an age‐limited, sudden and fatal apnoea.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb02064.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010821333", "source": "openalex"}

Tumours around the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) pose several specific challenges. Numerous difficulties arise when the existing TNM staging systems for gastric and oesophageal cancers are applied to GOJ tumours. The issues facing the current TNM staging and GOJ tumour classification systems are reviewed in this article. Recent evidence regarding the importance of several histopathologically derived prognostic factors, such as circumferential resection margin status and lymph node metastases, have implications for specimen reporting. With the rising use of multimodal treatments for oesophageal cancer it is important that the response of the tumour to this therapy is carefully documented pathologically. In addition, several controversial and novel areas such as endoscopic mucosal resection, lymph node micrometastases and the sentinel node concept are being studied. We aim to review these aspects, with special relevance to oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal cancer specimen reporting, to update the surgical oncologist with an interest in upper gastrointestinal cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7819-4-82", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151133845", "source": "openalex"}

We have performed a proof-of principle study to test the applicability in the clinical setting, analysing copy number alterations (CNAs) in plasma and tumour tissue from 44 patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer. Methods DNA was isolated from blood plasma and a tissue sample from each patient. Array-CGH was applied to the tissue DNA. The cell-free plasma DNA was sequenced by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing using a clinical pipeline for non-invasive prenatal testing. WISECONDOR and ichorCNA, two bioinformatic tools, were used to process the output data and were compared to each other. Results Cancer-associated CNAs could be seen in 59% (26/44) of the tissue biopsies. In the plasma samples, a targeted approach analysing 61 regions of special interest in gastro-oesophageal cancer detected cancer-associated CNAs with a z-score &gt;5 in 11 patients. Broadening the analysis to a whole-genome view, 17/44 patients (39%) had cancer-associated CNAs using WISECONDOR and 13 (30%) using ichorCNA. Of the 26 patients with tissue-verified cancer-associated CNAs, 14 (54%) had corresponding CNAs in plasma. Potentially clinically actionable amplifications overlapping the genes VEGFA , EGFR and FGFR2 were detected in the plasma from three patients. Conclusions We conclude that low-coverage whole-genome sequencing without prior knowledge of the tumour alterations could become a useful tool for cell-free tumour DNA analysis of total CNAs in plasma from patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245488", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127084636", "source": "openalex"}

However, some of these differences may be the result of chronic GERD rather than being an underlying contributory factor. Methods Twins discordant for GERD symptoms, i.e., only one twin had GERD symptoms, underwent standard LES and esophageal body manometry, and then using a sleeve sensor prolonged LES and pH monitoring, 30 min before and 60 min after a 250 mL 1200 kcal lipid meal.

Endoscopy and 24-hour pH monitoring studies, though of great value, have significant limitations for assessment of reflux disease. Only about one third of reflux disease patients have oesophageal mucosal erosion or ulceration. Analysis of symptoms is probably the most useful method for diagnosis. Further research is needed into the best strategies for maximising the potential of symptom analysis. In the pathogenesis of reflux disease, &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection is not a major factor but the interaction of &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; gastritis and eradication therapy are important areas of great current interest. Troublesome reflux disease arises primarily from abnormally frequent gastro-oesophageal reflux, though heightened oesophageal mucosal sensitivity and defective oesophageal clearance play a role in some patients. Transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation appears to be the most important mechanism of reflux. This distinctive, swallow-independent type of lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation has a complex triggering system, apparently located in the brain stem. Medical and surgical treatments of reflux disease are now well characterised and have improved very substantially over recent years.

After a survey of earlier literature on the passage of ethyl alcohol from the gastro‐intestinal tract to the blood, the factors are discussed that may possibly have to bear on this passage, the basis of the discussion being the laws of diffusion. From these laws formulae have been deduced, in which the percentage of the blood alcohol, the blood flow through the mucous membrane of the stomach and the concentration and the volume of the alcoholic solution ingested have been taken into consideration. The validity of these formulae is not only confined to the diffusion of alcohol but also applies to all the cases in which a pure process of diffusion is concerned. By means of a series of determinations of the alcohol percentage in the contents of the stomach of cat with intact and ligated pylori as well as on human subjects—both normal individuals and patients—by means of fractional withdrawal of ingested alcohol, an attempt has been made to show that the passage of alcohol through the mucous membrane of the stomach is to be regarded as a pure process of diffusion. The results of the experiments are: The absorption of ethyl alcohol from the stomach follows the laws of diffusion. This means that the greater the concentration of the alcohol ingested, the more rapidly will absorption take place with a higher and earlier blood alcohol maximum (cp fig. 1). The so‐called diffusion factor is constant in the case of constant blood flow and constant volume. A cat with ligated pylorus absorbs in 30 min about 38% of the alcohol ingested, when given in a solution of 5 per cent by volume, about 62% after 60 min and 76% after 120 min; of a solution of 17 per cent proportionally more is absorbed. On human subjects with closed pylori the corresponding figures for a solution of 5 per cent by volume are 40% after 30 min, 70% after 60 min and about 100% after 120 min. If the stomach is emptied, on the other hand, the whole quantity of alcohol ingested can disappear in less than 30 min.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.1940.tb00272.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016356121", "source": "openalex"}

The ethanol-induced inflammation and apoptosis were also significantly decreased by reducing the increased gastric myeloperoxidase activity and the expression of NF-kB and p53. TPM pretreatment also reduced the ethanol-induced damage to the gastric histology in rats. TPM exerted a gastro-protective effect against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers mediated by reducing the gastric ulcer index, preventing a decrease of the mucus levels, reduction in inflammation, damage to gastric histology, and a decrease in the enhanced expression of NF-kB and TPM.

However, with regard to symptom severity, patients without macroscopic mucosal lesions have been shown not to differ from those with more severe oesophagitis. A number of controlled trials on the efficacy of omeprazole in GORD have included patients with lower grades of the disease. The results show that the differences in efficacy between omeprazole and H2-receptor antagonists, which have been established for the treatment of erosive and ulcerative oesophagitis, also extend to patients with grade I oesophagitis (erythema and friability). In these studies, omeprazole provided more rapid symptom resolution and histological improvement than ranitidine. In one double-blind comparative trial, complete endoscopic normalization of the oesophageal mucosa was observed in 90% of patients with grade I oesophagitis within 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole, 40 mg once daily, compared with 55% of those treated with ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily; at 8 weeks the mucosa in all patients in the omeprazole group had completely healed at endoscopy, while oesophagitis was still present in 21% of the patients receiving ranitidine. A separate 6-month, placebo-controlled maintenance study was performed in patients who had completed a short-term study and who had total relief from the major symptoms of GORD and complete healing of endoscopic oesophagitis. All patients given placebo had an endoscopic recurrence (i.e. endoscopic grade I or more) and this was associated with the return of symptoms in 75% of cases. In patients treated long term with omeprazole, 10 mg daily, 45% remained in endoscopic remission at 6 months, and the corresponding figure for omeprazole, 20 mg daily, was 65%. Amongst those patients treated with omeprazole, 10 mg daily, who were not in endoscopic remission at 6 months, about 50% were nevertheless still asymptomatic, which indicates that omeprazole, 10 mg daily, is sufficient for the control of symptoms in most patients presenting with mild forms of disease. Further studies are required to define the role of omeprazole in the management of patients with symptomatic GORD without oesophagitis.Key Words: Cimetidinegastro-oesophageal refluxheartburnhistamineomeprazoleranitidinereflux oesophagitis", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/00365529409105367", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1967672362", "source": "openalex"}

Mild heat exposure reduced the digesta-free tissue weight of all GI tract segments distal to the omasum. Increases in the amounts of digesta in the stomach compartments were largely due to increases in water content, although the solids content of the abomasum (P less than 0.10) and omasum also increased. The treatment caused an increase in water intake (P less than 0.10), increased the MRT of 51Cr-EDTA in the reticulo-rumen (P less than 0.05), and tended to increase the MRT of all three markers in the omasum and abomasum. However, MRT in the whole GI tract was unaffected because of a compensating decrease (P less than 0.01) in digesta MRT in the distal large intestine. Suppression of prolactin secretion with 2-bromo-alpha-ergocryptine impaired the ewes' ability to maintain their body temperature under the warm conditions imposed. This was associated with a consistent reduction in the degree to which water intake and its transactions in the GI tract changed in response to mild heat exposure. The treatment also caused decreases in omasal MRT and increases in abomasal MRT. Increased plasma concentrations of somatostatin and gastrin were associated with reduced plasma concentrations of prolactin, and it was postulated that some of the effects of prolactin on the GI tract may be mediated via somatostatin.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1071/bi9860085", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2417742410", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to determine if number of reflux episodes associates with therapeutic outcome in regurgitation predominant gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Design We performed post hoc analysis of postintervention pH-impedance data from adult patients with moderate/severe regurgitation despite QD proton pump inhibitor (PPI), randomised to either two times a day PPI or magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) in 2:1 allocation. After 6 and 12 months, symptom response was defined by improvement in Foregut Symptom Questionnaire (FSQ) regurgitation score to none or minimal, ≥50% reduction in GERD health-related quality of life (HRQL) score and satisfaction with therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of symptom improvement. Results Of 152 randomised patients, 123 (age 46.9±1.2 year, 43% female) had complete data. Symptom and satisfaction scores significantly improved after MSA compared with two times a day PPI. Both acid exposure time (13.4%±0.7% to 1.3±0.2%, p&lt;0.001) and reflux episodes (86±4 to 48±4, p&lt;0.001) declined with therapy. Reduction to &lt;40 reflux episodes was significantly more frequent in those with symptom response by FSQ regurgitation score, GERD HRQL score and satisfaction with therapy (p≤0.03 for each); &lt;35 episodes performed better on receiver operating characteristic analysis.

However, once gastric contents leave the stomach and enter the oesopha- gus and the upper airways the protective mechanisms are much reduced. The major aggressors in gastric refluxate are acid, pepsin and bacteria. In addition, gastric refluxate will contain, but not always, duodenal factors such as bile acids and pancreatic enzymes. Acid in the majority of reflux events will remain at a damaging level, i.e. below pH 4.0 for a significant amount of time in the oesoph- agus. Bile acids have been demonstrated to be damaging in many experimental models; however, great care needs to be taken when interpreting these results because the concentrations and the form of the bile acids used do not always reflect the in vivo situation. Pepsin is an acidic protease but has the potential to damage extra-gastric tissues at pHs up to 6.0 and will not be irreversibly inhib- ited until pH 7.5 or above. Trypsin, if it passes through the stomach at pH 4.0 or above or rapidly though low pH of 2 or less, will retain activity and can go on to cause damage. With the increase in the use of proton pump inhibitors to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux the elevation of gastric pH has allowed bacterial over- growth of the stomach. Consequently, a reflux event can lead to the establishing of bacterial colonies outside of the stomach, notably into the airways and lungs.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2184204592", "source": "openalex"}

For a given amplitude ratio, the theoretical pressure rise per wavelength decreases linearly with increasing time-mean flow. An experiment with a quasi-two-dimensional apparatus confirmed the theoretical values. Calculations of the detailed fluid motions reveal that under many conditions of operation the net time-mean flow is the algebraic difference between a forward time-mean flow in the core of the tube and a backward (‘reflux’) time-mean flow near the periphery. The percentage of reflux flow can be very high. This reflux phenomenon is probably of physiologic significance in the functioning of the ureter and the gastro-intestinal system.

Although used in practice, little is known about how it has been evaluated. This study aimed to systematically summarize and appraise the reporting of MSA and its introduction into clinical practice, in the context of guidelines (such as IDEAL) for evaluating innovative surgical devices. Methods Systematic searches were used to identify all published studies reporting MSA insertion. Data collected included patient selection, governance arrangements, surgeon expertise, technique description and outcome reporting. Results Searches identified 587 abstracts; 39 full-text papers were included (1 RCT 5 cohort, 3 case–control, 25 case series, 5 case reports). Twenty-one followed US Food and Drug Administration eligibility criteria for MSA insertion. Twenty-six documented that ethical approval was obtained. Two reported that participating surgeons received training in MSA; 18 provided information about how MSA insertion was performed, although techniques varied between studies. Follow-up ranged from 4 weeks to 5 years; in 14 studies, it was less than 1 year. Conclusion Most studies on MSA lacked information about patient selection, governance, expertise, techniques and outcomes, or varied between studies.

There is a dose-dependent association between increasing body mass index and GORD An association between overweight and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) has long been suspected and observed in case series. Recently, this association has become established in large-scale analytical epidemiological research.1,2 In a recent meta-analysis based on the available literature, it was concluded that there is a dose-dependent association between increasing body mass index (BMI) and GORD, usually assessed as typical reflux symptoms—that is, heartburn or regurgitation.3 The precise strength of this association is difficult to assess, but it seems that persons with a BMI >30 kg/m2 are at an about twofold increased risk of GORD than persons of normal weight. Interestingly, it seems that any increase in BMI, even within the range of what is considered normal BMI, is associated with a gradually increased risk of reflux symptoms.2 A similar finding has been observed with regard to the relation between increased BMI and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus,4 a cancer closely linked with GORD.5 In the present issue of Gut , Corley et al 6 ( see page 756 ) present a large cohort study that not only evaluates BMI in relation to GORD, but also evaluates the role of objectively measured …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2006.112243", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2137253392", "source": "openalex"}

The balance between negligence and overconcern is therefore very difficult to make, and requires experienced physicians. The approach in infants with uncomplicated reflux consists of non-drug treatment and reassurance of the parents about the almost physiological nature of the regurgitations of the baby. If the parents persist in their complaints, the administration of prokinetics such as cisapride can be considered before performing investigations (oesophagel pH monitoring). The efficacy and the lack of side-effects of cisapride makes this the drug of choice. The frequency of side-effects of other drugs necessitates the diagnosis of reflux disease before their administration.Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy is the investigation of choice in children suspected of reflux oesophagitis. In the majority of cases, the efficacy of cisapride, H2-blockers and Na-K-ATP-ase-blockers should be given a chance. Unusual presentations, such as chronic respiratory disease, as a manifestation of reflux disease should be confirmed with oesophageal pH monitoring.Key Words: gastro-oesophageal refluxdiagnosistreatmentinfantschildrenregurgitationoesophagitisgastroscopy", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/07853899309147292", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132198524", "source": "openalex"}

Although the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Asia is substantially lower, the incidence may be increasing. How much of this increase is explained by the increasing recognition of heartburn in clinical practice, dietary changes and increasing obesity, or the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, remains unclear. There has been speculation that endoscopy-negative reflux disease represents a separate entity from reflux oesophagitis (as defined by the Los Angeles classification), but the evidence that might support this proposal is unconvincing. Patients with chronic reflux symptoms have a higher risk of Barrett's oesophagus, and the increased risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma in individuals with a long history of heartburn is also well documented, but whether this always occurs via Barrett's oesophagus is debatable. Moreover, treatment with standard-dose antisecretory therapies and anti-reflux surgery seems unlikely, based on current evidence, to reduce the cancer risk in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2048599708", "title": "Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and ulcer disease", "text": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was recognized as a clinical entity in the mid-1930s. It is the commonest disorder of the gastro-intestinal tract, resulting from failure of the gastro-oesophageal sphincter. It is a chronic condition and often requires life-long treatment with proton pump inhibitors in up to 25–50% of patients. The most common reported symptoms are heartburn and acid regurgitation, often exacerbated by eating. Heartburn alone occurs in 20–40% of the adult population in European countries. This disorder is associated with considerable long-term morbidity and mortality. Symptoms of GERD can have a major effect on a patient's lifestyle. In one survey conducted in the USA, 46% of patients were found to have moderate to extreme difficulty in eating certain foods that they wanted to include in their diet, and 30% also had difficulty eating the quantity of food they wanted. Half of respondents claimed that they did not have enough energy for activities they wanted to do, and 21–25% said that they felt tired or worn out almost all of the time. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of people suffering from GERD and fortunately, effective but costly medications are now available. These factors in combination have exponentially increased the cost of reflux management to health services. The estimation of the prevalence of GERD is difficult because of the lack of an accepted definition and of gold standard diagnostic criteria. European epidemiological data is lacking, however according to the available European data, the prevalence of GERD symptoms, mainly heartburn, has been reported to range from 10 to 40%. Hiatus hernia, which occurs when the upper part of the stomach moves up into the chest through a small opening in the diaphragm, resulting in retention of acid as well as other contents that reflux easily into the oesophagus, may cause some people to suffer from GERD. Certain foods, smoking and pregnancy may all trigger GERD. It is believed that genetics play a role. A recent study indicated that a family member of someone with GERD is four times more likely to experience the disorder. Obesity is an independent risk factor for GERD and may explain the recent increasing incidence. The concomitant use of drugs for treating blood pressure, angina and arthritis, together with stress, has also been found to be associated with GERD. In a recent Belgian study, 28.4% of participants experienced heartburn during the previous 12 months. This symptom was present at least once a week in 42% of sufferers. Heartburn was more frequent in women (31%) than men (25%), which is in accordance with a published French epidemiological study. In Finland, 9% had experienced heartburn on the day of response and 15%, 21% and 27% during the preceding week, month and year, respectively. The corresponding figures for regurgitation were 5, 15, 29 and 45%. Medication, most commonly antacids, was used by only 16% of symptomatic people, and only 5.5% had sought medical advice for symptoms during the past year. Thus, despite regular symptoms suggestive of GERD, only a minority of individuals use medication or seek medical consultation. In France, the annual incidence of epigastric pain and/or regurgitation was 35.2%. In Sweden, symptoms suggestive of GERD were found among 25% of the population, which may or may not include other dyspeptic symptoms. In the UK, GERD symptoms occurred in 28.7% of one large sample population. Fewer than 25% of reflux patients consulted a practitioner during the previous year. In Denmark, one study reported results of a 5-year follow-up of reflux and abdominal symptoms in an age- and sex-stratified random sample of 4581 Danes. Prevalence of both heartburn and acid regurgitation were significantly higher among men (38%) than women (30%). Approximately 20% of adults in the USA experience GERD symptoms such as heartburn, acid regurgitation and subxiphoid pain at least once a week. In populations undergoing gastroscopy for investigation of symptoms, oesophagitis (mucosal damage seen in patients who have acid regurgitation) may occur in 5–10% of people (Figure 1). Prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms in adult Europeans. Subjects with chronic GERD are at risk of developing Barrett's oesophagus, a condition manifested by a change in the lining of the oesophagus. The normal squamous lining of the oesophagus becomes replaced with columnar epithelium. The presence of specialized intestinal metaplasia is characteristic of Barrett's oesophagus. Approximately 12% of subjects who undergo endoscopy for GERD evaluation are found to have Barrett's oesophagus. Current research suggests patients with Barrett's oesophagus are at greater risk of developing oesophageal cancer. Some studies have revealed that Barrett's oesophagus predisposes to the development of adenocarcinoma in up to 40%. However, the degree of risk is not clearly defined, as many individuals with Barrett's oesophagus remain undiagnosed. Lifestyle modifications associated with symptom relief include the following: nocturnal elevation of the head of the bed by 4–6 inches, cessation of smoking, frequent small and low-fat meals, avoiding a recumbent position for 3 h after eating, and avoidance of foods that tend to aggravate symptoms. Patients should also be advised to reduce their alcohol and caffeine consumption, as both agents are associated with an increased number of reflux episodes. The mainstay of medical treatment is to reduce the amount of acid refluxing into the oesophagus. Several different medications are available, which achieve varying degrees of acid control. H2-receptor antagonists: H2-receptor antagonists block histamine receptors and so reduce acid secretion into the stomach. These drugs can decrease acid secretions by 50–70% in any 24-h period, but are unable to effectively suppress meal-stimulated acid secretion. This is now available to patients directly from pharmacists. The cost of over-the-counter medications for GERD is over €5 million in Ireland alone. Proton pump inhibitors: Proton pump inhibitors are the drugs of choice in achieving and sustaining a neutral gastric pH. They block the final pathway for acid production and so are often considered more effective than H2-receptor antagonists. These drugs have revolutionized the medical approach to GERD management. If the patient stops using proton pump inhibitor therapy, reflux symptoms reoccur rapidly and often with greater severity than before. The cost of proton pump inhibitors in Ireland has increased from €3.24 million in 1993 to €28 million in 2001. The cost of medical management of GERD in the USA is approximately $10 billion/annum. The most common anti-reflux procedure is a Nissen fundoplication, which provides relief of reflux symptoms in 90% of patients. In this procedure, the upper portion of the stomach is wrapped around the oesophagus. The operation, however, is not without risk and is associated with significant post-operative morbidity. These complications may also contribute to additional healthcare costs. Presently, a number of endoscopic anti-reflux techniques, including Endocinch, Radiofrequency Stretta and Enteryx, and expandable prostheses such as the Gatekeeper and NDO endoscopic full-thickness plicator, are being evaluated and may represent a significant advancement in the future treatment of GERD. Peptic ulcer disease is a common clinical problem. Today the lifetime risk of peptic ulcer disease in industrialized countries is 5–10%. The factors influencing this trend, such as increasing age, changes in smoking prevalence and the increasing use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), have all impacted on the changing epidemiology of peptic ulcer disease. The two principal, independent risk factors of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer disease are pre-existing Helicobacter pylori infection and the regular intake of NSAIDs. H. pylori infection and related digestive diseases will be discussed in a separate paper in this supplement. NSAID-induced adverse events are among the most frequently reported world-wide. Gastrointestinal pathology associated with the use of NSAIDs is common and may be considered a public health issue. NSAID-related conditions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that over 30 million individuals regularly consume NSAIDs and that this figure is rapidly increasing. NSAIDs remain the mainstay of treatment for myriad inflammatory conditions, and are frequently employed as analgesics. In particular the use of aspirin has risen dramatically since its efficacy in preventing both coronary artery and cerebral vascular disease has been proven. The decreasing prevalence of H. pylori infection in the developed world coupled with the increased consumption of NSAIDs has meant that these drugs are now the most important cause of gastroduodenal ulceration in many countries. Our understanding of the mechanisms involved in NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage has expanded over recent times and led to the development of preventative strategies and novel therapeutic agents. The relative contributions of different pathophysiological processes described to date in the development of mucosal damage as a result of any particular NSAID is still a matter for discussion (Table 1). Similarly, there is disagreement on whether data from endoscopic studies can be extrapolated to wider populations. Although there is significant consensus in the literature regarding these issues, the presence of conflicting laboratory and clinical data has naturally resulted in some debate among the diverse groups of individuals who prescribe and manage complications of NSAIDs. The consumption of NSAIDs induces acute gastric mucosal injury hours after ingestion, which is characterized by the presence of submucosal haemorrhage and the production of superficial mucosal erosions. Further ingestion may result in abrogation of these acute injuries via adaptation. Long-term consumption is associated classically with Type C gastritis, and a paucity of inflammatory response. The characteristic findings are epithelial, endothelial and muscular hyperplasia. Whether NSAID-induced gastritis is associated with symptoms such as dyspepsia is unclear. An observational study performed in England reported no increased prevalence of dyspepsia among NSAID users compared with controls over a 1-year follow-up. Conversely, a population-based study from the USA estimated that NSAID use was associated with a two-fold increased risk of gastrointestinal symptoms. Differences in the definition of dyspepsia and both the formulation and doses of NSAIDs employed may account for these disparate results. A recent meta-analysis of 92 studies reporting gastrointestinal complications of NSAIDs attempted to address this issue. Their analysis showed that epigastric pain-related symptoms are increased in NSAID users by 36% compared with controls.1 In many users, ongoing tissue damage results in the development of deep excavated gastric or duodenal ulcers, partly as a direct tesult of mucosal injury but also due to impairment of mucosal healing mechanisms. The effects of NSAIDs are not confined to the gastric or duodenal mucosa. Consumption has been implicated in the development of oesophagitis, oesophageal strictures, acute intestinal ulceration, perforation, and rarely, colonic ulceration. Frequently, NSAID-related ulcers are large, more commonly found in the stomach than in the duodenum and paradoxically less painful than other peptic ulcers. It has been suggested that NSAID-associated peptic ulcers cause less pain because of their effect on the production of prostaglandins, which are known to contribute to the sensation of somatic and possibly visceral pain. It has been demonstrated that patiets using NSAIDs are at an increased risk of development of both ulcers and associated complications (haemorrhage or perforation). It has been established that the consumption of NSAIDs is associated with a 3–4-fold increased risk of peptic ulcer development. The attributable risk of ulcer complications among NSAID users is 25–35%. Pooled data from several case control studies have reported that NSAID consumption is associated with relative risks of 3, 6 and 7.6 for gastrointestinal haemorrhage, perforation and mortality, respectively.2 Large-scale cohort studies have confirmed these findings.3-5 In addition, there are now more data available on the gastrointestinal effects of prophylactic low-dose aspirin. Case–control studies performed in the UK have shown that the use of low-dose aspirin confers an increased relative risk of bleeding compared with other patients and the community of between 2 and 6, depending on the dose employed (75–1200 mg per day).6 Further evidence from the UK Transient Ischaemic Attack Trial confirms previous data that showed the risk of bleeding to be greater for duodenal rather that gastric ulcers and that bleeding may occur from other sites of the gastrointestinal tract.7 Moreover, the risk of duodenal perforation is also increased and has been reported to be six times that of nonusers but less than that of other NSAIDs.8 It is worth noting that the concomitant use of low-dose aspirin and other NSAIDs has an additive effect, and has been reported to be associated with twice the risk of perforation and bleeding. There are a number of possible risk modifiers that may affect the rates of peptic ulceration and their complications regionally. The strength of available evidence for different risk modifiers varies. It has, however, been clearly established that age, past history of peptic ulceration, high doses, and concomitant use of anticoagulants or corticosteroids magnifies the risk of bleeding peptic ulceration (Table 2). Dosage and type of NSAID: It has been shown that patients with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to develop complications of NSAIDs than individuals with osteoarthritis. Although some reports do suggest that disease entities confer differing risks, it is more likely that the variation in risk reflects both the dosages and formulations regularly employed in different conditions. There are many reports available in the literature that demonstrate a linear association between the dose of NSAIDs employed and the development of ulcer complications.5, 9, 10 Likewise, a meta-analysis of 12 studies that investigated the effect of different NSAIDs on rates of ulcer complications demonstrated that different formulations did confer different tisks. However, despite there being a safety advantage for some formulations such as ibuprofen compared with piroxicam or azapropazone, this was not consistent at higher doses.11 Other pharmacokinetic properties are also likely to alter the relative risk of varying formulations. Age, peptic ulcer disease, anti-coagulants and corticosteroids: It has been clearly established that older age predisposes to peptic ulcer development. Studies have estimated the relative risk in subjects over 60 years compared with controls to be in the order of 3.5. The effect of NSAIDs on this risk appears to be additive rather than synergistic, that is, both are associated with inherent risks but there does not appear to be any specific mechanism whereby the effect of one enhances the deleterious effect of the other. The combined risk of ulcer disease in elderly individuals prescribed NSAIDs is approximately 13.12 Furthermore, a previous history of peptic ulcer is a risk factor for subsequent ulcer development, and again the addition of NSAIDs appears to add to this risk, with estimates of a combined relative risk of 17. This effect is independent of H. pylori status, and tends to be site-specific. It is therefore plausible that abnormal healing as a result of disordered repair mechanisms may play a role in the interaction of these two risk factors. As with the aforementioned risk modifiers, the effect of combined usage of NSAIDs and anticoagulants reflects the additive risks inherent to both agents,13 although it is possible that different NSAIDs will interact to greater or lesser degrees. It would be logical to presume that aspirin would further enhance the effect because of its ability to interfere with platelet aggregation. The role of corticosteroids is not quite as clear-cut. Whether these agents are themselves ulcerogenic or merely enhance the effects of other noxious stimuli continues to be debated. There is evidence to show that regular usage of at least 10 mg per day is associated, in combination with NSAIDs, with a three-fold increased risk of ulcer bleeding compared with subjects taking NSAIDs alone.14 The effect of concomitant H. pylori infection on the risk of developing NSAID-related conditions is complex, with evidence both for an additive effect and for an apparently contradictory protective role. It is likely that bacterial and host differences account for this disparity. Management of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity: Awareness of the possible risks inherent in the use of NSAIDs enables prescribing physicians to rationalize treatment according to simple basic principles. In particular, the dose and type of NSAID employed should be considered carefully before initiating therapy. Increased doses are associated with an increased risk of complications without necessarily improving their clinical efficacy. Patient characteristics, such as past history of peptic ulcer disease either related to NSAIDs or not, comorbidity including maintenance therapies, age and H. pylori status if indicated, should also be taken into consideration. In patients at an increased risk it is reasonable to try alternative treatments such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors or if necessary to use NSAIDs with primary prophylaxis against complications. Similarly, patients who have previously developed NSAID-related gastroduodenal complications should receive secondary prophylaxis while continuing to use these agents even after successful eradication of H. pylori infection. Profound acid suppression remains the mainstay of treatment for active NSAID-related peptic ulcers (Table 3). The substantial part of the total workload of gastroenterologist is attributed to dyspepsia, a significant proportion of which is a result of either GERD or peptic ulcer disease. Fewer than half the individuals with these problems will ever seek medical advice, yet these disorders are very costly as many buy medications such as antacids and H2 blockers over the counter. It is difficult to analyse separately the economic burden of GERD or peptic ulcer disease, as most studies have used the broader term ‘dyspepsia’ in their calculations. For the purpose of this analysis, to make a gross assessment of the burden of cost, dyspepsia has been employed as a surrogate marker. The available appropriate data on cost analysis is sparse. Using the Swedish model of cost analysis recently published in Pharmacoeconomics 2002, we applied the same model to assess the cost of these disorders in different countries throughout Europe. However, we are aware that this can certainly vary with different disease definitions, regional variations in population trends, family size, income, occupational category and other socio-economic variables, from country to country. We estimated the overall cost of these disorders as €253 per person. As with the previous study we can also assume that 61% would be accounted for by direct costs and 39% indirect costs. The direct costs include: visits to GPs and specialists, in-patient care with and without surgery, and investigations. Indirect costs include sick leave, disability pension, early retirement, and time off work. In all, drugs and sick leave (37% vs. 34%) were considered to be the two main expenses, constituting almost 70% of the total cost. The proportion of the cost for drugs increased from 7% to 37% from 1985 to 1997, while sick leave seemed to have decreased from at least 66% to 34% in the same time period. The gross assessment of cost analysis for different countries in Europe is shown in Table 4. The cost of managing the side-effects of NSAIDs has been studied separately throughout Europe. In one study examining the costs in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, the total cost of managing gastrointestinal related events was €62–962 for discomfort, €130–1200 for anaemia, €175–1470 for ulcers, and €2300–6500 for serious events requiring hospitalization.15 In summary, the cost of dyspepsia has exponentially increased in the last decade, mainly as a result of a marked increase in the cost of drugs, due to the introduction of proton pump inhibitors. The cost of sick leave has decreased, possibly due to better drugs and a general reduction in the financial benefits from sick leave. It is likely that these figures may represent an overestimation, but they do certainly suggest that a significant amount is being spent annually on these disorders throughout Europe. Costs associated with NSAIDs vary from region to region as a result of different resources consumed and price policies, but are substantial everywhere. H. pylori infection and NSAIDs are by far the commonest cause of gastroduodenal pathology worldwide. The discovery of H. pylori colonization of the gastric mucosa and its causal association with peptic ulcer disease has offered a new and lasting treatment for these previously chronic and often complicated conditions. In addition, the development of novel diagnostic tests and management strategies has revolutionized our approach of these diseases, enabling accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment without recourse to invasive procedures and indeed often to hospital facilities. NSAID-induced gastroduodenal toxicity is a common clinical problem associated with serious consequences. It remains the most frequently reported drug-related adverse event worldwide. Advances in recent years have led to a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved in mediating mucosal injury and to the development of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which may protect patients from these sequelae. The precise role of these agents in a variety of clinical settings is still under investigation and studies examining their costeffectiveness are ongoing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0953-0673.2003.01725.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048599708", "source": "openalex"}

The role of other potential risk factors for the development of Barrett's oesophagus in patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms is controversial. Aims To perform a systematic review and meta‐analysis examining risk factors in development of Barrett's oesophagus. Methods Medline, Embase and Embase Classic were searched (until December 2020) to identify cross‐sectional studies reporting prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus based on presence of one or more proposed risk factors in individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms. Prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus was compared according to presence or absence of each risk factor in individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms. Results Of 7164 citations evaluated, 13 studies reported prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus in 11 856 subjects. Pooled prevalence of histologically confirmed Barrett's oesophagus in individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms in all studies was 7.0% (95% CI 4.8% to 9.6%). Prevalence was higher in subjects with hiatal hernia (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.58 to 4.75) and in those who drank alcohol (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.95). Other features including non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and/or aspirin use (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.42), smoking (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35) or obesity (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) were not significantly associated with Barrett's oesophagus. Conclusions The prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus in individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms was higher in those who drank alcohol, although this association was modest. The strongest association found was between hiatal hernia and Barrett's oesophagus. Other potential risk factors assessed in this study did not appear to be associated with presence of Barrett's oesophagus among individuals with gastro‐oesophageal symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16321", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3135347010", "source": "openalex"}

This study was aimed at investigating the role of desmosomal proteins in relation to GERD. Methods and results: Ninety‐five patients with GERD‐related symptoms (erosive, n = 51; non‐erosive, n = 44) and 27 patients lacking those symptoms were included. Endoscopic and histological characterization of oesophagitis was performed according to the Los Angeles and Ismeil–Beigi criteria, respectively. Multiple biopsies were taken from the oesophageal mucosa of each patient. Gene expression analysis of plakoglobin, desmoglein‐1, desmoglein‐2 and desmoglein‐3 was performed by quantitative real time (RT)‐polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in the oesophageal mucosa. Routine histology revealed specific GERD‐related alterations, such as dilatation of intercellular spaces (DIS), basal cell hyperplasia (BCH), and elongation of the papillae, in the oesophageal mucosa of patients with GERD, as compared with controls (all parameters: P &lt; 0.05). All four genes and corresponding proteins were found to be up‐regulated by between 1.7 and 8.1‐fold (transcript level, P &lt; 0.05; protein level, P &lt; 0.05). Induced gene expression levels of plakoglobin, desmoglein‐1 and desmoglein‐2 correlated significantly with DIS and BCH.

Also if there is not a clinical indication to perform biopsies in patient with GERD, the diagnosis of microscopic esophagitis, when biopsies are provided, can be performed by following simple rules for evaluation which allow pathologists to make the diagnosis with confidence. On the other hand, biopsies are required for the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.

However information about the accuracy of Australian discharge data in identifying cancer, associated procedures and comorbidity is limited. The Admitted Patients Data Collection (APDC) is a census of inpatient hospital discharges in the state of New South Wales (NSW). Our aim was to assess the accuracy of the APDC in identifying upper gastro-intestinal (upper GI) cancer cases, procedures for associated curative resection and comorbidities at the time of admission compared to data abstracted from medical records (the 'gold standard'). We reviewed the medical records of 240 patients with an incident upper GI cancer diagnosis derived from a clinical database in one NSW area health service from July 2006 to June 2007. Extracted case record data was matched to APDC discharge data to determine sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and agreement between the two data sources (κ-coefficient). The accuracy of the APDC diagnostic codes in identifying site-specific incident cancer ranged from 80-95% sensitivity. This was comparable to the accuracy of APDC procedure codes in identifying curative resection for upper GI cancer. PPV ranged from 42-80% for cancer diagnosis and 56-93% for curative surgery. Agreement between the data sources was >0.72 for most cancer diagnoses and curative resections. However, APDC discharge data was less accurate in reporting common comorbidities - for each condition, sensitivity ranged from 9-70%, whilst agreement ranged from κ = 0.64 for diabetes down to κ < 0.01 for gastro-oesophageal reflux disorder. Identifying incident cases of upper GI cancer and curative resection from hospital administrative data is satisfactory but under-ascertained. Linkage of multiple population-health datasets is advisable to maximise case ascertainment and minimise false-positives. Consideration must be given when utilising hospital discharge data alone for generating comorbidity indices, as disease burden at the time of admission is under-reported.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-331", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080264574", "source": "openalex"}

Our previous study has identified an insulin receptor (IR)-binding protein (mcIRBP) from Momordica charantia.

By in vitro digestion and IR kinase activity assay, we found that a 9-amino-acid-residue peptide, mcIRBP-9, was a gastro-resistant peptide that enhanced IR kinase activities. mcIRBP-9 activated IR signaling transduction pathway, which resulted in the phosphorylation of IR, the translocation of glucose transporter 4, and the uptake of glucose in cells. Intraperitoneal and oral administration of mcIRBP-9 stimulated the glucose clearance by 30.91 ± 0.39% and 32.09 ± 0.38%, respectively, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.

Biological markers, such as peptides hypersecreted by biologically active NE tumours, aid in the evaluation of response to treatment. For surgically untreatable NE neoplasms, the therapeutic approach remains undefined. Somatostatin analogues, particularly octreotide, can control the clinical effects of hormone overproduction in NE neoplasms and they have revolutionised individualised treatment, particularly for biologically active tumours. So far, like interferon, octreotide used at standard dosages has failed to control neo-plastic growth per se. We gave the somatostatin analogue lanreotide to women with advanced breast cancer and to colorectal carcinoma patients. Results confirmed that inhibition of the production of insulin-like growth factor-1 which plays an important role in neoplastic proliferation, could be obtained using the highest doses. Considering these data, we started a clinical trial of 58 patients affected by NE tumours, treated with two sequential doses (500 and 1,000 μg subcutaneously t.i.d.) of octreotide. Long-term disease stabilisation ( > 6 months) was achieved in 43% of patients but an objective response in only 3%. Good control of clinical symptoms and markers was obtained in 73 and 77% of cases, respectively. Toxicity was negligible.

There is limited information on the influence of 5‐HT 4 receptor agonists on oesophageal function and gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Aim To evaluate the effects of tegaserod, a 5‐HT 4 agonist on oesophageal function using impedance‐manometry and postprandial reflux using impedance‐pH monitoring. Methods Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double‐blind randomized three‐period crossover placebo‐controlled study. Impedance‐manometry and impedance‐pH monitoring after a refluxogenic meal were performed at baseline and after 2 days of dosing with tegaserod 6 mg b.d. or placebo. Multichannel intraluminal impedance‐EM recorded pressure and bolus transit data during standardized swallows. Multichannel intraluminal impedance‐pH monitoring recorded the number of 2‐h postprandial acid and non‐acid reflux episodes. Results We found no significant difference in distal oesophageal amplitude when subjects received placebo (median 94.5; range: 53–243 mmHg) or tegaserod (93.6; 43–216 mmHg). Bolus transit time was similar during dosing with placebo (7.1; 5.3–9.4 s) and tegaserod (7.2; 5.9–11.1 s).

We aimed to verify whether such hormonal responses are retained in acromegaly, a disease characterized by high GH, subnormal ghrelin and abnormal GEP hormone levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of ghrelin (3.3 microg/kg given after overnight fasting as an i.v. bolus) on GH, prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, insulin, glucose, total somatostatin (SS) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) circulating levels were evaluated in seven non-diabetic patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly and in nine healthy controls. RESULTS: Ghrelin elicited a prompt, marked increase of serum GH and PRL levels in all normal (from 1.6+/-0.6 to 52.9+/-7.8 and from 9.7+/-0.8 to 24.2+/-4.8 microg/l (means+/-S.E.M.), respectively) and acromegalic subjects (from 11.2+/-4.9 to 91.6+/-21.0 and from 42.9+/-26.1 to 113.8+/-79.0 microg/l, respectively).

According to our present conceptions the specific biologic properties of animal tissues reside in great part, if not entirely, in the protein constituents.

About half represented the endemic level then prevailing, and the remainder formed a virulent epidemic, which was responsible for most of the deaths. Salmonella bovismorbificans was isolated from a sufficient proportion of these cases to justify the belief that it was the cause of the epidemic. Of recognized infections with S. bovis-morbificans 77 % were in babies under 1 year old, 19 % in those 1–2 years old, and 4 % in older children and adults. The infection was most severe in the under-1-year-old group, and severity varied during the epidemic, reaching a maximum in August and thereafter declining steadily. Nearly two-thirds of the infections were institutional. Infants were found to be infective during the incubation period and also for periods up to 6 months after clinical recovery. Their faeces provided the greatest mass of infective material. Infections in older age groups were relatively unimportant in relation to the rate of epidemic spread, but significant secondary centres of infection developed in mice and cockroaches in the hospital wards. The path of infection was traced from the faeces to the sinks and brushes used for cleansing soiled napkins, to mice and cockroaches which had access to the sinks, and to ward wash-basins and nailbrushes used by the nursing staff. Possible indicators of faecal contamination were found on nurses' hands, in ward kitchens, and in milk mixtures prepared for babies' feeds. Control is believed to be practicable and to depend, first, on making medical officers and nurses aware of the dangers; and secondly, on improved ward hygiene, of which elimination of washing napkins in wards, reduction of contamination when changing napkins, rigid segregation of ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’ nurses, and improvements in food preparation and administration, are regarded as the most important.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s002217240001442x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013884049", "source": "openalex"}

Because farm environment acts as a source of cattle contamination, it is important to better understand the factors controlling the persistence of E. coli O157:H7 outside the bovine gut. The E. coli O157:H7 strain MC2, identified as a persistent strain in French farms, possessed the characteristics required to cause human infections and genetic markers associated with clinical O157:H7 isolates. Therefore, the capacity of E. coli MC2 to survive during its transit through the bovine gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and to respond to stresses potentially encountered in extra-intestinal environments was analyzed. E. coli MC2 survived in rumen fluids, grew in the content of posterior digestive compartments and survived in bovine feces at 15°C predicting a successful transit of the bacteria along the bovine GIT and its persistence outside the bovine intestine. E. coli MC2 possessed the genetic information encoding fourteen adherence systems including adhesins with properties related to colonization of the bovine intestine (F9 fimbriae, EhaA and EspP autotransporters, HCP pilus, FdeC adhesin) reflecting the capacity of the bacteria to colonize different segments of the bovine GIT. E. coli MC2 was also a strong biofilm producer when incubated in fecal samples at low temperature and had a greater ability to form biofilms than the bovine commensal E. coli strain BG1. Furthermore, in contrast to BG1, E. coli MC2 responded to temperature stresses by inducing the genes cspA and htrA during its survival in bovine feces at 15°C. E. coli MC2 also activated genes that are part of the GhoT/GhoS, HicA/HicB and EcnB/EcnA toxin/antitoxin systems involved in the response of E. coli to nutrient starvation and chemical stresses. In summary, the large number of colonization factors known to bind to intestinal epithelium and to biotic or abiotic surfaces, the capacity to produce biofilms and to activate stress fitness genes in bovine feces could explain the persistence of E. coli MC2 in the farm environment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00375", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2791442836", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to determine virulence factors (cagA, vacA and iceA) of H. pylori strains and the pattern of gastritis in patients with GORD in comparison with patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) or functional dyspepsia (FD). Methods:H. pylori strains isolated from gastric biopsies of 105 consecutive patients with mild to moderate erosive GORD (n = 35, LA grade A-B), and from sex- and age-matched patients with DU (n = 35) or FD (n = 35 without reflux symptoms) were investigated. CagA, vacA, and iceA genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of the isolates. Gastritis was classified in accordance with the updated Sydney classification. Results: The prevalence of all three H. pylori virulence factors was higher in patients with GORD (cagA[Formula: See Text] 80%, vacA s1 77%, iceA1 71%) and DU (cagA[Formula: See Text] 83%, vacA s1 80%, iceA1 74%) than in patients with FD (cagA[Formula: See Text] 40%, vacA s1 49%, iceA1 46%).

TGF-α protein expression was significantly associated with tumour progression (P = 0.025) and lymph node metastasis (P< 0.05). The strong TGF-α expression found in neoplastic cells inside blood and lymphatic vessels and in metastatic localizations suggests that TGF-α-positive GEJ adenocarcinomas could have a more aggressive biological phenotype. The expression of TGF-α mRNA and protein in both inflammatory and neoplastic cells indicates that TGF-α is directly synthesized by both cell compartments.

The size or average diameter (d avg ) and surface morphology of the prepared microspheres were recognized and characterized by the optical and scanning electron microscopic methods, respectively. In vitro drug release studies were performed and the drug release kinetics were evaluated using the linear regression method. Effects of the stirring rate during preparation, polymer concentration on the size of the microspheres and drug release were also observed. The prepared microspheres exhibited prolonged drug release (18 h) and remained buoyant for more than 12 h. The mean particle size increased and the drug release rate decreased at a higher polymer concentration. No significant effect of the stirring rate during preparation on drug release was observed. In vitro studies demonstrated a diffusion-controlled drug release from the microspheres. The objective of the present study was to develop floating microspheres of FM in order to achieve an extended retention in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which may result in enhanced absorption and thereby improved bioavailability. The prepared microspheres were evaluated for particle size, in vitro release and buoyancy and incorporation efficiency. The effect of various formulation variables on the size and drug release was investigated.

Since non‐acidic reflux may be associated with symptoms persisting during PPI treatment, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the most important barrier protecting against reflux, has become an important target for the treatment of (refractory) GERD. Preclinical research has identified several receptors that are involved in the control of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs), the predominant mechanism of both acid and non‐acidic reflux events, and several drugs have now been tested in humans. The GABA B agonist baclofen has demonstrated to effectively reduce the rate of TLESRs and the amount of reflux in both GERD patients and healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, the occurrence of central side effects limits its clinical use for the treatment of GERD. Several analogues are being developed to overcome this limitation and have shown promising results. Additionally, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) receptor antagonists have shown to reduce both acid and non‐acidic reflux in GERD patients and several molecules are currently being evaluated. Although CB 1 antagonists have been shown to reduce TLESRs, they are also associated with central side effects, limiting their clinical applicability. Despite the identification of several potentially interesting drugs, the main challenge for the future remains the reduction of central side effects. Moreover, future studies will need to demonstrate the efficacy of these treatments in patients with refractory GERD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2010.01537.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1678891441", "source": "openalex"}

During coevolution with hosts, worms have developed numerous ways to trick and evade the host immune response, and because of their size, they cannot be internalized and killed by immune cells in the same way as bacteria or viruses. During infection, a substantial Th2 component to the immune response is evoked which helps restrain Th1-mediated tissue damage. Although an enhanced Th2 response is often not enough to kill the parasite and terminate an infection in itself, when tightly coordinated with the nervous, endocrine, and motor systems it can dislodge parasites from tissues and expel them from the gut. A significant role in this “weep and seep” response is attributed to intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). This review highlights the role of various IEC lineages (enterocytes, tuft cells, Paneth cells, microfold cells, goblet cells, and intestine stem cells) during the course of helminth infections and summarizes their roles in regulating gut architecture and permeability, and muscle contractions and interactions with the immune and nervous system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12020175", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4205769835", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we further provide evidence that gastro-duodenal reflux is a risk factor for early pre-malignant alterations in hypopharyngeal mucosa (HM) related to an activated NF- κ B oncogenic pathway, using both an in vitro and a novel in vivo model of C57Bl/6J mice. Histological, immunohistochemical and automated quantitative analysis documents significant NF- κ B activation and early pre-malignant alterations in HM topically exposed to GDFs, compared to acid alone and other controls. Early pre-malignant histologic lesions exhibited increased Ki67, CK14 and ΔNp63, cell proliferation markers, changes of cell adhesion molecules, E-Cadherin and β-catenin, and STAT3 activation. The in vivo effect of NF- κ B activation is positively correlated with p-STAT3, Ki67, CK14 or β-catenin expression, while GDFs induce significant transcriptional activation of RELA(p65), bcl-2, TNF-α, STAT3, EGFR and wnt5A, in vivo .

The small population size and extreme environmental pressures experienced by Fongoli chimpanzees make them particularly sensitive to the potential impact of pathogens. One hundred thirty‐two chimpanzee and seventeen baboon fecal samples were processed using sodium nitrate floatation and fecal sedimentation to isolate helminth eggs, larvae, and protozoal cysts. Six nematodes ( Physaloptera sp., Ascaris sp., Stronglyloides fuelleborni , Trichuris sp., an unidentified hookworm, and an unidentified larvated nematode), one cestode ( Bertiella sp.), and five protozoans ( Iodamoeba buetschlii , Entamoeba coli , Troglodytella abrassarti , Troglocorys cava , and an unidentified ciliate) were detected in chimpanzee fecal samples. Four nematodes ( Necator sp., S. fuelleborni , Trichuris sp., and an unidentified hookworm sp.), two trematodes ( Shistosoma mansoni and an unidentified fluke), and six protozoans ( Entamoeba histolytica / dispar , E. coli , Chilomastix mesnili, Balantidium coli, T. abrassarti , and T. cava ) were detected in baboon fecal samples. The low prevalence of pathogenic parasite species and high prevalence of symbiotic protozoa in Fongoli chimpanzees are indicative of good overall population health. However, the high prevalence of pathogenic parasites in baboons, who may serve as transport hosts, highlight the need for ongoing pathogen surveillance of the Fongoli chimpanzee population and point to the need for further research into the epidemiology and cross‐species transmission ecology of zoonotic pathogens at this site.

Road kills were the main source of this material. Spiculopteragia spiculoptera and Ostertagia leptospicularis, with their \"minor\" morphs S. mathevossiani and O. kolchida, were the dominant abomasal species, whereas Nematodirus europaeus was the only dominant species in the small intestine; therefore, species composition was typical of this ruminant host. Nematodes whose prime hosts are domestic and wild Bovids (Rupicapra rupicapra) were found occasionally. Abundances were low (407 nematodes in the abomasum, 209 in the small intestine, 6 in the large intestine) in spite of a high population density. Significant differences in worm counts were observed between seasons (abomasal worm counts peaked in late spring and summer whereas N. europaeus was more abundant in winter), years and between sex and age classes (higher abomasal counts in bucks vs does and in adult individuals vs fawns). Associations between worm counts and the condition of roe deer (five parameters taken into account) could not be demonstrated unambiguously.

Aim To present an update of the literature studying the clinical efficacy of endoscopic antireflux procedures, and to discuss further developments. Methods A PubMed search was performed for endoscopic suturing, antireflux treatment, endoscopic gastroplication, polymer injection, radiofrequency ablation of GORD. Own recent research was compared with existing data. Information concerning GORD endotherapy were gathered. Results Uncontrolled studies have reported promising clinical results on the short to intermediate term for most endoscopic GORD procedures, but the placebo effect remained unknown. It is, therefore, commendable that the three main procedures (Endocinch, Stretta and Enteryx) have now all been tested against a sham procedure. Although all three techniques were able to improve symptoms, quality of life and PPI use, oesophageal acid reduction was unremarkable. Endocinch and Stretta are safe outpatient procedures. Concerns about the durability of Endocinch have risen. Polymer injection (Enteryx) and gel prosthesis implantation (Gatekeeper) were recalled for severe complications and lack of efficacy, respectively. Conclusions Endotherapy has shown the potential to treat (uncomplicated) GORD. However, some early procedures have failed or proven unsafe. Further developments and studies are necessary to determine what modifications to these techniques are required to produce optimal efficacy and durability. Until then, widespread clinical use of endotherapy for GORD should probably be avoided.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03473.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129706554", "source": "openalex"}

The complex was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, powder x-ray diffractometer, and scanning electron microscopy. The prepared co-precipitate complex was used for the development of the sustained-release formulation to overcome the high metabolic and poor solubility problems associated with ABX. Furthermore, the co-precipitate complex was formulated as a suspension in an aqueous floating gel-forming vehicle of sodium alginate with chitosan, which might be beneficial for targeting the stomach as a good absorption site for ABX. The suspension exhibited rapid floating gel behaviour for more than 8 h, thus confirming the gastro-retentive effects. Particle size analysis revealed that the optimum nanosuspension (ABX-NS) had a mean particle size of 332.3 nm. Afterward, the ABX released by the nanoparticles would be distributed to the pulmonary tissue as previously described. Based on extensive pulmonary distribution, the developed nanosuspension-released ABX nanoparticles showed significant cytotoxic enhancement compared to free ABX in A549 lung cancer cells. However, a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) also occurred. The level of caspase-3 was the highest in the ABX-NS-released particle-treated samples, with a value of 416.6 ± 9.11 pg/mL. Meanwhile, the levels of nuclear factor kappa beta, interleukins 6 and 1 beta, and tumour necrosis alpha (NF-kB, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, respectively) were lower for ABX-NS compared to free ABX (p < 0.05). In caspase-3, Bax, and p53, levels significantly increased in the presence of ABX-NS compared to free ABX. Overall, ABX-NS produced an enhancement of the anticancer effects of ABX on the A549 cells, and the developed sustained-release gel was successful in providing a gastro-retentive effect.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/gels7040243", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3215092274", "source": "openalex"}

In women, infections with C. trachomatis may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. In addition to infecting the female reproductive tract (FRT), Chlamydia spp. are routinely found in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of animals and humans and can be a reservoir for reinfection of the FRT. Whether Chlamydia disseminates from the FRT to the GI tract via internal routes remains unknown. Using mouse-specific C. muridarum as a model pathogen we show that Chlamydia disseminates from the FRT to the GI tract in a stepwise manner, by first infecting the FRT-draining iliac lymph nodes (ILNs), then the spleen, then the GI tract. Tissue CD11c+ DCs mediate the first step: FRT to ILN Chlamydia transport, which relies on CCR7:CCL21/CCL19 signaling. The second step, Chlamydia transport from ILN to the spleen, also relies on cell transport. However, this step is dependent on cell migration mediated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling. Finally, spleen to GI tract Chlamydia spread is the third critical step, and is significantly hindered in splenectomized mice. Inhibition of Chlamydia dissemination significantly reduces or precludes the induction of Chlamydia-specific serum IgG antibodies, presence of which is correlated with FRT pathology in women. This study reveals important insights in context of Chlamydia spp. pathogenesis and will inform the development of therapeutic targets and vaccines to combat this pathogen.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008207", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2994179455", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence on the influence of gastrostomy placement on gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease has been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of gastrostomy on gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was performed including 50 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrostomy between May 2012 and April 2014. Before and 3 months after surgery 24‐hour multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring was performed and caregivers filled out reflux symptom questionnaires. Results: Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms were present in a comparable number of patients before (44%) and after gastrostomy placement (40%; P = 0.73). Twenty‐five of the patients (50%) underwent both the preoperative and postoperative tests and were included in impedance‐pH analysis. Acid exposure time (percentage of time with pH below 4) did not change significantly after gastrostomy placement: from 6.2% (3.0–18.1) to 6.1% (2.6–14.9). The number of reflux episodes did not significantly change, for either liquid [mean difference 4.3 (−4.5 to 13.2)] or mixed liquid‐gas reflux [mean difference 2.0 (−9.3 to 13.3)]. Before gastrostomy placement, 18 out of 25 patients had pathological reflux (72%) on pH‐impedance measurement. In 4 patients, pathological reflux dissolved, whereas 4 patients newly developed pathological reflux. A low preoperative weight‐for‐height percentile was associated with increased acid exposure after gastrostomy placement. Conclusions: Overall, gastrostomy placement was not associated with an increase in acid exposure on 24‐hour multichannel intraluminal impedance pH monitoring. Similarly, the prevalence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux‐related symptoms did not change after gastrostomy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002530", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2980804738", "source": "openalex"}

Firstly, babies who cry excessively are often prescribed proton pump inhibitors, despite evidence that gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease is very rarely a cause. The inaccuracy of commonly used explanatory mechanisms, the side‐effects of acid‐suppressive medications, and the failure to identify treatable problems, including feeding difficulty when the diagnosis of ‘reflux’ is applied, are discussed. Secondly, crying breastfed babies are still prescribed lactase or lactose‐free formula, despite evidence that the problem of functional lactose overload is one of breastfeeding management. The mechanisms and management of functional lactose overload are discussed. These two problems of research translation need to be addressed because failure to identify and manage other causes of cry‐fuss problems, including feeding difficulty, may have adverse outcomes for a small but significant minority of families.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.12153", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1621199980", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3093974632", "title": "Safety of the LMA®Gastro™ for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography", "text": "BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) patients typically receive either tubeless anesthesia or general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA). Patients receiving propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are at higher risk of sedation-related adverse events (SRAEs) than patients receiving GETA, primarily due to the need for additional airway maneuvers. The increasing use of non–operating room (OR) anesthesia and the perception of a higher incidence of adverse outcomes in non-OR areas has led to the development of devices to improve safety while maintaining efficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the LMA ® Gastro™ could be used as a safe alternative to tubeless anesthesia for successfully completing ERCPs. METHODS: Eligible subjects were identified within the patient population at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients (≥18 years old) scheduled for elective ERCP with TIVA. This was a prospective observational study in which the following data were collected: number of attempts and time to successful supraglottic airway (SGA) placement, vital signs, peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp o 2 ), median end-tidal CO 2 , practitioner satisfaction, and any complications. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included in this study. The overall rate of successful SGA placement within 3 attempts was 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.8–99.9) or 29/30. The rate of successful ERCP with SGA placement within 3 attempts was 93.3% (95% CI, 77.9–99.2) or 28/30. Both the gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist reported satisfaction with the device in 90% of the cases (in 66.7% of the cases both anesthesiologist and gastroenterologist scored the device a 7/7 for satisfaction). Patients maintained an Sp o 2 of 95%–100% from induction to discharge, with the exception of 1 patient who had an Sp o 2 of 93%. The median end-tidal CO 2 during the procedure for all patients was 35 mm Hg. Observed aspiration did not occur in any patient. Symptoms of hoarseness (13.3%), mouth soreness (6.7%), sore throat (6.6%), and minor bleeding/cuts/redness/change in taste to the tongue (3.3%) were determined through patient questioning before postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the LMA Gastro might be a safe alternative for ERCP procedures. There was a high level of practitioner satisfaction. Only minor complications, such as hoarseness, mouth or throat soreness, or minor trauma to the tongue were experienced by patients. Similar incidences of complications may occur with GETA and tubeless anesthesia. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients; all patients maintained adequate oxygenation and required only minimal blood pressure support.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005183", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3093974632", "source": "openalex"}

All nine short segment patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux had a Barrett's CK7/20 phenotype, while four of seven short segment patients without reflux had a gastric CK7/20 phenotype ( P = 0.019). Of 14 patients with intestinal metaplasia of the gastro‐oesophageal junction and reflux, 10 (71%) had a Barrett's CK7/20 phenotype, compared with 11 (55%) of the 20 non‐reflux patients. Conclusions : CK7/20 immunoreactivity for patients with intestinal metaplasia of the distal oesophagus without long segment Barrett's oesophagus suggests a heterogeneous group, with an association between Barrett's CK7/20 pattern and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in both short segment Barrett's and intestinal metaplasia of the gastro‐oesophageal junction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02219.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2003836769", "source": "openalex"}

Methods : A retrospective review of 79 children who underwent fundoplication between January 1995 and December 1999. Results : Forty‐nine of the children (62%) had a respiratory indication for fundoplication. Children with neurological impairment tended to have a respiratory rather than a gastrointestinal indication for surgery. Congenital anomalies were present in 47%. Fundoplication in older children was more likely to be for a gastrointestinal indication. Children with neurological impairment were more likely to have a gastrostomy compared to children with normal neurological status ( P &lt; 0.01). Children with a respiratory indication were more likely to have three or more diagnostic investigations ( P &lt; 0.001).

The manometric crural pressure was measured in 57 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, documented by 24-h ambulatory pH monitoring, and compared between patients with and without hiatal hernia. Repeat measurements were made in 33 patients who underwent antireflux surgery that incorporated a crural repair. Mean crural pressure in 41 patients with hiatal hernia was 5.0 mmHg, compared with 15.0 mmHg in 16 without hiatal hernia (P < 0.01). In the 33 patients undergoing antireflux surgery, mean crural pressure rose from 7.1 mmHg before operation to 11.6 mmHg afterwards (P < 0.02) overall, and from 4.7 to 10.1 mmHg (P < 0.01) in the 26 patients with hiatal hernia. These results confirm a measurable contribution of the diaphragmatic crural sling to resting pressure at the high-pressure zone. The crural pressure is deficient in patients with hiatal hernia compared with that in those with reflux but no hernia. The mean crural pressure is increased in patients by antireflux surgery, particularly in those with hiatal hernia.

Here, we aimed to investigate the expression relevance of three prognostic miRNAs (miR‐21, miR‐10b, and miR‐146a) in CSCs of AGS and MKN‐45 gastric cancer cell lines. Methods Serial sphere‐forming assay in serum‐free culture medium was used to enrich the cellular population with stem‐like properties. Gastro‐spheres were characterized by evaluating the stemness gene expression, clonogenicity, and resistance to docetaxel and cisplatin in comparison with their parental cells. The expression level of miRNAs in gastro‐spheres and their parental cells was measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results Gastro‐spheres from both cell lines exhibit stem‐like properties: upregulated stemness associated genes ( P &lt; 0.05), more colonogenicity and more resistance to docetaxel ( P &lt; 0.05).

There is an increasing understanding of the distinct comorbidities over-represented in patients with IPF and associated with a clinically important impact on symptoms and outcomes [1–4]. More than 40 years ago, Mays et al . [5] were the first to describe a potential association between gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and IPF. Since then multiple reports have established that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is one of the most prevalent comorbid conditions in IPF. Based on the increased prevalence, it has been hypothesised that GOR-associated microaspirations may have a pathogenic role in IPF. This stimulated further research, including in animal models, which suggested that aspiration of acid refluxate causes the parenchymal damage associated with pneumonitis and increased epithelial permeability with the consequence of stimulated fibrotic proliferation and perhaps of acute exacerbations (summarised in [6]). Therefore, an early dream was that supressing microaspiration may alter the course of IPF, namely by allowing greater symptom management, disease stabilisation and perhaps improved survival [7].

The appearance and distribution of the gastro-intestinal hormone, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) were examined in the gastro-entero-pancreatic system of human foetuses, aged 5–24 weeks, by immunocytochemistry or radioimmunoassay. The first immunoreactive cells were observed in the gut from 16 weeks of gestation. The GIP-containing cells were localized preferentially in the villous epithelium of the small intestine. In the radioimmunoassay, the highest concentrations of immunoreactive GIP (IR-GIP) were detected from 13 to 21 weeks of gestation. The tissue concentration of IR-GIP was 68.10 ± 10.70 ng/g wet weight of duodenum, 30.29 ± 3.96 ng/g wet weight of jejuno-ileum and 3.05 ± 1.97 ng/g wet weight in the colon. Measurable amounts of IR-GIP (4.93 ± 1.57 ng/g wet weight of organ) were found from 9 to 12 weeks in the jejuno-ileal region. The ontogenic development of IR-GIP was studied in this region. From 13 to 21 weeks of gestation, the IR-GIP content per g of organ increased about 6-fold. In the endocrine pancreas, GIP antiserum No. R07 was potent in staining A cells from 14 weeks of gestation. In radioimmunological tests, no cross-reactions of the anti-GIP sera R 07 and GP 01 with heterologous peptides were observed. Labelling of paraffin and semi-thin sections was subjected not only to the usual specificity tests, but also to particularly extensive cross-reaction studies. GIP-like immunoreactivity was not inhibited by absorptions against heterologous peptides added at varying concentrations.

In difficult‐to‐treat patients, oesophageal pH monitoring is a useful technique to assess pH control and to investigate the association of reflux with refractory symptoms. Intragastric pH monitoring allows direct assessment of acid suppression achieved with an agent, and is the most useful for head‐to‐head comparisons of antisecretory therapies, evaluating variability in individual gastric pH response, assessing dose timing and food effect, and determining alternate dosing strategies; as such, it is useful in the research laboratory, and may be useful clinically to guide clinicians in dose titration and in evaluating the effect of switching agents.

Here, common clinically relevant management issues are considered based on the best available evidence. Regardless of the presenting symptoms, determine if there are any alarm features; these have a low positive predictive value for malignancy but all patients with them should be referred for prompt upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Ask about medications; of most importance are the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both non‐selective and COX‐2 selective. Try to ascertain if the symptom pattern suggests gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or not. Dominant heartburn, however, may be of limited value; if the background prevalence of GERD is 25% and the patient complains of dominant heartburn, then the likelihood that such a patient has GERD as identified by 24‐h oesophageal pH testing is only just over 50%. If reflux disease is strongly suspected and there are no alarm features, give an empirical trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Symptoms cannot separate adequately functional from organic dyspepsia. Endoscopy in dyspepsia with no alarm features is more costly than an empirical management approach. H. pylori testing and treatment remains in most settings the preferable initial choice for managing dyspepsia without obvious GERD.

Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass is the preferred operation in morbidly obese patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. In 2011, we introduced preoperative endoscopy to assess for hiatus hernia or evidence of oesophagitis in conjunction with an assessment of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms for all patients undergoing bariatric surgery with a view to avoid sleeve gastrectomy for these patients. A prospectively maintained database was used to identify patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy before and after we changed the unit policy. The need for revisional surgery in patients with troublesome gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease was examined. Prior to 2011, 130 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy, and 11 (8.5%) of them required conversion to Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass for symptomatic reflux disease. Following the policy change, 284 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy, and to date, only five (1.8%) have required revisional surgery ( p = 0.001). Baseline demographics were comparable between the groups, and average follow‐up period was 47 and 33 months, respectively, for each group. Preoperative endoscopy and a detailed clinical history regarding gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms may improve patient selection for sleeve gastrectomy.

In clinical practice, heartburn relief following a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial or endoscopy can confirm a diagnosis of GERD. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty or before anti-reflux interventions, combined impedance-pH monitoring (MII-pH) provides a comprehensive assessment of both physical and chemical properties of the refluxate, allowing to achieve a conclusive diagnosis of GERD. Recently, the Lyon Consensus proposed the use of mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) and post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index (PSPW-I) as novel MII-pH metrics to support the diagnosis of GERD. The calculation of MNBI and PSPW-I currently needs to be performed manually, but artificial intelligence systems for the automated analysis of MII-pH tracings are being developed. Several studies demonstrated the increased diagnostic yield MNBI and PSPW-I for the categorization of patients with GERD at both on- and off-PPI MII-pH monitoring. Accordingly, we performed a narrative review on the clinical use and diagnostic yield of MNBI and PSPW-I when the diagnosis of GERD is uncertain. Based on currently available evidence, we strongly support the evaluation of PSPW-I and MNBI as part of the standard assessment of MII-pH tracings for the evaluation of GERD, especially in patients with endoscopy-negative heartburn.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10388-022-00933-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4283710487", "source": "openalex"}

To address the gastrointestinal toxicity of conventional NSAIDs, a new S-naproxen-4-allyl guaiacol chimera (MAS-1696) was computationally developed, chemically synthesized, and tested for anti-inflammatory effectiveness and gastrointestinal safety. The inhibitory potency of MAS-1696 tested against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), 15-lipoxygenase-2 (15-LOX2), and lipoxygenase-5 (5-LOX) in vitro revealed a stronger inhibition of COX2. Furthermore, the MAS-1696 chimera increased the COX selectivity index by 23% as compared to the parent compound naproxen, implying higher efficacy and gastric safety. In vivo data showed that MAS-1696 was less likely to cause gastrointestinal harm than naproxen while also exerting anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects equivalent to or superior to naproxen. In conclusion, MAS-1696 is orally active, bio-labile, and crystalline, making it a medication that may be administered orally.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27206905", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4306398928", "source": "openalex"}

In this study 32 formerly preterm infants were studied simultaneously by 24-hour oesophageal pH monitoring and cardio-respirogram before the presumed end of caffeine treatment. In 14 of these infants a reflux index (RI; percentage of recording time) of more than 4% could be detected (pH <4). Ten of them were treated orally with cisapride (0. 2 mg/kg t.i.d.). Data of pH monitoring, cardio-respirogram and caffeine serum concentrations were obtained before and 5 days after introducing cisapride. The RI and the frequency of GOR decreased significantly with cisapride. The steady-state serum concentrations of caffeine were not influenced by cisapride and the extent of periodic breathing remained unchanged. In conclusion, cisapride has a positive influence on GOR parameters during caffeine treatment without impairing the oral bioavailability or therapeutic effect of caffeine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000014200", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1988454417", "source": "openalex"}

The present investigation aims to design a gastric floating tablet with prolonged gastric floating time and sustained drug release profile. In the present study, a gastro retentive floating device (GRFD) was designed and fabricated using a fused deposition modelling (FDM)-based 3D printing technique. This device acts as a multifunctional dosage form exhibiting prolonged gastric retention time and sustained drug release profile with improved oral bioavailability in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Commercial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments were used to design GRFD, which was comprised of dual compartments. The outer sealed compartment acts as an air-filled chamber that imparts buoyancy to the device and the inner compartment is filled with a commercial propranolol hydrochloride immediate-release tablet. The device is designed as a round-shaped shell with a central opening of varying size (1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm), which acts as a drug release window. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were used to determine morphological characterization. The in vitro buoyancy and drug release were evaluated using the USP type II dissolution apparatus. All the designed GRFDs exhibit good floating ability and sustained drug release profiles. GRFDs fabricated using PLA filament show maximum buoyancy (&gt;24 h) and sustained drug release for up to 10 h. The floating ability and drug release from the developed devices were governed by the drug release window opening size and the filament material affinity towards the gastric fluid. The designed GRFDs show great prospects in modifying the drug release characteristics and could be applied to any conventional immediate-release product.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15173554", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4386222943", "source": "openalex"}

Gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity after radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer is typically addressed by studying specific single symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore the interplay between domains of patient- reported outcomes (PROs) on GI morbidity, and to what extent these are explained by RT dose to the GI tract.Material and methods. The study included men from two Scandinavian studies (N = 211/277) who had undergone primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for localized prostate cancer to 70–78 Gy (2 Gy/fraction). Factor analysis was applied to previously identified PRO-based symptom domains from two study-specific questionnaires. Number of questions: 43; median time to follow-up: 3.6–6.4 years) and dose-response outcome variables were defined from these domains. Dose/volume parameters of the anal sphincter (AS) or the rectum were tested as predictors for each outcome variable using logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) and model frequency.Results. Outcome variables from Defecation urgency (number of symptoms: 2–3), Fecal leakage (4–6), Mucous (4), and Pain (3–6) were defined. In both cohorts, intermediate rectal doses predicted Defecation urgency (mean Az: 0.53–0.54; Frequency: 70–75%), and near minimum and low AS doses predicted Fecal leakage (mean Az: 0.63–0.67; Frequency: 83–99%). In one cohort, high AS doses predicted Mucous (mean Az: 0.54; Frequency: 96%), whereas in the other, low AS doses and intermediate rectal doses predicted Pain (mean Az: 0.69; Frequency: 28–82%).Conclusion. We have demonstrated that Defecation urgency, Fecal leakage, Mucous, and Pain following primary EBRT for localized prostate cancer primarily are predicted by intermediate rectal doses, low AS doses, high AS doses, or a combination of low AS and intermediate rectal doses, respectively. This suggests that there is a domain-specific dose-response for the GI tract. To reduce risk of GI morbidity, dose distributions of both the AS region and the rectum should, therefore, be considered when prescribing prostate cancer RT.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/0284186x.2015.1063779", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1778245476", "source": "openalex"}

With the increasing availability of iso topes of calcium suitable for clinical studies in human subjects it seems reasonable to consider their use to measure absorption of calcium from the gastro-intestinal tract. We here describe a test in which 47Ca is given by mouth and the faecal radio activity measured without further manipulation of the faeces.

HER2 positivity is defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)3+ or IHC2+/fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)+. The decision problem addressed was the testing of the whole mGC population with IHC and, for IHC2+ patients, also with FISH, followed by treatment of HER2-positive patients with trastuzumab combined with cisplatin and either capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [HCX (trastuzumab, cisplatin, capecitabine)/fluorouracil (F)] compared with current standard NHS therapy. The manufacturer’s submission contained direct evidence from the ToGA trial, a well-conducted, multinational, phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared HCX/F with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine alone [cisplatin, capecitabine (CX)/F]. HCX/F showed statistically significantly better overall survival in the European Medicines Agency-licensed population subgroup (74%) (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.83), corresponding to median survival of 16 months versus 11.8 months. No other evidence exists for the efficacy of any therapy in a known HER2-positive mGC population; other comparisons extrapolate from trials in mixed HER2 status populations. The ERG accepted the manufacturer’s view that a meaningful network meta-analysis to establish a comparison for HCX/F compared with current standard NHS therapy [epirubicin, cisplatin, capecitabine (ECX)/epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine (EOX)/epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF)] was not possible, but was unconvinced by arguments advanced in the alternative narrative synthesis. These involved disregarding evidence from a meta-analysis and interpreting non-significant results of small RCTs comparing epirubicin-containing triplets with cisplatin, 5-FU (CF)/capecitabine (X) doublets as evidence of no difference between triplet and doublet regimens. The high CX/F dose in the ToGA trial was an additional basis for the contention of equivalence. An appropriate de novo economic evaluation, including an economic model that separately compared HCX or trastuzumab, cisplatin, 5-FU (HCF) with the triplet regimens ECX, EOX and ECF, based on a simple, three-state cohort model (progression-free, disease, progression and death), was submitted. Utility weights were applied to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were assessed from an NHS perspective, and incorporated the acquisition and monitoring costs of the alternative regimens, HER2 testing, adverse events and other supportive care costs. An 8-year time horizon was used to represent a lifetime analysis. Results from the ToGA trial were combined with a series of assumptions on relative treatment effects and testing strategies. The manufacturer’s results produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £53,010 per QALY for HCX versus ECX. Although the manufacturer undertook a detailed set of sensitivity analyses, several alternative model assumptions were not evaluated. The ERG undertook a series of alternative base-case analyses. As a result of these analyses, EOX replaced ECX as the appropriate comparator, and the ICER for the comparison of HCX vs EOX increased to between £66,982 and £71,636 per QALY. The impact of implementation of alternative testing strategies remained unclear. There is also considerable uncertainty surrounding the true estimate of effectiveness for the comparison between triplet regimens containing epirubicin (ECX/ECF/EOX) and doublet CX/F regimens. Consequently, the view of the ERG was that there is insufficient evidence on the efficacy of HCX/F compared with current NHS standard therapy for an ICER to be determined with any degree of certainty.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3310/hta15suppl1/04", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978708967", "source": "openalex"}

The present work includes initial phytochemical screening and study of ulcer protective and healing effects of methanolic extract of seeds of P. pinnata (PPSM) in rats. Phytochemical tests indicated the presence of flavonoids in PPSM. PPSM when administered orally (po) showed dose-dependent (12.5-50 mg/kg for 5 days) ulcer protective effects against gastric ulcer induced by 2 h cold restraint stress. Optimal effective dose of PPSM (25 mg/kg) showed antiulcerogenic activity against acute gastric ulcers (GU) induced by pylorus ligation and aspirin and duodenal ulcer induced by cysteamine but not against ethanol-induced GU. It healed chronic gastric ulcer induced by acetic acid when given for 5 and 10 days. Further, its effects were studied on various parameters of gastric offensive acid-pepsin secretion, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO) and defensive mucosal factors like mucin secretion and mucosal cell shedding, glycoproteins, proliferation and antioxidants; catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels. PPSM tended to decrease acid output and increased mucin secretion and mucosal glycoproteins, while it decreased gastric mucosal cell shedding without any effect on cell proliferation. PPSM significantly reversed the increase in gastric mucosal LPO, NO and SOD levels caused by CRS near to the normal level while it tended to increase CAT and GSH level decreased by CRS and ethanol respectively. Thus, the ulcer protective effects of PPSM may be attributed to the presence of flavonoids and the actions may be due to its effects both on mucosal offensive and defensive factors.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2398755780", "source": "openalex"}

In clinical trials, these agents have constantly been demonostrated to be more effective than other acid-suppressant agents such as H2-receptor antagonists in relief of symptoms and healing of oesophagitis, the two main goals of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease treatment. They provide a prompt clinical benefit to most patients and can be safely used in long-term gastro-oesophageal reflux disease management for maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remission, because of their negligible adverse-events profile. Therapeutic protocols vary depending on the severity of symptoms and the degree of oesophageal injury. In patients with mild symptoms and with minimal lesions at endoscopy, a \"step-down\" therapy, in the short-term, is considered the best medical strategy, while in the long-term the therapy \"on-demand\" appears to be a reasonable approach. Patients with non-erosive disease seem to have a lower response rate to proton pump inhibitor treatment. More severe grades of oesophagitis must be treated with full-dose proton pump inhibitors without withdrawal. Data on the treatment of extra-oesophageal manifestations of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are few and controversial. Overall, it appears that patients with extra-oesophageal symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease must be treated with higher doses of pharmacological treatment, principally with proton pump inhibitors, and with longer periods of treatment to achieve complete relief of symptoms, as compared with patients with typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and erosive oesophagitis.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1682138686", "source": "openalex"}

While the numbers of patients with severe comorbidities are rising constantly, gastrointestinal endoscopic interventions are moving closer to minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. The LMA Gastro™ is a new supraglottic airway device, developed specifically for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of LMA Gastro™ in patients with ASA physical status ≥3 undergoing advanced endoscopic procedures. Methods We analyzed data from 214 patients retrospectively who received anesthesia for gastroenterological interventions. Inclusion criteria were upper gastrointestinal endoscopic interventions, airway management with LMA Gastro™ and ASA status ≥3. The primary outcome measure was successful use of LMA Gastro™ for airway management and endoscopic intervention. Results Thirtyone patients with ASA physical status ≥3, undergoing complex and prolonged upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures were included. There were 7 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies, 7 peroral endoscopic myotomies, 5 percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies and 12 other complex procedures (e.g. endoscopic submucosal dissection, esophageal stent placement etc.). Of these, 27 patients were managed successfully using the LMA Gastro™. Placement of the LMA Gastro™ was reported as easy. Positive pressure ventilation was performed without difficulty. The feasibility of the LMA Gastro™ for endoscopic intervention was rated excellent by the endoscopists. In four patients, placement or ventilation with LMA Gastro™ was not possible.

The AXIN1 gene G2063A variation was previously described as a gene mutation but we demonstrate that this is a polymorphism. With these six SNPs loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 11 of 15 (73%) informative tumours. To investigate a possible AXIN1 gene dosage effect in GEJ tumours expressing nuclear β-catenin, AXIN1 locus LOH was determined in 20 tumours expressing membranous and no nuclear β-catenin. LOH was found in 10 of 13 (77%) informative cases. AXIN1 protein immunohistochemistry revealed cytoplasmic expression in all tumours irrespective of the presence of AXIN1 locus LOH. These data indicate that nuclear β-catenin expression is indicative for activated Wnt signalling and that neither AXIN1 gene mutations nor AXIN1 locus LOH are involved in Wnt pathway activation in GEJ adenocarcinomas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjc.6601589", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105626954", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and methods: Two hundred and seventy six patients undergoing a primary tailored anti-reflux procedure between 1986 and 1996 were evaluated. An anti-reflux procedure was selected on the basis of the anatomical and functional findings assessed by means of barium video, endoscopy, manometry and prolonged pH monitoring. The operations performed were Nissen fundoplication (77), total fundoplication gastroplasty (TFG; 140) and Belsey Mark IV (BMIV; 59). The unit policy is for life-long follow-up. The symptoms at review were assessed and graded according to previously published criteria (Orringer MB, Skinner DB, Besley HR. Long-term results of the mark IV operation for hiatal hernia and analyses of recurrences and their treatment. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1972;63:25–31). Patients with recurrent symptoms were fully re-investigated. Results: Mean hospital stay was 8.2 days (5–32 days). There was one hospital death (0.36%). Mean follow-up was 6.7 years (range, 2.2–13.1 years). Overall excellent or good results were achieved in 247 (89.5%) patients (92.2% in Nissen, 90.7% in TFG and 83.1% in BMIV group, P=0.1). In patients without oesophagitis (n=72), the success rate was 93.1%, while for patients with grade IV oesophagitis (n=89) this was 87.6% (P=0.2). Kaplan–Meier freedom from recurrent or new, operation-induced, symptoms at 10 years was 88.1% (89.5% in Nissen, 87.4% in TFG and 73.8% in BMIV groups, P=0.08). Conclusions: These data suggest that where the appropriate anti-reflux procedure is selected, surgery can achieve satisfactory mid- and long-term success rates across the spectrum of GORD. When oesophageal shortening is evident, or merely suspected, we favour a TFG. In the presence of impaired motility and no evidence of oesophageal shortening, a BMIV is the preferred approach.

To better understand the digestive system of these mammals the difference in the gastro‐intestinal transit time of four species of neotropical deer ( Mazama americana , Mazama gouazoubira , Mazama nana , Blastocerus dichotomus ), kept in captivity, was evaluated. Four plants ( Neonotonia wightii , Morus albans , Medicago sativa , Leucaena leucocephala ) were utilized and two variables were measured, mean time of the beginning of the elimination (BE) and mean time of permanence (TP). The results obtained for BE indicated similarity among the deer species, with significant differences between M. gouazoubira (mean=13.62 hr) and M. Americana (mean=19.25 hr). For the plants, the BE was faster with N. wightii and L. leucocephala , and slower for M. sativa . The TP results for B. dichotomus showed longer time when compared to the other species, whereas M. gouazoubira had a lower permanence. Overall, N. wightii had the highest retention time in the digestive tract of all the deer species studied. Associated with this observation, N. wightii had the highest quantity of plant fiber of the plants tested. In a similar fashion M. sativa showed the lowest TP in the digestive tract of the deer and had the lowest quantity of acid detergent fiber. The data from this study showed that, within species, the shape of the excretion curve of the plants was similar when the animals consumed N. wightii or M. sativa. Blastocerus dichotomus and M. gouazoubira had the highest and the lowest gastro‐intestinal transit time, respectively. This suggests that these species characterize different abilities to digest high fiber food, and consequently, represent the two extremities in the morphophysiological adaptation within the deer species evaluated. This information is vital because it is important to know the digestive physiology to define the diet of captive animals, particularly regarding the quantity and quality of fiber.

In this study, alginate-Hylon starch microcapsules with genipin cross-linked chitosan and poly-L-lysine coatings were developed to encapsulate four strains of probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 39392), Bifidobacterium bifidum (ATCC 29521), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469), and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (ATCC 15703). The viability of probiotics was investigated under heat treatment (72, 85, and 90 °C, 0.5 min), simulated gastric juice (along with pepsin, pH = 2, 2 h at 37 °C), and simulated intestinal juice (along with pancreatin and bile salts, pH = 8, 2 h at 37 °C). The morphology and size of microcapsules were measured by scanning electron and optical microscopy. Results of this research demonstrated that, compared with the free form, microencapsulated probiotics had significantly (P < 0.05) higher viability under simulated gastro-intestinal conditions and heat treatment. Microcapsules with genipin cross-linking significantly increased the viability of probiotics compared with non-cross-linked microcapsules. Moreover, genipin did not influence the size of the microcapsules produced using the emulsion technique. In general, this research indicated that the presence of genipin as a cross-linking agent in the structure of hydrocolloids such as chitosan and poly-L-lysine, and also the presence of Hylon (high-amylose starch) as a material resistant to heat and digestive enzymes, not only increased the viability of probiotics in simulated human gastro-intestinal condition but also considerably improved the thermal resistance of microcapsules.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2786599948", "source": "openalex"}

Four subjects were operated on for motility disorders of the esophagus, two for a hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter and two for an epiphrenic diverticulum; six subjects were operated on for oesophageal or gastric carcinomas. Specimens were fixed in phosphate-buffered OsO4, embedded in Epon, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under a Siemens Elmiskop Ia electron microscope. Both the oesophageal and gastric muscle cells, which showed features typical of this cell type, were innervated by multiple varicosities that were rich in synaptic vesicles; these varicosities were generally rarely encountered at distances less than 1000 Å from muscle cells. Only a very few, close neuromuscular junctions were detected. Special cells, which correspond to the \"interstitial cells of Cajal\" as reported by other authors, were discerned at the periphery of muscle cell bundles. These cells were characterized by an elongated cell body with many thin branches and an oval, sometimes indented nucleus. Some pinocytotic vesicles were located at the cell periphery. These cells were surrounded by a discontinuous basal lamina and were seen in close contact with each other and with muscle cells; the close contact areas were often very wide. The cytoplasm contained variable amounts of mitochondria, a well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum and a Golgi complex. As a characteristic feature, bundles of thin filaments were located at the cell periphery and were attached to electron-dense areas of the cell membrane. Morphologically, these filaments resembled myofilaments; they were present in variable amounts and were sometimes very numerous. The observation that the cytoplasmic organelles and filaments varied in number, is probably related to the different functional properties of these cells. Interstitial cells were richly innervated by varicose nerve fibers that were densely packed with synaptic vesicles; many close junctions to nerve endings were also detected. These morphological data lead us to assume that the interstitial cells demonstrated by the electron microscope do not correspond to the cells initially identified by Cajal and cannot even be considered connective tissue cells. We propose that they are specialized smooth muscle cells that are involved in generating spontaneous, myogenic electrical activity in the gastrointestinal tract.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2013.00049", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063110623", "source": "openalex"}

The main purpose is to find out to which extent are specific trends represented in Croatian restaurants.The methodology used is secondary research, desk research, method of analysis and synthesis, comparative method, quantitative research, interview as well as the observation from real life. As part of the quantitative method there is a survey conducted amongst 30 Croatian restaurants; 10 restaurants in continental Croatia and 20 restaurants in the area of coastal Croatia (among the best in 2016). Questions were asked about the extent to which the contemporary gastronomic trends were represented on the menus of selected Croatian restaurants. An interview was conducted with founder and owner of Palatin restaurant in Varazdin.Findings show that Croatian restaurants are aware of new trends in nutrition and culinary area, but the offer of dishes covered by these trends is insufficient.

KELTAE represents the C-terminal hexapeptide of WE-14, and SREWEDS (residue 316 human CgA Lys/Arg substitution) represents the C-terminal heptapeptide of the Intervening Peptide, located between pancreastatin and WE-14. The antisera were employed to study the occurrence of WE-14 and CgA-derived peptides in human and bovine gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) tissues and in a range of human GEP neuroendocrine tumours. Immunocytochemical analyses of normal human and bovine tissues demonstrated that each antiserum immunostained endocrine cells throughout the GEP tract. Variable intensities of immunostaining were detected in neoplastic tissues. Quantitatively, the highest levels of SREWEDS and KELTAE immunoreactivity were detected in pancreatic extracts, with lower levels in gastrointestinal tissues. Elevated levels of each immunoreactant were detected in neoplastic tissues. Chromatographic analysis resolved several SREWEDS-related peptides and a major KELTAE-related peptide that co-eluted with synthetic human WE-14.

We studied the efficacy and predictors for treatment failure of step-down on-demand PPI therapy in patients with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and those with low grade erosive esophagitis. Methods Consecutive symptomatic GERD patients who had positive esophageal pH studies and complete symptom resolution with initial treatment of esomeprazole were given step-down on-demand esomeprazole for 26 weeks. Patients with esophagitis of Los Angeles (LA) grade C or above and recent use of PPI were excluded. Treatment failure was defined as an inadequate relief of reflux symptoms using global symptom assessment. Potential predictors of treatment failure were determined using multivariate analysis. Key Results One hundred and sixty three NERD and 102 esophagitis patients were studied. The 26-week probability of treatment failure was 36.2% (95% CI: 23.9–46.5%) in NERD group and 20.1% (95% CI: 10.9–28.3%) in esophagitis group, respectively (P = 0.021).

Over a period of 42 months, we studied 521 Chinese patients with chest pain and identified 108 patients (20.7%) whose pain was not related to cardiac causes, as determined by exercise ECG or cardiac catheterization. Using 24 h ambulatory pH monitoring and baseline oesophageal manometry, 28.7, 19.4 and 5.6% of these patients were found to have abnormal reflux parameters, abnormal manometric findings or both, respectively. There were significantly more patients complaining of chest pain during the study in the gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) group than in the non‐GERD group (16/31 vs 20/77; P &lt; 0.001). The lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was lower in those with abnormal reflex parameters than in those with normal reflux parameters (12.7±5.4 vs 17.8±5.8 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in symptoms, such as heartburn (54.8 vs 42.9%), regurgitation (38.7 vs 35.1%) and dysphagia (19.4 vs 24.7%), among the two groups. Non‐specific changes were the most frequent baseline motility pattern. In conclusion, atypical chest pain and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are not uncommon in Chinese and this deserves special emphasis as the continuation of anti‐anginal drugs may aggravate their condition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.1996.tb00331.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010765043", "source": "openalex"}

Rates of digesta passage were determined using a simultaneous pulse dose of titanium dioxide (TiO2) mixed in the diet and suspensions of chromiumIIIoxide (Cr2O3) and barium sulphate (BaSO4) in saline, introduced via cannulae to the proximal jejunum and to the terminal ileum, respectively. Faecal recovery of each of the markers was quantified using an one-compartment model from which the transit times (TT) of the markers were derived. The TT of TiO2 represented the passage of digesta over whole gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) whereas the TT of Cr2O3 and BaSO4 represented the TT over the small plus large intestines and over the large intestines, respectively. The TT over the stomach and small intestine were estimated from the TT determined over the whole GIT and over the two sections of the GIT. Besides a control diet (C diet), three diets were offered differing in the contents of non starch polysaccharides (NSP) and water-holding capacity (WHC). A combination of palm kernel expeller and toasted soy bean hulls were included in the diet as NSP sources (NSP diet) and hydrolysed maize starch was included to elevate WHC (WHC diet). The fourth diet had both a high NSP content and a high WHC content (NSP plus WHC diet). The mean transit time (MTT) of the marker passing the whole GIT was on average 75 h and NSP significantly decreased TT over the total GIT and through the large intestines (P < 0.05). In contrast, NSP tended to increase the TT of the stomach contents (P < 0.10). The effects of WHC were smaller and limited to tendencies for a decrease of the TT in the large intestines (P < 0.10) and an increase of the TT in the small intestine (P < 0.10). It is concluded that NSP and to a lesser extent WHC, have opposite effects on digesta passage in the proximal and distal GIT, respectively. The animal model developed in the present study seems a valuable method to test the effect of dietary factors on the passage of digesta.

Previous studies on the cyclic population dynamics of red grouse ( Lagopus lagopus scoticus ) have emphasized the destabilizing effects of either nematode parasites or territorial behaviour and aggression. The potential interacting effects of these processes, mediated through density‐dependent, environmentally induced alterations of host immunocompetence influencing susceptibility to parasites have not been considered. Male red grouse at high density are more aggressive, associated with increased testosterone, which potentially could lead to reduced immunocompetence at a stage when parasites are most prevalent. This could depress individual condition, breeding performance and survival and thus drive or contribute to overall reductions in population size. Here, we characterize the transcriptomic response of grouse to nematode parasite infection and investigate how this is subsequently affected by testosterone, using a microarray approach contrasting red grouse with high and low parasite load at both high and low testosterone titre. A suite of 52 transcripts showed a significant level of up‐regulation to either chronic parasite load or experimental parasite infection. Of these, 51 (98%) showed a reduced level of expression under conditions of high parasite load and high testosterone. The genes up‐regulated by parasites and then down‐regulated at high testosterone titre were not necessarily associated with immune response, as might be intuitively expected. The results are discussed in relation to the fitness and condition of individual red grouse and factors influencing the regulation of abundance in natural populations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2010.04906.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142625060", "source": "openalex"}

Effects of NO on food intake are dependent on feeding status. We sought to determine the effect of NO on gastro-oesophageal vagal afferent activity in the normally fed and food-restricted states and the second messenger pathways mediating these effects. Eight week old female C56BL/6 mice were fed ad libitum or food restricted for 14 h. An in vitro preparation was used to determine the functional effects of NO and the second messenger pathways involved. Expression of NO signal transduction molecules in vagal afferents was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Endogenous NO and the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) inhibited vagal mucosal afferent responses to tactile stimuli in mice fed ad libitum. After a 14 h fast endogenous NO and SNAP potentiated tension and mucosal afferent responses to mechanical stimulation. The excitatory effect of NO was blocked by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor apocynin. After a 14 h fast expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) mRNA in whole nodose ganglia was significantly reduced and the excitatory effect of NO on gastro-oesophageal vagal afferents was lost.

We present a protocol for an international consensus study to develop a standardised set of outcomes and measurement tools – a 'core outcome set' (COS) – to be used by all future trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer. The GASTROS study aims to standardise the reporting of outcomes in gastric cancer surgery trials through an international consensus process of key stakeholders including health care professionals and patients.

Stage 2 will comprise an eDelphi survey which will consider the views of patients, nurse specialists and surgeons to prioritise the most important outcomes. A meeting of stakeholder representatives will ratify the COS. Stage 3 will focus on identifying appropriate instruments to measure the prioritised outcomes by means of quality assessment of available measurement instruments and stakeholder consultation. This study aims to standardise the reporting of outcomes in future trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer.

This allowed us to delineate more accurately the patient population that is likely to respond to long‐term continuous treatment with low or standard dose cisapride. The analysis revealed that symptom severity may be more useful than endoscopic severity in predicting relapse or in guiding therapy. Reflux oesophagitis outcome is particularly poor in the presence of treatment‐recalcitrant symptoms or severe mucosal damage.

A number of natural products have been identified as countering various forms of cancer with fewer side effects. The potential impact of vitamins and minerals on long-term health, cognition, healthy development, bone formation, and aging has been supported by experimental and epidemiological studies. Successful treatment may thus be highly influenced by the nutritional status of patients. An insufficient diet could lead to detrimental effects on immune status and tolerance to treatment, affecting the ability of chemotherapy to destroy cancerous cells. In recent decades, most cancer patients have been taking vitamins and minerals to improve standard therapy and/or to decrease the undesirable side effects of the treatment together with the underlying disease. On the other hand, taking dietary supplements during cancer therapy may affect the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Thus, micronutrients in complementary oncology must be selected appropriately and should be taken at the right time. Here, the potential impact of micronutrients on gastro-intestinal and hepatic cancers is explored and their molecular targets are laid down.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158014", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3186043979", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Patients with proven GORD were randomized to laparoscopic Nissen or 180° anterior fundoplication. The 12-year outcome measures included reflux control, dysphagia, gas-related symptoms and patient satisfaction. Measures included scores on a visual analogue scale, a validated Dakkak score for dysphagia and Visick scores. Results Of the initial 163 patients randomized (Nissen 84, anterior 79), 90 (55·2 per cent) completed 12-year follow-up (Nissen 52, anterior 38).

Its metabolites could also be involved in these effects. Potentially bioactive lycopene metabolites namely apo-10′-lycopenol, apo-10′-lycopenal, apo-14′-lycopenol, apo-14′-lycopenal, and apo-11-lycopenoids with alcohol, carboxylic acid, aldehyde and ethyl ester terminal groups were obtained by organic synthesis as (all-E) stereoisomers using HWE condensation reactions. The ability of (all-E)-lycopene and the synthesized apo-lycopenoids to inhibit lipid peroxidation was tested in a chemical model of postprandial oxidative stress in the gastric compartment. Oxidative stress was generated by metmyoglobin, the main form of dietary iron (from red meat), which is able to catalyse the peroxidation of linoleic acid under mildly acidic conditions. In this model, apo-6′-lycopenal and apo-8′-lycopenal were better inhibitors of lipid peroxidation than (all-E)-lycopene itself. For the apo-lycopenoids, a long unsaturated chain and a terminal carboxylic acid group both favour the antioxidant activity. The short-chain apo-lycopenoic acid, apo-14′-lycopenoic acid, was shown to behave like a hydrophilic antioxidant, i.e. by reducing hypervalent iron forms of metmyoglobin. Thus, besides the polyene chain length, the terminal group of the apo-lycopenoids is expected to deeply influence the lipophilic/hydrophilic balance of the molecule (and consequently its distribution between the aqueous and lipid phases) and its affinity for the heme cavity. It can thus be concluded that the polyene chain length and terminal group are two important parameters modulating the mechanism by which apo-lycopenoids express their antioxidant activity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1039/c1nj20437h", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071221883", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical significance of tissue expression and serum concentration of TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-7 and TLR-9 in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Material and Methods. The study group consisted of 97 individuals: 32 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 27 with gastro-esophageal junction cancer, and 38 ageand gender-matched controls. The mRNA expression and protein concentration of TLRs in tissues and sera were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests.Results. In esophageal cancer patients, mRNA expressions of TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-7, and protein concentrations of all TLRs were significantly higher in tumor than in control tissue (p < 0.05). In esophageal cancer patients with lymph node metastasis, a tendency toward higher protein concentrations of tumor TLR-4 was observed. In gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma subgroup, only the mRNA expression of TLR-7 and protein concentrations of TLR-4, TLR-7 and TLR-9 were significantly higher in tumors than in normal mucosa (p < 0.05). Protein concentration of TLR-9 was significantly higher in tumors of gastro-esophageal junction cancer with lymph node metastasis and depth of tumor invasion. Diagnostic potential of serum TLR-4 as a marker of gastro-esophageal junction cancer presence was reported.Conclusion.

Acid and bile reflux was produced by introducing a side-to-side esophago-gastro-jejunostomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. Endoscopic examination of the distal esophagus was performed in 24 surgically altered and 4 control rats, between weeks 24 and 36 after the operation in 4-week intervals, and all rats were biopsied and sacrificed at 36 weeks. Endoscopic images were classified based on the surface mucosal patterns of the distal esophagus and then compared with histology. The endoscopic appearance was classified as: (i) normal, characterized by a smooth surface; (ii) intestinal metaplasia, defined as elevated plaques/ridges, deep grooves, and thin linear folds; (iii) dysplasia, indicated by coarse folds/grooves, meshlike villi, and foveolar appearance; and (iv) carcinoma, suggested by irregular-shaped mass lesions with ulcerations. The endoscopic criteria for intestinal metaplasia yielded a sensitivity of 100% in comparison with histology. Intestinal metaplasia with high-grade dysplasia was found in two rats and with low-grade dysplasia in three rats.

The seeds of N. sativa have been widely used in the treatment of different diseases and ailments. In Islamic literature, it is considered as one of the greatest forms of healing medicine. It has been recommended for using on regular basis in Tibb-e-Nabwi (Prophetic Medicine). It has been widely used as antihypertensive, liver tonics, diuretics, digestive, anti-diarrheal, appetite stimulant, analgesics, anti-bacterial and in skin disorders. Extensive studies on N. sativa have been carried out by various researchers and a wide spectrum of its pharmacological actions have been explored which may include antidiabetic, anticancer, immunomodulator, analgesic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, bronchodilator, hepato-protective, renal protective, gastro-protective, antioxidant properties, etc. Due to its miraculous power of healing, N. sativa has got the place among the top ranked evidence based herbal medicines.

It is still an expensive, invasive tool, has poor compliance and not routinely available in every hospitals in Nepal. This study was undertaken to establish the role of portal vein diameter and spleen size by ultrasonography in predicting gastro-esophageal varices.Method: One hundred and fifty patients with clinical features, laboratory and sonological findings suggestive of cirrhosis of liver and endoscopic evidence of portal hypertension were included in the study. Ultrasonography assessments of portal vein diameter and spleen size alongside endoscopy for detection of varices were done.Result: Average portal vein diameter of patients without gastro-esophageal varices was 10.800 ± 1.1402 mm, while it was 13.731 ± 1.061mm in patients with varices(p&lt;0.001). Average spleen size of patients without varices was 12.67 ± 2.35 cm and with varices was 15.367 ± 1.210 cm (p &lt; 0.001). There was 92.72 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity for prediction for presence of esophageal varices when the cutoff value for portal vein diameter was 12.25 mm. There was 94.5 % sensitivity and 75 % specificity for prediction for presence of esophageal varices when the cutoff value for spleen size was 13.9 cm.Conclusion: Ultrasonography of portal vein diameter and spleen size is a reliable non invasive tool in predicting the presence of gastro-esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis. With increase in portal vein diameter and spleen size, risk of formation of gastro-esophageal varices also increases and positive correlations exist between them.

This study aims to define the clinical role of oesophageal bilirubin monitoring in reflux patients with an intact stomach. Methods: In total, 113 consecutive patients with reflux symptoms were prospectively studied using combined ambulatory oesophageal pH and bilirubin monitoring. Patients were categorized as follows: no pathological reflux, isolated acid reflux, isolated bilirubin reflux, combined acid and bilirubin reflux. Results: Thirty-eight patients (33%) had no pathological reflux, 49 patients (44%) had combined pathological acid and bilirubin reflux, and 17 patients (15%) had isolated pathological acid reflux. Only nine patients (8%) had isolated pathological bilirubin reflux. In these nine, the extent of pathological bilirubin reflux was small (median total bilirubin exposure time 12.2%, range 6.5%-20.7%) and mucosal damage was minimal (five had grade 1 oesophagitis, four had a normal oesophagus). In one patient, symptoms were temporally related to acid reflux, and in none were symptoms temporally related to bilirubin reflux. Conclusions: Isolated oesophageal bilirubin reflux in patients with an intact stomach is uncommon.

Methods Forty gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients [non‐erosive reflux disease (NERD): 15, EO: 25] were included, after 7 days off antisuppressive drugs. EO patients were randomized to 20‐mg rabeprazole once daily for either 4 or 8 weeks with baseline and follow‐up endoscopy with distal oesophageal biopsies. T lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry. DNA adducts were measured by analysis of 8‐oxo‐deoxyguanosine levels. Results Erosive oesophagitis patients had more T lymphocytes and CD8 + T lymphocytes in squamous epithelium than NERD patients ( P = 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Levels of DNA adducts between both groups were, however, not different ( P = 0.99). Four‐ and eight‐week rabeprazole treatment in EO patients resulted in a significant decrease in number of T lymphocytes and CD8 + T lymphocytes (all P &lt; 0.05).

Therefore, hyperphosphataemia is a widely recognized risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [1]. Despite the introduction in the market of new P-binders, such as sevelamer hydrochloride and lanthanum carbonate, the control of hyperphosphataemia in haemodialysis (HD) patients remains difficult because of adverse effects such as constipation and faecal impaction, drug compliance and metal accumulation. We here report an interesting observation that serum P levels can be reduced by modifying the intestinal flora with probiotic administration. This may suggest a new potential approach to better control hyperphosphataemia in HD patients. In patients receiving HD, intestinal aerobic bacteria, such as enterobacteria and enterococci, occur in numbers ∼100 times higher than those in healthy subjects. These aerobes produce putrefactive substances [2]. Oral administration of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria for 4 weeks can restore the composition of disturbed microflora characterized by overgrowth of aerobes and decreased levels of serum uraemic toxins, including indicant, in HD patients [2]. When administered orally, Bifidobacteria cannot survive exposure to gastric juice before they reach the intestine. In order to enable Bifidobacteria to reach the intestine, a colony-forming unit of Bifidobacterium longum JBL01, a strain of human Bifidobacteria, measuring 2.0 × 109, combined with 0.11 g of oligosaccharides (lactulose and raffinose) as a stimulant to bacteria proliferation, were encapsulated in a gastro-resistant seamless capsule (B capsule, MorishitaJintan Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan). Bifidobacteria can survive in this gastro-resistant capsule even in a solution of 1.2 pH at 37°C for 120 min. In contrast, Bifidobacteria without the capsule (a powder formulation) cannot be detected immediately after mixing with the solution [3]. Moreover, significant decreases in serum levels of indoxyl sulphate and homocysteine were observed by oral administration of B. longum in the gastro-resistant capsule, but not by the administration of B. longum without the capsule in HD patients [4]. Thus, to improve the composition of disturbed microflora and alleviate faecal impaction, B capsules containing B. longum JBL01 were administered orally once daily for 4 weeks in 15 patients receiving HD [age: 62.2 ± 9.8 years; 10 males, 5 females; 5 diabetes mellitus (DM), 10 non-DM; HD duration: 9.3 ± 7.0 years; serum albumin levels: 3.9 ± 0.3 g/dL; serum corrected calcium (Ca) levels: 9.1 ± 0.8 mg/dL; serum P levels: 6.7 ± 0.6 mg/dL; serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels: 363 ± 221 pg/mL]. Results were compared with those of 16 HD patients who did not receive B capsules as a control group (age:58.1 ± 15.6 years; 10 males, 6 females; 3 DM, 13 non-DM; HD duration: 9.1 ± 6.8 years; serum albumin levels: 3.8 ± 0.3 g/dL; serum-corrected Ca levels: 9.0 ± 0.9 mg/dL; serum P levels: 7.0 ± 0.8 mg/dL; serum intact PTH levels: 219 ± 124 pg/mL). No patient had undergone treatment with B. longum preparations before participating in this study. The dose of drugs affecting P metabolism were fixed through the study period in the control group (Ca carbonate: 2.79 ± 1.44 g, n= 14; sevelamer hydrochloride: 3.20 ± 2.94 g, n= 5; calcitriol injection: 1.67 ± 0.24 μg/week, n= 3; maxacalcitol: 15.0 ± 4.1 μg/week, n= 3; oral alfacalcidol: 0.5 μg, n= 2, oral calcitriol: 0.38 μg, n= 2) and in the B capsule-treated group (Ca carbonate: 2.50 ± 0.71 g, n= 12; sevelamer hydrochloride: 3.75 ± 0.53 g, n= 4; calcitriol injection: 2.75 μg/week, n= 2; maxacalcitol: 12.5 ± 8.5 μg/week, n= 4; oral alfacalcidol: 0.25 ± 0 μg, n= 3, oral calcitriol: 0.25 μg, n= 1). No patients received lanthanum carbonate or cinacalcet hydrochloride in either group. All data are expressed as mean ± SD or without SD in n= 1 or 2. Oral administration of B capsules for 4 weeks had no significant effect on defecation frequency or faecal hardness determined by the Bristol stool form scale (data not shown). The explanation for this result may be related to the low incidence of obstinate constipation from the beginning in this study (mean defecation frequency: 0.9/day). Serum P levels unexpectedly decreased significantly in the second and fourth weeks due to oral administration of the B capsule (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Serum P levels remained unchanged in the control group. Subsequently, serum P levels returned to original levels 2 weeks after the completion of oral treatment. No significant changes were found in other serum parameters in the B capsule-treated group compared with baseline data and with the control group (data not shown). Fig. 1. Effect of once-daily oral administration of encapsulated B. longum JBL01 with oligosaccharides (B capsule) for 4 weeks on serum P levels in patients on haemodialysis. Open circle: untreated control group (n= 16); filled circle: B capsule-treated group ... The main mechanism for a decrease in serum P levels during B capsule treatment is its ability to lower intestinal pH levels. In the faeces of HD patients, pH levels and ammonia concentrations are elevated due to bacteria-mediated hydrolysis of urea [4]. High levels of ammonia are responsible for elevated pH in faeces and lead to overgrowth of aerobic and putrefactive bacteria. Bifidobacteria can ferment carbohydrates to produce acetic acid and lactic acid, resulting in acidification of the intestinal lumen [4]. Low pH levels in the intestinal milieu inhibit the growth of aerobic and putrefactive bacteria, thus normalizing the intestinal flora. In another study, the administration of B. longum decreased faecal pH levels, and pretreatment levels were restored 1 week after the completion of treatment [5]. Decreased intestinal pH levels due to B capsule treatment may increase the ionization of intestinal Ca. Ca2+ binds with intestinal P ions as an intrinsic P binder. In this study, increased intestinal Ca2+ did not lead to elevated serum Ca levels. Ca2+ may be immediately used in the formation of calcium phosphate in the intestine, and thus not absorbed. Further studies measuring faecal pH, P and Ca excretions will examine this as a possible mechanism in B capsule-treated patients. In this study, although the number of faecal bacteria was not determined during B capsule treatment, the decrease in serum P levels cannot be due to increased uptake of P into the intestinal B. longum for their proliferation. Because feeding of B. longum increases their number, but does not affect the total number of bacteria through a reduction in aerobes in the faeces of healthy subjects [5]. In addition, increased faecal volume and water content are not responsible for low serum P levels, as evidenced by unchanged defecation frequency and faecal hardness among the patients in the present study. It is increasingly recognized that uraemic toxins originating from intestinal microbial metabolism may contribute to the deterioration of renal function, cardiovascular calcification, metabolic bone disease and mortality in CKD/HD patients [6, 7]. The administration of Bifidobacteria can decrease the serum concentrations of indoxyl sulphate and P-cresol in HD patients [4, 7]. In addition, Bifidobacteria produce vitamin B12 and folate, which can normalize serum homocysteine levels in HD patients [3]. This is an important property since most HD patients show hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although further investigation is clearly required to clarify the mechanism for the P-reducing effect of the B capsule, Bifidobacteria preparation is a simple and safe treatment for persistent hyperphosphataemia in patients receiving HD. Further studies may identify additional potential benefits of probiotic treatments in CKD/HD patients [6, 7].", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfs072", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2323889680", "source": "openalex"}

Measurement by two methodologies", "text": "Background: An association between cow’s milk hypersensitivity (CMH) and gastro–oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in childhood has been reported in the past decade. Aim: To assess whether biopsies from the upper gastrointestinal tract of children with cow’s milk sensitive GERD have a specific allergic inflammatory pattern, and to compare two different techniques for measuring inflammatory cells in gastrointestinal biopsies. Methods: GERD was diagnosed by means of endoscopy and oesophageal pH monitoring. Hypersensitivity to cow’s milk was determined by an elimination diet and cow’s milk challenge. Allergic inflammatory cells in upper gastrointestinal biopsies were identified by immunohistochemistry and their numbers were assessed by two different methods—counting the number of cells/high power field and using the computerised Cast-Grid system. Results: Cow’s milk sensitive GERD was identified in 10 of 17 children with severe GERD (median age, 7.8 years). Biopsies from children with endoscopic oesophagitis had significantly increased numbers of mast cells and T cells. No differences in the number of eosinophils, mast cells, or T cells were found between children with CMH and those with primary GERD. Several differences were found between the two different histological quantification methods. Conclusions: CMH was found not only in infants but also in school age children with GERD. Histology did not identify the cow’s milk sensitive GERD subgroup. The computerised histological method provides a more complete evaluation based upon total biopsy area, and helped to limit the bias of uneven biopsy size.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/jcp.2004.024513", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023311116", "source": "openalex"}

The roles of environmental, dietary, and host physiological factors are well established. However, the plausible role of Helicobacter pylori infection in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is still controversial. Furthermore, the role of host genetic factors remains unidentified. Extensive PubMed review of the previous literature has revealed that H. pylori may be negatively associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Ethnic or inter-individual variations in response to H. pylori infection may also determine disease outcome. Thus, host genetic factors may play an important role in deciding the final outcome of disease. Limited studies have shown that homEM ofCYP2C19, b allele (val105) ofGSTP1, T allele of IL1B-31, 2/2 genotype of IL1RN +2018, 2/2 genotype of IL-10-1082, A/A genotype of CCND1 G870A, and homozygous variant of XPC PAT gene are potential risk factors for the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or its complications such as Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Nine primary E/GEJ adenocarcinoma xenograft lines were further characterized for the spectrum and stability of gene/protein expression over passages. Seven primary esophageal adenocarcinoma xenograft lines were treated with individual or combination chemotherapy. Tumors that were implanted (n=55) in NOD/SCID mice had features suggestive of more aggressive biology than tumors that were never implanted (n=32). Of those implanted, 21/55 engrafted; engraftment was associated with poorly differentiated tumors (p=0.04) and older patients (p=0.01). Expression of immunohistochemical markers were similar between patient sample and corresponding xenograft. mRNA differences observed between patient tumors and first passage xenografts were largely due to loss of human stroma in xenografts. mRNA patterns of early vs late passage xenografts and of small vs large tumors of the same passage were similar. Complete resistance was present in 2/7 xenografts while the remaining tumors showed varying degrees of sensitivity, that remained constant across passages. Because of their ability to recapitulate primary tumor characteristics during engraftment and across serial passaging, PTXGs can be useful clinical systems for assessment of drug sensitivity of human E/GEJ cancers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121872", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2082318502", "source": "openalex"}

Method: In this retrospective cohort study, we identified out‐patients prescribed clozapine and other atypical antipsychotics (AAP) and compared times and rates of prescribing of acid‐suppressant therapy. Odds ratios were calculated. Results: Of 352 patients on clozapine and 358 patients on other AAP, there were 74 (21.0%) and 23 (6.7%) patients prescribed acid‐suppressant therapy respectively [OR = 3.9 (95% CI: 2.4–6.4) P ≤ 0.0001]. In 67 of 74 cases (90.5%) vs. 18 of 23 cases (81.8%), acid‐suppressant therapy began after the start of the antipsychotic. Clozapine patients were more likely to be prescribed acid‐suppressant therapy within the first 5 years of initiation than those on other AAP ( P = 0.039). Where indication for acid‐suppressant therapy was known, it was prescribed for GORD in 44 of 62 (71.0%) of the clozapine patients and 6 of 13 (46.2%) of those on other AAP ( P = 0.109).

Microbiological and epidemiological aspects", "text": "SummaryThis study, which is the first one documenting rotavirus (RV) diarrhoea in Asian infants in South Africa, describes the virological and epidemiological aspects of this disease in this population. Fifty-five per cent of 1142 hospitalized cases investigated over a 31-month period showed a positive stool ELISA for RV. Most of these children stopped shedding RV by days 4–6 of hospital admission, though prolonged excretion was recorded in some acute cases for up to 13 days. Mixed RV-bacterial infections occurred in 7% of the total gastro-enteritis (GE) patients, while 8.6% had pure bacterial gastro-enteritis. Sixteen per cent of 188 GE patients had serum anti-RV complement-fixing (CF) antibodies on admission. Rotavirus diarrhoea occurred in half of the seropositive infants. Seroconversion occurred in only two-thirds of the initially seronegative children who had RV diarrhoea. In 5.6% of the RV diarrhoea patients the infection was acquired nosocomially whilst in hospital for other illnesses. The age-groups mainly affected were between 3 and 14 months, with a peak at 9–11 months; 3% of the RVGE patients were neonates. Both the RVGE and the total GE admissions showed well-marked winter peaks, with an inverse relationship between RV prevalence and both temperature and humidity. It is concluded that RV is the most important cause of infantile GE in this population, whereas pure bacterial infections play a relatively minor role. Circulating anti-RV antibodies do not necessarily afford protection against RV diarrhea, probably owing to serotypic differences.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02724936.1990.11747425", "url": "https://openalex.org/W201932835", "source": "openalex"}

This retrospective study examines the association of preneoplastic conditions and inflammation of the gastric mucosa with GOJ cancer at different locations and compares them with nonjunctional gastric cancers. Patients and methods A total of 520 patients with junctional and nonjunctional gastric cancer were assessed for the presence and degree of intestinal metaplasia, glandular atrophy and inflammation in the stomach. Histopathological data were complete for 428 patients (68.9% men, median age 67.7 years), including 172 patients with GOJ cancer (GOJ1: 1–5 cm proximal to the junction, GOJ2: 'true' junctional, GOJ3: 2–5 cm distal to the junction). Gastric inflammation and preneoplastic conditions were scored according to the updated Sydney classification and further stratified into respective operative link on gastritis assessment (OLGA) and operative link on gastritis assessment on intestinal metaplasia (OLGIM) stages. Results The prevalence and degree of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were significantly lower in GOJ1 than GOJ3 (P<0.01). Preneoplastic conditions in the stomach were similar in GOJ3 compared with nonjunctional gastric cancer. GOJ1 were almost exclusively (98.4%) of the intestinal type, whereas GOJ2 and GOJ3 were the diffuse type in 22.6 and 22.4% of the patients (P<0.001).

These include endoscopic plicators, which place submucosal or transmural sutures around the lower oesophageal sphincter, the Stretta procedure, which places minute areas of thermal injury in the muscle of the lower oesophageal sphincter and cardia, and injection techniques, in which inert substances are injected into the mucosa or the muscle of the lower oesophagus. The mechanism of action of these procedures has been studied to varying degrees. The Stretta procedure is the only endoscopic technique that has been shown to be effective in a sham‐controlled trial. Complication rates are generally low, but serious complications have been reported in some cases. The results with some of these techniques are promising, but all procedures described to date are limited by the absence of large, rigorously controlled trials against a form of treatment that has been proven to be both safe and effective (medical therapy).

There is some understanding of the forces responsible for determining the frequency of colicin production in E. coli populations; however, this understanding cannot explain all of the observed variation. A survey of colicin production in E. coli isolated from native Australian mammals revealed that the frequency of colicin production in strains isolated from carnivores was significantly lower than the frequency of production in strains recovered from herbivores or omnivores. The intestine of Australian carnivores is tube-like and gut turnover rates are rapid compared with the turnover rates of the intestinal tracts of herbivores and omnivores, all of which possess a hindgut fermentation chamber. A mathematical model was developed in order to determine if variation in gut turnover rates could determine if a host was more likely to harbour a colicin-producing strain or a non-producer. The model predicted that a colicin producer was more likely to dominate in the gut of a host with lower gut turnover rates, and a non-producer to dominate in hosts with rapid gut turnover rates.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2007/007120-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2104592444", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, the aim of study was to develop a novel oral drug delivery system with minimum gastric effects and improved dissolution rate for aceclofenac (ACF), a model BCS class-II drug. Methods: Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) were formulated to increase the solubility and ultimately the oral bioavailability of ACF. Oleic acid was used as an oil phase, Tween 80 (T80) and Kolliphor EL (KEL) were used as surfactants, whereas, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and propylene glycol (PG) were employed as co-surfactants. Optimized formulations (F1, F2, F3 and F4) were analyzed for droplet size, poly dispersity index (PDI), cell viability studies, in vitro dissolution in both simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid, ex vivo permeation studies and thermodynamic stability. Results: The optimized formulations showed mean droplet sizes in the range of 111.3 ± 3.2 nm and 470.9 ± 12.52 nm, PDI from 244.6 nm to 389.4 ± 6.51 and zeta-potential from − 33 ± 4.86 mV to − 38.5 ± 5.15 mV. Cell viability studies support the safety profile of all formulations for oral administration. The in vitro dissolution studies and ex vivo permeation analysis revealed significantly improved drug release ranging from 95.68 ± 0.02% to 98.15 ± 0.71% when compared with control. The thermodynamic stability studies confirmed that all formulations remain active and stable for a longer period.

A plausible mechanism by which the infection might protect against reflux disease is by its propensity to produce atrophic gastritis and consequently reduce gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid is a key factor in the pathophysiology of reflux oesophagitis. It is well recognised that acid secretion decreases with age in H. pylori infected populations whereas acid secretion is maintained throughout life in H. pylori negative populations. The tendency for H. pylori infection to induce atrophy and reduce acid secretion is more marked in Eastern Europe and the Far East than in Western Europe, and this may be due to the influence of environmental and host genetic co‐factors. This difference may also explain why the negative association between H. pylori infection and reflux disease is more marked in these areas than in Western Europe. If H. pylori infection is indeed protecting against reflux disease, then one would predict a rise in incidence of this disease and its malignant complications in these Eastern countries as the incidence of H. pylori infection decreases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02227.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2052099491", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the new gold standard oesophageal impedance monitoring, pH monitoring is still used frequently for detection of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). Besides drops in pH from above to below pH4, drops of ≥1 unit are also used as a marker for GOR. In this study the objective was to investigate the accuracy of drops in pH for detection of GOR, using impedance monitoring as the gold standard. Material and methods. Nineteen GORD patients (9 M, 55±11 years) underwent combined 24-h pH-impedance recording off acid-suppressive therapy. All drops in pH ≥0.5 pH units, with a duration ≥4 s, reaching the nadir pH within 5 s after onset were included. Reflux events detected with impedance monitoring were taken as the reference. Results. In total, 2221 drops in pH were found; 47% were acid (nadir pH <4), 47% weakly acidic (nadir pH between pH7 and 4) and 5% were superimposed (pH drop starting below pH4). The sensitivities of acid, weakly acidic and superimposed pH drops ≥1 were 91%, 28%, 24%, respectively, and the percentages of false-positive reflux episodes were 20, 56 and 54, respectively.

In contrast, weakly acidic and superimposed reflux showed greater false-positive than true-positive percentages for all cut-off values. Conclusions. Compared to impedance monitoring, detection of reflux with pH monitoring is clearly inferior.

Additionally, 5 of the 6 patients detected with intestinal metaplasia (IM) at the cardia (83%) and 9 of the 12 patients with IM of the antrum (75%) had elevated BRI.Bile reflux gastropathy is present in a significant proportion of patients with GERD and associated with disease severity. The elevated BRI in such patients highlights the role of duodeno-gastro-esophageal reflux as an additional factor in the pathogenesis of GERD.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1955724009", "source": "openalex"}

A multicenter perspective cross-over study was conducted in formula-fed infants with persisting regurgitation, randomly assigned to receive two weeks of a magnesium-alginate-based formulation followed by two weeks of thickened formula, or vice-versa. Infants, exclusively breast-fed, were followed up for two weeks while receiving magnesium alginate. Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were evaluated through the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire Revised (I-GERQ-R). Direct cost of treatments was also calculated. Seventy-two infants completed the study. We found a significant reduction of I-GERQ-R scores over time (F = 55.387; p &lt; 0.001) in all groups with no difference between the sequences of administration (F = 0.268; p = 0.848) in formula-fed infants and between exclusively breast-fed and formula-fed infants receiving magnesium alginate (t = 1.55; p = 0.126). The mean cost savings per infant was € 4.60 (±11.2) in formula-fed infants treated with magnesium alginate compared to thickened formula (t = 2.91, p &lt; 0.0005). Conclusions were that the magnesium-alginate formulation reduces GER symptoms both in formula-fed and breast-fed infants.

Absorption from the region between the infusion sites was measured from the change in urinary excretion and apparent absorption caused by changing the site of infusion. Absorption was greater from a ruminal than from a comparable duodenal infusion. There was evidence, however, that the absorption mechanism within the stomach area was becoming saturated at the higher infusion rates in that the relationship between the amount absorbed and infused was curvilinear. The proportion of infused Mg which was absorbed from the stomach area fell from 0·61 to 0·14 as the infusion rate increased from 0·44 to 2·80 g/day. The main site of absorption within the stomach area was the rumen; a small amount was absorbed from the omasum, but none from the abomasum. Positive differences between omasal and duodenal infusions were seen in plasma concentration at the two lowest and in urinary excretion at all infusion rates. Increasing the amount of Mg infused into the duodenum caused an increase in plasma concentration and a linear increase in absorption.

This is a common physiological, self-limiting condition in healthy infants with a prevalence peaking at 3–4 months of age, occurring more than once a day in 50% of healthy infants. As infants achieve upright posture with neurodevelopment maturation and acquire a more solid diet with age, symptoms usually improve by 6 months old with resolution by 12–14 months old.1 Transient inappropriate relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter and delayed gastric emptying are common mechanisms leading to GOR. This is further exaggerated in preterm infants who have shorter and immature oesophagus with non-peristaltic motility. ### How is gastro-oesophageal reflux disease diagnosed? With increasingly frequency and severity, GOR becomes pathological. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is defined as ‘reflux of gastric contents causing troublesome symptoms or complications or both’ by the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.2 Rather than distinct entities, GOR and GORD are commonly seen as a continuum and non-invasive distinction of GOR and GORD is difficult. The term ‘troublesome symptoms’ in infants is vague due to the non-specific and pervasive nature of GOR symptoms. The lack of gold-standard objective measures and reliance on symptom reporting by caregiver complicate the diagnostic process. Diagnosis is usually inferred when infants display frequent reflux episodes with clear association between symptoms and reflux without an alternate diagnosis.

Salsalate seems to resorb faster than the enteric-coated forms but more slowly than the soluble forms of acetylsalicylate. However, in comparison with these latter forms, salsalate activity is more protracted. In the second part of the study, 42 patients were admitted to a trial in which 3 to 5 g of salsalate was given daily and in which serum salicylate levels and blood loss in stools were measured using the method of labelling red blood cells with Cr. The ideal dosage to obtain a serum salicylate level of 20 mg/100 ml seems to lie between 3 and 4 g of salsalate a day.

The patients were assessed for symptoms of GERD using a Severity symptom score (SS) questionnaire and anti-reflux medications.Of the ten patients, five patients had GERD preoperatively. At the mean follow-up of 11.70 ± 6.07 months after surgery, four patients (80%) showed complete resolution while one patient complained of persistence of symptoms. Endoscopy in this patient revealed resolution of esophagitis indicating that the persistent symptoms were not attributable to reflux. The other five patients without GERD remained free of any symptom attributable to GERD. Thus, in all ten patients, repair of hiatal hernia (HH) during LSG led to either resolution of GERD or prevented any new onset symptom related to GER.In morbidly obese patients with HH with or without GERD undergoing LSG, repair of the hiatus hernia helps in amelioration of GERD and prevents any new onset GER.

INTEGRATE IIa was designed to examine if Rego improves overall survival (OS). Methods: Double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 trial comparing Rego + best supportive care (BSC) vs PBO + BSC using 2:1 randomisation, stratified by tumour location (GO junction vs gastric), geographic region (Asia vs rest of world), prior VEGF inhibitors (Y/N). Eligibility criteria: histologically/cytologically confirmed AGOC, evaluable metastatic/locally advanced disease, failure/intolerance of ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy with a platinum agent + fluoropyrimidine. Primary objective: OS in the whole study population. OS among Asian sub-population is a key secondary objective. Target of at least 221 events from 250 patients provides 80% power to detect an OS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67. Pooled OS analysis incorporating INTEGRATE phase 2 data is also planned. Secondary endpoints include PFS, objective response rate, safety and quality of life. Results: 251 patients enrolled (Oct16 - Sep21) from 5 countries:157 from Asia (Korea, Taiwan, Japan);169 Rego and 82 PBO. After 238 events, median OS (in months) for Rego vs PBO was 4.5 vs 4.0 (HR 0.70 [95%CI: 0.53 to 0.92]; p = 0.011) in the whole study population, with a 12 mo survival of 19% vs 6%. Median PFS was 1.8 v 1.6 (HR = 0.52; [95%CI: 0.40-0.69]; p = &lt; .0001). After pre-planned adjustment for multiplicity, there were no statistically significant differences across regions (Asia versus non-Asia) or other pre-specified subgroups.

However, the subsequent exposure of the gut microbiota to florfenicol is not well described. Hence, the effect of various administration protocols on both plasma and gastro-intestinal florfenicol concentrations in pigs was evaluated. In field situations were simulated by application of different administration routes and dosages (single oral bolus at 10 or 5 mg/kg body weight (BW), medicated feed at 10 or 5 mg/kg BW and intramuscular injections at 15 or 30 mg/kg BW). After intramuscular administration of 30 mg florfenicol/kg BW, gastro-intestinal concentrations of florfenicol, quantified 10 h after the last administration, were significantly elevated in comparison with the other treatment groups and ranging between 31.5 - 285.8 µg/g over the different gut segments. For the other treatment groups, the influence of dose and administration route was not significantly different. Bacteriological analysis of the faecal samples from the animals at the start of the experiment, demonstrated the presence of both florfenicol susceptible (with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 2-16 µg/mL) and florfenicol resistant (MIC ≥256 µg/mL) Escherichia coli isolates in all treatment groups. Following, at 10 h after the last administration the susceptible Escherichia coli population was eradicated in all treatment groups due to the high intestinal florfenicol concentrations measured. Moreover, selection of the resistant Escherichia coli strains during treatment occurred in all groups. This is likely related to the fact that the different treatment strategies led to high gastro-intestinal concentrations albeit not reaching the high magnitude of MIC values associated with florfenicol resistance (≥256 µg/mL). Conclusively, in our experimental setup the administration route and dose alterations studied, had no influence on monitored florfenicol resistance selection in Escherichia coli from the microbiota.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.01265", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2900378413", "source": "openalex"}

It is now appreciated that reflux disease is not simply caused by liquid acid reflux but rather by a variety of chemical refluxates originating from the stomach and duodenum due to a number of different mechanisms. Reflux disease can be challenging to diagnose, particularly proving its role in the causation of direct respiratory epithelial damage. Significant advances in oesophageal assessment and gastric biomarkers have emerged in recent years as our understanding increases. There are a number of treatments available for reflux disease, both medical and surgical, but there is a paucity of large randomised trials to evaluate their efficacy in the setting of chronic respiratory disease.

METHODS:Male SD rats and C57BL/6 mice, both wildtype and prostacyclin IP receptor knockout animals, were used after 18 h of fasting.Gastric lesions were induced by the po administration of HCl/ethanol (60% in 150 mmol/L HCl) in a volume of 1 mL for rats or 0.3 mL for mice. RESULTS:Both lafutidine and capsaicin (1-10 mg/kg, po) afforded dose-dependent protection against HCl/ ethanol in rats and mice.The effects were attenuated by both the ablation of CSN and pretreatment with N G -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, yet only the effect of capsaicin was mitigated by prior administration of capsazepine, the TRPV1 antagonist, as well as indomethacin.Lafutidine protected the stomach against HCl/ethanol in IP receptor knockout mice, similar to wild-type animals, while capsaicin failed to afford protection in the animals lacking IP receptors.Neither of these agents affected the mucosal PGE 2 or 6-keto PGF 1α contents in rat stomachs.Capsaicin evoked an increase in [Ca 2+ ]i in rat TRPV1-transfected HEK293 cells while lafutidine did not.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that although both lafutidine and capsaicin exhibit gastro-protective action mediated by CSN, the mode of their effects differs regarding the dependency on endogenous PGs/IP receptors and TRPV1.It is assumed that lafutidine interacts with CSN at yet unidentified sites other than TRPV1.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v12.i19.3031", "url": "https://openalex.org/W39653907", "source": "openalex"}

The incorporation of trans ‐resveratrol into food products would allow for broader access of this bioactive compound to a larger population. However, this strategy is limited by instability of trans ‐resveratrol under environmental conditions and within the digestive system leading to isomerization of trans ‐resveratrol (bioactive form) to cis ‐resveratrol (bio‐inactive form). Studies in the stabilization of trans ‐resveratrol into protein microparticles are presented. Trans ‐resveratrol was encapsulated using whey protein concentrate (WPC) or sodium caseinate (SC), with or without anhydrous milk fat (AMF). Binding of resveratrol and aromatic residues in protein was estimated utilizing the Stern–Volmer equation and the number of tryptophan residues. The stability of encapsulated resveratrol was evaluated after exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light and 3‐stage in vitro digestion. After UVA light exposure, SC‐based microcapsules maintained a higher trans:cis resveratrol ratio (0.63, P &lt; 0.05) than WPC‐based microcapsules (0.43) and unencapsulated resveratrol (0.49). In addition, encapsulation of resveratrol in both protein microparticles led to an increased digestive stability and bioaccessibility in comparison to unencapsulated resveratrol (47% and 23%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). SC‐based microcapsules provided a higher digestive stability and bioaccessibility (86% and 81%; P &lt; 0.05) compared to WPC‐based microcapsules (71% and 68%). The addition of AMF to the microcapsules did not significantly change the in vitro digestion values. In conclusion, SC‐based microencapsulation increased the stability of trans ‐resveratrol to UVA light exposure and simulated digestion conditions. This encapsulation‐system‐approach can be extended to other labile, bioactive polyphenols.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.13176", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2221187659", "source": "openalex"}

However, orally administered drugs are often metabolized in the liver, resulting in reduced efficacy and the need for higher doses. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can be engineered to prevent the diffusion of the drug in the stomach, addressing the release at the target site, and enhancing the efficacy of the delivered drug. Here, an orally administrable galunisertib delivery system is developed with gelatin-covered diatomite nanoparticles targeting the ligand 1-cell adhesion molecule (L1-CAM) on metastatic cells, and further encapsulated in an enteric matrix by microfluidics. The gastro-resistant polymer protects the nanoparticles from the action of the digestive enzymes and allows for a sustained release of galunisertib at the intestinal pH. The efficacy of antibody-antigen interactions to drive the internalization of nanoparticles in the targeted cells is investigated in CRC cells expressing abnormal (SW620) or basal levels (Caco-2, HT29-MTX) of L1-CAM. The combination of local drug release and active targeting enhances the effect of the delivered galunisertib, which inhibits the migration of the SW620 cells with greater efficiency compared to the free drug.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202202672", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4310601250", "source": "openalex"}

However, the placement of such tubes may be associated with potentially devastating intra-abdominal complications possibly related to the tenuous security of a tube through the small bowel wall. An alternative method for enteral nutrition access is to surgically place a “PEG-J” tube (i.e., surgical G/J tube) thus providing for jejunal feedings via a gastrotomy without a jejunotomy. The purpose of this study is to assess whether surgically placed G/J tubes reduce the postoperative complications in comparison to feeding J tubes.Over the past 18 months, 92 J tubes and 56 G/J tubes were placed during laparotomy at a single institution and the method chosen by surgeons' preference. The frequency of complications associated with each tube was determined by review of the postoperative medical records.There was no enteric leakage in those patient given G/J tubes (p < 0.05). Furthermore 10% of the patients receiving J tubes required operative repair of a J tube complication while no patient with an access complication following G/J tube placement required surgical repair (p < 0.05).These results demonstrate that operative positioning of a jejunal feeding tube through a gastrostomy tube (surgical G/J tube) provides a safer route for enteral nutrition than does direct tube placement via the jejunal wall, by significantly reducing both the incidence of enteric leakage and the requirement for operative repair.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.1996.10718579", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2092634099", "source": "openalex"}

This study assessed the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy on the volume, distribution and acidity of gastric secretions in GERD and healthy subjects (HS).A randomized, double blind, cross-over study in 12 HS and 12 GERD patients pre-treated with 40 mg pantoprazole (PPI) or placebo b.i.d. was performed. Postprandial secretion volume (SV), formation of a secretion layer and contact between the layer and the EGJ were quantified by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Multi-channel pH-monitoring assessed intragastric pH.A distinct layer of undiluted acid secretion was present on top of gastric contents in almost all participants on and off high-dose acid suppression.

All recurrent and persistent wheezers (under two years) were investigated for GER and treated medically where tests were positive. The subjects were further profiled to identify any predictors for GER. Sixty-seven children of less than 2 years age with recurrent or persistent wheezing were evaluated for GER. Mean age of the study subjects at enrolment was 10.8 months and at onset of wheezing was 7.1 (± 3.8 S.D) months. Asthma and wheeze associated lower respiratory tract infection (WALRI) was diagnosed in about 1/3 each of the patients studied. GER studies were positive in over one-third (25/67) of cases. Forty-two percent of children who wheezed by 1 year of age had a positive GER study. Interestingly, nearly half (12/25) of the patients with an abnormal study did not have any clinical suggestion of regurgitation (\"silent\" GERs). The severity of wheezing was higher among those who had GER versus those who did not (p ≤ 0.048; OR: 3.2). However, only 32% patients showed significant response to anti reflux treatment alone while others had partial response. GER, therefore, is an important cause for recurrent wheezing among children less than 2 years of age, either singularly or as a co-morbidity.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Science Citation Index and reference lists for randomized controlled trials which compared cisapride with placebo or other non‐surgical therapy in children. We included only trials which reported reflux‐related symptoms as an outcome, provided that cisapride was administered orally for at least 1 week. Seven trials (286 children in total) compared cisapride with placebo. Two trials reported good concealment of treatment allocation. The pooled odds ratio for the ‘same or worse’ symptoms was 0.34 (95%CI 0.10, 1.19). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies ( P &lt; 0.00001) and the funnel plot was asymmetrical. Adverse effects (mainly diarrhoea) were not significantly increased with cisapride (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.80: 0.87, 3.70). The reflux index was significantly reduced in children treated with cisapride (weighted mean difference –6.49: –10.13, –2.85). One study (50 children) compared cisapride with gaviscon plus carobel: the OR for the ‘same or worse’ symptoms was 3.26 (0.93, 11.38). There was no clear evidence that cisapride reduced symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux. As smaller, poorer quality studies were biased in favour of a positive treatment effect, the pooled OR overestimated the potential benefits of cisapride. There was some evidence to suggest that gaviscon plus carobel may be a more effective option than cisapride.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1754.2000.00615.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066823916", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS:In October 2010, we introduced a mechanical anastomotic technique of gastro-or duodenojejunostomy using staplers during PpPD.We compared clinical outcomes between 19 patients who underwent PpPD with a stapled gastro/duodenojejunostomy (stapled anastomosis group) and 19 patients who underwent PpPD with a conventional hand-sewn duodenojejunostomy (hand-sewn anastomosis group). RESULTS:The time required for reconstruction was significantly shorter in the stapled anastomosis group than in the hand-sewn anastomosis group (186.0 ± 29.4 min vs 219.7 ± 50.0 min, P = 0.02).In addition, intraoperative blood loss was significantly less (391.0 ± 212.0 mL vs 647.1 ± 482.1 mL, P = 0.03) and the time to oral intake was significantly shorter (5.4 ± 1.7 d vs 11.3 ± 7.9 d, P = 0.002) in the stapled anastomosis group than in the hand-sewn anastomosis group.There were no differences in the incidences of delayed gastric emptying and other postoperative complications between the groups.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that stapled gastro/duodenojejunostomy shortens reconstruction time during PpPD without affecting the incidence of delayed gastric emptying.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v19.i48.9399", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129163297", "source": "openalex"}

Stimulation of myocardial vagal receptors impairs lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) function and may explain this link. This study examined the role of bradykinin, produced in increased quantities by the ischaemic myocardium, in activating this reflex. Thirteen dogs had patches soaked in bradykinin 100 μg/ml and saline applied sequentially to the left ventricular epicardium. Eleven of these animals were further divided into two subgroups: group 1 animals (six dogs) had the above sequence repeated after obliteration of sympathetic afferent fibres with phenol and those in group 2 (five animals) underwent sequential intravenous and intra-atrial injection of bradykinin 0·2 μg/kg. Epicardial bradykinin produced a fall in mean(s.e.m.) LOS tone from 13·3(1·3) to 6·0(0·5) sphinctometer units (P&amp;lt; 0·002), accompanied by a reduction in mean(s.e.m.) arterial pressure from 95(4) to 83(5) mmHg (P&amp;lt; 0·002). Destruction of sympathetic afferent fibres did not alter the LOS effect. Intra-atrial, but not intravenous, bradykinin reproduced the LOS effect. this suggests a cardiac origin. Myocardial release of bradykinin may play a role in producing transient LOS relaxation, predisposing to gastro-oesophageal reflux.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800811020", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963953724", "source": "openalex"}

Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), selected as a model protein, has been encapsulated inside calcium alginate capsules, which have been coated with a thin layer of chitosan (CHT) to improve its robustness and delivery profile. BSA and sodium alginate aqueous mixtures were characterized by optical microscopy and dynamic light scattering, suggesting that BSA and sodium alginate form water-in-water coacervate droplets by ionic complexation. Encapsulation of BSA-Alg colloidal dispersions was performed by introducing the BSA-Alg mixtures in CaCl2 solutions. Thus, calcium alginate capsules were formed, which were subsequently coated with CHT. Encapsulation of BSA achieved ≈99% efficiency, the water content of capsules was ≈95 wt% and the amount of chitosan coating in wet capsules was <0.017 wt%. The stability of the capsules and the release of BSA were studied by several in vitro techniques, in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. The addition of CHT as a coating material greatly improved the performance of the capsules, compared to that of capsules without CHT. The results of calcium-chitosan alginate capsules showed that they are stable in water at neutral pH and remain almost intact in simulated gastric fluid, but rapidly disintegrate when further treated with simulated intestinal fluid. These results demonstrated that calcium alginate-chitosan capsules can protect proteins from harsh gastric conditions and release their content at intestinal pH, demonstrating their potential application in the field of oral protein delivery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.133998", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4394913287", "source": "openalex"}

To assess the use of an obstruction manoeuvre during endoscopy for the detection of dynamic gastro‐oesophageal junction abnormalities. Materials and Methods Thirty‐six client‐owned brachycephalic dogs were prospectively included in a randomised trial. Antacid treatment was randomly prescribed in 18 dogs before and after surgery while the other 18 dogs did not receive any gastrointestinal medical treatment. At presentation, at the time of surgery and at recheck, digestive clinical signs and gastro‐oesophageal junction abnormalities were assessed using specific scores. Gastro‐oesophageal junction abnormalities were assessed during endoscopy in standard conditions as well as during endotracheal tube obstruction. This manoeuvre was also applied in an unrelated control group. Results The results suggest a beneficial effect of antacid treatment on the improvement of digestive clinical signs and lesions in dogs with brachycephalic syndrome undergoing surgery. At postsurgical control 83% of dogs had a digestive clinical score ≤1 in the treated group in contrast to 44% in the non‐treated group and 39% of dogs had a gastro‐oesophageal abnormalities score (during obstruction manoeuvre) ≤1 in the treated group in contrast to 16.7% in the non‐treated group. The use of the obstruction manoeuvre during endoscopic assessment in a control group revealed that gastro‐oesophageal junction movements are negligible in healthy animals. Clinical Significance The addition of antacid treatment during the pre‐ and postoperative period for brachycephalic dogs undergoing surgery may result in a faster and greater improvement in treated dogs. The obstruction manoeuvre is an interesting technique to improve detection of gastro‐oesophageal junction abnormalities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.13279", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3107738565", "source": "openalex"}

Reflux is also one of the causes of several other symptoms, e.g. globus pharyngis, chronic laryngitis and pulmonary fibrosis, and the knowledge that reflux is present may be of paramount clinical importance in these conditions. Conventional radiographic tests of reflux during barium meal examinations are unreliable, and pH monitoring and manometric tests are not practicable for routine use. In the acid-barium test, oesophageal peristalsis is observed during perfusion with barium sulphate suspension containing 0·35 per cent hydrochloric acid (pH 1·7). Delayed emptying and non-peristaltic contractions are the indicators of a positive test. The test was done in 350 patients and the results compared with the clinical evidence of reflux. The test correlated only moderately well with the clinical features, mainly because of unexpected positive tests in patients without other evidence of reflux. The reasons for this are discussed, and it is concluded that although the test detects sensitivity of the oesophagus to acid perfusion, a positive test does not necessrily indicate symptomatic reflux. Within limitations the test is of value in concert with clinical and other radiological tests, and because of its simplicity and safety, may be a useful screening test in selecting patients in need of more sophisticated and tedious tests of oesophageal function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1259/0007-1285-46-548-578", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976349189", "source": "openalex"}

The effect of the potent specific cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist loxiglumide on meal‐stimulated plasma concentrations of CCK, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), neurotensin, glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), insulin and C peptide was investigated in a placebo‐controlled study in 10 healthy male volunteers. Intravenous infusion of loxiglumide (10 mg kg ‐1 h ‐1 ) significantly augmented integrated incremental IR‐CCK levels 7·3‐fold after stimulation by a standard breakfast (504·54 vs 3·665±365 pmol ‐1 135 min ‐1 , P &lt;0·001), as measured by a specific CCK radioimmunoassay. Basal IR‐CCK concentrations were not affected by administration of loxiglumide. Oral treatment with bile acids (2 g ursodeoxycholic acid plus 2 g chenodeoxycholic acid) together with the meal abolished this augmentation, whereas high‐dose substitution with pancreatic enzymes (4·2 g pancreatin) reduced elevated IR‐CCK levels by only 38%. CCK‐like bioactivity, determined by a bioassay using rat pancreatic acini, was not detectable in all samples that contained loxiglumide at plasma concentrations of 100–250 μg ml ‐1 . Plasma gastrin concentrations in response to the breakfast were elevated 3·2‐fold during loxiglumide infusion and not influenced by substitution with bile acids or pancreatic enzymes. Meal‐stimulated integrated incremental plasma PP concentrations were significantly suppressed (55–65% inhibition, P &lt;0·01) by loxiglumide. Infusion of the CCK receptor antagonist only slightly increased postprandial peak plasma glucose, insulin and C‐peptide levels, whereas GIP and neurotensin levels were not significantly influenced. These findings suggest: (i) CCK secretion is under feedback control by intraduodenal bile acids and to a lesser extent by pancreatic enzymes; (ii) simultaneous extraction of CCK and loxiglumide results in circulating plasma CCK‐like bioactivity of zero; (iii) gastrin secretion is feedback controlled via an indirect mechanism probably involving CCK‐induced somatostatin secretion; (iv) release of PP is under inhibitory control of CCK; (v) CCK does not play a major role as insulinotropic hormone in the entero‐insular axis in humans.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2362.1991.tb01402.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2031272904", "source": "openalex"}

A clinical and endoscopic study, and correlation with outcome", "text": "ABSTRACT. To evaluate the clinical and endoscopic features of peptic oesophagitis associated with gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) in infants and children, and to correlate these features with outcome of GOR, we selected 62 patients with GOR aged 21 days to 10 years (median 6.5 months) with symptoms suggesting oesophagitis from a group of 126 patients with GOR for fiberoptic endoscopy. Clinical presentation, clinical features, investigations and management and outcome were recorded by computer‐aided analysis. Of the 62 patients studied, 34 (55%) had oesophagitis. Of these, nine had macroscopic ulceration and desquamation, 23 had macroscopic erythema and friability and two had strictures. Comparing those with and without oesophagitis, common clinical symptoms associated with oesophagitis included excessive crying, irritability and/or sleep disturbance often presenting as “colic” (85%), failure to thrive (41%), haematemesis (29%), and abnormal head and back posturing (7%). Maternal distress was common with GOR and oesophagitis in infants and three cases presented with child abuse. Four cases had associated neurological deficit. Of the 28 cases with minimal or no oesophagitis at endoscopy, 26 (93%) responded satisfactorily to conservative management whereas only 14 of 34 (41%) of the group with oesophagitis responded to conservative management including the use of cimetidine. The remainder of this group required antireflux surgery. We conclude that peptic oesophagitis is an often unrecognised important complication of GOR in infants and children which, apart from causing considerable morbidity may adversely affect prognosis. We emphasize the importance of diagnostic endoscopy in selected cases to detect pathological GOR, particularly where irritability, “colic”, sleep disturbance and haematemesis accompanies GOR as other diagnostic tests detect only the presence or absence of GOR, and are poor predictors of oesophagitis. Management of GOR in infants should include measures to prevent this important complication, and careful follow‐up of established cases seems prudent.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1754.1983.tb02064.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999381935", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To determine if adding histology as a criterion and excluding patients with epigastric pain enhances the diagnosis for GERD . Methods Patients with frequent upper gastrointestinal symptoms who had not taken a proton pump inhibitor in the previous 2 months and who had evaluable distal oesophageal biopsies were included (Diamond study: NCT 00291746). Epithelial hyperplasia was identified when total epithelial thickness was at least 430 μm. Investigation‐based GERD criteria were: presence of erosive oesophagitis, pathological oesophageal acid exposure and/or positive symptom–acid association probability. Symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and a pre‐specified checklist. Results Overall, 127 (55%) of the 231 included patients met investigation‐based GERD criteria and 195 (84%) met symptom‐based criteria. Epithelial hyperplasia was present in 89 individuals, of whom 61 (69%) met investigation‐based criteria and 83 (93%) met symptom‐based criteria. Adding epithelial hyperplasia as a criterion increased the number of patients diagnosed with GERD on investigation by 28 [12%; number needed to diagnose ( NND ): 8], to 155 (67%). The proportion of patients with a symptom‐based GERD diagnosis who met investigation‐based criteria including epithelial hyperplasia was significantly greater when concomitant epigastric pain was absent than when it was present ( P &lt; 0.05; NND : 8). Conclusions Histology increases diagnosis of GERD and should be performed when clinical suspicion is high and endoscopy is negative.

The project combines research on plant growth and management, animal nutrition and parasitology. The first results, especially those from Onobrychis viciifolia (sainfoin), presented here are encouraging. O. viciifolia has a consistently high concentration of condensed tannins (CT) throughout the whole growing season. Thus, the optimal time for harvest can be determined in relation to agronomic properties such as fodder quality and yield and does not have to be related to a specific time period with high tannin concentration in the herbage. Despite its high CT content, the animals accepted O. viciifolia very well. Finally, the anti-parasitic properties of fresh CT-containing O. viciifolia were largely preserved in silage and hay leading to a substantial decrease in worm egg excretion in faeces.

Pharmacotherapy for GERD has evolved from antacids to H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to prokinetics to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

One case involved recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux with a short oesophagus and fundoplication raised into the mediastinum. In one other case, there was recurrent hiatal herniation with a rotary as well as axial component and consequent mediastinal occupation. The other three cases featured persistent post-operative dysphagia caused, in one case, by an error in the creation of the anti-reflux valve (perigastric cuff) and, in the other two, by erroneous choice of the anti-reflux operation: post-operative manometry showed important oesophageal hypo-dyskinesia which should have indicated partial fundoplication.

However, there are few studies on propofol combined with S-ketamine in children undergoing gastro-duodenoscopy. We aim to determine the sedative effect and safety of different doses of S-ketamine in combination with propofol in school-aged children undergoing gastro-duodenoscopy. Methods This is a prospective, randomized trial. Totally, 120 school-aged children who underwent gastro-duodenoscopy were randomly allocated into Group P, Group S 0.3 , Group S 0.5 and Group S 0.7 . During induction, children in Group P, Group S 0.3 , Group S 0.5 and Group S 0.7 received 0, 0.3 mg.kg −1 , 0.5 mg.kg −1 and 0.7 mg.kg −1 S-ketamine, respectively, following 3 mg.kg −1 propofol injection. During gastro-duodenoscopy, 1 mg.kg −1 of propofol was added according to the condition of the children and the BIS (bispectral index) value. The primary outcome was smooth placement rate of the first endoscope insertion. The secondary outcome was the times of additional propofol, the total amount of propofol, adverse events, recovery time, length of PACU (post anesthesia care unit) stay and endoscopist satisfaction. Results The smooth placement rate of the first endoscope insertion in Group P, Group S 0.3 and Group S 0.5 was significantly lower than that in Group S 0.7 (16.70%, 34.50%, 50.00% vs. 83.30%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). The times of additional propofol in Group S 0.3 ( P = 0.018), Group S 0.5 ( P = 0.014) and Group S 0.7 ( P = 0.001) were significantly less than Group P. The total amount of propofol in Group S 0.7 was significantly less than Group P ( P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of intraoperative hypotension in Group S 0.5 and Group S 0.7 was low. Group S 0.7 had significantly higher incidence of postoperative dizziness ( P = 0.003), longer PACU stay ( P = 0.018) and higher endoscopist satisfaction ( P = 0.001) than Group P. There was no difference in the recovery time among groups.

The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in these patients is difficult due to the low sensitivity of invasive tests and the need to discontinue treatment with proton pump inhibitors to perform a breath test with urea 13C or the detection of Helicobacter pylori antigens in feces.We included 214 patients (164 men and 50 women) with an average age of 58 +/- 15 years, who were admitted to hospital due to upper gastro-intestinal bleeding caused by a gastro-duodenal peptic ulcer. The presence of Helicobacter pylori was established by means of gastric biopsy (fast urease test histology and/or culture) and a breath test with 13C-labeled urea. Serology was performed with the ELISA method (Pyloriset EIA-G by Orion Diagnostica). Positive Helicobacter pylori infection was accepted with any positive invasive method or breath test, and no infection was established if all invasive tests performed and the breath test with 13C-labeled urea were negative. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of serology in the global series and in different subgroups of patients according to age (> 60 and < 40 years), recent exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, type of endoscopic wound and history of gastro-duodenal peptic ulcer.192 patients (89.7%) showed infection due to Helicobacter pylori. In the global series (n = 214) we obtained a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 87.5, 54.5, 94.3 and 33.3%, respectively. Specificity was greater in the group not exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 110) as compared to the exposed group (n = 104), in the < 40 year old group (n = 28) with respect to the > 60 years group (n = 105), in the duodenal ulcer group (n = 141) with respect to the gastric ulcer group (n = 59), and in the group with a history of gastro-duodenal peptic ulcers (n = 92) as compared to the group without any of these past events (n = 122); nevertheless, no significant statistics were reached.IgG (ELISA) serology shows low specificity and a low negative predictive value in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with gastro-intestinal bleeding due to gastro-duodenal peptic ulcer. The diagnostic value of serology did not improve significantly when age, recent exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, type of endoscopic wound or history of gastro-duodenal peptic ulcer was taken into consideration.

Adult African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were fed a starch (SD) or fat (FD) diet and groups of fish were dissected at 2, 5 and 8 h after the consumption of a single meal. Chyme was collected quantitatively and was analysed for osmolality and dry matter (DM) content. Postprandial water fluxes were calculated, while using yttrium oxide (Y2O3) as an inert marker to account for the absorption of DM along the GIT. The largest differences in chyme characteristics between diets were observed in the stomach and decreased towards subsequent compartments. A high initial osmotic pressure was measured in the stomach for both diets (up to 498±2 mOsm kg−1) and was likely the driver for the endogeneous water influx to this compartment. Large additions of water were recorded to the stomach and proximal intestine for both diets and absorption of water took place in the mid- and distal intestine. Interestingly, the dietary treatment had an impact on water balance in the stomach and proximal intestine of the fish, but not in the mid- and distal intestine. A strong complementary relationship suggested that 59% of the water fluxes in the proximal intestine could be explained by previous additions to the stomach. Therefore, a higher dietary inclusion of starch led to a shift in water additions from the proximal intestine to the stomach. However, the sum of water additions to the GIT was not different between diets and was on average 6.52±0.85 ml water g−1 DM. The interactions between osmoregulation and digestion, in the GIT of fed freshwater fish, deserve further attention in future research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055245", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135801355", "source": "openalex"}

It is often difficult to predict whether antireflux surgery will improve the respiratory status of an infant and assist with weaning off the ventilator. The aim of this study was to review the outcomes in a cohort of ventilator-dependent infants who underwent fundoplication to help wean them off ventilation. <b>Methods</b> Between January 2006 and December 2010, out of 596 infants who underwent fundoplication for symptoms of GOR, 26 were ventilator dependent before surgery; 13 patients had an emergency fundoplication following an acute life-threatening event (<i>n</i> = 5, 19%) or an acute deterioration of respiratory status (<i>n</i> = 8, 31%). Fundoplication was planned in the rest of the group (<i>n</i> = 13, 50%) with the aim of improving respiratory status and weaning from ventilation. The median age at surgery was 5.8 months (range: 0.8 to 19.4 months). The median weight at surgery was 6.3 kg (range: 4 to 15.1 kg). Data were collected for each infant on comorbidities, pre- and postoperative ventilation status, pre- and postoperative GOR symptoms, and survival. <b>Results</b> All infants underwent a Nissen fundoplication with no intraoperative morbidity or mortality. Of these, 12 infants had a laparoscopic fundoplication; 14 infants had an open fundoplication. Postoperatively, all infants received invasive positive pressure ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). All infants were successfully weaned from ventilation. The median time to extubation was 4 days (range: 2 to 18 days). The median postoperative ICU stay was 9 days (range: 3 to 52 days). Of the patients, 9 (34%) had a recurrence of symptoms following fundoplication; 5 (19%) subsequently underwent revision of fundoplication and 1 (3.8%) underwent oesophago-gastric dissociation; and 10 (38%) died within the study period. <b>Conclusion</b> In infants with severe GOR, ventilator dependence, and complex comorbidities, fundoplication may be a useful procedure to assist weaning off ventilator dependence.

Forty‐four subjects had two wild‐type alleles, 15 had one variant, and one had two variant CYP2C19 alleles. The presence of a variant allele was significantly associated with a lower odds of gastric acid breakthrough during proton‐pump inhibitor therapy [odds ratio 5.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–22.61]. The presence of a variant allele was not associated with a lower odds of significant oesophageal acid exposure (odds ratio 2.50, 95% CI 0.60–10.52), or the occurrence of symptoms (incidence rate ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.54–2.06). Conclusions: These results indicate that factors other than gastric acid secretion are important determinants of reflux in GERD patients. This suggests that CYP2C19 genotype testing will not be useful in proton‐pump inhibitor therapy of GERD, except perhaps in identifying patients at risk for hypochlorhydria and consequent hypergastrinemia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.01645.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051232797", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, ryegrass proteins extracted using two different approaches-chemical and enzymatic extraction, were characterised for their physico-chemical and in vitro digestion properties. A New Zealand perennial ryegrass cultivar Trojan was chosen based on its higher protein and lower dry matter contents. Grass protein concentrate (GPC) with protein contents of approximately 55 and 44% were prepared using the chemical and enzymatic approach, respectively. The thermal denaturation temperature of the GPC extracted via acid precipitation and enzymatic treatment was found to be 68.0 ± 0.05 °C and 66.15 ± 0.03 °C, respectively, showing significant differences in protein’s thermal profile according to the method of extraction. The solubility of the GPC was highly variable, depending on the temperature, pH and salt concentration of the dispersion. The solubility of the GPC extracted via enzymatic extraction was significantly lower than the proteins extracted via the chemical method. Digestion of raw GPC was also studied via a gastro-small intestinal in vitro digestion model and was found to be significantly lower, in terms of free amino N release, for the GPC prepared through acid precipitation. These results suggest that the physico-chemical and digestion characteristics of grass proteins are affected by the extraction method employed to extract the proteins. This implies that selection of an appropriate extraction method is of utmost importance for achieving optimum protein functionality during its use for food applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10020331", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3128528454", "source": "openalex"}

As a result, we have no understanding of the quantitative changes in gastric or oesophageal acidity over time, the patterns that might characterize these changes, or the physiological significance of gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Aim : To examine the time series for gastric and oesophageal pH. Methods : Detrended fluctuation analysis and lag analysis were used to analyse data from 24 h recordings of oesophageal and gastric pH in five normal subjects and five subjects with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Results : Analyses of the patterns of gastric and oesophageal pH over time in normal subjects and subjects with gastro–oesophageal reflux disease indicate that the fluctuations in pH are self‐similar across different time scales and are consistent with an underlying fractal process. Furthermore, there is a significant statistical association between sequential pH values separated by as much as 2.2 h. Conclusions : We hypothesize that the self‐similar, fractal pattern encodes information about gastric acidity and that the oesophagus decodes this information and, when appropriate, may signal the stomach to reduce gastric acidity. Subjects with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease might have an impaired oesophageal–gastric feedback mechanism that results in increased gastric acid, which reflux from the stomach into the oesophagus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2005.02665.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112181175", "source": "openalex"}

Dose limiting toxicities are frequently seen and many patients require dose reductions. This study aimed to evaluate regorafenib toxicities and their management in a real-world GIST population. Methods Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database identified 50 patients with GIST treated with regorafenib at our centre between March 2013 and September 2018. Results Median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months [interquartile range (IQR) 2.8–14.4 months]. Median overall survival (OS) from start of regorafenib to death or last follow up was 15.7 months (IQR 9.2–28.4 months). Baseline median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status on starting regorafenib was 1. The main reason for discontinuing regorafenib was progressive disease (PD) (31/50 [62%]) rather than toxicity (10/50 [20%]). Grade 3–4 adverse events (AEs) were seen in 23/50 (46%) patients; palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was most frequently seen (9/50 (18%)). Two patients died whilst on treatment with regorafenib from multi-organ failure secondary to sepsis (4%). Dose reductions were required in 19/50 patients (38%) and 8/50 (16%) patients started regorafenib at a lower dose band than the recommended dose (160 mg) due to comorbidities or concern over a higher individual risk of toxicity. Conclusion Although PD was the main reason for discontinuing treatment, toxicity management and dosing of regorafenib remains critical.

Phenylephrine (5 × 10 −7 to 5 × 10 −5 m ) produced a dose‐related contraction, whilst dopamine (10 −6 to 10 −4 m ) and isoprenaline (5 × 10 −7 to 2 × 10 −5 m ) produced dose‐related relaxations. Clonidine was ineffective in doses up to 10 −5 m . 5‐Hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) produced a contraction. Phenylephrine was antagonized by α 1 ‐adrenoceptor antagonists but unaffected by β‐adrenoceptor antagonists, whilst the opposite was the case for isoprenaline. A mixture of α‐ and β‐adrenoceptor antagonists was required to inhibit completely dopamine‐induced relaxations. 5‐HT (3 × 10 −7 m ) was specifically antagonized by methysergide (3 × 10 −6 m ). pA 2 values for a range of α‐adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor antagonists were determined against dopamine and phenylephrine. The relative order of potency of the antagonists was the same for both antagonists and was prazosin &gt; spiroperidol &gt; phentolamine &gt; domperidone &gt; haloperidol, with pimozide and metoclopramide being inactive. Tyramine caused dose‐related relaxations of the gastro‐oesophageal strips which were susceptible to the same range of antagonists as dopamine. Cocaine (6 × 10 −6 m ) and desmethylimipramine (3 × 10 −7 and 10 −6 m ) reduced the relaxations induced by dopamine and tyramine but there were quantitative differences in the antagonism. Tissue from reserpine pretreated guinea‐pigs was insensitive to tyramine but the response to dopamine was only partly reduced.

First, the cardiovascular risk factor chronic systemic inflammation may reflect gastroenterological inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal infections, in particular, chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. Furthermore, since contemporary treatment of cardiovascular disease commonly includes potent antithrombotic medications, the cardiovascular benefit in terms of a decrease in the incidence of recurrent ischemic events and death needs to be carefully balanced with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Several strategies to target chronic gastrointestinal inflammation and to diagnose and treat Helicobacter pylori to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal bleeding are available but residual controversy remains and large-scale gastro-cardiology trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment approaches. In perspective, the centennial gastrocardiac syndrome is more relevant than ever in a contemporary gastroenterology and cardiology setting.

This effect has been reproduced in 17 out of 18 volunteers taking 1, 2 or 3 g per day of oral erythromycin base during 5 days.

During pregnancy, elevated sex hormones are thought to contribute to the high prevalence of reflux symptoms. Increased female sex hormone levels may thus contribute to the aetiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).To determine if female sex hormone levels are associated with symptomatic acid reflux.Women with GORD symptoms undergoing oesophageal pH monitoring were prospectively recruited. 'Cases' and 'controls' were defined by normal and excess total acid exposure on pH monitoring and were age-matched and BMI-matched. Case and control groups were further stratified into premenopausal and postmenopausal groups. Demographic data were collected, body morphological parameters were measured and oestradiol, oestrone, progesterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured.One hundred and twenty-one women [mean age 52 (SD 11.6) years] were recruited and 104 [mean age 51 (SD 11.6) years] were matched for age and BMI. Increasing BMI, as expected, correlated with increasing acid exposure [premenopausal (r=0.404, P=0.02), postmenopausal (r=0.401, P=0.01)]. Increasing BMI also correlated with sex hormone levels [premenopausal oestradiol (r=0.52, P=0.004), postmenopausal oestrone (r=0.364, P=0.01)]. In premenopausal women, sex hormone binding globulin (r=-0.27, P=0.05) and testosterone (r=0.29, P=0.05) correlated with increasing acid exposure, but oestradiol fell just short of significance (r=0.26, P=0.06).

Therefore initial choice of treatment has long-term cost implications. The aim was to compare the costs and effectiveness of treatment of GORD (unconfirmed by endoscopy) with seven proton pump inhibitors (PPIs: esomeprazole, lansoprazole (capsules and oro-dispersible tablets), omeprazole (generic and branded), pantoprazole and rabeprazole), over one year.Design and methods: A treatment model was developed of 13 interconnected Markov models incorporating acute treatment of symptoms, long-term therapy and subsequent decisions to undertake endoscopy to confirm diagnosis. Patients were allowed to stop treatment or to receive maintenance treatment either continuously or on-demand depending on response to therapy. Long-term dosing schedule (high dose or step-down dose) was based on current market data. Efficacy of treatments was based on clinical trials and follow-up studies, while resource use patterns were determined by a panel of physicians.Main outcome measures: The model predicts total expected annual costs, number of symptom-free days and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY).Results: Generic omeprazole and rabeprazole dominated (i.e. cost less and resulted in more symptom-free days and higher QALY gains) the other PPIs. Rabeprazole had a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio of £3.42 per symptom-free day and £8308/quality-adjusted life-year gained when compared with generic omeprazole. Rabeprazole remained cost-effective independent of choice of maintenance treatment (i.e. proportion of patients remaining on continuous treatment versus on-demand treatment).Conclusions: Economic models provide a useful framework to evaluate PPIs in realistic clinical scenarios. Our findings show that rabeprazole is cost-effective for the treatment of GORD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1185/030079905x65330", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127860988", "source": "openalex"}

In fasting pythons, oxyntopeptic cells located within the fundic glands are typically non-active, with a thick apical tubulovesicular system and numerous zymogen granules. They become active immediately after feeding but return to a non-active state 3 days after the ingestion of the prey. The proton pump, expressed throughout the different fasting/feeding states, is either sequestered in the tubulovesicular system in non-active cells or located along the apical digitations extending within the crypt lumen in active cells. The sodium pump is rapidly upregulated in fed animals and is classically located along the baso-lateral membranes of the gastric oxyntopeptic cells. In the intestine, it is only expressed along the lateral membranes of the enterocytes, i.e., above the lateral spaces and not along the basal side of the cells. Thus, solute transport within the intestinal lining is mainly achieved through the apical part of the cells and across the lateral spaces while absorbed fat massively crosses the entire height of the cells and flows into the intercellular spaces. Therefore, in the Burmese python, the gastrointestinal cellular system quickly upregulates after feeding, due to inexpensive cellular changes, passive mechanisms, and the progressive activation and synthesis of key enzymes such as the sodium pump. This cell plasticity also allows anticipation of the next fasting and feeding periods.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2108/zsj.26.632", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097703761", "source": "openalex"}

Almost all hens (>99%) were infected with at least one nematode species. Species-specific nematode prevalence ranged from 85.8% to 99.1% between the two genotypes. Heterakis gallinarum was the most prevalent nematode (98.5%), followed by Ascaridia galli (96.2%) and Capillaria spp. (86.1%). Capillaria spp. were composed of C. obsignata (79%), C. caudinflata (16%) and C. bursata (5%).All phenotypic and genetic correlations among worm counts of different parasite species were positive in combined genotypes (rP ranged from 0.05 to 0.30 and rG ranged from 0.29 to 0.88). A strong genetic correlation (rG = 0.88 ± 0.34) between counts of A. galli and H. gallinarum was quantified. Heritability for total worm burden for LB plus and LB classic, respectively, were 0.55 ± 0.18 and 0.55 ± 0.34. Across both genotypes, the heritability of total worm burden was 0.56 ± 0.16.In conclusion, there is a high variation attributable to genetic background of chickens in their responses to naturally acquired nematode infections. The high positive genetic correlation between counts of closely related worm species (e.g. A. galli and H. gallinarum) may indicate existence of similar genetically determined mechanism(s) in chickens for controlling these nematodes.

In a recent phase I study, single agent MBP-426 given q3w showed thrombocytopenia as DLT, with 226 mg/m2 being the recommended phase II dose (RDP2). The current phase I–II study was designed to establish the RDP2 of MPB-426 in combination with 5-FU/LV (de Gramont schedule) and assess the efficacy of this combination in pretreated patients with gastro-esophageal (GE) adenocarcinoma. Methods: MBP-426 IV was given q3w at two dose levels: 226 and 170 mg/m2 with fixed doses of 5-FU/LV. LV (400 mg/m2) was given concurrently with MBP-426 followed by IV bolus 5-FU (400 mg/m2), and then by 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 by continuous IV (CIV) infusion over 46 hours. The phase I dose assessment part was conducted in solid tumor patients. The phase II part will be limited to second line patients with gastric, gastro-esophageal or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Results: The phase I part has been completed. Nine patients (pts) were included and treated. Median age: 61 years (55–67), gender M/F: 5/4, ECOG PS 0/1: 2/7, diagnosis: colorectal 4, pancreas 2, bladder 1, H&amp;N 1 and cervix 1. Median number of prior lines: 4 (2–10). Four patients received a total of 11 cycles at the first dose level (MBP-426 226 mg/m2), in which two dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed: grade 3 nausea and vomiting (1 pt) and grade 3 back pain (1 pt). Additional grade 3–4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (3 pts), neutropenia (2 pts), transient rise of bilirubin (1 pt), and skin toxicity (1 pt with grade 3 erythema multiforme at cycle 4). To date, six patients (7 cy) have been explored at a lower dose level of 170 mg/m2. No DLTs were observed, establishing 170 mg/m2 as the RDP2. Grade 3–4 toxicity was limited to neutropenia in 1 pt. Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy was not reported at either dose level, with 5 pts receiving an oxaliplatin equivalent dose ≥ 500 mg/m2. Efficacy: early data show 2 SD (4 cycles, 4+) and 1 PD (2 cycles) in 3 evaluable colorectal pts, all resistant to prior exposure to oxaliplatin. Pharmacokinetic data will be available for the meeting. Conclusion: MBP-426 at 170 mg/m2 is the RDP2 for use in combination with 5-FU/LV (de Gramont schedule) every 3 weeks. Treatment at this dose was well tolerated. No peripheral neurotoxicity has been reported with this new formulation of oxaliplatin. Potential activity was observed in 2 oxaliplatin-resistant patients.

One of the main features of the GAS was the ‘formation of acute erosions in the digestive tract, particularly in the stomach, small intestine and appendix’. This provided experimental evidence for the view based on clinical data that gastro-duodenal (peptic) ulcers could be caused by stress. This hypothesis was challenged by Marshall and Warren’s Nobel Prize (2005)-winning discovery of a causal association between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcers. However, clinical and experimental studies suggest that stress can cause peptic ulceration in the absence of H. pylori . Predictably, the etiological pendulum of gastric and duodenal ulceration has swung from ‘all stress’ to ‘all bacteria’ followed by a sober realization that both factors play a role, separately as well as together. This raises the question as to whether stress and H. pylori interact, and if so, how? Stress has also been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and related disorders; however, there is no proof yet that stress is the primary etiological trigger for IBD. Central dopamine mechanisms seem to be involved in the stress induction of peptic ulceration, whereas activation of the sympathetic nervous system and central and peripheral corticotrophin-releasing factor appears to mediate stress-induced IBD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1530/joe-16-0547", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2563455549", "source": "openalex"}

This study assessed the effects of induction chemoradiotherapy on post-operative course after resection of locally advanced oesophageal carcinoma (cT3-4 + cM1lymph).Induction therapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil days 1-5 and days 21-25, cisplatin day 1 + day 21 and concomitant radiotherapy 18-20 fractions of 2Gy (total dose 36-40Gy). Induction chemoradiotherapy was completed in 109 patients. Surgery was performed in 90 patients (operability: 90/109 = 83%): 85 patients underwent resection with curative intent (resectability: 85/109 = 78%), bypass operation was performed in five patients. Nineteen patients could not be operated on. Results were compared to a matched group of pT3M1LYM/pT4 patients (n = 86) who underwent primary surgery in the same period.Resection was complete (R0) in 68 patients (68/90 = 76%). Mean duration of surgery was 428 min (range: 240-690). Peroperative complications were haemorrhage in three patients (3/90 = 3.3%), tracheobronchial perforation in three patients (3/90 = 3.3%). Median total hospital stay was 20.5 days (range: 8-355). Mean duration of intubation was 7 days (range: 1-190); 67 patients (67/90 = 74.4%) were intubated for less than 24 h. Non-tumour related hospital mortality after resection was 8.3% (7/84 patients). Mortality after two-field lymphadenectomy was 5.2 versus 11.7% after three-field lymphadenectomy. After primary surgery (n = 86) overall mortality was 2.3% (P = 0.015) and nil after two- and three-field lymphadenectomy (P = 0.011). Medical morbidity consisted of pneumonia in 43 patients (43/90 = 48%), atelectasis in ten patients (10/90 = 11%), dysrhythmia in 21 patients (21/90 = 23%), sepsis in 11 patients (11/90 = 12%) and adult respiratory distress syndrome in ten patients (10/90 = 11%). Surgical morbidity included pleural effusion in 16 patients (16/90 = 18%), tracheal fistula in two patients (2/90 = 2%), chylothorax in two patients (2/90 = 2%) and acute pancreatitis in one patient (1/90 = 1%). Ten patients (10/90 = 11%) had a radiologically confirmed anastomotic leak; however only in four out of them with clinical manifestation; treatment was conservative in all four patients.

About 30–50% of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) experience refractory symptoms despite taking proton pump inhibitors regularly. Epidemiology studies suggest lifestyle risks, but these are under-represented in existing guidelines. The potential for changes to positively impact on symptoms may be underestimated. Lifestyle advice currently appears to be ineffective. Objectives. To inform the future design of a behaviour change intervention aimed at improving symptoms for patients with GORD, by exploring patient understanding and experiences of lifestyle influences on GORD symptoms. Methods. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 patients (12 women and 11 men) aged 30–86 years, aiming to identify lifestyle influences perceived by patients to affect their symptoms. Results. Patients reported a wide range of daily influences on their symptoms, including diet, drinking with a meal, body position, alcohol, gaining weight, stress and anxiety. Dietary influences included types of food eaten and eating pattern—including speed of eating and meal size. Many foods were identified as troublesome, but not all foods affected all patients. Eating late and daytime tiredness were not recognized as causes or consequences of night-time reflux. Conclusions. Patients stated that daily living patterns affected their reflux symptoms, but influences were highly variable between respondents. Lifestyle factors appear to combine in unique patterns for individuals, but GORD patients may not be able to identify potential triggers and make changes for themselves. A behaviour change intervention might prove beneficial to these patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmq020", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102570857", "source": "openalex"}

While the majority of NECs originate in the pulmonary organs, extrapulmonary NECs occur most predominantly in the gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) system. Although platinum-based chemotherapy is the main therapeutic option for recurrent or metastatic GEP-NEC patients, the clinical benefits are limited and associated with a poor prognosis, indicating the clinically urgent need for effective therapeutic agents. The clinical development of molecular-targeted therapies has been hampered due to the rarity of GEP-NECs and the paucity of knowledge on their biology.

Drug combinations may be more effective than single drugs and delay the onset of resistance. A combination of the nicotinic antagonist, derquantel, and the macrocyclic lactone, abamectin, has been found to have synergistic anthelmintic effects against gastro-intestinal nematode parasites. We have observed in previous contraction and electrophysiological experiments that derquantel is a potent selective antagonist of nematode parasite muscle nicotinic receptors; and that abamectin is an inhibitor of the same nicotinic receptors. To explore these inhibitory effects further, we expressed muscle nicotinic receptors of the nodular worm, Oesophagostomum dentatum (Ode-UNC-29:Ode-UNC-63:Ode-UNC-38), in Xenopus oocytes under voltage-clamp and tested effects of abamectin on pyrantel and acetylcholine responses. The receptors were antagonized by 0.03 μM abamectin in a non-competitive manner (reduced Rmax, no change in EC50). This antagonism increased when abamectin was increased to 0.1 μM. However, when we increased the concentration of abamectin further to 0.3 μM, 1 μM or 10 μM, we found that the antagonism decreased and was less than with 0.1 μM abamectin. The bi-phasic effects of abamectin suggest that abamectin acts at two allosteric sites: one high affinity negative allosteric (NAM) site causing antagonism, and another lower affinity positive allosteric (PAM) site causing a reduction in antagonism. We also tested the effects of 0.1 μM derquantel alone and in combination with 0.3 μM abamectin. We found that derquantel on these receptors, like abamectin, acted as a non-competitive antagonist, and that the combination of derquantel and abamectin produced greater inhibition. These observations confirm the antagonistic effects of abamectin on nematode nicotinic receptors in addition to GluCl effects, and illustrate more complex effects of macrocyclic lactones that may be exploited in combinations with other anthelmintics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146854", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2239168304", "source": "openalex"}

This study aimed to formulating curcumin loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CS.CUR.NPs) and investigate its gastroprotective and neuroprotective effects in rats subjected to cold restraint stress (CRS), in reference to conventional oral CUR preparation, and explore its underlying mechanism. Treated groups received either CUR or CS.CUR.NPs (100 mg∕kg) orally for 14 days before exposure to CRS. CRS elicited marked behavioral changes and gastric ulcer accompanied by histopathological abnormalities of the brain and stomach along with elevation of pain score. CUR and CS.CUR.NPs improved stress-induced gastric ulcer, cognitive performance, and pain sensation. Mechanistically, CRS disrupts oxidative and inflammatory status of the brain as manifested by high malondialdehyde and IL-6 and low total antioxidant capacity and IL-10, along with high C-reactive protein level. CRS decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2) and increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) expressions.

Identification of NVG is complicated by the non-culturable nature of this virus, and the absence of a diagnostic gold standard makes traditional evaluation of test characteristics problematic. We evaluated 189 specimens derived from 440 acute gastroenteritis outbreaks investigated in Ontario in 2006–07. Parallel testing for NVG was performed with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT2-PCR), enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and electron microscopy (EM). Test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) were estimated using latent class models and composite reference standard methods. The practical implications of test characteristics were evaluated using binomial probability models. Latent class modelling estimated sensitivities of RT2-PCR, EIA, and EM as 100%, 86%, and 17% respectively; specificities were 84%, 92%, and 100%; estimates obtained using a composite reference standard were similar. If all specimens contained norovirus, RT2-PCR or EIA would be associated with > 99.9% likelihood of at least one test being positive after three specimens tested. Testing of more than 5 true negative specimens with RT2-PCR would be associated with a greater than 50% likelihood of a false positive test. Our findings support the characterization of EM as lacking sensitivity for NVG outbreaks. The high sensitivity of RT2-PCR and EIA permit identification of NVG outbreaks with testing of limited numbers of clinical specimens. Given risks of false positive test results, it is reasonable to limit the number of specimens tested when RT2-PCR or EIA are available.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-7-23", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2018997014", "source": "openalex"}
