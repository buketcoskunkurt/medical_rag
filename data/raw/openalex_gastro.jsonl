Data on factors associated with GORD were also evaluated. An approximate prevalence of 10-20% was identified for GORD, defined by at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation in the Western world while in Asia this was lower, at less than 5%. The incidence in the Western world was approximately 5 per 1000 person years. A number of potential risk factors (for example, an immediate family history and obesity) and comorbidities (for example, respiratory diseases and chest pain) associated with GORD were identified. Data reported in this systematic review can be interpreted with confidence as reflecting the epidemiology of \"true\" GORD. The disease is more common in the Western world than in Asia, and the low rate of incidence relative to prevalence reflects its chronicity.

Studies were required to be population-based, to include ≥200 individuals, to have response rates ≥50% and recall periods &lt;12 months. GERD was defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation on at least 1 day a week, or according to the Montreal definition, or diagnosed by a clinician. Temporal and geographic trends in disease prevalence were examined using a Poisson regression model. <h3>Results</h3> 16 studies of GERD epidemiology published since the original review were found to be suitable for inclusion (15 reporting prevalence and one reporting incidence), and were added to the 13 prevalence and two incidence studies found previously. The range of GERD prevalence estimates was 18.1%–27.8% in North America, 8.8%–25.9% in Europe, 2.5%–7.8% in East Asia, 8.7%–33.1% in the Middle East, 11.6% in Australia and 23.0% in South America. Incidence per 1000 person-years was approximately 5 in the overall UK and US populations, and 0.84 in paediatric patients aged 1–17 years in the UK.

During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically. Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidites preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12-24 h, and may have little benefit beyond. Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 h of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis may be useful in delaying intervention, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality. In mild AP, oral feedings can be started immediately if there is no nausea and vomiting. In severe AP, enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent infectious complications, whereas parenteral nutrition should be avoided. Asymptomatic pancreatic and/or extrapancreatic necrosis and/or pseudocysts do not warrant intervention regardless of size, location, and/or extension. In stable patients with infected necrosis, surgical, radiologic, and/or endoscopic drainage should be delayed, preferably for 4 weeks, to allow the development of a wall around the necrosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2013.218", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1972516036", "source": "openalex"}

The major goal of enteral nutrient supply to these infants is to achieve growth similar to foetal growth coupled with satisfactory functional development. The accumulation of knowledge since the previous guideline on nutrition of preterm infants from the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in 1987 has made a new guideline necessary. Thus, an ad hoc expert panel was convened by the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in 2007 to make appropriate recommendations. The present guideline, of which the major recommendations are summarised here (for the full report, see http://links.lww.com/A1480 ), is consistent with, but not identical to, recent guidelines from the Life Sciences Research Office of the American Society for Nutritional Sciences published in 2002 and recommendations from the handbook Nutrition of the Preterm Infant.

The preferred food for premature infants is fortified human milk from the infant's own mother, or, alternatively, formula designed for premature infants. This guideline aims to provide proposed advisable ranges for nutrient intakes for stable‐growing preterm infants up to a weight of approximately 1800 g, because most data are available for these infants.

Intended for use by physicians and allied health professionals, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible and adjustable for individual patients. Specific recommendations are evidence-based wherever possible, and when such evidence is not available or inconsistent, recommendations are made based on the consensus opinion of the authors. To best characterize the evidence cited in support of the recommendations, the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup with minor modifications (Table 1).2 The strength of recommendations in the GRADE system is classified as strong (1) or weak (2). The quality of evidence supporting strong or weak recommendations is designated by one of three levels: high (A), moderate (B) or low-quality (C).2 This is a practice guideline for clinicians rather than a review article and interested readers can refer to several comprehensive reviews published recently.3-8 NAFLD, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; NAFL,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver; NASH, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis; T2DM, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; AST, Aspartate Aminotransferase; ALT, Alanine Aminotransferase; HOMA,Homeostatic Model Assessment; RCT; Randomized Controlled Trial; PIVENS: Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Non-diabetic patients with Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; TONIC; Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children; NAS, NAFLD Activity Score; CK18; Cytokeratin 18 Fragments; ELF, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Panel; TZD; Thiazolidinediones; UDCA: Ursodeoxycholic Acid; ANA; Anti Nuclear Antibody; ASMA: Anti Smooth Muscle Antibody; US; Ultrasound; CT: Computerized Tomography; MR; Magnetic Resonance. The definition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) requires that (a) there is evidence of hepatic steatosis, either by imaging or by histology and (b) there are no causes for secondary hepatic fat accumulation such as significant alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication or hereditary disorders (Table 2). In the majority of patients, NAFLD is associated with metabolic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. NAFLD is histologically further categorized into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Table 3). NAFL is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with no evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning of the hepatocytes. NASH is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without fibrosis. The incidence of NAFLD has been investigated in a limited number of studies. Two Japanese studies9, 10 reported an incidence rate of 31 and 86 cases of suspected NAFLD per 1,000 person-years respectively, whereas another study from England showed a much lower incidence rate of 29 cases per 100,000 person-years.11 More studies are needed to better understand the incidence of NAFLD across different age, ethnic, and geographic groups. The reported prevalence of NAFLD varies widely depending on the population studied and the definition used. The prevalence of histologically-defined NAFLD was 20% and 51% in two different studies comprised of potential living liver donors.12, 13 The reported prevalence of NAFLD when defined by liver ultrasound ranged between 17% and 46% depending on the population studied.4 In a study consisting of nearly 400 middle aged individuals, the prevalence of NAFLD defined by ultrasonography was 46% and the prevalence of histologically confirmed NASH was 12.2%.14 In the Dallas Heart Study, when assessed by MR spectroscopy the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population was 31%.15 The prevalence of suspected NAFLD when estimated using aminotransferases alone without imaging or histology ranged between 7% and 11%, but aminotransferases can be normal in individuals with NAFLD.4 In summary, estimates of the worldwide prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 6.3% to 33% with a median of 20% in the general population, based on a variety of assessment methods.4 On the other hand, the estimated prevalence of NASH is lower, ranging from 3 to 5%.4 The prevalence of NASH cirrhosis in the general population is not known. Obesity is a common and well documented risk factor for NAFLD. Both excessive BMI and visceral obesity are recognized risk factors for NAFLD. In patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, the prevalence of NAFLD can exceed 90% and up to 5% of patients may have unsuspected cirrhosis.4, 16-20 There is a very high prevalence of NAFLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).4 An ultrasonographic study of patients with T2DM showed a 69% prevalence of NAFLD.21 In another study, 127 of 204 diabetic patients displayed fatty infiltration on ultrasound, and 87% of the patients with fatty infiltration who consented to biopsy had histologic confirmation of NAFLD.22 High serum triglyceride levels and low serum HDL levels are very common in patients with NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD in individuals with dyslipidemia attending lipid clinics was estimated to be 50%.23 Age, gender and ethnicity are also associated with a differential prevalence for NAFLD.4 A number of studies have shown that the prevalence of NAFLD increases with age.24-28 The likelihood of disease progression to advanced fibrosis or mortality increases in older patients with NAFLD.29-31 Many recent studies have reported that male gender is a risk factor for fatty liver disease.4 For example, in a study of 26,527 subjects undergoing medical checkups, the prevalence of NAFLD was 31% in men and 16% in women.32 Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic individuals have significantly higher and non-Hispanic blacks have significantly lower prevalence of NAFLD.15, 33-35 The prevalence of NAFLD in American-Indian and Alaskan-Native populations appears lower, ranging from 0.6% to 2.2%, although the lack of histologic definition makes it likely that is an underestimate.36, 37 There are data to suggest that hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism, sleep apnea, and polycystic ovary syndrome independent of obesity are important risk factors for the presence of NAFLD (Table 4).3 The evolution of hepatic histologic changes in patients with NAFL and NASH has been investigated by several studies, but these generally included smaller number of patients and had relatively modest duration of follow-up.4, 7 Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that patients with simple steatosis have very slow, if any, histological progression, while patients with NASH can exhibit histological progression to cirrhotic-stage disease.4, 7 The long term outcomes of patients with NAFLD and NASH have been reported in several studies.31, 38-45 Their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this guideline, but their findings can be summarized as follows; (a) patients with NAFLD have increased overall mortality compared to matched control populations, (b) the most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD, NAFL and NASH is cardiovascular disease, and (c) patients with NASH (but not NAFL) have an increased liver-related mortality rate. Another piece of indirect evidence that supports the progressive nature of NASH is in the features of cryptogenic cirrhosis which is closely related to NAFLD.46, 47 Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have disproportionately high prevalence of metabolic risk factors (T2DM, obesity, metabolic syndrome) typical of patients with NAFLD, their liver biopsies frequently show one or more features of NASH, and studies have demonstrated the loss of histological features of NASH with the development of cirrhosis.4, 7, 46, 47 Patients with NAFLD are at increased risk for HCC, but this risk is likely limited to those with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.48-53 Several studies investigated the natural history of NASH cirrhosis in comparison to patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis.54-57 One large prospective US-based study55 observed a lower rate of decompensation and mortality in patients with NASH cirrhosis as compared to patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis. However, a more recent international study56 of 247 NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis followed over a mean duration of 85.6 ± 54.5 months showed an overall 10-year survival of 81.5% that was not different from matched patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis. Importantly, both studies have shown that patients with NASH cirrhosis are at significantly lower risk for HCC than patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis.55, 56 By definition, NAFLD indicates the lack of any evidence of ongoing or recent consumption of significant quantities of alcohol. However, the precise definition of significant alcohol consumption in patients with suspected NAFLD is uncertain. A recent consensus meeting58 concluded that, for NASH clinical trials candidate eligibility purposes, significant alcohol consumption be defined as >21 drinks per week in men and >14 drinks per week in women over a 2-year period prior to baseline liver histology. Furthermore, this group recommended that validated questionnaires should be used to quantify the amount of alcohol consumption in the context of clinical trials. The definition of significant alcohol consumption in the published NAFLD literature has been inconsistent and ranged from > 1 alcoholic drink (∼ 10 grams of alcohol per one drink unit) per day to > 40 grams per day, and published studies have not always used gender-specific definitions.59 If self-reported alcohol consumption details are not consistent with clinical suspicion when evaluating a patient with suspected NAFLD, confirmation with a family member or a close friend should be considered. Recommendation 1. Ongoing or recent alcohol consumption > 21 drinks on average per week in men and > 14 drinks on average per week in women is a reasonable definition for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating patients with suspected NAFLD in clinical practice. (Strength – 2, Quality - C) Some patients undergoing thoracic and abdominal imaging for reasons other than liver symptoms, signs or biochemistry may demonstrate unsuspected hepatic steatosis. While this phenomenon is not uncommon in clinical practice, studies have not systematically examined the characteristics or natural history of NAFLD in this patient population. Recommendations 2. When patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked-up accordingly. (Strength – 1, Evidence -A) 3. In patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption or medications. (Strength – 1, Evidence -A) 4. In patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who are asymptomatic and have normal liver biochemistries, a liver biopsy cannot be recommended. (Strength – 1, Evidence -B) It can be argued that there should be systematic screening for NAFLD, at least among higher-risk individuals attending diabetes and obesity clinics. However, at present there are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of NAFLD. As liver biochemistries can be within normal ranges in patients with NAFLD and NASH, they may not be sufficiently sensitive to serve as screening tests, whereas liver ultrasound is potentially more sensitive but it is expensive and cumbersome as a screening test. Recommendation 5. Screening for NAFLD in adults attending primary care clinics or high-risk groups attending diabetes or obesity clinics is not advised at this time due to uncertainties surrounding diagnostic tests and treatment options, along with lack of knowledge related to the long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening. (Strength – 1, Evidence -B) Anecdotal experience and some published studies suggest familial clustering and heritability of NAFLD,60-63 but conclusive studies are lacking. In a retrospective cohort study, Willner et al. observed that 18% of patients with NASH have a similarly affected first degree relative.61 A small familial aggregation study observed that patients with NAFLD have a significantly higher number of first degree relatives with cirrhosis and a trend towards familial clustering of NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis than matched healthy controls.62 In another familial aggregation study63 of overweight children with and without NAFLD, after adjusting for age, gender, race, and BMI, the heritability of MR-measured liver fat fraction was 0.386, and fatty liver was present in 18% of family members of children with NAFLD despite normal ALT and lack of obesity. Recommendation 6. Systematic screening of family members for NAFLD is currently not recommended. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) The diagnosis of NAFLD requires that (a) there is hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology, (b) there is no significant alcohol consumption, (c) there are no competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis, and (d) there are no co-existing causes for chronic liver disease. Common alternative causes of hepatic steatosis are significant alcohol consumption, hepatitis C, medications, parenteral nutrition, Wilson's disease, and severe malnutrition (Table 2). When evaluating a patient with newly suspected NAFLD, it is important to exclude co-existing etiologies for chronic liver disease including hemochromatosis, autoimmune liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and Wilson's disease.3 Mildly elevated serum ferritin is common in patients with NAFLD and it does not necessarily indicate increased iron stores.3, 64 Elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in patients with suspected NAFLD should lead to testing for genetic hemochromatosis. Mutations in the HFE gene occur with variable frequency in patients with NAFLD and their clinical significance is unclear.64 One should consider a liver biopsy to assess hepatic iron concentration and to exclude significant hepatic injury and fibrosis in a patient with suspected NAFLD with elevated serum ferritin and a homozygote or compound heterozygote C282Y mutation in the HFE gene.65 Elevated serum autoantibodies are common in patients with NAFLD and are generally considered to be an epiphenomenon.3 In a recently published large study from the NASH Clinical Research Network, positive serum autoantibodies, defined as ANA > 1:160 or ASMA >1:40 were present in 21% of patients with well-phenotyped NAFLD and were not associated with more advanced histologic features.66 Recommendations 7. When evaluating a patient with suspected NAFLD, it is essential to exclude competing etiologies for steatosis and co-existing common chronic liver disease. (Strength – 1, Evidence - A) 8. Persistently high serum ferritin and increased iron saturation, especially in the context of homozygote or heterozygote C282Y HFE mutations may warrant a liver biopsy. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 9. High serum titers of autoantibodies in association with other features suggestive of autoimmune liver disease (very high aminotransferases, high globulin) should prompt a more complete work-up for autoimmune liver disease. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) The natural history of NAFLD is fairly dichotomous – NAFL is generally benign whereas NASH can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Existing dogma posits that liver biopsy is the most reliable approach for identifying the presence of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, but it is generally acknowledged that biopsy is limited by cost, sampling error, and procedure-related morbidity and mortality. Serum aminotransferase levels and imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT, and MR do not reliably assess steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Therefore, there has been significant interest in developing clinical prediction rules and non-invasive biomarkers for identifying steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD,7 but their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this practice guideline. The presence of metabolic syndrome is a strong predictor for the presence of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD3, 7, 67-69 and may be used to best identify patients with persistently abnormal liver biochemistries who would benefit diagnostically and prognostically from a liver biopsy. There has been intense interest in non-invasive methods to identify advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD7;these include the NAFLD Fibrosis Score70, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel70 and transient elastography. The NAFLD Fibrosis Score is based on six readily available variables (age, BMI, hyperglycemia, platelet count, albumin, AST/ALT ratio) and it is calculated using the published formula (http://nafldscore.com). In a meta-analysis of 13 studies consisting of 3,064 patients,7 NAFLD Fibrosis Score has an AUROC of 0.85 for predicting advanced fibrosis (i.e., bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) and a score < −1.455 had 90% sensitivity and 60% specificity to exclude advanced fibrosis whereas a score > 0.676 had 67% sensitivity and 97% specificity to identify the presence of advanced fibrosis. The ELF panel consists of plasma levels of three matrix turnover proteins (hyaluronic acid, TIMP-1, and PIIINP) had an AUROC of 0.90 with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting advanced fibrosis.71 Circulating levels of cytokeratin-18 (CK18) fragments have been investigated extensively as novel biomarkers for the presence of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD.7, 72 Wieckowska et al., measured CK18 fragments in plasma that had been obtained from 44 consecutive patients with suspected NAFLD at the time of liver biopsy, and correlated the findings with hepatic immunohistochemistry data.70 Plasma CK18 fragments were markedly increased in patients with NASH compared with patients with simple steatosis or normal biopsies (median 765.7 U/L versus 202.4 U/L or 215.5 U/L, respectively; P < 0.001), and independently predicted NASH (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.18-3.22 for every 50 U/L increase). This observation was reproduced in several subsequent studies and a recent meta-analysis estimated that plasma CK18 levels have a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 87%, and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88) for steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD.7 Although these are very encouraging results, currently this assay is not commercially available. Furthermore, as each study utilized a study-specific cut-off value, there is not an established cut-off value for identifying steatohepatitis. Transient elastography, which measures liver stiffness non-invasively, has been successful in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Although a recent meta-analysis showed high sensitivity and specificity for identifying fibrosis in NAFLD,7 it has a high failure rate in individuals with a higher BMI. Furthermore, it is not commercially available in the United States. Other imaging tools such as MR elastography, although commercially available in the United States, is rarely used in clinical practice. A major limitation of these prediction models and biomarkers is that they have largely been investigated in cross-sectional studies and thus their utility in monitoring disease natural history, predicting outcomes or response to therapeutic intervention is unknown. Recommendations 10. As the metabolic syndrome predicts the presence of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD, its presence can be used to target patients for a liver biopsy. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 11. NAFLD Fibrosis Score is a clinically useful tool for identifying NAFLD patients with higher likelihood of having bridging fibrosis and/or cirrhosis. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 12. Although serum/plasma CK18 is a promising biomarker for identifying steatohepatitis, it is premature to recommend in routine clinical practice. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for characterizing liver histology in patients with NAFLD. However, it is expensive and carries some morbidity and very rare mortality risk. Thus, it should be performed in those who would benefit the most from diagnostic, therapeutic guidance, and prognostic perspectives. Recommendations 13. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk to have steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 14. The presence of metabolic syndrome and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score may be used for identifying patients who are at risk for steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 15. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected NAFLD in whom competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis and co-existing chronic liver diseases cannot be excluded without a liver biopsy. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) The management of patients with NAFLD consists of treating liver disease as well as the associated metabolic co-morbidities such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and T2DM. As patients with NAFLD without steatohepatitis have excellent prognosis from a liver standpoint, treatments aimed at improving liver disease should be limited to those with NASH. Many studies indicate that lifestyle modification may reduce aminotransferases and improve hepatic steatosis when measured either by ultrasound73-80 or MR imaging and spectroscopy.81-94 In a meta-analysis of 15 early case series and clinical studies spanning between 1967 through 2000, most studies reported reductions in aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis by ultrasound across a broad spectrum of diets of different caloric restriction intensities and macronutrient composition (low vs. high carbohydrate, low vs. high fat, saturated vs. unsaturated fat diets).95 However, these early studies were inconclusive as a result of being small, largely uncontrolled and few using histology as the primary endpoint. More recent uncontrolled studies also showed an improvement in aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis on histology with lifestyle modification.96-98 Orlistat (an enteric lipase inhibitor) in conjunction with lifestyle modification was investigated in two randomized controlled trials. In the study by Ziegler-Sagi et al.,99 orlistat reportedly improved ALT and steatosis by US, but its effect on liver histology could not be evaluated because the majority of patients did not undergo a follow-up liver biopsy. However, in the study by Harrison et al.,100 orlistat did not improve body weight or liver histology. The best evidence for weight loss as a means to improve liver histology in NASH comes from a trial that randomized 31 obese persons with NASH to intensive lifestyle changes (diet, behaviour modification and 200 minutes a week of moderate physical activity for 48 weeks) versus structured basic education alone.101 The intensive arm had 9.3% weight loss (versus 0.2% in the dietary counseling alone arm) and led to an improvement in steatosis, necrosis and inflammation, but not fibrosis. Importantly, participants with ≥ 7% weight loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS).101 There was a similar pattern in the study by Harrison et al.,100 where participants who lost > 5% body weight improved steatosis, whereas individuals with ≥ 9% weight loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and NAS. A number of recent studies used MR spectroscopy to assess changes in hepatic fat in response to lifestyle modification. The results from these studies using a variety of interventions, either by diet alone81, 83, 84, 89, 92, 93 or in combination with different exercise prescriptions,82, 85-88, 92, 94 have consistently reported a significant reduction in liver fat by an average of ∼40% (ranging from 20% to 81%). The degree of hepatic fat reduction was proportional to the intensity of the lifestyle intervention and generally required a body weight loss between ∼5 to 10%.82, 88, 92 The effect of exercise without dietary modification on hepatic steatosis was investigated in four studies using MR spectroscopy.102-105 Exercise programs consisted of 2-3 sessions a week of 30-60 minutes over a period of 6 to 12 weeks. In all but one study101 liver fat content diminished without a significant change in body weight. Recommendations 16. Weight loss generally reduces hepatic steatosis, achieved either by hypocaloric diet alone or in conjunction with increased physical activity. (Strength – 1, Evidence - A) 17. Loss of at least 3-5% of body weight appears necessary to improve steatosis, but a greater weight loss (up to 10%) may be needed to improve necroinflammation. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) 18. Exercise alone in adults with NAFLD may reduce hepatic steatosis but its ability to improve other aspects of liver histology remains unknown. (Strength – 1, Evidence - B) Several studies investigated the effect of metformin on aminotransferases and liver histology in patients with NASH. Early small, open-label studies demonstrated a reduction in insulin resistance and aminotransferases106-108 but no significant improvement in liver histology.107, 108 An open-label trial consisting of 110 patients with NASH received either metformin 2 grams/day (55 patients), vitamin E 800 IU/day (28 patients) or dietary-induced weight loss (27 patients) for 12 months.109 Aminotransferases improved more with metformin than with vitamin E or diet alone. However, there was only a modest improvement in hepatic steatosis and inflammation in the subset of 17 patients undergoing paired liver biopsies with metformin treatment. In a 48-week open-label study in 26 patients, metformin improved NASH activity in only 30% of patients, although interpretation of the study was confounded by a significant weight loss in the responders (19% lost more than 10 kilograms).110 Haukeland et al.112 reported a similar lack of efficacy in a larger (n=48) randomized control trial (RCT) of metformin vs. placebo with a similar dietary and exercise intervention in both groups. Other studies also failed to show major benefit for metformin on hepatic insulin sensitivity, aminotransferases111-116 or liver histology.111, 113, 116 A recent meta-analysis4 concluded that 6-12 months of metformin plus lifestyle intervention did not improve aminotransferases or liver histology, compared with lifestyle intervention alone, independently of metformin dose or the presence of diabetes. Recommendation 19. Metformin has no significant effect on liver histology and is not recommended as a specific treatment for liver disease in adults with NASH. (Strength – 1, Evidence - A) Several studies investigated the effect of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on aminotransferases and liver histology in adults with NASH. In an early uncontrolled open-label study117 in 22 subjects with biopsy-proven NASH, rosiglitazone improved aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis, ballooning and inflammation scores, but not fibrosis. But in a subsequent RCT, Ratziu et al.118 observed that rosiglitazone improved aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis, but not necroinflammation or fibrosis and its two-year open-label extension phase also showed similar results.119 Belfort et al.120 conducted a RCT of pioglitazone (45 mg/day) in patients with NASH who had impaired glucose tolerance or T2DM. Although there was a significant weight gain (2.5 ± 0.5 kg) with pioglitazone, it significantly improved aminotransferases, steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation. The NAS improved with pioglitazone in 73% compared to 24% of placebo-treated patients (P<0.001) and there was a trend towards improvement in fibrosis among patients randomized to pioglitazone (P=0.08). Aithal et al.121 performed a RCT of lifestyle intervention with either pioglitazone 30 mg/day or placebo for 12 months in a total of 74 patients with NASH. While steatosis did not improve significantly compared to placebo, hepatocellular injury and fibrosis improved significantly.1210 The PIVENS122 study is a large multicenter RCT that randomized 247 non-diabetic patients with NASH to pioglitazone (30 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), or placebo for 24 months. The primary endpoint was an improvement in NAS ≥ 2 points with at least 1 point improvement in hepatocellular ballooning and 1-point improvement in either the lobular inflammation or steatosis score, and no increase in the fibrosis score.122 It was achieved in 19% in the placebo group compared to 34% in the pioglitazone group (P=0.04 vs. placebo) and 43% in the vitamin E group (P=0.001 vs. placebo).122 Because this study consisted of two primary comparisons (pioglitazone vs. placebo and vitamin E vs. placebo), a P-value of 0.025 was considered to be significant a priori. Therefore, although there were histological benefits associated with pioglitazone, this study concluded that pioglitazone did not meet the primary end point. However, resolution of NASH, a key secondary end point, was achieved in significantly higher number of pati", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.25762", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963683487", "source": "openalex"}

Though the prevalence of this infection appears to be decreasing in many parts of the world, H. pylori remains an important factor linked to the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric malignanc and dyspeptic symptoms. Whether to test for H. pylori in patients with functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), patients taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, with iron deficiency anemia, or who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer remains controversial. H. pylori can be diagnosed by endoscopic or nonendoscopic methods. A variety of factors including the need for endoscopy, pretest probability of infection, local availability, and an understanding of the performance characteristics and cost of the individual tests influences choice of evaluation in a given patient. Testing to prove eradication should be performed in patients who receive treatment of H. pylori for peptic ulcer disease, individuals with persistent dyspeptic symptoms despite the test-and-treat strategy, those with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, and individuals who have undergone resection of early gastric cancer. Recent studies suggest that eradication rates achieved by first-line treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin have decreased to 70-85%, in part due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. Eradication rates may also be lower with 7 versus 14-day regimens. Bismuth-containing quadruple regimens for 7-14 days are another first-line treatment option. Sequential therapy for 10 days has shown promise in Europe but requires validation in North America. The most commonly used salvage regimen in patients with persistent H. pylori is bismuth quadruple therapy. Recent data suggest that a PPI, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin for 10 days is more effective and better tolerated than bismuth quadruple therapy for persistent H. pylori infection, though this needs to be validated in the United States.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01393.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152211277", "source": "openalex"}

Sixty-five consecutive patients with well-defined IPF were subjected to 24-h pH monitoring and oesophageal manometry. A total of 133 consecutive patients with intractable asthma and symptoms of GER were used as comparisons. The prevalence of abnormal acid GER in IPF patients was 87%, with 76% and 63% demonstrating abnormal distal and proximal oesophageal acid exposures, respectively. Abnormal acid GER was significantly more common in IPF patients than asthma patients. Only 47% of IPF patients experienced classic GER symptoms. Despite treatment with standard doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), 12 out of 19 patients receiving PPIs during the 24-h pH monitoring had abnormal oesophageal acid exposures by pH probe. There was no correlation between IPF severity and acid GER severity. In conclusion, abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux is highly prevalent, but often clinically occult in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Standard doses of proton pump inhibitors may not suppress the acid gastro-oesophageal reflux in this population. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine if acid abnormal gastro-oesophageal reflux represents an important risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis development or progression, and if optimal suppression of acid gastro-oesophageal reflux slows the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or decreases episodic exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.06.00037005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144469870", "source": "openalex"}

After a final round of adjustments based on these comments, a draft version was sent out to external reviewers. RESULTS: The 101 recommendations covered 12 topics related to the clinical management of chronic pancreatitis: aetiology (working party (WP)1), diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis with imaging (WP2 and WP3), diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (WP4), surgery in chronic pancreatitis (WP5), medical therapy (WP6), endoscopic therapy (WP7), treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts (WP8), pancreatic pain (WP9), nutrition and malnutrition (WP10), diabetes mellitus (WP11) and the natural course of the disease and quality of life (WP12). Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, 70 of the 101 (70%) recommendations were rated as 'strong' and plenary voting revealed 'strong agreement' for 99 (98%) recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The 2016 HaPanEU/United European Gastroenterology guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations concerning key aspects of the medical and surgical management of chronic pancreatitis based on current available evidence. These recommendations should serve as a reference standard for existing management of the disease and as a guide for future clinical research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640616684695", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2577520851", "source": "openalex"}

Nivolumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated superior overall survival versus chemotherapy at 12-month follow-up in gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the randomized, global CheckMate 649 phase 3 trial 5 (programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score ≥5 and all randomized patients). On the basis of these results, nivolumab plus chemotherapy is now approved as a first-line treatment for these patients in many countries 6 . Nivolumab and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab have distinct but complementary mechanisms of action that contribute to the restoration of anti-tumour T-cell function and induction of de novo anti-tumour T-cell responses, respectively 7–11 . Treatment combining 1 mg kg −1 nivolumab with 3 mg kg −1 ipilimumab demonstrated clinically meaningful anti-tumour activity with a manageable safety profile in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer 12 . Here we report both long-term follow-up results comparing nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone and the first results comparing nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone from CheckMate 649. After the 24.0-month minimum follow-up, nivolumab plus chemotherapy continued to demonstrate improvement in overall survival versus chemotherapy alone in patients with PD-L1 combined positive score ≥5 (hazard ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.61, 0.81) and all randomized patients (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.71, 0.88). Overall survival in patients with PD-L1 combined positive score ≥ 5 for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone did not meet the prespecified boundary for significance. No new safety signals were identified. Our results support the continued use of nivolumab plus chemotherapy as standard first-line treatment for advanced gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04508-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220909053", "source": "openalex"}

AIMS To examine the interaction between hiatus hernia and lower oesophageal sphincter hypotension. METHODS In seven normal subjects and seven patients with hiatus hernia, the squamocolumnar junction and intragastric margin of the gastro-oesophageal junction were marked with endoscopically placed clips. Axial and radial characteristics of the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone were mapped relative to the hiatus and clips during concurrent fluoroscopy and manometry. Responses to inspiration and abdominal compression were also analysed. RESULTS In normal individuals the squamocolumnar junction was 0.5 cm below the hiatus and the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone extended 1.1 cm distal to that. In those with hiatus hernia, the gastro-oesophageal junction high pressure zone had two discrete segments, one proximal to the squamocolumnar junction and one distal, attributable to the extrinsic compression within the hiatal canal. Inspiration and abdominal compression mainly augmented the distal one. Simulation of hernia reduction by algebraically summing the proximal segment pressures with the hiatal canal pressures restored normal maximal pressure, radial asymmetry, and dynamic responses of the gastro-oesophageal junction. CONCLUSIONS Hiatus hernia reduces lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and alters its dynamic responsiveness by spatially separating pressure components derived from the intrinsic lower oesophageal sphincter and the extrinsic compression of the oesophagus within the hiatal canal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.44.4.476", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156425129", "source": "openalex"}

AIMS To identify and synthesise findings from all articles on the performance of EUS in tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging of gastro-oesophageal carcinoma. SOURCE Published and unpublished English language literature, 1981–1996. METHODS Data on the staging performance of EUS were retrieved and evaluated. Summary receiver operator characteristic methodology was used for synthesis, and a summary estimate of performance, Q*, obtained. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess study validity and investigate reasons for differences in performance. RESULTS Twenty seven primary articles were assessed in detail. Thirteen supplied results for staging oesophageal cancer, 13 for gastric cancer, and four for cancers at the gastro-oesophageal junction. For gastric T staging, Q*=0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.95) and for oesophageal T staging, Q*=0.89 (95% CI 0.88–0.92). For gastro-oesophageal T staging, including cancers at the gastro-oesophageal junction, Q*=0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.93). Inclusion of cases with non-traversable stenosis was found to slightly reduce staging performance. For N staging, Q*=0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.83). In articles that compared EUS directly with incremental computed tomography, EUS performed better. None of the variables assessed in the regression analysis was significant using a Bonferroni correction. Three variables (anatomical location, traversability, and blinding) showed strong relationships for future research and validation. CONCLUSIONS EUS is highly effective for discrimination of stages T1 and T2 from stages T3 and T4 for primary gastro-oesophageal carcinomas. The failure rate of EUS from non-traversability of a stenotic cancer may be a limitation in some patient groups. * CT : computed tomography EUS : endoscopic ultrasound FPR : false positive rate SROC : summary receiver operating characteristic TNM : tumour, node, metastasis TPR : true positive rate", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.49.4.534", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096810410", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027852470", "title": "Appropriate Acid Suppression for the Management of Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease", "text": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) results from an abnormally prolonged dwell time of acidic gastric contents in the oesophagus. Although GORD is primarily a motor disorder, the injurious effects of gastric acid are central to the pathogenic process of oesophagitis, and the severity of disease correlates with the degree and duration of oesophageal acid exposure. In the majority of patients with mild disease, oesophageal acid exposure occurs predominantly during post-prandial periods. Conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists cannot overcome the integrated stimulus to acid secretion resulting from a meal, and are thus relatively ineffective in preventing daytime, post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure. In patients with more severe grades of oesophagitis, there are abnormally high levels of nocturnal acid exposure, with the intra-oesophageal pH being less than 4.0 for 36% of the time, compared with 5% of the time in patients with mild GORD. Control of nocturnal acid secretion thus becomes increasingly important. This may be made worse by relative gastric acid hypersecretion in some patients with severe GORD. The long duration of action and effective inhibition of meal-stimulated acid secretion probably explains the superiority of omeprazole in treating GORD. Preliminary meta-analysis shows that the healing rate of erosive oesophagitis at 8 weeks by antisecretory agents is directly related to the duration of suppression of gastric acid secretion achieved over a 24-hour period (r = 0.87; p < 0.05).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000200917", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027852470", "source": "openalex"}

In female patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, the present study examined the effects on health status of: 1) history of sexual abuse and physical abuse, 2) invasiveness or seriousness of sexual abuse and physical abuse, and 3) age at first sexual and physical abuse. Method: The sample included 239 female patients from a referral gastroenterology clinic who were interviewed to assess sexual and physical abuse history. Results: We found the following: 1) 66.5% of patients experienced some type of sexual and/or physical abuse; 2) women with sexual abuse history had more pain, non-GI somatic symptoms, bed disability days, lifetime surgeries, psychological distress, and functional disability compared to those without sexual abuse; 3) women with physical abuse also had worse health outcome on most health status indicators; 4) rape (intercourse) and life-threatening physical abuse seem to have worse health effects than less serious physical violence, and sexual abuse involving attempts and touch; and 5) those with first abuse in childhood did not appear to differ on health from those whose first abuse was as adults. Conclusions: The authors conclude that asking about abuse should be integrated into history taking within referral-based gastroenterology practices.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006842-199601000-00002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070641149", "source": "openalex"}

Methods : A telephone survey of 2500 subjects was performed using a validated questionnaire. The association of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (defined as the presence of heartburn or acid regurgitation) and their clinical characteristics with potential risk factors was summarized using the odds ratios (OR) obtained by multiple logistic regression. Results : The response rate was 71.2%. The annual prevalence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms was 31.6%[95% confidence interval (CI), 29.8–33.4] and the weekly prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI, 8.6–10.9). Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms were associated with excess weight (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.92), obesity (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.30–2.32), the psychosomatic symptom score (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.41–3.67) and the presence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms in a direct family member (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.17–2.23). Gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms of ≥ 10 years' duration were more frequent in obese subjects (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14–3.22) and those with a direct family member with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.44–4.06). Factors associated with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms of ≤ 1 year duration were a spouse with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.39–3.9) and the consumption of 1–5 aspirins/week (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.01–2.86). Conclusions : The prevalence of frequent gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms in Spain is lower than that observed in other Western populations. The psychosomatic symptom score is the factor most strongly associated with gastro‐oesophageal reflux symptoms.

In the field of gastroenterology, physicians handle large amounts of clinical data and various kinds of image devices such as endoscopy and ultrasound. AI has been applied in gastroenterology in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and image analysis. However, potential inherent selection bias cannot be excluded in the form of retrospective study. Because overfitting and spectrum bias (class imbalance) have the possibility of overestimating the accuracy, external validation using unused datasets for model development, collected in a way that minimizes the spectrum bias, is mandatory. For robust verification, prospective studies with adequate inclusion/exclusion criteria, which represent the target populations, are needed. DL has its own lack of interpretability.

Previous attempts of classification have been based primarily on anatomic location and behavior of disease. However, no uniform definition of patient subgroups has yet achieved broad acceptance. The aim of this international Working Party was to develop a simple classification of Crohn's disease based on objective variables. Eight outcome-related variables relevant to Crohn's disease were identified and stepwise evaluated in 413 consecutive cases, a database survey, and by clinical considerations. Allocation of variables was conducted with well-defined Crohn's disease populations from Europe and North America. Cross-table analyses were performed by chi-square testing. Three variables were finally elected: Age at Diagnosis [below 40 years (A1), equal to or above 40 years (A2)], Location [terminal ileum (L1), colon (L2), ileocolon (L3), upper gastrointestinal (L4)], and Behavior [nonstricturing nonpenetrating (B1), stricturing (B2), penetrating (B3)]. The allocation of patients to these 24 subgroups proved feasible and resulted in specific disease clusters. Cross-table analyses revealed associations between Age at Diagnosis and Location, and between Behavior and Location (all p < 0.001).

A similar positive association was found for table salt intake. The odds ratio for reflux was 1.7 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.0) among those who always used extra table salt compared with those who never did so.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1573236912", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guideline", "text": "INTRODUCTION Constipation is a chronic problem in many patients all over the world. In some groups of patients such as the elderly, constipation is a significant health care problem, but in the majority of cases chronic constipation is an aggravating, but not life threatening or debilitating, complaint that can be managed in primary care with cost-effective control of symptoms. The terminology associated with constipation is problematic. There are 2 pathophysiologies, which differ in principle but overlap: disorders of transit and evacuation disorders. The first can arise secondary to the second, and the second can sometimes follow from the first. This guideline focuses on adult patients and does not specifically discuss children or special groups of patients (such as those with spinal cord injury). Cascades: A Resource-sensitive Approach A gold standard approach is feasible for regions and countries in which the full range of diagnostic tests and medical treatment options are available for the management of all types and subtypes of constipation. A cascade is a hierarchical set of diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options for dealing with risk and disease, ranked according to the resources available. DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS The word “constipation” has several meanings, and the way it is used may differ not only between patients but also between different cultures and regions. In a Swedish population study, it was found that a need to take laxatives was the most common conception of constipation (57% of respondents). In the same study, women (41%) were twice as likely as men (21%) to regard infrequent bowel motions as representing constipation, whereas equal proportions of men and women regarded hard stools (43%), straining during bowel movements (24%), and pain when passing a motion (23%) as representing constipation. Depending on various factors—the diagnostic definition, demographic factors, and group sampling—constipation surveys show a prevalence of between 1% and >20% in western populations. In studies of the elderly population, up to 20% of community-dwelling individuals and 50% of institutionalized elderly persons reported symptoms. Functional constipation is generally defined as a disorder characterized by persistent difficult or seemingly incomplete defecation, and/or infrequent bowel movements (once every 3 to 4 d or less) in the absence of alarm symptoms or secondary causes. Differences in the medical definition and variations in the reported symptoms make it difficult to provide reliable epidemiologic data. Pathogenesis and Risk Factors Functional constipation can have many different causes, ranging from changes in diet, physical activity, or lifestyle to primary motor dysfunctions due to colonic myopathy or neuropathy. Constipation can also be secondary to evacuation disorder. Evacuation disorder may be associated with a paradoxical anal contraction or involuntary anal spasm, which may be an acquired behavioral disorder of defecation in two thirds of patients (Table 1).TABLE 1: Pathophysiology of Functional ConstipationAlthough physical exercise and a high-fiber diet may be protective, the following factors increase the risk of constipation (the association may not be causative): Aging (but constipation is not a physiological consequence of normal aging) Depression Inactivity Low calorie intake Low income and low education level Number of medications being taken (independent adverse effect profiles) Physical and sexual abuse Female sex—higher incidence of self-reported constipation in women Associated Conditions and Medications (Tables 2 and 3)TABLE 2: Possible Causes and Constipation-associated ConditionsTABLE 3: Medications Associated With ConstipationDIAGNOSIS Constipation is a common condition, and although a minority of patients seek medical care, in the United States alone this accounts for several million physician visits per year, whereas in the United Kingdom more than 13 million general practitioner prescriptions were written for laxatives in 2006. Gastrointestinal specialist help should focus on efficiently applying health care resources by identifying those patients who are likely to benefit from specialized diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Constipation An international panel of experts developed uniform criteria for the diagnosis of constipation—the Rome III criteria (Table 4).TABLE 4: Rome III Criteria for Functional ConstipationPatient Evaluation The medical history and physical examination in constipation patients should focus on identifying possible causative conditions and alarm symptoms. Stool consistency: This is regarded as a better indicator of colon transit than stool frequency (Fig. 1). Patient's description of constipation symptoms, symptom diary Bloating, pain, malaise Nature of stools Bowel movements Prolonged/excessive straining Unsatisfactory defecation Laxative use, past and present, frequency and dosage Current conditions, medical history, recent surgery, psychiatric illness Patient's lifestyle, dietary fiber, and fluid intake Use of suppositories or enemas, other medications (prescription or over-the-counter) Physical examination: Gastrointestinal mass Anorectal inspection: Fecal impaction Stricture, rectal prolapse, rectocele Paradoxical or nonrelaxing puborectalis activity Rectal mass If indicated: blood tests—biochemical profile, complete blood count, calcium, glucose, and thyroid function FIGURE 1: The Bristol Stool Form Scale: A measure to assist patients in reporting on stool consistency. Reproduced from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bristol_Stool_Chart.png. © 1997 Informa Healthcare.Alarm Symptoms (Table 5)TABLE 5: Alarm Symptoms in ConstipationIndications for Screening Tests Laboratory studies, imaging or endoscopy, and function tests are only indicated in patients with severe chronic constipation or alarm symptoms (Table 6).TABLE 6: Physiologic Tests for Chronic ConstipationTransit Measurement The 5-day marker retention study is a simple method for measuring colonic transit. Markers are ingested on one occasion and the remaining markers are counted on a plain abdominal radiograph 120 hours later. If >20% of the markers remain in the colon, transit is delayed. Distal accumulation of markers may indicate an evacuation disorder, and in typical cases of slow-transit constipation almost all markers remain and markers are seen in both the right and the left colon. Several companies produce markers, but markers can also be made from a patient-safe radiopaque tube by cutting it into small pieces (2 to 3 mm in length). A suitable number of markers (20 to 24) can be placed in gelatin capsules to facilitate ingestion. Clinical Evaluation Classification of the patient's constipation should be possible on the basis of the medical history and appropriate examination and testing (Table 7).TABLE 7: Constipation Categories Based on Clinical EvaluationCascade Options for Investigating Severe and Treatment-refractory Constipation Cascade: a hierarchical set of diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options for dealing with risk and disease, ranked according to the resources available. Level 1: Limited resources (a) Medical history and general physical examination (b) Anorectal examination, 1-week bowel habit diary card (c) Transit study using radiopaque markers (d) Balloon expulsion test Level 2: Medium resources (a) Medical history and general physical examination (b) Anorectal examination, 1-week bowel habit diary card (c) Transit study using radiopaque markers (d) Balloon expulsion test or defecography Level 3: Extensive resources (a) Medical history and general physical examination (b) Anorectal examination, 1-week bowel habit diary card (c) Transit study using radiopaque markers (d) Defecography or magnetic resonance proctography (e) Anorectal manometry (f) Sphincter electromyography TREATMENT Scheme for General Management of Constipation (Table 8)TABLE 8: General Management of ConstipationSymptomatic Approach If organic and secondary constipation have been evaluated and excluded, most cases can be managed adequately with a symptomatic approach. A graded approach to treatment is based on recommending changes in lifestyle and diet, stopping or reducing medications that cause constipation, and administering fiber supplementation or other bulk-forming agents. A gradual increase in fiber (either as standardized supplements or incorporated in the diet) and fluid intake is generally recommended. The second step in the graded approach is to add osmotic laxatives. The best evidence is for the use of polyethylene glycol, but there is also good evidence for lactulose. The new drugs, lubiprostone and linaclotide, act by stimulating ileal secretion and thus increasing fecal water. Prucalopride is also approved in many countries and in Europe. The third step includes stimulant laxatives, enemas, and prokinetic drugs. Stimulant laxatives can be given orally or rectally to stimulate colorectal motor activity. Prokinetic drugs are also meant to increase the propulsive activity of the colon, but in contrast to stimulant laxatives, which should only be taken occasionally; they are designed to be taken daily. Diet and Supplements Dietary modification may consist of a high-fiber diet (25 g of fiber) and fluid supplementation (up to 1.5 to 2.0 L/d) and may improve stool frequency and decrease the need for laxatives. There is no evidence that dietary and lifestyle measures have any effect on constipation in the elderly persons; fiber supplements and simple osmotic laxatives are usually an adequate approach for constipation in these patients. In patients with colonic dilation, fiber supplementation should be avoided. Psyllium supplements and lactulose may be appropriate for the treatment of chronic constipation. Medication Evacuation disorders respond poorly to standard oral laxative programs. If an evacuation disorder plays a considerable role in constipation, biofeedback and pelvic muscle training may be considered. Critical success factors are the patient's level of motivation, the frequency of the training program, and participation of a behavioral psychologist and dietitian. If a dietary approach fails, polyethylene glycol (17 g polyethylene glycol laxative for 14 d) or lubiprostone (24 mg twice daily) can be used to promote bowel function in patients with chronic constipation. Prokinetic agents (eg, the 5-HT4 receptor agonist prucalopride) can be used in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Simple laxative agents, such as milk of magnesia, senna, bisacodyl, and stool softeners are a reasonable choice for treating constipation. Surgery If there is persistent treatment failure in slow-transit constipation, then carefully selected, well-evaluated, and informed patients may benefit from total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. The exceptional indication for colectomy must be established in a specialized and experienced tertiary center. Disappointing results may be seen, with fecal incontinence due to surgery and recurrent constipation, especially in patients with evacuation disorder. Only very few patients benefit from a (reversible) colostomy to treat constipation. Evidence-based Summary (Table 9)TABLE 9: Summary: Evidence Base for the Treatment of Constipation*Cascade Options for Treatment of Chronic Constipation The following cascade is intended for patients with chronic constipation without alarm symptoms and with little or no suspicion of an evacuation disorder. The main symptoms would be hard stools and/or infrequent bowel movements.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1974062643", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines", "text": "INTRODUCTION Over the past couple of decades, it has become increasingly clear that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are now the number 1 cause of liver disease in the western countries. The prevalence of NAFLD has doubled during last 20 years, whereas the prevalence of other chronic liver diseases has remained stable or even decreased. More recent data confirm that NAFLD and NASH play an equally important role in the Middle East, Far East, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. NAFLD is a condition defined by excessive fat accumulation in the form of triglycerides (steatosis) in the liver. A subgroup of NAFLD patients displays liver cell injury and inflammation in addition to excessive fat (steatohepatitis). The latter condition, designated NASH, is virtually indistinguishable histologically from alcoholic steatohepatitis. While the simple steatosis of NAFLD does not correlate with increased short-term morbidity or mortality, progression of this condition to that of NASH dramatically increases the risks of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The exact cause of NASH has not been elucidated, and it is almost certainly not the same in every patient. Although it is most closely related to insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, not all patients with these conditions have NAFLD/NASH, and not all patients with NAFLD/NASH suffer from one of these conditions. NASH is a potentially fatal condition, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.Table: No title available.Cascades: A Resource-sensitive Approach A gold-standard approach is feasible for regions and countries in which the full scale of diagnostic tests and medical treatment options are available for the management of NASH. However, such resources are not available throughout much of the world. With their diagnostic and treatment cascades, the World Gastroenterology Organisation guidelines provide a resource-sensitive approach.Table: No title available.EPIDEMIOLOGY NASH is an increasingly common chronic liver disease with worldwide distribution that is closely associated with diabetes and obesity, which have both reached epidemic proportions. It is estimated that there are at least 1.46 billion obese adults worldwide. Approximately 6 million individuals in the USA are estimated to have progressed to NASH and some 600,000 to NASH-related cirrhosis. There are significant cultural and geographic differences in the prevalence of obesity. Whereas in most western countries, the preferred body image, especially in women, is very thin with minimal body fat, which is not necessarily true globally. In many other cultures, obesity is considered desirable and also regarded as a distinct sign of prosperity. In the USA, obesity is particularly epidemic in those from lower socioeconomic groups who rely heavily on diets provided by high-fat, high-calorie fast food outlets (junk food). The opposite is true in many poorer countries, where it is the well-to-do, better-educated population that has the highest prevalence of obesity (Table 1).TABLE 1: Estimated Prevalences of NAFLD and NASHDIAGNOSIS Diagnostic Strategy for NASH NASH represents the most severe histologic form of NAFLD, which is defined by fat accumulation in the liver exceeding 5% of its weight. Uniform criteria for diagnosing and staging NASH are still debated. Insulin resistance is related to obesity and is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In addition, oxidative stress and cytokines are important contributing factors, together resulting in steatosis and progressive liver damage in genetically susceptible individuals. The disease can remain asymptomatic for years, or can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Triggers for considering a diagnosis of NASH and starting testing of liver enzymes are: hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, a positive family history, nonblack ethnicity, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and a sedentary lifestyle (Figs. 1–3).Table: No title available.FIGURE 1: Management algorithm for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Studies with atorvastatin and pravastatin have shown improvement in histology in patients with NASH. NAFLD patients with dyslipidemia should be treated with statins. Patients with underlying liver disease do not seem to have any additional risk of statin toxicity. Serious hepatotoxicity from statins is rare.Table: No title available.Improving Insulin Sensitivity: Weight ReductionTable: No title available. Diet: A weight loss of 5% to 10% should be aimed for, and a 25% decrease in calories from the normal diet (ca. 2500 calories/d) for the patient's age and sex. A moderately calorie-restricted diet with modified macronutrient composition produces better results in comparison with a very low-caloric diet. Attention should be given to the role of a hypocaloric diet and counseling about the type of foods to be consumed—avoiding fructose and trans-fats present in soft drinks and fast foods, and increasing omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in diet. This may be difficult for the patient to adhere to, and many patients regain weight after an initial loss. Exercise: A moderate exercise program 3 to 4 times a week should be encouraged to achieve a heart rate of 60% to 75% of the age-based maximum. The efficacy of dietary and exercise measures should be assessed after a 6-month period; if they have been ineffective, additional therapeutic options such as pharmacologic therapy may then be considered. Weight loss (bariatric) surgery may be beneficial for patients with morbid obesity; again, this should be considered early, as most programs will decline such surgery for patients who are already cirrhotic. Limited studies have reported a dramatic improvement in liver disease, as well as other complications of metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance, following successful bariatric surgery. Drugs targeting insulin resistance, such as thiazolidinediones and metformin, are approved for diabetes therapy but not for NAFLD/NASH, and should be considered experimental (see the reference list below for more information and detailed discussion). Antioxidants and Antifibrotic Agents Antioxidants and antifibrotic agents, such as vitamin E and pentoxifylline, have not been approved for NASH/NAFLD treatment. For all of them, there are limited data and few if any data from double-blind controlled trials. They are all considered experimental (see the reference list below for more information and detailed discussion). Cascades: Options for Therapy See Table 3.TABLE 3: Therapy Cascades for Extensive, Medium, and Limited ResourcesSUMMARY NAFLD and NASH represent a major global public health problem, which is pandemic and affects rich and poor countries alike. There is insufficient evidence to justify screening for NASH/advanced liver disease in the general population. The diagnosis should be sought in all patients who present with risk factors for NASH. Not all patients with risk factors will have NAFLD or NASH, and not all patients with NASH will have standard risk factors. Not every person with fatty liver needs aggressive therapy. Diet and exercise should be instituted for all patients. Liver biopsy should be reserved for those patients who have risk factors for NASH and/or other liver diseases. Patients with NASH or risk factors for NASH should first be treated with diet and exercise. Vitamin E or pentoxifylline may be added in these patients. Experimental therapy should be considered only in appropriate hands and only in patients who fail to achieve a 5% to 10% weight reduction over 6 months to 1 year of successful lifestyle changes. Bariatric surgery should be considered in patients in whom the above approaches fail, and it should be performed before the patient becomes cirrhotic. Liver transplantation is successful in patients who meet the criteria for liver failure; however, NASH may recur after transplantation and is likely to be denied to patients with morbid obesity. NAFLD and NASH are also becoming an increasingly serious problem in pediatric patients, including those under the age of 10. Ultimately, NAFLD and NASH are diagnoses of exclusion and require careful consideration of other diagnoses. Just as the clinician cannot diagnose NASH on the basis of clinical data alone, the pathologist can document the histologic lesions of steatohepatitis, but cannot reliably distinguish those of nonalcoholic origin from those of alcoholic origin.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000000116", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1974062643", "source": "openalex"}

In Western countries, 20-40% of the adult population experience heartburn, which is the cardinal symptom of GORD, but only some 2% of adults have objective evidence of reflux oesophagitis. The incidence of GORD increases with age, rising dramatically after 40 years of age. There is also wide geographical variation in prevalence. Complications, including oesophageal ulcer and stricture, and Barrett's oesophagus, are found in up to 20% of patients with verified reflux oesophagitis. The signs and symptoms of GORD often wax and wane in intensity, and spontaneous remissions have been reported. In most cases, however, GORD is a chronic condition that returns shortly after discontinuing therapy. Although GORD causes substantial morbidity, the annual mortality rate due to GORD is very low (approximately 1 death per 100,000 patients), and even severe GORD has no apparent effect on longevity, although the quality of life can be significantly impaired. There are data to suggest that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contributes to oesophagitis and stricture formation in patients with GORD. Although these data are not conclusive, it seems prudent, if possible, to avoid the use of NSAIDs in patients with GORD, particularly those with oesophageal stricture.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000200911", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072166021", "source": "openalex"}

One of the strengths of this guideline is that the recommendations for treatment are based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of trial-based and network meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of dietary, pharmacological and psychological therapies in treating IBS. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, summarising both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, this guideline identifies novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need for future research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-324598", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3159143441", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2061938579", "title": "Current concepts in the management of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection—The Maastricht 2‐2000 Consensus Report", "text": "Significant progress and new insights have been gained in the 4 years since the first Maastricht Consensus Report, necessitating an update of the original guidelines. To achieve this, the European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group organized a meeting of specialists and experts from around the world, representatives from National Gastroenterology Societies and general practitioners from Europe to establish updated guidelines on the current management of Helicobacter pylori infection. The meeting took place on 21–22 September 2000. A ‘test and treat’ approach is recommended in adult patients under the age of 45 years (the age cut‐off may vary locally) presenting in primary care with persistent dyspepsia, having excluded those with predominantly gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug users and those with alarm symptoms. Diagnosis of infection should be by urea breath test or stool antigen test. As in the previous guidelines, the eradication of H. pylori is strongly recommended in all patients with peptic ulcer, including those with complications, in those with low‐grade gastric mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, in those with atrophic gastritis and following gastric cancer resection. It is also strongly recommended in patients who are first‐degree relatives of gastric cancer patients and according to patients’ wishes after full consultation. It is advised that H. pylori eradication is considered to be an appropriate option in infected patients with functional dyspepsia, as it leads to long‐term symptom improvement in a subset of patients. There was consensus that the eradication of H. pylori is not associated with the development of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in most cases, and does not exacerbate existing gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. It was agreed that the eradication of H. pylori prior to the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs reduces the incidence of peptic ulcer, but does not enhance the healing of gastric or duodenal ulcer in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. Treatment should be thought of as a package which considers first‐ and second‐line eradication therapies together. First‐line therapy should be with triple therapy using a proton pump inhibitor or ranitidine bismuth citrate, combined with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole. Second‐line therapy should use quadruple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline. Where bismuth is not available, second‐line therapy should be with proton pump inhibitor‐based triple therapy. If second‐line quadruple therapy fails in primary care, patients should be referred to a specialist. Subsequent failures should be handled on a case‐by‐case basis by the specialist. In patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, eradication therapy does not need to be followed by further antisecretory treatment. Successful eradica‐ tion should always be confirmed by urea breath test or an endoscopy‐based test if endoscopy is clinically indicated. Stool antigen test is the alternative if urea breath test is not available.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2002.01169.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061938579", "source": "openalex"}

This study aimed to evaluate typical symptoms and complications of GORD, and their associated risk factors, in a representative sample of the Italian population. <h3>Methods:</h3> 1533 adults from two Italian villages were approached to undergo symptom assessment using a validated questionnaire and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Data were obtained from 1033 individuals (67.4% response rate). <h3>Results:</h3> The prevalence of reflux symptoms was 44.3%; 23.7% of the population experienced such symptoms on at least 2 days per week (frequent symptoms). The prevalence rates of oesophagitis and Barrett’s oesophagus in the population were 11.8% and 1.3%, respectively. Both frequent (relative risk (RR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.9) and infrequent (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0) reflux symptoms were associated with the presence of oesophagitis. No reflux symptoms were reported by 32.8% of individuals with oesophagitis and 46.2% of those with Barrett’s oesophagus. Hiatus hernia was associated with frequent reflux symptoms and oesophagitis, and was present in 76.9% of those with Barrett’s oesophagus. We found no association between body mass index and reflux symptoms or oesophagitis. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> GORD is common in Italy, but the prevalence of Barrett’s oesophagus in the community is lower than has been reported in selected populations. Both frequent and infrequent reflux symptoms are associated with an increased risk of oesophagitis. Individuals with oesophagitis and Barrett’s oesophagus often have no reflux symptoms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2007.145177", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121758465", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the present study was to examine whether an inflammation-based prognostic score (Glasgow Prognostic score, GPS) was associated with survival, in patients with inoperable gastro-oesophageal cancer. Patients diagnosed with inoperable gastro-oesophageal carcinoma and who had measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein concentrations, at the time of diagnosis, were studied (n=258). Clinical information was obtained from a gastro-oesophageal cancer database and analysis of the case notes. Patients with both an elevated C-reactive protein (>10 mg l−1) and hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g l−1) were allocated a GPS score of 2. Patients in whom only one of these biochemical abnormalities was present were allocated a GPS score of 1, and patients with a normal C-reactive protein and albumin were allocated a score of 0. On multivariate survival analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.02–1.46, P<0.05), stage (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30–1.83, P<0.001), the GPS (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.22–1.86, P<0.001) and treatment (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.80–3.56, P<0.001) were significant independent predictors of cancer survival. A 12-month cancer-specific survival in patients with stage I/II disease receiving active treatment was 67 and 60% for a GPS of 0 and 1, respectively. For stage III/IV disease, 12 months cancer-specific survival was 57, 25 and 12% for a GPS of 0, 1 and 2, respectively. In the present study, the GPS predicted cancer-specific survival, independent of stage and treatment received, in patients with inoperable gastro-oesophageal cancer. Moreover, the GPS may be used in combination with conventional staging techniques to improve the prediction of survival in patients with inoperable gastro-oesophageal cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjc.6602998", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2094703627", "source": "openalex"}

Since recent studies in animals suggest that nitric oxide (NO) is implicated physiologically in the inhibitory responses of the lower oesophageal sphincter, we have investigated whether the synthesis of NO is altered in the gastro-oesophageal junction of patients with achalasia. NO synthase activity was investigated in samples of tissue from the gastro-oesophageal junction obtained during surgery in eight patients with typical achalasia and six non-achalasic controls who underwent oesophagectomy for reasons other than sphincter dysfunction. The NO synthase activity was determined by the transformation of 14C-L-arginine into 14C-L-citrulline in tissue homogenates. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of the tissues was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide sequence of rat brain NO synthase. Furthermore, the relaxant response to an exogenous NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) was measured in vitro in muscle strips obtained from two patients with achalasia and in two non-achalasic controls. NO synthase activity was detected in each of the samples obtained from six control patients (0.59 +/- 0.21 pmol mg-1 min-1; mean +/- SE). By contrast, none of the samples obtained from the eight patients with achalasia had any detectable NO synthase activity. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of NO synthase in the myenteric plexus of the gastro-oesophageal junction of control patients and its absence in achalasia. SNP relaxed muscle strips precontracted with bethanechol in both control samples and those from patients with achalasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2362.1993.tb01292.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056169163", "source": "openalex"}

The gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor type B agonist, baclofen, is a potent inhibitor of TLOSRs in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of baclofen on TLOSRs and postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux disease. Methods: In 20 patients with reflux disease, oesophageal motility and pH were measured, with patients in the sitting position, for three hours after a 3000 kJ mixed nutrient meal. On separate days at least one week apart, 40 mg oral baclofen or placebo was given 90 minutes before the meal. Results: Baclofen reduced the rate of TLOSRs by 40% from 15 (13.8–18.3) to 9 (5.8–13.3) per three hours (p&lt;0.0002) and increased basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Baclofen also significantly reduced the rate of reflux episodes by 43% from 7.0 (4.0–12.0) to 4.0 (1.5–9) per three hours (median (interquartile range); p&lt;0.02). However, baclofen had no effect on oesophageal acid exposure (baclofen 4.9% (1.7–12.4) <i>v</i> placebo 5.0% (2.7–15.5)). Conclusions: In patients with reflux disease, the GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen significantly inhibits gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes by inhibition of TLOSRs. These findings suggest that GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists may be useful as therapeutic agents for the management of reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.50.1.19", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156522371", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2056304431", "title": "American College of Gastroenterology Monograph on the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Chronic Idiopathic Constipation", "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation ((CIC) also referred to as functional constipation) are two of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. IBS is a global problem, with anywhere from 5 to 15% of the general population experiencing symptoms that would satisfy a definition of IBS (1,2). In a systematic review on the global prevalence of IBS, Lovell and Ford (1) documented a pooled prevalence of 11% with all regions of the world suffering from this disorder at similar rates. Given its prevalence, the frequency of symptoms, and their associated debility for many patients and the fact that IBS typically occurs in younger adulthood, an important period for furthering education, embarking on careers, and/or raising families, the socioeconomic impact of IBS is considerable. These indirect medical costs are frequently compounded by the direct medical costs related to additional medical tests and the use of various medical and nonmedical remedies that may have limited impact. CIC is equally common; in another systematic review, Suares and Ford (3) reported a pooled prevalence of 14%, and also noted that constipation was more common in females, in older subjects, and those of lower socioeconomic status (3). Chronic constipation has also been linked to impaired quality of life (4), most notably among the elderly (5). Neither IBS nor CIC are associated with abnormal radiologic or endoscopic abnormalities, nor are they associated with a reliable biomarker; diagnosis currently rests entirely, therefore, on clinical grounds. Although a number of clinical definitions of both IBS and CIC have been proposed, the criteria developed through the Rome process, currently in its third iteration, have been those most widely employed in clinical trials and, therefore, most relevant to any review of the literature on the management of these disorders. According to Rome III, IBS is defined on the basis of the presence of: Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort at least 3 days/month in the past 3 months associated with two or more of the following: Improvement with defecation Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool These criteria should be fulfilled for the past 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis (6). Rome III defines functional constipation as: the presence of two or more of the following: Straining during at least 25% of defecations Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations Manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor) Fewer than three defecations per week Furthermore, loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives and there are insufficient criteria for IBS. Again, these criteria should be fulfilled for the past 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis (6). In Rome III, IBS is subtyped according to predominant bowel habit as IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed type (IBS-M), and unclassified (IBS-U). The definition of bowel habit type is, in turn, based on the patient's description of stool form by referring to the Bristol Stool Scale (7). The recognition that IBS sufferers segregate into subtypes according to predominant bowel habit, together with research findings suggesting that IBS-C and IBS-D may be pathophysiologically distinct entities (8,9,10), led to the development of therapies specifically directed at each of these subtypes. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that symptoms may not be stable over a lifetime and individuals may exhibit one IBS subtype during a period, and then a different IBS subtype during another period in their lives. However, although there is general awareness of the Rome criteria, they are infrequently employed in the assessment of IBS and CIC in clinical practice (11). To provide more \"clinician friendly\" definitions, as well as to permit inclusion of studies that predated the Rome process, American College of Gastroenterology Task Forces suggested the following definitions in prior systematic reviews: IBS is defined by: abdominal discomfort associated with altered bowel habits (12). Constipation is defined as: a symptom-based disorder defined as unsatisfactory defecation and is characterized by infrequent stools, difficult stool passage, or both. Difficult stool passage includes straining, a sense of difficulty passing stool, incomplete evacuation, hard/lumpy stools, prolonged time to stool, or need for manual maneuvers to pass stool. CIC is defined as the presence of these symptoms for at least 3 months (13). It is important to note that the Rome III criteria state that individuals with chronic constipation do not fulfill criteria for IBS, with pain or discomfort being a major determinant in the latter. In practice, a clear separation between CIC and IBS with constipation may be challenging and studies have shown, not only considerable overlap between these entities (14,15,16), but also a significant tendency for patients to migrate between these diagnoses over time (15). It is appropriate therefore that in this update of prior American College of Gastroenterology monographs on IBS and CIC, these entities be addressed in the same exercise (12,13,17). The goal of this exercise, therefore, was to update the most recent systematic reviews commissioned by the American College of Gastroenterology on IBS from 2009 (17) and CIC from 2005 (13). METHODS We have conducted a series of systematic reviews on the efficacy of therapy in IBS and CIC. There have been several systematic reviews of therapy for IBS and CIC published in the past 5 years (18,19,20,21,22). There have been considerable data published in the intervening time, and hence we have, therefore, updated all these systematic reviews of IBS and CIC and synthesized the data, including the information from new trials, where appropriate. The primary objective of this exercise was to assess the efficacy of available therapies in treating IBS and CIC compared with placebo or no treatment. The secondary objectives included assessing the efficacy of available therapies in treating IBS according to predominant stool pattern reported (IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhea, and mixed IBS), as well as assessing adverse events with therapies for both IBS and CIC. Systematic review methodology We evaluated manuscripts that studied adults (aged >16 years) using any definition of IBS or CIC. For IBS, this included a clinician-defined diagnosis, the Manning criteria (23), the Kruis score (24), or Rome I (25), II (26), or III (6) criteria. For CIC, this included symptoms diagnosed by any of the Rome criteria (6,25,26), as well as a clinician-defined diagnosis. We included only parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active intervention with either placebo or no therapy. Crossover trials were eligible for inclusion, provided extractable data were provided at the end of the first treatment period, before crossover. For IBS, the following treatments were considered: Diet and dietary manipulation Fiber Interventions that modify the microbiota: probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics Antispasmodics Peppermint oil Loperamide Antidepressants Psychological therapies, including hypnotherapy Serotonergic agents Prosecretory agents Polyethylene glycol For CIC, the following were considered: Fiber Osmotic and stimulant laxatives 5-HT4 agonists Prosecretory agents Biofeedback Bile acid transporter inhibitors Probiotics Subjects needed to be followed up for at least 1 week. To be eligible, trials needed to include one or more of the following outcome measures: Global assessment of improvement in IBS or CIC symptoms Improvement in abdominal pain for IBS Global IBS symptom or abdominal pain scores for IBS Mean number of stools per week during therapy for CIC Search strategy for identification of studies MEDLINE (1946 to October 2013), EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947 to October 2013), and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched.

The search was limited to humans. No restrictions were applied with regard to language of publication. A recursive search of the bibliography of relevant articles was also conducted. DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW (United European Gastroenterology Week) abstract books were hand searched between 2000 and 2013. Authors of trial reports that did not give enough detail for adequate data extraction were contacted and asked to contribute full data sets. Experts in the field were contacted for leads on unpublished studies. Trials were assessed for risk of bias according to the methods described in the Cochrane handbook [27] using the following characteristics: method used to generate the randomization schedule, method used to conceal treatment allocation, implementation of masking, completeness of follow-up, and conduct of an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligibility, quality, and outcome data were extracted by the lead reviewer (Alexander Ford) and by a masked second reviewer (Paul Moayyedi) on to specially developed forms. Any discrepancy was resolved by discussion between the two reviewers in order to reach a consensus. Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, where all dropouts were assumed to be treatment failures, wherever trial reporting allowed this. Data synthesis For IBS, whenever possible, any improvement of global IBS symptoms as a binary outcome was taken as the primary outcome measure. If this was not available, improvement in abdominal pain was used. For CIC, any improvement of global CIC symptoms as a binary outcome was taken as the primary outcome measure. The impact of interventions was expressed as a relative risk (RR) of IBS or CIC symptoms not improving, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If there were sufficient data, RRs were combined using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model (28) to give a more conservative estimate of the efficacy of individual IBS therapies. For continuous data, such as global IBS symptom scores or individual IBS symptom scores, a standardized mean difference, with 95% CIs, was calculated. It should be noted that some treatments may be beneficial in IBS or CIC because of the effects on outcomes other than global symptoms or abdominal pain, but this was not evaluated and was outside of the scope of this review. Tests of heterogeneity were reported (29). When the test of heterogeneity was significant (P<0.10 and/or I2>25%), the reasons for this were explored by evaluating differences in study population, study design, or study end points in subgroup analyses. Publication bias or other causes of small study effects were evaluated using tests for funnel plot asymmetry (30), where sufficient studies were identified (31). The number needed to treat (NNT), which is the number of patients who would need to receive active therapy, over and above the control therapy, for one to experience an improvement in symptoms, and the number needed to harm (NNH), which is the number of patients who would need to receive active therapy, over and above the control therapy, for one to experience an adverse event were calculated as the inverse of the risk difference from the meta-analysis and checked using the formula: NNT = 100 / RRR × BR, where BR is baseline risk and RRR is relative risk reduction. Methodology for assessing levels of evidence and grading recommendations We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system for grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation for each medical intervention (32). The system has been widely used in evidence-based guidelines and is endorsed by all major gastrointestinal societies (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org). The quality of the evidence is based on the study design, as well as the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias that exists for the evidence supporting the intervention (33). Quality of evidence is described as high to very low, depending on the extent to which further evidence would change the estimate of treatment effect (Box 1). The grading scheme also classifies recommendations as strong or weak, according to the quality of the evidence, applicability to all patient groups, balance of benefits and risks, patient preferences, and cost. With this graded recommendation, the clinician receives guidance about whether or not recommendations should be applied to most patients, and whether or not recommendations are likely to change in the future after production of new evidence. \"Strong\" recommendations represent a \"recommendation that can apply to most patients in most circumstances and further evidence is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect.\" The summary of the evidence for IBS is presented in Table 1, the reasons for the decision on the quality of that evidence in Table 2, and the reasons for the strength of recommendation in Table 3. Similarly, the summary of the evidence for CIC is presented in Table 4, the reasons for the decision on quality of the evidence in Table 5, and the reasons for the strength of recommendation in Table 6.Box 1.: Interpretation of the grading of the quality of evidenceTable 1: Summary of results of monograph on interventions for IBSTable 2: Reasons for quality of evidence of assessment for IBS data according to GRADE criteriaTable 2: Continued.Table 3: Reasons for strength of recommendation for IBS therapies according to GRADE criteriaTable 4: Summary of results of monograph on interventions for CICTable 5: Reasons for quality of evidence of assessment of data on CIC according to GRADE criteriaTable 6: Reasons for strength of recommendation for treatments of CIC according to GRADE criteriaRESULTS Irritable bowel syndrome 1. Diet and dietary manipulation in IBS (a) Role of diet in IBS: Although food intake is one of the most common precipitants of symptoms in IBS (34), responses to food ingestion and interactions with components of the diet have not typically undergone rigorous evaluation in the context of a blinded trial. Based on their own experiences, IBS sufferers have generated their own theories to explain this phenomenon or seek guidance from other, usually unsupported, dietary remedies. Many IBS patients commonly believe that they have an allergy to certain foods, although true food allergies are uncommon in IBS (35). Thus, although the prevalence of true food allergies in Western societies is between 1 and 3% in adults, surveys of gastrointestinal clinic patients found that 30–50% believed that their symptoms represented food allergy or food intolerance (35,36,37). Most food-related IBS symptoms appear to represent food intolerance, although only 11–27% of patients can accurately identify the presumed offending food when re-challenged in a double-blind manner (38). Based on their own experiences with food, and despite a lack of objective evidence to incriminate a specific food, studies have shown that a majority of IBS patients institute dietary changes (39,40,41), sometimes to an extent that may compromise their nutrition (42). (b) Role of dietary manipulation in IBS:Specialized diets may improve symptoms in individual IBS patients. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: very low. We identified 12 RCTs that evaluated dietary intervention in IBS (43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54). Following exclusions due to nonextractable data (46,48,50,52,53,54), lack of relevant symptom data (45,49,51), and an intervention lasting <1 week (46), three evaluable RCTs involving 230 patients remained (43,44,47). The first of these addressed the impact of gluten in IBS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 34 patients with IBS were randomized to either remain on a gluten-free diet or to receive 16 g/day of gluten on completion of an open gluten-free run-in phase (44). In the gluten group, 68% (13/19) reported that their symptoms were not adequately controlled as compared with 6/15 (40%) in the placebo group. Continuous symptom scores for abdominal pain, bloating, satisfaction with stool consistency, and tiredness were statistically significantly better in those who maintained a gluten-free diet. The second of these studies examined the contribution of food allergy or hypersensitivity as assessed, not by immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies, but by IgG antibodies (43). In a double-blind, parallel-group trial, 150 IBS patients were randomized to either an exclusion diet based on the presence of IgG antibodies to various foods or a sham diet. Participants were followed for 12 weeks and symptoms assessed using a global impact score and the IBS severity score. Compared with 11/66 (17%) in the sham diet group (P=0.14), 28% (18/65) in the exclusion diet intervention arm noted a significant improvement in symptoms. The authors reported marginal statistical significance in those with high adherence to their diet. The third study examined the role of FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). Forty-one IBS patients were randomized to a low-FODMAP diet or their regular (habitual) diet for 4 weeks (47). Of those randomized to the low-FODMAP diet, 68% (13/19) reported adequate control of their symptoms compared with 5/22 (23%) of the habitual diet group (P=0.005). Stool consistency did not differ between groups; stool frequency was less in the low-FODMAP diet group. A significant limitation of this study was the lack of blinding regarding the dietary intervention. Summary: Belatedly perhaps, the role of dietary components in the precipitation of symptoms, or even in the basic pathogenesis of IBS, is now being addressed. To date, two mechanisms, intolerance and hypersensitivity, have been addressed in clinical trials, although it is highly plausible that other mechanisms (e.g., stimulation of gut hormones and interactions with the microbiota) may also be relevant to the effects of food or food components. While recognizing the challenges that any investigation of the role of an individual's diet or of a specific food component in IBS present, the current data provide limited guidance on the role of diet in the management of IBS. Gluten-free and low-FODMAP diets show promise but their precise role(s) in the management of IBS need to be defined. 2. Fiber in IBS Fiber provides overall symptom relief in IBS. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: moderate. Psyllium, but not bran, provides overall symptom relief in IBS. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: moderate. Increased intake of dietary fiber is frequently recommended to improve bowel function for IBS, particularly for constipation-related symptoms. However, insoluble fibers frequently cause bloating and abdominal discomfort. In updating our prior systematic review (18), we identified two additional studies for a total of 14 RCTs (55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69) involving 906 patients. All but five trials did not differentiate IBS by subtype and only two restricted recruitment to IBS-C (58,66). In the largest study to date, 275 patients, of whom 53–58% were IBS-C and 19–29% were IBS-D, were randomized to one of three arms: 10 g of the soluble fiber psyllium, 10 g of the insoluble fiber bran, or 10 g of a placebo once daily for 12 weeks (57). During the first month, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving psyllium, but not bran, reported adequate symptom relief for at least 2 weeks compared with placebo (57% vs. 35% psyllium vs. placebo; RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13–2.26). Bran was more effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% vs. 32%; 1.70, 1.12–2.57). After 3 months of treatment, symptom severity in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points compared with 49 points in the placebo group (P=0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P=0.61 vs. placebo). No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Dropout was most common in the bran group; most commonly because of exacerbation in IBS. Data on overall adverse events were only provided by six trials (57,58,60,64,65,69). These trials evaluated 566 patients, but as numbers of adverse events were so small in 5 of the trials, pooling of data was not carried out. A total of 130 (38.8%) of 335 patients receiving fiber reported adverse events compared with 63 (27.3%) of 231 in the placebo arms. Summary: Although its use in the management of IBS is time honored, the status of fiber, in general, in IBS, is far from straightforward. Insoluble fibers may exacerbate symptoms and provide little relief; soluble fibers and psyllium, in particular, provide relief in IBS. These latter effects appear to transcend expected benefits in terms of relief of constipation. 3. Interventions that modify the microbiota: probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics The suggestion that the gut bacteria could be relevant to IBS first came from the observation that a small, although definite, proportion of individuals who suffer an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis will go on to develop IBS de novo; postinfectious IBS (70). Although bacterial fermentation has been linked to bloating and flatulence and changes in the microbiota have been described in IBS, the contribution of the microbiota to these, or other symptoms in IBS, is unclear. Thus, although both small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (71) and quantitative and qualitative changes in the fecal microbiota (72) have also been linked to IBS (73), the overall contribution of SIBO to IBS remains controversial (74), and findings in relation to the microbiota require confirmation in larger patient populations. Prebiotics, probiotics, and prebiotic–probiotic preparations have been used for decades on an empirical basis by IBS sufferers; they have only recently been subjected to scrutiny in clinical trials. The interpretation of probiotic studies in IBS remains challenging as studies have employed different species, strains, preparations, and doses in various patient populations and often in substandard trials. Although initial studies, employing the lactulose hydrogen breath test, suggested that more than \"three quarters\" of all IBS sufferers had SIBO (75), subsequent studies have, in general, failed to confirm such a high prevalence of SIBO in IBS (73,74). These divergent results may relate to problems inherent to the lactulose breath hydrogen test that may provide an overestimation of the true positive rate (73). Nevertheless, this finding provided a rationale for assessing antibiotics in IBS. Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in IBS-D, and although statistically significant improvements were demonstrated over placebo in global IBS symptoms as well as in bloating, it is important to note that tests for SIBO were not performed in these pivotal trials, leaving the mechanism of action of rifaximin in IBS unclear (76). (a) Prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend prebiotics or synbiotics in IBS. Recommendation: weak. Quality of evidence: very low. (b) Probiotics in IBS:Taken as a whole, probiotics improve global symptoms, bloating, and flatulence in IBS.

The prevalence, clinical spectrum and health care‐seeking behaviour of subjects with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were studied. Methods : Ethnic Chinese (3605) were invited to participate in a telephone survey using a validated gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results : A total of 2209 subjects (58% female; mean age, 40.3 years) completed the interview. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence rates of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease were 29.8%, 8.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms were associated with non‐cardiac chest pain [odds ratio (OR), 2.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7–3.1], dyspepsia (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.5), globus (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.7), acid feeling in the stomach (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 4.5–7.5) and the use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.6), but not with dysphagia, bronchitis, asthma, hoarseness and pneumonia. Patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease had a significantly higher anxiety and depression score and required more days off work when compared with subjects without. The frequency of heartburn ( P = 0.032), female gender ( P &lt; 0.001), degree of depression ( P = 0.004) and social morbidity ( P &lt; 0.001) were independent factors associated with health care‐seeking behaviour. Conclusion : The prevalence of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease was lower than that in Western populations, but carried a significant socio‐economic burden in the studied Chinese population.

In order to assess the validity of this suggestion, we examined the risk of oesophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's and with GORD compared with the general population in a community based cohort study.Cohorts of patients with Barrett's (n = 1677), oesophagitis (n = 6392), and simple reflux (n = 6328), and a reference cohort (n = 13416) were selected from the General Practice Research Database. The last three cohorts were matched to the Barrett's cohort by general practitioner practice, age, and sex. Cox's regression analysis was used to calculate relative risks for oesophageal cancer. Standardised incidence ratio methodology was used to estimate the relative risks for oesophageal adenocarcinoma.A total of 137 oesophageal cancers were identified, of which 94 prevalent cases were excluded. The hazard ratios for oesophageal cancer were 10.6 (5.1-22.0), 2.2 (0.9-5.2), and 1.7 (0.7-4.5) in the Barrett's, oesophagitis, and reflux cohorts compared with the reference cohort, respectively. The corresponding relative risks for oesophageal adenocarcinoma were 29.8 (9.6-106), 4.5 (1.04-19.6), and 3.1 (0.6-14.2).Barrett's oesophagus increases the risk of oesophageal cancer approximately 10 times and oesophageal adenocarcinoma approximately 30 times compared with the general population. There is only a modestly increased risk of oesophageal cancer in patients with reflux who have no record of Barrett's oesophagus. Our findings therefore do not support the suggestion that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease itself predisposes to cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2003.028076", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100503989", "source": "openalex"}

The symptom‐based management of GERD in primary care may be further optimised with the use of a questionnaire. Aim To assess the diagnostic validity of the GerdQ questionnaire in patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD . Methods Patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD without alarm features, underwent upper endoscopy, and if normal, pH‐metry. Patients were followed for 4 weeks and GerdQ was completed blinded to the investigator at both visits. Reflux oesophagitis or pathological acid exposure was used as diagnostic references for GERD . The diagnostic accuracy for GERD on symptom response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was assessed. Results Among the 169 patients, a GerdQ cutoff ≥9 gave the best balance with regard to sensitivity, 66% (95% CI: 58–74), and specificity, 64% (95% CI: 41–83), for GERD . The high prevalence of reflux oesophagitis (81%) resulted in a high proportion of true positives, but at the same time a high proportion of false‐negatives. Consequently, GerdQ had a high positive predictive value, 92% (95% CI: 86–97), but a low negative predictive value, 22% (95% CI: 13–34), for GERD . Symptom resolution on PPI therapy had high sensitivity, 76% (95% CI: 66–84), but low specificity, 33% (95% CI: 17–53), for GERD . Conclusions GerdQ is a useful complementary tool for the diagnosis of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease in primary care. The implementation of GerdQ could reduce the need for upper endoscopy and improve resource utilisation.

Early detection of cholestatic jaundice by the primary care physician and timely, accurate diagnosis by the pediatric gastroenterologist are important for successful treatment and a favorable prognosis. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in the infant. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee, consisting of a primary care pediatrician, a clinical epidemiologist (who also practices primary care pediatrics), and five pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature integrated with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through the Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee examined the value of diagnostic tests commonly used for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice and how those interventions can be applied to clinical situations in the infant. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, indications for consultation by a pediatric gastroenterologist, and recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee recommends that any infant noted to be jaundiced at 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin. However, breast-fed infants who can be reliably monitored and who have an otherwise normal history (no dark urine or light stools) and physical examination may be asked to return at 3 weeks of age and, if jaundice persists, have measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin at that time. This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition on the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also endorsed these recommendations. These recommendations are a general guideline and are not intended as a substitute for clinical judgment or as a protocol for the care of all patients with this problem.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00005176-200408000-00001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1994271325", "source": "openalex"}

One suggestion is that gastric juice is aspirated into the tracheal and upper airways but detection of these events is difficult and involves radioisotopic studies. A new method of making direct measurements of tracheal and oesophageal pH over a 24 hour period is described, together with its application to patients with asthma. METHODS--The technique involves insertion of simultaneous tracheal and oesophageal pH probes under general anaesthesia. Continuous monitoring of pH over a 24 hour period is possible, permitting comparison with peak flow readings during wakefulness and at night should the patient be disturbed. Representative data from four patients with asthma (mean FEV1 62% predicted) and symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, together with data from three non-asthmatics, is presented. RESULTS--Thirty seven episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux lasting more than five minutes were recorded. Of these, five were closely followed by a fall in tracheal pH from a mean (SE) of 7.1 (0.2) to 4.1 (0.4) and a fall in peak expiratory flow (PEFR) of 84 (16) l/min. When gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred without tracheal aspiration the fall in PEFR was 8 (4) l/min. CONCLUSIONS--This new technique was well tolerated and allowed quantitation of the number, duration, and timing of episodes of tracheal micro-aspiration. Unlike acid reflux without aspiration, these events appear to be related to significant acute changes in lung function in asthmatic patients. Further studies with this new method may elucidate the role of gastro-oesophageal reflux in asthma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.50.2.201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1963799705", "source": "openalex"}

It reduces lower oesophageal sphincter length and pressure, and impairs the augmenting effects of the diaphragmatic crus. It is associated with decreased oesophageal peristalsis, increases the cross‐sectional area of the oesophago‐gastric junction, and acts as a reservoir allowing reflux from the hernia sac into the oesophagus during swallowing. The overall effect is that of increased oesophageal acid exposure. The presence of a hiatus hernia is associated with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux, increased prevalence and severity of reflux oesophagitis, as well as Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of treatment with proton pump inhibitors is reduced. Our view on the significance of the sliding hiatus hernia in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease has changed enormously in recent decades. It was initially thought that a hiatus hernia had to be present for reflux oesophagitis to occur. Subsequently, the hiatus hernia was considered an incidental finding of little consequence. We now appreciate that the hiatus hernia has major patho‐physiological effects favouring gastro‐oesophageal reflux and hence contributing to oesophageal mucosal injury, particularly in patients with severe gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02149.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2004830815", "source": "openalex"}

During a follow-up period of up to 24 years, 189 gastro-intestinal cancer cases were diagnosed in the cohort, initially free from cancer. Intake of nitrate, nitrite and NDMA were estimated, based on food-consumption data from a 1-year dietary history interview covering the total diet of the participants. A significant positive association was observed between intake of NDMA and subsequent occurrence of colorectal cancer with a relative risk (RR) between the highest and lowest quartiles of intake of 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–4.33]. Of various sources of N-nitroso compounds, intake of smoked and salted fish was significantly (RR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.21 − 5.51) and intake of cured meat was non-significantly (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 0.98– 3.47) associated with risk of colorectal cancer.

These functional challenges partly explain the relatively high morbidity and mortality of neonates. Preterm birth interrupts prenatal organ maturation, including that of the GIT, and increases disease risk. Exemplary is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) which is associated closely with GIT immaturity, enteral feeding and bacterial colonization. Infants with NEC may require resection of the necrotic parts of the intestine, leading to short bowel syndrome (SBS), characterised by reduced digestive capacity, fluid loss, and dependency on parenteral nutrition. This review presents the preterm pig as a translational model in pediatric gastroenterology that has provided new insights into important pediatric diseases such as NEC and SBS. We describe protocols for delivery, care, and handling of preterm pigs, and show how the immature GIT responds to delivery method and different nutritional and therapeutic interventions. The preterm pig may also provide a sensitive model for postnatal adaptation of weak term piglets showing high mortality. Attributes of the preterm pig model include close similarities with preterm infants in body size, organ development, and many clinical features, thereby providing a translational advantage relative to rodent models of GIT immaturity. On the other hand, the need for a sow surgical facility, a piglet intensive care unit, and clinically trained personnel may limit widespread use of preterm pigs. Studies on organ adaptation in preterm pigs help to identify the physiological basis of neonatal survival for hypersensitive newborns and aid in defining the optimal diet and rearing conditions during the critical neonatal period.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2013-6359", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014156095", "source": "openalex"}

Upper GI bleeding accounted for 76% of bleeding events, with duodenal and gastric ulcers being the source in more than 50% of the upper GI bleeders. Diverticula was the most common bleeding source identified in lower GI bleeders. In the bleeding group, 78.8% were anemic, with 60.9% having hemoglobin of <10 g/dl; 31% presented with orthostatic changes in blood pressure or shock.

Marked changes in the contraction pattern were observed in early manometric studies. The orocecal transit time, particularly small intestinal transit, has generally been reported to be prolonged, which has been demonstrated in multiple investigations to be related to the severity of the liver disease (e.g., Child-Pugh class), the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) as well as a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Bacteriologically proven SIBO in proximal jejunal aspiration has been reported to be present in up to 59% of cirrhotic patients and is associated with systemic endotoxemia. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that delayed small bowel transit in liver cirrhosis may lead to SIBO, which could contribute to the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea. In addition to autonomic neuropathy, metabolic derangements and diabetic state, SIBO itself may delay intestinal transit in cirrhotic patients. Several studies, both from the West and the East, have shown that the gut microbiota is altered in cirrhotic patients and particularly those with HE. Further, a quantitative change in &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides/Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; ratio, with a prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;) and reduction in specific commensals (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt;), has been described. Structural and functional changes in the intestinal mucosa that contribute to increases in intestinal permeability for bacteria and their products have been observed in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is considered as an important pathogenetic factor for several complications. The mechanism of intestinal barrier dysfunction in cirrhosis is multifactorial, including alcohol, portal hypertension (vascular congestion and dysregulation), endotoxemia, SIBO, local inflammation and, most likely, immunological factors and medications. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This review summarizes major achievements regarding intestinal dysfunction in cirrhosis for future gastroenterology research. The question of whether this intestinal barrier dysfunction is accompanied and/or at least partly caused by structural and functional changes in the epithelial tight junction proteins is as yet unsolved.

The normal non-anemic dog absorbs little iron but chronic anemia due to blood loss brings about considerable absorption-perhaps 5 to 15 times normal. In general the same differences are observed in man (1). Sudden change from normal to severe anemia within 24 hours does not significantly increase iron absorption. As the days pass new hemoglobin is formed. The body iron stores are depleted and within 7 days iron absorption is active, even when the red cell hematocrit is rising. Anoxemia of 50 per cent normal oxygen concentration for 48 hours does not significantly enhance iron absorption. In this respect it resembles acute anemia. Ordinary doses of iron given 1 to 6 hours before radio-iron will cause some \"mucosa block\"-that is an intake of radio-iron less than anticipated. Many variables which modify peristalsis come into this reaction. Iron given by vein some days before the dose of radio-iron does not appear to inhibit iron absorption. Plasma radio-iron absorption curves vary greatly. The curves may show sharp peaks in 1 to 2 hours when the iron is given in an empty stomach but after 6 hours when the radio-iron is given with food. Duration time of curves also varies widely, the plasma iron returning to normal in 6 to 12 hours. Gastric, duodenal, or jejunal pouches all show very active absorption of iron. The plasma concentration peak may reach a maximum before the solution of iron is removed from the gastric pouch-another example of \"mucosa block.\" Absorption and distribution of radio-iron in the body of growing pups give very suggestive experimental data. The spleen, heart, upper gastro-intestinal tract, marrow, and pancreas show more radio-iron than was expected. The term \"physiological saturation\" with iron may be applied to the gastro-intestinal mucosal epithelium and explain one phase of acceptance or refusal of ingested iron. Desaturation is a matter of days not hours, whereas saturation may take place within 1 to 2 hours. We believe this change is a part of the complex protein metabolism of the cell.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.78.3.169", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1971958166", "source": "openalex"}

CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002075", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4313538770", "source": "openalex"}

Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer—in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every 3 years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM.

Apart from the physical discomfort and the economic burden, GERD may increase morbidity and mortality through its association with oesophageal carcinoma. The pathophysiology of GERD differs between obese and lean subjects. First, obese subjects are more sensitive to the presence of acid in the oesophagus. Second, hiatal hernia, capable of promoting GERD by several mechanisms, is more prevalent among the obese. Third, obese subjects have increased intra‐abdominal pressure that displaces the lower oesophageal sphincter and increases the gastro‐oesophageal gradient. Finally, vagal abnormalities associated with obesity may cause a higher output of bile and pancreatic enzymes, which makes the refluxate more toxic to the oesophageal mucosa. The altered body composition associated with obesity affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. There are no data regarding the efficacy of any of the drugs used for GERD treatment. The dosages of cimetidine and ranitidine should be calculated according to the patient’s ideal body weight, not their actual weight. Of the operative procedures used for weight loss, Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass was found to be most effective for GERD, while gastric banding was associated with a high prevalence of reflux. This review outlines the pathophysiology and the treatment of GERD in obesity with emphasis on the therapeutic considerations in this population of patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2002.00049.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143090957", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2922240680", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines", "text": "This is the second WGO guideline published to complement World Digestive Health Day themes. WGO guidelines are intended to highlight appropriate, context-sensitive and resource-sensitive management options for all geographical regions, regardless of whether they are considered to be “developing,” “semi-developed,” or “developed.” There is a concern that guidelines from developed countries, by emphasizing high-tech investigations and Barrett esophagus (BE) surveillance, for example, may divert research and clinical resources from more urgent problems in developing and semideveloped countries. However, one could argue that there are similar problems in developed countries and that an overemphasis on complications or “proposed GERD associations” (as in the Montreal Consensus1) is leading to inappropriate investigations and resource utilization even in developed regions. It is also important to emphasize to health care insurers and funding bodies that appropriate, effective therapy is both therapeutic and diagnostic and that conducting mandatory investigations [eg, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to permit proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is not patient-centered and, more importantly, is likely not to be cost-effective. WGO Cascades are thus context-sensitive, and the context is not necessarily defined solely by resource availability. Neither the epidemiology of the condition, nor the availability of resources for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is sufficiently uniform throughout the world to support the provision of a single, gold-standard approach. WGO Cascades: a hierarchical set of diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options for dealing with risk and disease, ranked by the resources available. GERD is now widely prevalent around the world (Table 1), with clear evidence of increasing prevalence in many developing countries. Prevalence estimates show considerable geographic variation, but it is only in East Asia that they are currently consistently lower than 10%.2 The high prevalence of GERD, and hence of troublesome symptoms, has significant societal consequences, impacting adversely on work productivity3 and many other quality-of-life aspects for individual patients.4,5TABLE 1: GERD Symptoms: Range of IncidencePractice recommendations should be sensitive to context, with the goal of optimizing care in relation to local resources and the availability of health care support systems. The expression of the disease is considered to be similar across regions, with heartburn and regurgitation as the main symptoms. For initial management, the patient may purchase over-the-counter (OTC) medication for heartburn relief or seek further advice from a pharmacist. When patients perceive that their symptoms are more troublesome, they may seek a doctor’s advice; depending on the patient’s circumstances and the structure of the local health care system, patients may seek advice at the primary care level or they may consult a gastroenterology specialist or surgeon, directly or by referral. The WGO Cascade approach aims to optimize the use of available health care resources for individual patients, based on their location and access to various health care providers. CLINICAL FEATURES Predisposing and Risk Factors GERD is a sensorimotor disorder associated with impairment of the normal antireflux mechanisms (eg, lower esophageal sphincter function, phrenicoesophageal ligament), with changes in normal physiology (eg, impaired esophageal peristalsis, increased intragastric pressure, increased abdominothoracic pressure gradient) or, very rarely, excess gastric acid secretion (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Eating and Lifestyle An increase in GERD symptoms occurs in individuals who gain weight.6 A high body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk of GERD.7 High dietary fat intake is linked to a higher risk of GERD and erosive esophagitis (EE).8 Carbonated drinks are a risk factor for heartburn during sleep in patients with GERD.9 The role of coffee as a risk factor for GERD is unclear; coffee may increase heartburn in some GERD patients,10 but the mechanism is unknown and it may be due to caffeine, rather than coffee per se. Coffee is not a dominant risk factor. The role of alcohol consumption as a risk factor for GERD is unclear. Excessive, long-term use may be associated with progression to esophageal malignancy, but this may be independent of an effect of alcohol on GERD.11,12 The role of smoking as a risk factor for GERD is unclear, although like alcohol, it is associated with an increased risk of malignancy.13,14 Medication—Certain Medications May Affect GERD See the Patient history and physical examination section. The treatment of comorbidities (eg, with calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may negatively affect GERD and its treatment.15 Some medications (eg, potassium supplements, tetracycline, bisphosphonates) may cause upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract injury and exacerbate reflux-like symptoms or reflux-induced injury. Pregnancy Heartburn during pregnancy usually does not differ from the classic presentation in the adult population, but it worsens as pregnancy advances. Regurgitation occurs with approximately the same frequency as heartburn, and GERD in the first trimester is associated with a number of altered physiological responses.16,17 Factors that increase the risk of heartburn18 are: heartburn before pregnancy, parity, and duration of pregnancy. Maternal age is inversely correlated with the occurrence of pregnancy-related heartburn.19 Symptomatology GERD has a wide spectrum of clinical symptom-based and injury-based presentations, which may manifest either separately or in combination. Symptom evaluation is key to the diagnosis of GERD, particularly in the evaluation of the effectiveness of therapy. Heartburn and regurgitation are the most common symptoms, but atypical symptoms of GERD may occur, with or without the common symptoms. Atypical symptoms may include epigastric pain20 or chest pain,1,21 which may mimic ischemic cardiac pain, as well as cough and other respiratory symptoms that may mimic asthma or other respiratory or laryngeal disorders. Dysphagia may also occur. A minority of GERD patients have multiple unexplained symptoms, which may be associated with psychological distress22 (Table 2).TABLE 2: GERD Symptoms23,24Natural History Most cases of GERD are mild and are not associated with a significant increase in morbidity or mortality in comparison with the general population. In most GERD patients, the severity of the condition remains stable or improves over a 5-year observation period during current routine clinical care.26 There is a relationship between GERD and obesity: a higher BMI or larger waist circumference and weight gain are associated with the presence of symptoms and complications of GERD, including BE.27 Complicated GERD is characterized by stricture, BE, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The Montreal consensus includes EE as a complication of GERD (recognizing that the definition of “mucosal breaks” used in the Los Angeles classification includes esophageal ulceration in the range of reflux esophagitis).28 Nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) may progress to EE in approximately 10% of GERD patients,29 and EE may therefore be considered as a manifestation of more severe reflux disease. EE is associated with BE and is a major risk factor for BE. In comparison with patients who were free of GERD at follow-up, those with EE had a 5-fold increased risk of BE after 5 years, in a cohort of the general population in Sweden.30 Globally, BE is rare in patients with GERD. It is more common in western populations. It is not known when BE develops relative to the onset of GERD; however, it appears to be more prevalent in older individuals and is strongly associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.31 There is a well-documented association between BMI and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia, although the risk of malignancy in a given individual with GERD is very low.32 Alarm Features Most alarm features are not specific for GERD; many are associated with alternative diagnoses that are unrelated to GERD. In most countries, many of these features relate to gastric cancer, complicated ulcer disease, or other serious illnesses. Dysphagia.33 Odynophagia (painful swallowing). Recurrent bronchial symptoms, aspiration pneumonia. Dysphonia. Recurrent or persistent cough. GI tract bleeding. Frequent nausea and/or vomiting. Persistent pain. Iron-deficiency anemia. Progressive unintentional weight loss. Lymphadenopathy. Epigastric mass. New-onset atypical symptoms at age 45 to 55 years (a lower age threshold may be appropriate, depending on local recommendations). Family history of either esophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma.34 The WGO Global Guideline on common GI symptoms may also be consulted: http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines/common-gi-symptoms and http://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2014/08000/Coping_With_Common_Gastrointestinal_Symptoms_in.4.aspx. DIAGNOSIS Diagnostic Considerations The presence of heartburn and/or regurgitation symptoms 2 or more times a week is suggestive of GERD.35 Clinical, endoscopic, and pH-metric criteria provide a comprehensive characterization of the disease, although investigations are usually not required to establish a diagnosis of GERD—with the caveat that the pretest probability of GERD varies markedly between geographical regions. The initial evaluation should document the presence, severity, and frequency of heartburn, regurgitation (acid or otherwise), and alarm features; atypical esophageal, pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, and oral symptoms should also be sought. It may be helpful to evaluate precipitating factors such as eating, diet (fat), activity (stooping), and recumbence; and relieving factors (bicarbonate, antacids, milk, OTC medications). At this point, it is important to rule out other GI diagnoses, particularly upper GI cancer and ulcer disease, especially in areas in which these are more prevalent. It is also important to consider other, non-GI diagnoses, especially ischemic heart disease. Diagnostic questionnaire tools for GERD (reflux disease questionnaires, RDQs) have been developed for epidemiological studies. However, RDQs did not perform particularly well in the Diamond study.36 In fact, diagnosis by a physician such as the family practitioner or GI specialist showed better sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of GERD than did the RDQ. Questionnaires are generally difficult to use in clinical practice. A careful history is the basis for symptomatic diagnosis, with EGD being reserved for identifying or excluding significant structural lesions in selected cases. A region-based assessment of the local “pretest probability” may provide some guidance with regard to the choices and sequence of diagnostic tests needed, given the relatively poor predictive value of most symptoms. PPI Treatment as an Aid to Diagnosis “PPI trial.” It is no longer recommended to administer an empirical short-term (1 to 2 week) course of high-dose PPI treatment to determine whether or not the patient’s symptoms are acid related,36 since this is neither sensitive nor specific. Nonetheless, this is commonly done in practice. A formal course of PPI therapy, of adequate duration (usually 8 weeks) is required to assess the treatment response in GERD patients. Weakly acidic reflux episodes may be a substantial proportion of all reflux episodes. If this is the case, such patients may not respond well to PPI therapy (20% to 40% of GERD patients may not respond to PPI treatment).20 In addition, genuinely alkaline reflux may comprise up to 5% of all reflux episodes. In a subset of PPI nonresponders, reflux-like symptoms may be due to functional heartburn, rather than GERD.20 Alternative diagnoses, including peptic ulcer disease, upper GI malignancy, functional dyspepsia, eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia of the cardia, and cardiovascular disease should also be considered. In patients with cases that are refractory to PPI treatment, ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH/impedance monitoring, with the patient off PPI therapy, may be considered to help characterize symptoms.37 If there has been complete failure to respond to PPI treatment, the PPI should be stopped at least 1 week before 24-hour pH monitoring is performed (rescue antacid may be allowed when necessary), to assess for acid reflux. If the refractory reflux symptoms have responded partially, 24-hour pH monitoring (with or without esophageal impedance monitoring) should be performed with PPI administration being continued, to assess for acid reflux that is persistent despite treatment. Occasionally, 24-hour pH monitoring with esophageal impedance monitoring may be required, with the patient both on and off PPI therapy.38 Helicobacter pylori Infection39 In many countries with a high prevalence of H. pylori infection, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer continue to be more common than GERD and cause much higher morbidity and mortality.40 In this setting, any approach to the diagnosis and management of upper gut symptoms must include an assessment of the risks of infection with H. pylori and an awareness of the overlap among, and difficulty of discriminating between, symptoms of GERD, peptic ulcer disease, and functional symptoms—with a decision regarding the relative merits of a test-and-treat approach in comparison with EGD to test for H. pylori and related diseases before empirical antireflux therapy. Although epidemiological studies show a negative association between the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the presence and severity of GERD, this is not proof of causation. H. pylori infection should be sought and eradication therapy given when indicated in accordance with international, national, or local guidelines.41 Although there may be an inverse correlation between H. pylori infection and GERD prevalence and severity, this may well reflect differing effects of a separate, distinct factor or factors on the 2 conditions, rather than a causal relationship between H. pylori and GERD. Physiological studies using pH monitoring have shown that abnormal esophageal acid exposure, which is the hallmark of esophageal reflux, is not influenced by the presence or absence of H. pylori infection. In most patients, H. pylori status has no effect on symptom severity, symptom recurrence, or treatment efficacy in GERD. H. pylori eradication does not exacerbate preexisting GERD or affect treatment efficacy.42 Indeed, in patients with H. pylori-positive uninvestigated dyspepsia, eradication therapy is associated with a lower prevalence of reflux-like symptoms (36%) than control therapy (49%).43 A subgroup of patients infected with more proinflammatory strains of H. pylori (virulence factors vacA and cagA) may be less likely to have severe esophagitis or BE. This may be because infection in these patients more often causes severe corpus gastritis with atrophy, resulting in reduced acid output. However, these patients are at much greater risk of developing gastric cancer. Eradication therapy in these patients has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric malignancy.41 PPIs and H. pylori PPIs are associated with a worsening of the histologic grade of gastritis in H. pylori-infected patients, accompanied by an increased prevalence of gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia44 that occurs earlier, as well as more frequently, than in H. pylori-infected patients who do not take PPIs. As gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia are known to be the major risk factors for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma, most expert guidelines recommend testing and treating for H. pylori before long-term PPI therapy, particularly in younger patients. Endoscopy EGD is usually performed for new-onset upper GI symptoms, almost irrespective of age, in regions where it is available and affordable and where both the frequency of ulcer disease and the concern about malignancy are high, as in most of Asia.45 The Cascades given below address the limited availability of endoscopy in less well-resourced areas by suggesting the use of empiric H. pylori eradication therapy as a first-line strategy. If EGD is performed in regions where the prevalence of GERD is low, the majority of GERD patients will have NERD; in these circumstances, the sensitivity of EGD for the diagnosis of GERD will be low and the main outcome will therefore be the exclusion of other upper GI diagnoses. Endoscopy is particularly recommended for patients with alarm features suggestive of GERD with complications or of other significant upper GI disease such as dysphagia, bleeding, odynophagia, or weight loss. Patients with dysphagia should undergo investigation for a potential complication or for an underlying motility disorder, achalasia, stricture, ring, eosinophilic esophagitis, or malignancy.25 In several Asian countries, the preference for EGD is driven by the risk of malignancy at an early age and by the availability of “affordable, direct-access” endoscopy—an “endoscopy first” approach. Additional investigations other than EGD are rarely needed; furthermore, they have variable accuracy and are often unavailable. Patient History and Physical Examination The goals of patient evaluation include the assessment of symptoms and risk factors for the diagnosis of GERD and the prediction of long-term sequelae. In this regard, it is important to consider the regional epidemiology of upper GI disease and the pretest probability of GERD relative to other conditions. In Asia, for instance, BE is uncommon and it is not therefore an important risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is itself uncommon. The prevalence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer are the greater drivers of endoscopy in Asia where, unlike in the west, esophageal adenocarcinoma is less common. Personal and Family History Features The following features may be helpful in making a diagnosis and assessing the severity of GERD: Predisposing factors and risk factors, including family history. Duration of symptoms. Daytime symptoms, including time of day and relationship to meals. Nocturnal symptoms, including impact on sleep and the effects of a recumbent position and large, late evening meals. Treatments and remedies tried, including symptomatic response to therapy; symptom improvement with acid-lowering medications including antacids supports a diagnosis of GERD. Periodic dysphagia or food bolus impaction may suggest reflux-related esophageal injury, stricture or malignancy, as well as eosinophilic esophagitis or esophageal dysmotility.46 Drug History The patient should be asked about any medications that may contribute to upper gut symptoms (not necessarily GERD): Aspirin/NSAIDs, iron, potassium, quinidine, tetracycline, bisphosphonates. Zidovudine, anticholinergic agents, α-adrenergic antagonists, barbiturates. β2-adrenergic agonists, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines, dopamine. Estrogens, narcotic analgesics, nitrates, progesterone, prostaglandins, theophylline. Tricyclic antidepressants, chemotherapy. Dietary History In some patients, bloating or constipation may be associated with an increased risk of GERD or gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (GERS).47 Several studies suggest that stopping smoking and some physical measures, as well as modification of meal size and timing, can be beneficial, but there is limited evidence for the avoidance of alcohol and certain dietary ingredients including carbonated drinks, caffeine, fat, spicy foods, chocolate, and mint.48 In those who are overweight, weight loss may be associated with improvement in GERD or GERS.49 Fermentable carbohydrates may increase the propensity for reflux.50 Physical Evaluation There are usually no physical signs of GERD. Waist circumference, weight, and BMI are relevant to risk. Peripheral stigmata of scleroderma may, rarely, be present. Evaluation and inspection to exclude other medical problems such as asthma, cardiac disease, and cancer. Diagnostic Tests for GERD A presumptive diagnosis of GERD can be established in the setting of typical symptoms: heartburn and regurgitation. In pregnancy, GERD can be reliably diagnosed on the basis of symptoms alone. If the dominant or most troublesome symptoms are atypical for GERD, other diagnoses should be considered, including H. pylori-related diseases and NSAID-related disease. In regions with a high prevalence of H. pylori infection, an initial H. pylori test-and-treat strategy, or endoscopy if available, should be considered. Radiologic examinations are seldom required. Esophageal pH or pH-impedance monitoring and esophageal manometry can be performed safely, but are seldom required except to assess structural disorders (eg, hiatal hernia) in patients with dysphagia symptoms. Intractable reflux symptoms or GERD complications can be evaluated safely using EGD16,17 (Table 3).TABLE 3: Diagnostic Options for GERDDifferential Diagnosis Peptic ulcer disease. Upper gut malignancy. Functional heartburn—differentiate NERD and functional heartburn on the basis of a clinical response to therapeutic acid suppression, pH monitoring, or impedance pH monitoring. Schatzki ring, stricture—esophageal web. Achalasia of the cardia. Esophageal body motility disorders—scleroderma; diffuse esophageal spasm. Eosinophilic esophagitis. Infection—Candida, herpes simplex, etc. “Pill esophagitis.” Cardiac disease—ischemic heart disease, pericardial disease. Esophageal diverticulum. Other chest pathology. Cascades for the Diagnosis of GERD For EGD, perform esophageal biopsy in abundantly resourced regions or biopsy for selected patients in regions with “medium resources” if features suggest eosinophilic esophagitis. For screening EGD, consider this only if there is a high prevalence of BE in the local population and if there are abundant resources. For most purposes, EGD will not alter the management, in the absence of alarm features or access to antireflux surgery. There is no role for upper GI series in the investigation of routine upper GI symptoms (uninvestigated dyspepsia) (Table 4). TABLE 4: Cascades for the Diagnosis of GERDMANAGEMENT Management Principles General Principles Although the severity and frequency of symptoms vary greatly between GERD patients, occasional reflux symptoms (GERS) do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of GERD and are managed with low-level intermittent treatments and lifestyle adjustments, as required. More frequent or severe symptoms interfere significantly with patients’ quality of life and warrant therapy sufficient to normalize their quality of life. Generally, the management of GERD follows a stepwise approach, both with respect to the treatments and to the health care professionals who guide or provide therapy. Core Principles The core principles of GERD management are lifestyle interventions and reduction of esophageal luminal acid either by local acid neutralization or by suppression of gastric acid secretion using medical treatment; or, rarely, antireflux surgery. The primary goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, improve the patient’s health-related quality of life, heal esophagitis, prevent symptom recurrence, and prevent or treat GERD-associated complications in the most cost-effective manner. Stepwise Therapy Infrequent heartburn occurring less than twice per week will probably respond to self-care with an antacid or alginate-antacid, taken once a week or less often. These medications are very unlikely to have any deleterious effects. Alginate-antacid combinations are useful and are superior to antacids alone.53 Particularly in this group of patients, avoidance of foods or events that trigger symptoms and avoidance of large meals eaten late at night may be helpful. Weight reduction in those who are overweight may also reduce the frequency of symptoms. Patients who have more frequent symptoms should be assessed for longer-term therapy. A diagnosis of GERD—that is, troublesome symptoms 2 or more times per week—warrants empirical therapy with an acid inhibitor [PPI or, if unavailable, histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA)]. Antacids/alginates may also be used if PPIs or H2RAs are unavailable, or for prompt symptom relief in patients taking a PPI. If OTC or lifestyle measures fail, patients will often present initially to a pharmacist or primary care physician. The definition of treatment failure depends to a large extent on the treatment being tried. In contrast, treatment may fail because the patient does not actually have GERD; in contrast, it may be that the treatment is inadequate to address the severity of the GERD. In the latter case, there may be a partial response to treatment, and subsequent management will be guided by the availability and optimization of more potent therapies. These latter steps may require referral to secondary care if initial management fails.54 Approaches to reflux should focus on best clinical practice, with treatment of the symptoms being the priority. It is wise to choose the lowest effective dose of prescription drugs. For patients with mild symptoms, and some patients with NERD, self-directed, intermittent PPI therapy (“on-demand therapy”) is a useful management strategy in many cases. At the primary care level, PPIs or a combination of alginate-antacid and acid-suppressive therapy can be prescribed at the physician’s discretion for combination therapy, which may be more beneficial than acid-suppressive therapy alone.54 For better symptom control, patients should be informed about how to use PPI treatment properly; optimal therapy may be defined as taking the PPI 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast, and in the case of twice-daily dosing, 30 to 60 minutes before the last meal of the day as well.55 Patients in whom full-dose PPI treatment fails, with or without adjuvant therapies, may benefit from a trial of step-up therapy to a twice-daily PPI. Twice-daily PPI therapy may not work for a proportion of patients, either because the symptoms are not due to acid reflux—when an alternative diagnosis should be considered—or because the degree of acid suppression achieved is insufficient to control the symptoms. Referral to secondary care should be considered for “PPI-refractory” patients. OTC antacids show disappointing results in patients with EE. Self-care Controlled weight reduction in the overweight and obese is an important part of the long-term management of GERD and should not be ignored as a therapeutic intervention, as it may reduce the frequency and intensity of symptoms and lessen the grade of EE, if present. Lifestyle—small meals, avoidance of late meals, avoidance of precipitating factors, use of a sleep positioning device (pillow).56 OTC medicines (antacids or alginate-antacids) offer the most rapid, but usually transient, symptom relief and can be taken as required. Alarm features (see the Alarm features section). Options for Pharmacist-assisted Self-medication Reinforce lifestyle advice. Guide patients in the selection of medical OTC treatment by confirming the diagnosis, referring patients with alarm symptoms to physicians, and educating patients on the proper use of their OTC medication—which in some jurisdictions may include PPIs.57 N.B.: the availability of treatment choices varies between countries. Antacids—recommended for short-term or intermittent relief: Simple antacids neutralize gastric acid—that is, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts. Alginate-containing agents: these include alginic acid with small doses of antacids: minimal buffering effects. H2RAs—recommended for short-term to medium-term use. Widely available OTC. Cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine. More prolonged action than antacids. Tachyphylaxis. OTC PPIs: Patients seeking pharmacy advice for frequent reflux symptoms may benefit from OTC PPI treatment. Esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, which have different OTC availability in individual countries—see the Association of the European Self-Medication Industry Web site (http://www.aesgp.eu/facts-figures/otc-ingredients/). Other OTC PPIs may be available in other jurisdictions. Alarm features (see the Alarm features section). Check medication interactions. Self-treatment without investigation should be avoided in the presence of the following conditions58–61: Heartburn or regurgitation symptoms when: Duration >3 months with severe or nocturnal heartburn. Continuing after 2 weeks of treatment with an OTC H2RA or PPI. Occurring when taking a prescription H2RA or PPI. New-onset heartburn or regurgitation at age 45 to 55 years—lower age in several Asian regions. Dysphagia or odynophagia. Symptoms or signs of GI bleeding: hematemesis and melena, iron-deficiency anemia. Symptoms or signs of laryngitis: hoarseness, wheezing, coughing, or choking. Unexplained weight loss. Continuous nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Symptoms suggestive of cardiac-type chest pain: radiating to shoulder, arm, neck or jaw, shortness of breath, sweating. In pregnant women or nursing mothers. Children below 12 years of age for antacids/H2RA, or below 18 years for PPIs. Follow-up Action The goals of self-treatment are that the patient should become symptom-free and return to an optimal quality of life, with the most cost-effective therapy. If satisfactory and complete symptom relief is not achieved, patients should be recommended to visit a health care professional for diagnostic evaluation. PPI overuse—people who need sustained gastric acid suppression should have an appropriate indication for long-term PPI use; the long-term need for PPIs should be reassessed regularly.

Methods Literature search was focused on indications and technical recommendations for GERD testing and phenotypes definitions. Statements were proposed and discussed during several structured meetings. Key Results Reflux testing should be performed after cessation of acid suppressive medication in patients with a low likelihood of GERD . In this setting, testing can be either catheter‐based or wireless pH ‐monitoring or pH ‐impedance monitoring. In patients with a high probability of GERD (esophagitis grade C and D, histology proven Barrett's mucosa &gt;1 cm, peptic stricture, previous positive pH monitoring) and persistent symptoms, pH ‐impedance monitoring should be performed on treatment. Recommendations are provided for data acquisition and analysis. Esophageal acid exposure is considered as pathological if acid exposure time ( AET ) is greater than 6% on pH testing. Number of reflux episodes and baseline impedance are exploratory metrics that may complement AET . Positive symptom reflux association is defined as symptom index ( SI ) &gt;50% or symptom association probability ( SAP ) &gt;95%. A positive symptom‐reflux association in the absence of pathological AET defines hypersensitivity to reflux. Conclusions and Inferences The consensus group determined that grade C or D esophagitis, peptic stricture, histology proven Barrett's mucosa &gt;1 cm, and esophageal acid exposure greater &gt;6% are sufficient to define pathological GERD . Further testing should be considered when none of these criteria are fulfilled.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13067", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2601059298", "source": "openalex"}

Aims: To assess the impact of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease on reduced work productivity and to identify the predictors of reduced productivity. Methods: A sample of employed individuals reporting chronic heartburn was selected from US household mail survey respondents. Heartburn severity and frequency were recorded using a diary, and work productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Patients with Symptoms of Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease. Predictors of reduced productivity were evaluated. Results: Over 30% of heartburn sufferers reported reduced productivity. Individuals with symptoms of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ( n = 1003) reported 6.0% reduced productivity attributable to symptoms. Over 48% of respondents with severe symptoms reported reduced productivity, compared with 40% and 12% of respondents with moderate and mild symptoms, respectively. Using logistic regression, severity, a younger age and nocturnal symptoms were associated with increased odds of reduced productivity. In those reporting nocturnal heartburn, medication use and sleep interference increased the odds of reduced productivity. Conclusions: Reduced work productivity is seen in a large proportion of subjects on prescription medication for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.

METHODS Competency at colonoscopy among 4 novice GI fellows who completed a 6-h CBCS curriculum was compared with 4 novice fellows who were not CBCS-trained. Measurements of competency were rendered by supervising faculty by recording \"insertion time,\"\"depth of unassisted insertion,\"\"independent procedure completion,\"\"ability to identify endoscopic landmarks,\"\"inserts in a safe manner,\"\"adequately visualizes mucosa on withdrawal,\" and \"responds appropriately to patient discomfort\" with each colonoscopy. RESULTS Simulator-trained fellows outperformed traditionally trained fellows during their initial 15 colonoscopies in all performance aspects except \"insertion time\" (pp < 0.05). Simulator-trained fellows inserted the endoscope significantly further and reached the cecum independently nearly twice as often during this early training period.

Methods: The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system. Results: Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast‐feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non–breast‐fed infants and young children, lactose‐free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii , diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti‐infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires safety clearance given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates.

Methods Focused literature searches were conducted, evaluating pathophysiology of GERD with emphasis on HRM . The results were discussed with an international group of experts to develop a consensus on the role of HRM in GERD . A proposed classification system for esophageal motor abnormalities associated with GERD was generated. Key Results Physiologic gastro‐esophageal reflux is inherent in all humans, resulting from transient lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) relaxations that allow venting of gastric air in the form of a belch. In pathological gastro‐esophageal reflux, transient LES relaxations are accompanied by reflux of gastric contents. Structural disruption of the esophagogastric junction ( EGJ ) barrier, and incomplete clearance of the refluxate can contribute to abnormally high esophageal reflux burden that defines GERD . Esophageal HRM localizes the LES for pH and pH ‐impedance probe placement, and assesses esophageal body peristaltic performance prior to invasive antireflux therapies and antireflux surgery. Furthermore, HRM can assess EGJ and esophageal body mechanisms contributing to reflux, and exclude conditions that mimic GERD. Conclusions &amp; Inferences Structural and motor EGJ and esophageal processes contribute to the pathophysiology of GERD . A classification scheme is proposed incorporating EGJ and esophageal motor findings, and contraction reserve on provocative tests during HRM .", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2617435753", "source": "openalex"}

It is suggested that these patients might exhibit enhanced oesophageal sensation, akin to the heightened perception of both physiological and provocative stimuli in the gut that has been described in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. This study tested the hypothesis by measuring the sensory thresholds for oesophageal balloon distension and discomfort in 20 patients with symptoms of GORD, in whom ambulatory pH monitoring had shown normal acid exposure times, but in whom the symptom index for reflux events was 50% or greater, and compared these with 15 healthy volunteer controls, and with control groups with confirmed excess reflux. The study group showed lower thresholds both for initial perception of oesophageal distension, and for discomfort, compared with healthy controls (median ml (range)); 7.5 (2-19) v 12 (6-30) (p = 0.002) and 10 (5-20) v 16 (8-30) (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively. Sensory thresholds in the study group were also significantly lower than in patients with excess reflux, and than patients with Barrett9s oesophagus, who also exhibited significantly higher sensory thresholds than healthy controls. No differences in sensory thresholds for somatic nerve stimulation were found between the study group and health controls. The results show a spectrum of visceral sensitivity in GORD, with enhanced oesophageal sensation in patients with symptomatic but not excess gastro-oesophageal reflux, suggesting that their symptoms result from a heightened perception of normal reflux events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.37.1.7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013228264", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen, which was shown to inhibit the occurrence of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLOSRs) in patients with persistent non-acid duodenal reflux during PPI therapy. <b>Methods:</b> Patients were eligible for the study if they had persistent reflux symptoms, normal pH monitoring, and pathological Bilitec monitoring during PPI treatment. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and reflux symptom score were performed at the beginning of the study. Baclofen 5 mg three times daily was associated with treatment, and was increased by 5 mg every fourth day until a maintenance dose of 20 mg three times daily was reached. A reflux symptom questionnaire, ambulatory pH monitoring, and Bilitec monitoring were repeated four days later while PPI and baclofen were continued.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on GORD prevalence and risk factors at a global level. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were systematically searched, without language restrictions, for studies on the prevalence and risk factors of GORD. Data were pooled using a random effects model (95% confidence interval), and the odds ratio and relative risk for each risk factor were calculated. Out of 34,355 search results, 96 records reporting the results from 102 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, representing 37 countries and all regions of the UN geoscheme. The global pooled prevalence of GORD was 13.98% and varied greatly according to region (12.88% in Latin America and the Caribbean to 19.55% in North America) and country (4.16% in China to 22.40% in Turkey). Using the United Nations 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects, the estimated number of individuals suffering from GORD globally is 1.03 billion. Multiple risk factors associated with a significant increase in the risk of GORD were also identified.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2022785032", "title": "NASPGHAN Guidelines for Training in Pediatric Gastroenterology", "text": "1. OVERVIEW The field of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition (referred to subsequently as pediatric gastroenterology) continues to expand and evolve and is far different from 1999, when the previous guidelines on fellowship training in this field were published (1). Although still a relatively young field, this subspecialty is increasingly recognized and accepted throughout the world (2), albeit with varying degrees of medical resources and access to care. Tremendous medical advances, especially in the fields of genetics, infectious disease, pharmacology, and immunology, have changed our fundamental understanding of pathophysiology, and along with technological innovations, such as wireless imaging technology and intraesophageal impedance monitoring, have affected the way we diagnose and manage disease. At the same time, economic factors have become increasingly important in discussions of health care and graduate medical education (3). With rapidly escalating health care costs, care must be demonstrated to be not only high in quality but also cost-effective. Moreover, in response to pressure from the public to ensure practitioners are competent, accrediting agencies are imposing new and increasingly complex constructs for assessing the competency of our trainees. These factors demand that the training of pediatric gastroenterology fellows be continuously revised and reevaluated. It is not sufficient to focus exclusively on the clinical aspects of training, however. Although the primary mission of fellowship programs is to create competent clinicians, ensuring the health of future generations requires a broader training mission that recognizes that some of our trainees will choose careers as researchers and medical educators. Fellowship training, therefore, must provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue other essential career pathways. The necessity of providing this more inclusive training must be reconciled with evolving lifestyle expectations of trainees (4) and duty hour restrictions (5). In response to these enumerated factors, the Executive Council of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) charged its Training Committee with the task of updating the 1999 fellowship training guidelines. The goals outlined by the Steering Committee were to consider existing guidelines and seek consistency where possible; specifically incorporate the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies; create a framework that would permit consistent updating; reflect the unique aspects of pediatric gastroenterology, including the breadth of the field and unique nature of the patients, especially the changing presentation of disease as children develop; and respond to the practical needs of pediatric gastroenterology program directors. In addition to the original NASGPHAN guidelines, other existing guidelines were reviewed in the preparation of this document. Table 1 provides a list of the primary guidelines and the means to access them. ACGME's Residency Review Committee issues standards for fellowship training in pediatric gastroenterology and updates them every 5 years, with the most recent update in 2009 (6,7). ACGME establishes detailed training program requirements that are not included in these NASPGHAN guidelines. Requirements for training as a pediatric gastroenterologist in Canada are enumerated by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada (RCPSC) (8,9). The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) reviewed training issues and developed a curriculum for fellows in 2002 (2). The task force also reviewed the gastroenterology core curriculum generated by 4 adult gastroenterology societies that was updated in 2007 (10) and the recent guidelines for fellowship training in pediatric cardiology, a subspecialty with similar training issues, including procedure training and advanced training opportunities (11).TABLE 1: Guide to existing guidelinesUnique Characteristics of a Pediatric Gastroenterologist A pediatric gastroenterologist is expected to be an expert in the anatomy and physiology of a large segment of the human body that includes the esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, biliary tree, and pancreas, as well as the diverse array of acute, subacute, and chronic illnesses that may affect these organs. Trainees must have the ability to analyze and integrate the clinical data, instead of limiting their thought processes to a particular organ or segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In pediatric gastroenterology, an assessment of growth and nutrition is an especially integral part of any patient's evaluation and care. Diseases of the digestive system can negatively affect the nutritional status of the child; conversely, the nutritional status of the child can profoundly affect the diagnostic evaluation of the patient. In addition, the practitioner must possess exemplary interpersonal and communication skills, because the field of pediatric gastroenterology is truly multidisciplinary and requires routine consultations and collaborations with myriad allied providers, including endoscopy suite and operating room personnel, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, surgeons, intensivists, radiologists, pathologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Many of the diseases encountered by a pediatric gastroenterologist also are of relevance to other subspecialties, including endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and metabolism/genetics, necessitating collaborative relationships with these experts. A pediatric gastroenterologist, unlike an adult gastroenterologist, interacts extensively with both the patient and the patient's care provider(s). As such, it is imperative that the care not only be evidence-based and cost-effective but also be delivered in a compassionate manner that respects patients’ families and their cultures. The fiscal aspects of health care, especially in the United States, are undergoing seismic modifications and it is anticipated that events in the next 5 years will be characterized by vastly different reimbursement models and accountability in medicine. A pediatric gastroenterologist will need to be adept at demonstrating added value to health care dollars and strive for continuous quality enhancement of care. Knowledge of the dollar footprint of care will be imperative, especially as the subspecialist will have increasing access to an ever-expanding array of technological tools and diagnostic modalities, including medical genetic and pharmacogenetic testing. Furthermore, it is likely that as medical homes are established, pediatric subspecialists will need to develop new relationships with primary care providers. The other trend affecting fellowship programs is the juxtaposition of personal lifestyle choices and career choices. A subset of pediatric gastroenterologists works part-time for a variety of reasons, including needs for childcare, personal (or family) health issues, or other personal obligations or pursuits. Because these needs affect the training years, programs have increasingly adapted to trainee lifestyle requests. In the early years of this subspecialty, the majority of practitioners entered academic institutions, and this later expanded to private practice options. Presently, graduating trainees also consider hybrid practices in which they have an academic appointment with some role in trainee education, but otherwise maintain an independent practice. In summary, the field of pediatric gastroenterology is undergoing rapid transformation and these updated guidelines aim to address the changes occurring in the training of this subspecialty during the last decade and, more important, to prepare us for the future. Competencies ACGME was established in 1981 with a goal of developing a uniform set of guidelines that could be applied to ensure and improve the quality of resident and fellow education. As part of its Outcome Project, 6 core competencies that could serve as focal points in the development of residency and fellowship training program curricula were identified in 1999 and became part of program requirements in 2002 (12). Similarly, the RCPSC developed a set of core competencies that are an integral part of fellowship training program curricula (Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists, or CanMEDS competencies) (13). Although the CanMEDS competencies are not identical to those of the ACGME, their goals are similar (Table 2). Application of these core competencies and implementation of assessment tools by program directors of pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training are required for program certification by the ACGME and the RCPSC. Table 3 indicates how the ACGME competencies are presented in this guideline document.TABLE 2: ACGME and CanMEDS core competenciesTABLE 3: Mapping ACGME competencies to guidelinesThe competency of medical knowledge (CanMEDS Medical Expert and Scholar) requires that fellows demonstrate knowledge of relevant biomedical, clinical, epidemiological, and sociobehavioral sciences and their application to patient care. Areas that are particularly applicable to understanding the clinical manifestations and treatment of GI disease include developmental biology, pharmacology, host/microbial interactions, immunology, and genetics. Fellows should develop an understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the disorders that are encountered in ambulatory and inpatient settings. Medical knowledge should be obtained through didactic conferences, self-directed learning, and in the course of supervised clinical care. Concepts important for training in pediatric gastroenterology are included in the individual content areas. The competency of patient care (CanMEDS Medical Expert and Manager) is directed at ensuring that fellows are able to provide competent and compassionate care to their patients. They must be able to gather appropriate information via the performance of a complete clinical history and comprehensive physical examination, review of medical records, and appraisal of up-to-date scientific evidence. They must be able to develop and implement patient management plans, taking into consideration patient/family preferences. They must be able to interpret diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and develop the clinical judgment necessary to make informed decisions. Fellows also are expected to develop technical competency in the performance of GI procedures that are considered essential for the practice of pediatric gastroenterology and should understand the indications, benefits, risks, and limitations of all procedures commonly used in the evaluation of children with GI disorders. Enumeration of the patient care experiences required for training in pediatric gastroenterology is included in the individual patient content areas of this document. Recommendations for procedural training are reviewed in a separate section of this overview and in more detail in the final section of these guidelines. The competency of practice-based learning and improvement (CanMEDS Scholar) emphasizes lifelong learning. Instruction in this competency should help fellows to develop a set of skills that will empower them to serially assess and reflect upon their perceived strengths and weaknesses as clinicians, and to develop strategies and realistic goals to improve their clinical practice. This includes the ability to incorporate constructive feedback provided by supervisors, colleagues, other health care providers, administrative staff, and patients. In addition, this process of continuous improvement requires the ability to use information technology to support their education and an understanding of the principles and application of evidence-based medicine. Fellows must perform practice-based improvement, which involves obtaining information about their own population of patients, instituting a change, and assessing the effect using a systematic methodology. This competency also includes the development of specific teaching skills that will permit fellows to effectively educate patients and families, students, residents, other fellows, and consulting physicians. The competency of interpersonal and communication skills (CanMEDS Communicator) encompasses more than the performance of specific tasks or behaviors. Fellows should demonstrate interpersonal skills such as the ability to be present in the moment; awareness of the importance of the relationships among physician, patient, and family members; respect for others and treating others as one would like to be treated; and the capacity to adjust interpersonal skills based on the needs of different patients and families (14). Fellows must be able to create and sustain therapeutic and ethically sound relationships with patients, use effective listening skills to facilitate relationships, and work effectively with others as a member or leader of a health care team. Physician providers must be able to communicate across cultural and socioeconomic boundaries. In addition, fellows should begin to learn the skills necessary to communicate their findings and experiences with colleagues and other health care providers, both orally and in the form of written reports, manuscripts, and case series. Such skills are critical in practicing medicine effectively in a multidisciplinary setting. The competency of professionalism (CanMEDS Professional) includes training to ensure that fellows will be able to provide compassionate care to their patients in a manner that is sensitive to language, age, culture, sex/sexual orientation, religious persuasion, and disabilities. Professionalism is realized through partnership between a patient and doctor, based on mutual respect, individual responsibility, and appropriate accountability. It should include such areas as honesty and integrity, self-awareness and knowledge of limits, reliability, respect for others, compassion, altruism and advocacy, continuous self-improvement, collaboration, and working in partnership with members of the health care team (15). Moral reasoning and judgment also are essential components of professional behavior. Fellows should receive formal training in bioethics to equip them in addressing complex problems, such as parental unwillingness or inability to provide lifesaving care for their child. The content areas of this document include examples of the specific application of this competency to disorders encountered in the course of pediatric gastroenterology practice. The competency of systems-based practice (CanMEDS Health Advocate, Manager, and Collaborator) challenges fellows to conduct their clinical efforts in a manner that is medically sound, of high quality, and cost-effective. This requires that fellows understand different types of medical practice and delivery systems. Fellows must learn skills that will enable them to advocate for their patients and to coordinate services drawn from throughout the health care system. Upon completion of training, the fellow should be able to demonstrate his or her understanding of the roles of members of a multidisciplinary team and how to lead a multidisciplinary group that ensures optimal management of complex conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or intestinal failure. The content areas of this document also include examples of the specific application of this competency to disorders encountered in the course of pediatric gastroenterology practice. A number of metrics can be used to evaluate fellow performance, and specific competencies may be best addressed through the application of different methodologies (16,17). Medical knowledge may be best assessed with traditional tools such as written examinations or standardized oral examinations. Other competencies are better assessed using a variety of tools, including record review, chart-stimulated recall, checklists, logs/portfolios, standardized patient examinations, objective structured clinical examinations, simulations, patient surveys, and 360o global ratings. Although the particular choice of evaluation metrics may vary from institution to institution, it is essential that all pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training programs develop a process that facilitates the longitudinal collection of information/data and provision of constructive feedback to fellows in a manner that is timely, respectful, and most likely to positively contribute to their long-term personal and career development. Faculty development is key to the establishment of these metrics and to an effective feedback process. At present, few faculty are expert in these areas (18). A fundamental difficulty in assessing trainees based on the ACGME competencies is that supervising physicians often are asked to do this outside the environment of clinical care and without knowledge of the longitudinal development of trainees (19). A proposed solution to this dilemma is the creation of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) (20,21). According to ten Cate and Scheele, EPAs are part of the essential professional work; must require adequate knowledge, skill, and attitude; lead to recognized output of professional labor; be independently executable; and be observable and measureable in its process and outcome. An example of a possible EPA in pediatric gastroenterology is the medical management of the postoperative liver transplant patient. EPAs provide a clinical context in which to judge a trainee's competence in >1 of the 6 areas defined by ACGME. In this example, trainees’ competency in systems-based practice could be assessed in his or her ability to work on a multidisciplinary team and the competency in communication assessed in his or her ability to provide compassionate and respectful anticipatory guidance to the transplant patient and family. ten Cate and Scheele suggest that one could create a matrix listing specific EPAs on 1 axis and the ACGME general competencies that could pertain to the EPAs on another. Successful training, then, would require reaching the entrustable level of each EPA within a set time period by satisfying all of the relevant competencies. To assist program directors in conceptualizing the application of ACGME competencies, the content areas of this document include the development of tables that relate possible EPAs in each specific area to appropriate competencies. In the future, guidelines for training in pediatric gastroenterology may be based on a series of carefully defined EPAs. ACGME and the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) initiated a pediatrics milestones project to better define the competencies and improve the assessment of outcomes (22,23). The project specifies 52 subcompetencies and proposes a series of developmental levels for assessment. Application of the milestones to subspecialty training must await further study and validation. Clinical Training Guidelines ACGME requirements for subspecialty training in pediatric gastroenterology specify that the training program should be 3 years in length and ensure trainee competence as defined by their 6 competencies in the treatment of infants, children, and adolescents with diseases of the GI tract, the pancreas, the hepatobiliary tract, and nutrition. Current RCPSC guidelines require only 2 years of fellowship for certification in pediatric gastroenterology (8). To meet all of the recommendations enumerated below for a 3-year fellowship, candidates training in Canada could arrange an additional year of fellowship or obtain equivalent training after completing their fellowship. Acknowledging the increasing complexity of pediatric gastroenterology practice and the ACGME requirements, we recommend that at least 15 months should be devoted to clinical training in inpatient and ambulatory settings (Table 4). This length of clinical training would still permit the fellow to be supported by research training grants that restrict clinical activities after a first clinical year. Traditionally, the majority of fellowship training has occurred in the inpatient setting; however, given that clinical pediatric gastroenterology is predominantly an outpatient practice, consideration should be given to providing a significant component of training in the ambulatory setting. A continuity care outpatient opportunity of at least ½ day/week should be provided during the entire 3 years of fellowship. Throughout the training period, duty hours should conform to the guidelines issued by ACGME and be monitored closely (5).TABLE 4: Apportionment of training timeThe fellow should assume progressively increasing responsibility for clinical care and demonstrate increasing competence, both in the inpatient and ambulatory settings, during the course of the fellowship. Fellows also should demonstrate increasing competence in the performance of routine diagnostic and therapeutic GI procedures. Fellows have differing career goals that may affect their training. The current flexibility of training should allow trainees with specific interests to obtain additional clinical training, including training in selected areas, such as neurogastroenterology and motility, nutrition, intestinal failure, IBD, therapeutic endoscopy, hepatology or liver, small bowel, and multivisceral transplantation after the required 15 months of clinical training. For example, if a fellow seeks to obtain expertise (without formal certification) in areas such as motility or management of intestinal failure, additional training, up to 9 months during the 3-year fellowship, could be devoted to this special interest. Alternatively, such specialized training could occur after completion of the pediatric gastroenterology fellowship, as a separate fourth year or in a mentored clinical practice. Such training should not interfere with completion of the scholarly work product. Depending on local institutional resources, the flexibility also should permit fellows who are interested in academic careers to pursue advanced degrees, such as a master's degree in public health or clinical science. Trainees interested in a career in investigation (basic, translational, or clinical) would receive research training during their fellowship; however, fellows and programs should recognize that the path to independence as an investigator commonly requires that at least 4 to 5 years of training is needed to equip a fellow to work independently as an investigator in his or her area of interest. Whether this career path is included as an extra 1 to 2 years as a trainee or as junior faculty depends on local institutional resources, availability and type of funding to support further research training, and the individual needs of trainees. Table 5 suggests lengths of total training for pediatric gastroenterologists seeking different career pathways.TABLE 5: Overall training for different career pathwaysEndoscopy and Other Procedures Procedures are an integral part of the practice of pediatric gastroenterology, and trainees are expected to demonstrate competency in the performance of a wide array of procedures. Endoscopy and related procedures, such as liver biopsy and motility procedures, are in a continual state of evolution as a result of technological advances in equipment, changes in other diagnostic disciplines (eg, radiology), and shifts in the health care delivery system. Nevertheless, it remains important to establish guidelines for pediatric gastroenterology training programs so that trainees are up to date in the most current techniques available. Certain core principles of procedure training will remain important regardless of the details of specific procedures. Trainees must understand the appropriate indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Each program must have formal mechanisms for monitoring and documenting trainees’ development of skills in the performance of each procedure on a regular basis. Ideally, trainees should maintain a log detailing procedures performed and problems encountered. This will facilitate the regular feedback that must be given to trainees throughout their training as to their level of skill acquisition and whether they are meeting expectations for their level of experience. Trainees who are not achieving expected goals should be given constructive guidance in how to achieve the necessary level of endoscopic competence for their level of training. Adequate training and the minimal threshold number of procedures recommended to achieve competency for each procedure are defined in the endoscopy and procedure guideline for training that follows. Each trainee does not necessarily have to attain competence in all of the procedures outlined, but it is important that each trainee become familiar with every procedure and understand its application, interpretation, and limitations. Endoscopic competency is recognized as a continuum. As such, it is recognized that some trainees will achieve procedural competency at a lower number of procedures because of superior hand–eye coordination and other factors that determine procedural success, whereas others will require more instruction or experience to achieve the same level of proficiency. Although emphasizing that true procedural competency rather than volume is the more appropriate goal, careful review of the published literature allows for estimation of minimal numbers that should be achieved before performing procedures independently. Trainees are expected to achieve competence in the procedures that they intend to perform without supervision after completion of training. At completion of training, trainees who have not achieved adequate procedural competence in a procedure that they wish to perform will require mentoring by an experienced proceduralist until such time as procedural competency has been met. Therefore, an essential aspect of all training programs is to ensure that each trainee is adequately exposed to relevant procedures, which include diagnostic and therapeutic upper GI endoscopy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopy, endoscopic examination of the small intestine (capsule endoscopy and/or small bowel enteroscopy), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous liver biopsy, rectal biopsy, manometry (esophageal, antroduodenal, colonic and anorectal), esophageal pH and impedance monitoring, and breath test analysis. Since the publication of the 1999 North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition training guidelines (1), the 2009 ACGME update has moved several procedures from the “demonstrate competence” list to the “understand the principles” list, including paracentesis and percutaneous liver biopsy (7). This change was driven by the recognition that some of the procedures are being increasingly performed by interventional radiologists. These trends will continue to affect the training of pediatric gastroenterologists and certification requirements. As a result, guidelines for procedure training will require regular updates. Scholarship Integral to the advancement of the care of children with GI, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and nutritional disorders is the elucidation of basic disease mechanisms and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In addition, a greater understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular processes controlling the development and function of the GI tract, liver, and related organs is essential to progress in disease prevention and health maintenance during childhood. The continuation of these advances requires the availability of individuals with training in basic, clinical, and translational sciences, medical education, health services, and health policy. All clinicians in the subspecialty of pediatric gastroenterology must understand the foundations of the field and be prepared to assess the impact of new information on clinical care and thus practice evidence-based medicine. Congruent with ACGME and ABP guidelines (7,24), subspecialty training in pediatric gastroenterology must emphasize scholarship. All fellows must receive formal training in scholarly pursuits and participate in basic, clinical, or translational research, or another scholarly activity. The inclusion of forms of scholarship other than research recognizes the importance of all contributions vital for the continued advancement of the field of pediatric gastroenterology. Scholarship, in this context, can be conceived as 4 interrelated domains of academic activity (25). The scholarship of discovery encompasses the activities involved in original basic science and clinical research. The scholarship of education involves the development of educational strategies, curricula, and assessment tools for the communication of knowledge to students and the public. The scholarship of integration is concerned with making connections among diverse disciplines such as the use of communication technology in telemedicine, engineering methods in genomics research, or ethics in patient care. The scholarship of application involves the use of knowledge to solve problems of individuals and society. The types of scholarly work described by this domain include clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. Many translational biomedical activities are included within the domains of integration and application. Trainees need to acquire knowledge in all aspects of scholarship through a combination of didactics and direct participation in a meaningful scholarly project with appropriate mentorship. The experience must begin during the first year and continue throughout the period of training. The ABP sets requirements for the nature of the scholarly project and its output, but it does not stipulate the amount of time that must be devoted to this activity. To meet the goals established by the ABP, at least 12 months of fellowship training should be committed to scholarship activities, although some activities, such as a basic science project, clearly require a longer time commitment. Ideally, at least some contiguous blocks of time will be designated for completion of the scholarly activity. During these designated periods, 80% of the trainees’ time should be committed to scholarly work. Trainees must participate in a formal core curriculum in scholarship. The curriculum should be presented in a format that stimulates learning behavior through the use of diverse educational modalities, including lectures, group discussions, journal clubs, and research conferences. The curriculum should provide trainees with the opportunity to achieve an in-depth understanding of biostatistics, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory research methodology, study design, critical literature review, ethical norms governing scholarly activities (presentation of data, collaborative activities, confidentiality in peer review, authorship designation, social responsibility, human rights, and animal welfare), application of research to clinical practice, and evidence-based medicine. The curriculum also should include principles of teaching and adult learning, curriculum development, and assessment of educational outcomes. Trainees should acquire the necessary skills to deliver information in oral and written forms, prepare applications for approval and potential funding of clinical and research protocols, and complete abstracts and manuscripts for publication. Furthermore, the trainees should develop as effective teachers of individuals and groups of learners in clinical settings, classrooms, and seminars. Per ABP requirements (24), all fellows are to complete a supervised scholarly activity. This activity must be directly related to the field of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, or nutrition, with the objective to prepare trainees to become effective subspecialists and to contribute to the advancement of scholarship in the field. Participation in the scholarly activity should lead to the development of skills to critically analyze the work of others; gather and analyze data; assimilate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques; formulate clear and testable questions from a body of data; derive conclusions from available data; and translate ideas into written and oral forms. The scholarly activity may include basic, clinical, and translational sciences, medical education, health services, and health policy. Acceptable projects include basic, clinical, and translational research; meta-analysis or systematic review of the literature; critical analysis of health services or policies; and curriculum development. The project must be hypothesis driven or have clearly stated objectives, and requires in-depth integration and analysis of information or data. Trainees must actively participate and acquire comprehensive knowledge of all aspects of their scholarly activity. Trainees should practice reflective critique during the performance of the scholarly activity by thinking about the work, seeking the opinion of others, and responding positively to criticism. The scholarly activity is to lead to a work product for which trainees are responsible for a significant portion of its completion. Examples of an acceptable work product are a peer-reviewed publication, a formal report extensively describing a completed or complex ongoing activity, a peer-reviewed extramural grant application, and a thesis. Fellowship training in scholarship is to be performed in a supportive, stimulating, and inquisitive environment. Trainees must have the opportunity to discuss and critically analyze current literature, present their work in conferences, and interact with other trainees and faculty in a wide variety of disciplines. To provide an appropriate scholarly environment, faculty of the program must include people with established skills in scholarship, preferably in different areas of basic science, clinical science, health services, health policy, and education. Trainees should designate a faculty member to provide mentorship during their scholarly activity. The mentor is fundamental to the training process and must commit to support trainees during the extent of their scholarly activity. The mentor should have an established record of productivity in scholarship, have attained excellence in a field related to pediatric gastroenterology, and be aware of the opportunities for trainees to apply for grant support, participate in national conferences, and collaborate with others in the subspecialty of pediatric gastroenterology. The mentor must ensure that the support, facilities, and equipment required for the completion of the specific scholarly activity are available to the fellow and must monitor his or her progress and provide ongoing feedback. Each trainee is to have a scholarship oversight committee (SOC), governed by written guidelines (24). The SOC, in conjunction with the designated mentor and program director, is responsible for the guidance of trainees through the completion of the scholarly activity and for the assessment of whether a specific activity and the product of that activity meets the current ABP guidelines for certification. The SOC, as stipulated by the ABP, is to comprise at least 3 individuals (including the mentor), with 1 member from outside the subspecialty of pediatric gastroenterology. The program director can serve as a mentor and participate in committee activities, but he or she is not formally a member of the SOC. The committee is to meet on a regular basis during the period of training, at least twice per year. The committee is to assist trainees in the development of a course of study to acquire knowledge and skills beyond those provided by the core curriculum to ensure successful completion of the scholarly activity. The SOC will evaluate each fellow's progress, involvement in the specific scholarly activity, product of the scholarly activity, and defense of the product of the scholarly activity at its completion. The SOC will advise the program director on each fellow's progress during the training period and determine whether the scholarly activity was performed and completed according to the local program and ABP guidelines. Advanced Training Given the explosion of knowledge and technology, some pediatric gastroenterologists have restricted their practices to certain highly specialized clinical areas. Preparation to practice in these areas may require further training to develop the medical knowledge and clinical and technological skills necessary to achieve competency. At present, the field of pediatric cardiology includes multiple areas of subspecialization, and guidelines for training in each of these were published in 2006 (11). As the discipline of pediatric gastroenterology develops further, it is likely that new subspecialties will develop and others will change. The goal of advanced training in pediatric gastroenterology is to provide specialized clinical instruction for subspecialty trainees exceeding what would be expected in a traditional 3-year fellowship training program. Examples of areas in which advanced training can be appropriate include but are not limited to pediatric transplant hepatology, neurogastroenterology and motility, therapeutic endoscopy, IBD, intestinal rehabilitation and small bowel/multivisceral transplantation, and nutrition. Such training could be obtained in 1 of 3 ways: within the context of a standard 3-year fellowship, assuming all of the basic requirements for clinical training and scholarship are met; during an additional, dedicated fourth year of fellowship training; or postfellowship in the course of mentored, specialized practice. The only current official mechanism for obtaining advanced training in pediatric gastroenterology is that which exists for pediatric transplant hepatology (26). Obtaining a certificate of added qualification in this subspecialty requires the completion of an additional year of fellowship training in pediatric transplant hepatology and passing a certifying examination, offered jointly by the ABP and the American Board of Internal Medicine (27). Although the original NASPGHAN guidelines specified requirements for advanced training in other areas of subspecialty within pediatric gastroenterology (1), clear pathways for advanced fellowship training do not exist and, therefore, specifications for achieving this training were not included in this document. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the ABP will be able to offer certifying examinations, given the expected small numbers of applicants. We do, however, recommend that NASPGHAN consider defining the requirements for programs that may offer advanced training in areas other than pediatric transplant hepatology and for fellowship training in these areas. Format of the Content Areas Traditional approaches to enumerating the medical knowledge and clinical skills that trainees must develop to master a specialty field have resulted in lengthy and detailed lists of specific items. In practice, such lists have been rarely accessed by program directors and therefore been of little practical benefit. The Guidelines Steering Committee established a number of guiding principles for the development of content areas. First, the committee believes that to be effective, the format of the content areas should be simplified by avoiding repetitious language and emphasizing concepts rather than details. In the current era of expanding medical knowledge, retention of all relevant facts is impossible and problem-based learning, often on a Web-based platform, is becoming an essential part of practice and should be encouraged. Another goal was to create a format that could be updated easily periodically in response to changes in medical knowledge and practice. Finally, a link to the ACGME competencies for each content area was thought to be important to help embrace all aspects of trainee development that are necessary to meet both professional and lay concepts of acceptable practice. The Steering Committee identified 11 areas of content that best encompassed the breadth of pediatric gastroenterology without resulting in needless complexity: acid-peptic disease, congenital anomalies of the GI tract, GI bleeding, GI infections, hepatobiliary disorders, IBDs, malignancies and premalignant conditions, motility and functional GI disorders, nutritional disorders, pancreatic disorders, and intestinal failure. For each of these content areas, acknowledged experts were drafted to lead task forces, and they in turn invited additional experts to serve on these task forces. The format of each content area acknowledges the key role of the competencies in fellowship training. The outline of the content areas and the relation of the format to the general AGCME competencies are shown in Table 6. The last section of Table 6 emphasizes the importance of the developmental context in understanding the field of pediatric gastroenterology.TABLE 6: Format of the content areasAcknowledgments The authors acknowledge the role of the advisory group and especially the task force leaders and members for their work in creating the content areas.

It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA-for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss.Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel.IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease- with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians.

British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for the initial histopathological diagnosis of IBD were published in 1997. Changes since then include: more widespread use of full colonoscopy; greater recognition of the effects of time and treatment; improved documentation of variations in anatomical distribution; better understanding of the mimics of IBD; significant progress in clinical management; and modifications of terminology. Accordingly, an update is required. These revised guidelines aim to optimise the quality and consistency of reporting of biopsies taken for the initial diagnosis of IBD by summarising the literature and making recommendations based on the available evidence. Advice from existing clinical guidelines is also taken into account. Among the subjects discussed are: distinguishing IBD from other colitides, particularly infective colitis; subclassification of IBD (as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or IBD unclassified); the discriminant value of granulomas; aspects of disease distribution, including discontinuity in ulcerative colitis; time-related changes; differences between paediatric and adult IBD; the role of ileal and upper gastrointestinal biopsies; differential diagnoses such as diverticular colitis and diversion proctocolitis; and dysplasia.

The approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to define and prioritize outcomes. For therapeutic questions, the quality of evidence was also assessed using GRADE. Grading the quality of evidence for other questions was performed according to the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS) and Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tools. During a 3‐day consensus meeting, all recommendations were discussed and finalized. In cases where no randomized controlled trials (RCT; therapeutic questions) or diagnostic accuracy studies were available to support the recommendations, expert opinion was used.

However, gastroenterology societies have called for more data before making a formal recommendation. Aim To determine whether the detection of suspected NAFLD in overweight and obese children through screening in primary care and referral to paediatric gastroenterology resulted in a correct diagnosis of NAFLD . Methods Information generated in the clinical evaluation of 347 children identified with suspected NAFLD through screening in primary care and referral to paediatric gastroenterology was captured prospectively. Diagnostic outcomes were reported. The diagnostic performance of two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) was assessed. Results Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed in 55% of children identified by screening and referral. Liver disease other than NAFLD was present in 18% of those referred. Autoimmune hepatitis was the most common alternative diagnosis. Children with NAFLD had significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher screening ALT (98 ± 95) than children with liver disease other than NAFLD (86 ± 74). Advanced fibrosis was present in 11% of children.

In children over 6 years, however, gastric emptying was significantly delayed in those presenting with reflux compared with those without reflux; in children over 3 years there was slower gastric emptying in those with a decreased lower oesophageal sphincter pressure compared with those with higher pressure and in those with overt oesophagitis compared with those without oesophagitis. This study suggests that gastro-oesophageal reflux is more severe in childhood than in infancy, probably due to more complex motor disorders affecting the gastric fundus as well as lower oesophageal sphincter function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/adc.62.5.449", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153228370", "source": "openalex"}

Mature collagen is broken down by the action of specific enzyme collagenase. This has been estimated by a tissue-culture method and is produced by viable explants of mucosa. There is a significant increase in the amount of this enzyme produced post-operatively and it is suggested that this is responsible for the decrease in collagen and weakness of the colon. An increased amount of enzyme is produced by explants from the colon than from those of other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. This is regarded as an important reason for the high incidence of colonic and rectal anastomotic breakdown compared with breakdown of anastomoses in other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. Following colonic anastomosis there is increased collagenase production not only locally but throughout the gastro-intestinal tract, suggesting that wound healing is not only under local control.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800571206", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2012147690", "source": "openalex"}

Infectious diseases in particular cause enormous morbidity and mortality. Diseases which afflict both western and developing countries are often seen in more florid forms in poorer countries. Innovative techniques continuously improve and update gastroenterological practice. However, advances in diagnosis and treatment which are commonplace in the West, have yet to reach many developing countries. Clinical guidelines, based on these advances and collated in resource-rich environments, lose their relevance outside these settings. In this two-part review, we first highlight the global burden of gastroenterological disease in three major areas: diarrhoeal diseases, hepatitis B, and Helicobacter pylori. Recent progress in their management is explored, with consideration of future solutions. The second part of the review focuses on the delivery of clinical services in developing countries. Inadequate numbers of healthcare workers hamper efforts to combat gastroenterological disease. Reasons for this shortage are examined, along with possibilities for increased specialist training. Endoscopy services, the mainstay of gastroenterology in the West, are in their infancy in many developing countries. The challenges faced by those setting up a service are illustrated by the example of a Nigerian endoscopy unit. Finally, we highlight the limited scope of many clinical guidelines produced in western countries.

Aim To review systematically the effects of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease on work productivity. Methods Studies of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and work productivity were identified in a systematic literature search and their results were valued in US dollars using the human capital method. Work productivity loss was defined as absence from work (absenteeism) plus reduced effectiveness while working (presenteeism). Results Eight eligible studies were included. Reported work productivity loss among individuals with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease ranged from 6% to 42% and was primarily because of presenteeism (6–40%) rather than absenteeism (&lt;1% to 7%). Reported losses were greatest in patients experiencing sleep disturbance because of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease, and lowest in individuals from the general population taking appropriate prescription medication. Work productivity impairment correlated with symptom severity and responded to acid‐suppressive therapy. Assuming a 40‐h working week and average wages in the US, the weekly mean productivity loss per employee with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease can be estimated between 2.4 ($62) and 16.6 h ($430), depending on the population studied.

Many reasons have been given for the lower prevalence of GORD in Asia. Low dietary fat and genetically determined factors, such as body mass index and maximal acid output, may be important. Other dietary factors appear to be less relevant. Increased intake of carbonated drinks or aggravating medicines may influence the increasing rates of GORD in some Asian countries but no strong evidence links other factors, such as the age of the population, smoking or alcohol consumption, to GORD. The management of GORD in Asia is similar to that in Europe and North America but the lower incidence of severe oesophagitis in Asia may alter the approach slightly. Also, because Asians tend to develop stomach cancer at an earlier age, endoscopy is used routinely at an earlier stage of investigation. Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease is essentially a motility disorder, so short‐term management of the disease can usually be achieved using prokinetic agents (or histamine (H 2 )‐receptor antagonists). More severe and recurrent GORD may require proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or a combination of prokinetic agents and PPI. The choice of long‐term treatment may be influenced by the relative costs of prokinetic agents and PPI. © 2000 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1746.2000.02148.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2008180072", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2030602908", "title": "World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines on Celiac Disease", "text": "CONTENTS 1 Definitions 2 Key points 3 Epidemiology 4 Diagnosis of celiac disease 5 Management of celiac disease DEFINITIONS Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, immunologically determined form of enteropathy affecting the small intestine in genetically predisposed children and adults. It is precipitated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods.1,2 It is also referred to as celiac sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or nontropical sprue. Gluten can be defined as the rubbery protein mass that remains when wheat dough is washed to remove starch.3 The major protein fractions of gluten, gliadin and glutenin are storage proteins in wheat. They are present in wheat, rye, and barley and gives the dough its desired baking properties. Gluten is widely used as an ingredient in food processing. KEY POINTS Gluten and gluten-related proteins present in wheat, rye, and barley are the causative external antigens of CD. The prevalence of CD in an adult population varies between roughly 1 in 100 and 1 in 300 in most parts of the world. First-degree and (to a lesser extent) second-degree relatives have an increased risk for CD. Its clinical presentation varies widely, and the onset of the disease or symptoms may occur at any time in life. Many patients with CD have few symptoms or present atypically, whereas a minority of patients have malabsorption (classical CD). Patients with active CD have an increased risk of complications, including death, in comparison with the general population. However, this excess rate of major complications seems to return to normal after 3 to 5 years on a strictly gluten-free diet. Key Diagnostic Findings Include: Histopathologic changes in an intestinal biopsy, characterized by crypt hyperplasia, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and destruction of the surface epithelial lining Evidence that the small bowel enteropathy is dependent on gluten shown by positive CD-specific antibodies and/or clinical and/or histologic improvement in response to a gluten-free diet Serological Tests Can: Confirm CD in patients with a demonstrated characteristic enteropathy Screen for individuals at risk Identify patients in whom biopsy may be warranted. Be used to identify gluten consumption during follow-up in diagnosed patients The presence of autoantibodies directed against transglutaminase-2 suggests that CD has an autoimmune component.4 In adults, CD is diagnosed on average >10 years after the first symptoms appear.5 Patients with CD should not eat products containing wheat, rye, or barley. Patients usually need to follow a strictly gluten-free diet for the rest of their lives.6 Oats may be consumed, but they are very often contaminated by wheat, and pure oats are often not available. A small subgroup of patients with CD (<5%) may also be intolerant to pure oats.7 EPIDEMIOLOGY Introduction CD is common throughout the world and affects around 1 in 100 to 1 in 300 of the population.8,9 This prevalence is significantly higher than that recognized 20 years ago.10,11 The epidemiology of CD has iceberg characteristics that there are far more undiagnosed cases (below the waterline) than diagnosed cases (above the waterline). A key study by Fasano et al12 in 2003 found that the prevalence of CD was as follows: At risk, first-degree relatives: 1 in 10 At risk, second-degree relatives: 1 in 39 At risk, symptomatic patients: 1 in 56 Groups not at risk: 1 in 100 Ethnicity Early epidemiology studies regarded CD as a disease of individuals with white ancestry, mainly located in Europe and North America.13,14 However, although there is a lack of worldwide epidemiological information, further studies in other areas of the world have shown a similar prevalence.15,16 Some of these studies detected CD among people with Amerindian or African American ancestry.17–19 Recent reports have shown that CD is a common disorder in North Africa, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan.20–22 Very recent reports from China have shown that both, the CD-predisposing HLA-DQ alleles and the disorder itself are not rare in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, at least.23 In summary, worldwide distribution of gluten-containing foods, predisposing genotypes, and factors involved in the pathogenesis of CD, are likely to be responsible to the widespread and almost universal emergence of the disorder. At-risk Populations CD should be considered in the following cases (estimated prevalence are given in brackets, if available)6,24: First-degree and second-degree relatives of celiac patients (10% and 5%, respectively) Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia (3% to 15%) Unexplained folic acid, iron, or vitamin B12 deficiency Reduced serum albumin Unexplained hypertransaminasemia (2% to 9%) Osteoporosis and osteomalacia of premature onset (2% to 4%) Recurrent abdominal pain or bloating Other autoimmune disorders: type 1 diabetes mellitus (2% to 15%), thyroid dysfunction (2% to 7%), Addison disease, and autoimmune hepatitis (3% to 6%) Ataxia and idiopathic neuropathy Down syndrome and Turner syndrome (6% each) Irritable bowel syndrome (3%) DIAGNOSIS OF CD Introduction The considerable increase in the number of patients being diagnosed with CD correlates with the recognition of a remarkably wide variety of clinical manifestations of the disorder, the development of accurate screening tests, and also a true increase in the incidence. Current Diagnosis In current practice, the diagnosis of CD hinges on a diagnostic intestinal biopsy and the concomitant presence of a positive CD-specific serology.6,14,24–28 A second (posttreatment) biopsy is not necessary for most patients if they respond satisfactorily to the specific treatment and should be reserved for patients in whom the first biopsy and serological test are inconclusive (eg, seronegative enteropathy) or for patients on a strict gluten-free diet but fail to respond.26,27 A gluten challenge, in which the offending agent is reintroduced while the patient is on a restrictive diet, should be reserved for patients who are receiving treatment but have a doubtful diagnosis.24–28 Diagnostic Tests Intestinal Biopsy An intestinal biopsy together with positive serology represents the gold standard in diagnosing CD. In 1992, Marsh14 reviewed the intensity of mucosal damage observed in treated CD patients who were confronted with increased amounts of gluten (Fig. 1).FIGURE 1: Diagnosis of celiac disease.Histologic Characteristics of Celiac Enteropathy Histologic damage is considered characteristic, but not pathognomonic, of CD, as similar lesions are seen in several other disorders.29 CD affects the mucosa of the proximal small intestine, with damage gradually decreasing in severity toward the distal small intestine, although in severe cases the lesions can extend to more distal areas.14,26 The severity and extent of the histologic damage seem to correlate with the intensity of the clinical symptoms.26,28 The proximal damage may be very mild in atypical or silent cases, with little or no abnormality histologically detectable in the intestine. Abnormalities in the gastric and rectal mucosa may be observed in some cases.14 The lesion in the duodenum/upper jejunum may be patchy, as a result of which it may be missed if there is insufficient mucosal sampling.24 Four to 6 biopsy samples must be taken: 3 or 4 from the second part of the duodenum distal to the papilla and at least 1 from the duodenal bulb.30 A negative histologic diagnosis may justify a second biopsy in selected patients who have positive autoantibodies such as endomysial antibodies (EMA).26,31 Biopsy samples taken from the proximal duodenum above the papilla of Vater may have artifacts (eg, stretching of villi) produced by submucosal Brunner glands, which may be falsely interpreted as flat mucosa.30 Under light microscopy, the most characteristic histologic findings in patients who are taking a gluten-containing diet are14,29: Blunted or atrophic villi Crypt hyperplasia Mononuclear cell infiltration in the lamina propria Epithelial changes, including structural abnormalities in epithelial cells Intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration A series of well-designed studies by Marsh made it possible to interpret the wide range of mucosal damage induced by gluten, with the celiac histologic modifications being categorized as ranging from normal mucosa to complete flat villi. The modified Marsh classification is widely used in clinical practice to characterize the histologic damage.32,33 Key factors to be considered for making histologic diagnosis reliable include: Number of biopsies procured Quality of biopsy samples Handling of samples Patchiness of mucosal damage Different grades of lesion Subjective histologic interpretation Serum Antibodies for Suspicion and Diagnosis of CD CD-specific serological tests, which have been in use for >20 years now, are important for 2 purposes: to select patients in whom biopsies are appropriate and to confirm the diagnosis in cases in which an enteropathy has been detected.34–37 A number of serological markers have been shown repeatedly in many studies to be highly sensitive and specific for untreated CD. On the basis of the target antigens, serological tests for CD can be divided into 2 groups: Autoantibodies: antiendomysial (EMA) and antitissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody tests4,34 Antibodies targeting the offending agent (gliadin): conventional antigliadin antibodies (nowadays considered obsolete for diagnostic purposes).35 Antibodies against synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs)37–40 All of these antibodies are based on immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG). Specifically, IgG-based tests are useful for detecting CD in selected IgA-deficient patients.40 Choosing the Most Appropriate Serological Test in Different Clinical Scenarios To confirm gluten dependence in patients with a demonstrated enteropathy while consuming a gluten-containing diet. Both IgG DGP seems to be very helpful in IgA-deficient patients and for some EMA-negative and tTG-negative patients. To select patients for duodenal biopsy: to reduce the need for duodenal biopsies, and on the basis of the different accuracy of serological tests, a series of serological algorithms are used to select patients for biopsy in different clinical scenarios: From the general population (screening). tTG and DGPs show similar performance and have a high sensitivity. These tests have low positive predictive values in the general (low risk) population (with a prevalence of 1%). A serological algorithm, with serial use of more specific screening assays (eg, EMA) has therefore been widely used to improve the diagnostic accuracy in the general population. A recent study has suggested that the single assay detecting IgA and IgG subtypes of tTG and DGP is the most sensitive test. Simultaneous or serial use of 2 tests (eg, IgA and IgG DGP/tTG plus either IgA tTG or IgA DGP or IgG DGP) provides the highest positive and negative predictive values. A combination of tests therefore improves suspicion of cases.37–44 Case finding in high-risk populations. Any of the given tests can be used as a single assay, as they all show similar performance as a single test, or in combination. A combination of tests does not improve case finding. The EMA test requires expert observers, and ELISA tests for detecting tTG antibodies should therefore be recommended in settings with low expertise.35,36 Genetic Testing for Diagnosis Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 are found in virtually all patients (almost 100% sensitivity) and also in 30% to 40% of the population in Europe, where the great majority will never develop CD. These haplotypes are essential for the recognition of gliadin epitopes by antigen-presenting cells and are therefore a key factor in the development of adaptive immunity. On the basis of its extremely high-negative predictive value, HLA typing can help support exclusion of a diagnosis of CD in equivocal cases in which the patient lacks HLA-DQ2 and DQ8.14,45,46 Role of Endoscopy Endoscopy is a valuable tool for obtaining duodenal biopsy samples. Endoscopy may show typical duodenoscopic features that are highly predictive of mucosal damage.47–49 Characteristic findings on endoscopy include: scalloped folds, fissures, and a mosaic pattern; flattened folds; and smaller size and/or disappearance of folds with maximum insufflation. Although endoscopic signs of mucosal atrophy have a low sensitivity for diagnosing CD in the general population,50 the procedure is very helpful when these signs are detected during endoscopies that are being conducted for other reasons. In such cases, the endoscopist can follow-up with an intestinal biopsy due to a strong suspicion of mucosal atrophy (Table 1).TABLE 1: Cascade for Diagnosing Celiac DiseaseMANAGEMENT OF CD Introduction The only treatment for CD is a strictly gluten-free diet for life. No foods or medications containing gluten from wheat, rye, and barley, or their derivatives can be taken, as even small quantities of gluten may be harmful.6,14,24,27,31 Oats are not toxic in over 95% of patients with CD, but there is a small subgroup (<5%) in whom oats are not safe. In addition, there is reluctance in some countries to advise liberal use of oats, because of difficulties in guaranteeing that commercially available oats are free of contamination with other grains.7,51 Complete removal of gluten from the diet will result in symptomatic, serological, and histologic remission in most patients.52 Growth and development in children returns to normal with adherence to the gluten-free diet and many disease complications in adults are avoided, with an improvement in the quality of life.53–55 Approximately 70% of patients reported an improvement in symptoms within 2 weeks after starting the gluten-free diet.52 With strict dietary control, antibody levels may decrease very soon after the diet has been instituted. In contrast, complete histologic resolution is not always achieved, or may take years. Monitoring Compliance is difficult, and patients should therefore be advised of the importance of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet.55–57 A multidisciplinary approach can produce more meaningful outcome information. The following is a summary of recommendations for follow-up after diagnosis and tools for monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet, during the first year after diagnosis (with follow-up appointments every 3 to 6 mo): Clinical visits: check symptoms and laboratory tests. CD serology tests (best predictors: quantitative determination of DGP IgA and tTG IgA) Visit to an expert nutritionist: assessment of nutritional status and adherence to a gluten-free diet based on an interview, a food diary, and the frequency of consumption (coinciding with the clinical visit) After the first year and once the patient is stable, visits for consultation can be reduced to 1 per year. Follow-up intestinal biopsy is not required. Laboratory Assessment Specific serological tests should be less frequent, depending on the degree of compliance and the length of time spent on a gluten-free diet. Recent studies suggest that periodical testing for IgA DGP and/or IgA tTG is the preferred method for monitoring compliance.36,52 Although these tests do not identify minor dietary indiscretions, a continued reduction in serum concentrations helps to assess compliance with the diet.52 Nutritionist Consultation58–64 An expert dietitian should be consulted in order to: Assess the patient's current nutritional status Identify macronutrient and/or micronutrient intake and detect deficiencies and/or excesses Analyze eating habits and potential factors affecting access to the diet Provide information and initiate the gluten-free diet Provide dietary education Monitor and evaluate dietary compliance and reinforce alimentary counseling Patients who are unable to adhere to the diet may require support with psychological counseling. Persistence of Symptoms The persistence of symptoms is almost always caused by continued ingestion of gluten.55 A common difficulty with the gluten-free diet is cross-contamination and the presence of unsuspected gluten in processed foods and/or medicines (although the latter is rare). Gluten may be a hidden ingredient, so it is prudent for patients to routinely check the ingredient list before purchasing any product; available lists should be checked for allowable foodstuffs.60,62,64 Serology can detect major and continued lapses in dietary adherence.52,55,56 Note Further details and evidence are available in the full text of this guideline on the World Gastroenterology Organization web site, at: http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/celiac-disease.html.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0b013e31827a6f83", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030602908", "source": "openalex"}

When comparing patients with more than 15 reflux episodes x day(-1) (n=50), with those having less (n=43), no differences were found in lung function and GER parameters. However, there was a positive correlation between the provocative dose of methacholine causing forced expiration volume to fall 20% from the baseline and NRE in patients with NRE&gt;15 (r=0.561; p=0.05). In conclusion, gastro-oesophageal reflux was observed in a third of the asthma patients studied. These data do not support a firm aetiological relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux and asthma, but do suggest an association between the number of reflux episodes and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.97.10102255", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102708593", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: Subjects were recruited from 10 international sites by a total of 5581 face-to-face interviews conducted with randomly selected members of the general population aged 18 years and over (50.6% female; mean age 44 years). The sample was divided according to whether subjects reported 1 or more of 14 GI symptoms, or no GI symptoms. Those with any of 11 upper GI symptoms were then subdivided according to their most bothersome symptom: gastro-oesophageal reflux (GORD)-like symptoms, ulcer-like symptoms or dysmotility-like symptoms. Symptoms were classified as relevant if they were of at least moderate severity and/or occurred at least once a week. Results: A mean of 46.4% of subjects reported experiencing one or more of the 14 GI symptoms, with 28.1% experiencing upper GI symptoms classified as relevant. Significant differences between the prevalences of relevant symptoms were evident between sampling sites. The estimated prevalence of GORD-like symptoms for the pooled sample was 7.7%. For ulcer-like symptoms, prevalence was 4.1%, and for dysmotility-like symptoms 15.5%. Significant differences were observed in the prevalence rates of symptom groups between countries. Women were significantly more likely than men to experience relevant symptoms, with gender differences also observed in the rates of GORD-like and dysmotility-like symptoms. The proportion of those with relevant symptoms experiencing GORD-like symptoms increased significantly with age; ulcer-like symptoms showed no significant relationship with age; and dysmotility-like symptoms decreased significantly with age. The prevalence of relevant symptoms increased with increasing BMI. Conclusions: In conclusion, the DIGEST has provided valuable data on the cross-country prevalence of upper GI symptoms, and their association with biological factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/003655299750025237", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986038117", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are less responsive than patients with oesophagitis to acid‐suppressive therapy. Aim: To assess the role of acid reflux in gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Methods: The spatio‐temporal characteristics of reflux events were analysed and related to reflux perception in 45 patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and 20 patients with erosive oesophagitis. Results: Compared with healthy controls, all patients showed a higher intra‐oesophageal proximal spread of acid, which was prominent in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (&gt; 50% of events lasting for 1–2 min). Irrespective of mucosal injury, the risk of reflux perception was very high when acid reached proximal sensors (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.6–12.5), being maximal in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease with normal acid exposure time (odds ratio, 11; 95% confidence interval, 5.2–22.3). Conclusions: Patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease are characterized by a significantly higher proportion of proximal acid refluxes and a higher sensitivity to short‐lasting refluxes when compared with patients with oesophagitis. The highest proximal acid exposure and highest perception occurred in patients with non‐erosive gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease presenting with a normal pH‐metric profile. The assessment of acid distribution and its perception in the oesophageal body can better identify reflux patients who should benefit from acid‐suppressive treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.01702.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046430423", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2810026625", "title": "American College of Gastroenterology Monograph on Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "text": "INTRODUCTION Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Current estimates are that IBS affects up to 10–12% of adults in North America [1, 2]. Although it can affect all individuals regardless of age, creed, or gender, IBS is more common among women and is most commonly diagnosed in younger individuals (<age 50) [2, 3]. IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits; bloating and distention frequently coexist. The diagnosis of IBS is made by taking a careful history, eliciting key symptoms, as well as performing a physical examination and limited diagnostic testing [4–6]. IBS is categorized into four main subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit: IBS with constipation (IBC-C); IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D); IBS with mixed symptomology (IBSM); and unclassified IBS [5]. IBS imposes a significant burden to the health care system and to individuals. Direct medical costs attributed to IBS in the US, excluding prescription and over-the-counter medicines, were estimated at $1.5-$10 billion per year in 2005 [7]. Patients with IBS enrolled in a large Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) had significantly more outpatient visits and incurred nearly 50% more in total costs than individuals without IBS [8]. A retrospective case-control study from another large HMO reported that patients with IBS had significantly more diagnostic tests, imaging, and surgery compared with patients without a diagnosis of IBS [9]. Significant variations in care across the United States related to the diagnosis and treatment of IBS also play a role in excessive health care costs [10]. The burden of IBS on individuals can be measured in a number of ways. Studies have demonstrated consistently that IBS impairs work-related activities (e.g., lost work time, reduced productivity while at work) and also reduces quality of life [11, 12]. The development of effective and efficient treatment strategies for IBS assumes considerable importance, therefore, not just for the individual sufferer, but for society at large. Given the clinical heterogeneity that is a hallmark of the disorder and the absence of a single effective therapy for all sufferers, available therapies tend to focus on predominant symptomatology at presentation (i.e., altered bowel habits, abdominal pain, or bloating) [4–6]. Based on their purported mode of action, many pharmacological therapies for IBS developed in recent decades have been directed towards those with a particular bowel habit, whether diarrhea or constipation. However, treating IBS patients can be difficult as no validated treatment algorithm exists, not all patients respond to treatment, and patients with similar symptoms frequently respond to the same treatment differently. Fortunately, a variety of novel therapeutic strategies are being explored and new compounds have appeared since the last iteration of the ACG monograph on IBS [4]. The goal of this document, therefore, is to provide an updated, evidence-based document on the therapy of this common and, at times, debilitating disorder. AN OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF IBS THERAPY Prior to the last evidence-based systematic review on the management of irritable bowel syndrome commissioned and published by the ACG in 2014 [4], and the work that underpinned this, there had been several systematic reviews of available therapies for IBS [13–22]. We have previously shown that these had either not synthesized the data correctly, or contained inaccuracies in applying eligibility criteria and data extraction [23]. We have, therefore, updated all the rigorously performed meta-analyses [24–27], which informed the ACG position statement in 2014, according to the following protocol: Objectives Primary outcome. To assess the efficacy of available pharmacological therapies in treating IBS compared with placebo, or, in the case of psychological and dietary therapies, in comparison with either no treatment or standard/usual care. Secondary outcomes. To assess the efficacy of available pharmacological, psychological, and dietary therapies in treating IBS according to predominant stool pattern reported (IBS-C, IBS-D, or IBS-M), and to assess adverse events with pharmacological and other therapies for IBS. Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies. Only parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological therapies with placebo, or comparing psychological and dietary therapies with either no treatment or standard/usual care, were considered for this review. Cross-over trials were eligible for inclusion, provided extractable data were provided at the end of the first treatment period, prior to cross-over. Types of participants. Adults over 16 years of age recruited from primary, secondary, or tertiary care with IBS symptoms diagnosed by any criteria (including clinical impression). Types of interventions. The following treatments were considered eligible: Exercise, diet, and dietary manipulation 2. Fiber Interventions that modify the microbiota: prebiotics, synbiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics Antispasmodics and peppermint oil Antidepressants Psychological interventions Pro-secretory agents: linaclotide, plecanatide, and lubiprostone Eluxadoline Loperamide Serotonergic agents Polyethylene glycol 5-aminosalicylates Types of outcome measures. Subjects needed to be followed up for at least 1 week. The trials needed to include one or more of the following outcome measures: Global assessment of IBS cure or improvement Abdominal pain cure or improvement Global IBS symptom or abdominal pain scores Search strategy for identification of studies MEDLINE (1946 to July 2017), EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947 to July 2017), PsychINFO (1806 to July 2017), and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched. The search strategy is given below: Studies on IBS were identified with the terms irritable bowel syndrome and functional diseases, colon (both as medical subject heading (MeSH) and free text terms), and IBS, spastic colon, irritable colon, and functional adj5 bowel (as free text terms). For RCTs of dietary manipulation these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms: diet, fat-restricted, diet, protein-restricted, diet, carbohydrate-restricted, diet, gluten-free, diet, macrobiotic, diet, vegetarian, diet, Mediterranean, diet fads, gluten, lactose intolerance, or lactose (both as MeSH terms and free text terms), or the following free text terms: FODMAP$, glutens, or food adj5 intolerance. For RCTs of fiber, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms: dietary fiber, cereals, psyllium, sterculia, karaya gum, parasympatholytics, scopolamine, trimebutine, muscarinic antagonists, or butylscopolammonium bromide (both as MeSH and free text terms), or the following free text terms: bulking agent, psyllium fiber, fiber, husk, bran, ispaghula, wheat bran, spasmolytics, spasmolytic agents, antispasmodics, mebeverine, alverine, pinaverium bromide, otilonium bromide, cimetropium bromide, hyoscine butyl bromide, butylscopolamine, drotaverine, peppermint oil, or colpermin. For RCTs of prebiotics, synbiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms: Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibacterial agents, penicillins, cephalosporins, rifamycins, quinolones, nitroimidazoles, tetracycline, doxycycline, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, or tinidazole (both as MeSH and free text terms), or the following free text terms: antibiotic, or rifaximin. For RCTs of antidepressants and psychological therapies, including hypnotherapy, these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms: psychotropic drugs, antidepressive agents, antidepressive agents (tricyclic), desipramine, imipramine, trimipramine, doxepin, dothiepin, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, cognitive therapy, psychotherapy, behavior therapy, relaxation techniques, or hypnosis (both as MeSH terms and free text terms), or the following free text terms: behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy, or hypnotherapy. For RCTs of linaclotide, plecanatide, lubiprostone, eluxadoline, and loperamide these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms loperamide or antidiarrheals (both as MeSH and free text terms), as well as the following free text terms: linaclotide, constella, linzess, plecanatide, trulance lubiprostone, amitiza, eluxadoline, viberzi, imodium, or lopex. For RCTs of serotonergic agents these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the terms: serotonin antagonists or receptors (serotonin, 5-HT3) (both as MeSH and free text terms), or the following free text terms: 5-HT3 or alosetron. For RCTs of polyethylene glycol these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the term polyethylene glycol (both as a MeSH and free text term). For RCTs of 5-aminosalicylates these were combined using the set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: sulfasalazine, mesalamine, or aminosalicylic acid (both as MeSH terms and free text terms), or the following free text terms: balsalazide, olsalazine, mesalazine, pentasa, asulfidine$, azulfadine$, azulfidine$, sulfasalazine$, salazopyrin$, salazosulfapyridine, 5-ASA, 5ASA, 5-aminosalicylic$, 5-aminosalicylate$, 5aminosalicylic$, or 5aminosalicylate$. The search was limited to humans. No restrictions were applied with regard to language of publication. A recursive search of the bibliography of relevant articles was also conducted. Abstracts. ACG, DDW, and UEGW abstract books between 2000 and 2016 were hand-searched. Authors of trial reports published only as abstracts were contacted and asked to contribute full datasets or completed papers. Correspondence. Experts in the field were contacted for leads on unpublished studies. Methods of the review Selection of studies. The lead reviewer screened titles and trial abstracts that had been identified by the search strategy for articles that could possibly be eligible for the review. The lead reviewer then screened the selected trials to confirm eligibility, using pre-designed eligibility forms. A second reviewer, masked to the initial assessment, also evaluated all identified trials for eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and a consensus view was taken. Assessment of study quality. Only trials that used the word 'random', 'randomly', or 'randomized' in the description of their methodology were considered in this review and assessed for quality according to four characteristics: Method used to generate the randomization schedule (truly random or not stated/unclear). Computer generated random numbers, coin toss, or card shuffles, etc. were defined as truly random. Method used to conceal treatment allocation (adequate, inadequate, or unclear). If investigators were unaware of each participant's allocation to a treatment when they were recruited, then the allocation was said to be adequately concealed. Methods such as central randomization systems, or serially numbered opaque envelopes, fit these criteria. Implementation of masking (patients masked, clinicians masked, outcome assessors masked). When an identical placebo was used it was assumed that the participants were masked to their treatment allocation. Completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis. Wherever possible, completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis was recorded, as were dropout rates by group. Study quality was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data extraction. All data were extracted independently by two investigators on to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XP professional edition; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA). Any disagreement between investigators was resolved by discussion. The following characteristics were recorded for each trial: - Setting: population-based, primary care, secondary care, tertiary care - Country of origin and number of centers involved - Dose of therapy - Duration of therapy - Adverse events: both total number and individual adverse events, if available - Definition of IBS used - Primary outcome measure used Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, with all dropouts assumed to be treatment failures, wherever trial reporting allowed this. Data synthesis and analysis. For binary outcomes, (global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain improved or cured), the impact of interventions were expressed as relative risks (RR) of global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain not improving, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data were pooled using a random effects model, in order to give a more conservative estimate of the efficacy of individual IBS therapies [28]. The number needed to treat (NNT) for treatment efficacy, and the number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse events, were calculated using the formula NNT or NNH = 1/(control event rate × (1-RR)). These provide useful summary estimates for efficacy and safety for each of the active interventions of interest over a placebo or control intervention, corresponding to the number of extra patients needing to be treated with the active intervention over and above placebo or the control intervention to see one of the events of interest (i.e., a patient experiencing an improvement of symptoms or an adverse event). However, it should be pointed out that these cannot be used to compare the relative efficacy of one active intervention versus another, as they are not based on head-to-head studies. In addition, for NNHs, which are derived from summaries of adverse events it is important to point out that the definitions of these adverse events are also not standardized between individual trials, so again should not be compared. For continuous data, such as global IBS symptom scores or individual IBS symptom scores, a standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% CIs, was calculated. The results of individual studies can be diverse, and this inconsistency within a single meta-analysis can be quantified with a statistical test of heterogeneity, to assess whether the variation across trials is due to true heterogeneity, or chance. This quantity is termed I2, and its value ranges from 0 to 100%, with 0% representing no observed heterogeneity, and larger values indicating increasing heterogeneity. A value ≤50%, accompanied by a P value of >0.10 for the ÷2 test, was arbitrarily chosen to represent low levels of heterogeneity [29]. Review Manager version 5.3.5 (RevMan for Windows 2014, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to generate Forest plots of pooled RRs and SMDs for primary and secondary outcomes with 95% CIs, as well as funnel plots. The latter were assessed for evidence of asymmetry, and therefore possible publication bias or other small study effects, using the Egger test [30], if there were sufficient (10 or more) eligible studies included in the meta-analysis, in line with published recommendations [31]. GRADEpro version 3.6 (GRADE working group 2004–2007) was used to grade the quality of the evidence. Consensus was reached using a consensus-oriented decision-making framework [32], culminating in a face-to-face meeting to discuss the evidence and reach a unanimous decision on the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. EXERCISE, DIET AND DIETARY MANIPULATION Exercise We suggest exercise for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of Evidence: very low) Exercise and physical fitness are key elements of maintaining physical and mental health [33, 34]. Studies from healthy volunteers and patients suggest that physical activity protects against gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms [35, 36], and bears an inverse relationship with colonic transit time [37]. Based upon these observations, it is reasonable to hypothesize that exercise might be beneficial to patients with IBS. To date, there have been few RCTs that have rigorously evaluated the benefits of exercise in IBS patients. Daley et al. invited 305 IBS patients to participate in a RCT that compared 12 weeks of an exercise intervention with usual care [38]. Fifty-six IBS patients (18%) agreed to participate. Quality of life (IBS-QOL) and IBS symptoms (Birmingham IBS symptoms questionnaire) were assessed before and after the interventions. Exercise led to statistically significant benefits for constipation (95% CI: -1.6 to -20.1) but not for other outcomes such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, total symptom score, or quality of life. In a second trial, Johannesson et al. randomized 102 IBS patients to a rigorous exercise program monitored by a physiotherapist or usual care for 12 weeks [39]. Seventy-five IBS patients completed the trial. IBS symptom severity scores improved to a greater degree in the exercise arm compared with the control arm (P = 0.003). The same authors reported long-term follow-up data (median follow-up 5.2 years) for 39 of the originally enrolled IBS patients [40]. Increases in physical activity and improvements in symptom scores compared with baseline were maintained at follow-up. Summary. Although it is clear that exercise offers general health benefits and, whenever possible, should be encouraged the Task Force did not feel that the weight or strength of available evidence justified a strong recommendation regarding exercise for IBS. Although encouraging, the Task Force feels that the current body of evidence should be viewed as hypothesis-generating, and in need of validation by methodologically rigorous, appropriately powered, RCTs. Diet and dietary manipulation for IBS We suggest a low FODMAP diet for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: very low) We suggest against a gluten-free or exclusion diet based upon antibody or leukocyte activation test for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: very low) The majority of IBS patients associate symptom onset or worsening with eating a meal. Although true food allergy is uncommon in IBS patients, perceived food intolerances or sensitivities are quite common. Up to 90% of IBS patients exclude certain foods in the hopes of avoiding or improving their GI symptoms [41]. Since the publication of the last IBS Task Force evidence-based review in 2014 [4], there have been numerous studies that have evaluated dietary therapies in IBS patients [42]. Although various diets have been suggested to benefit IBS patients, the largest body of evidence relates to two specific diets; a diet low in fermentable oligo-saccharides, di-saccharides, and mono-saccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and a gluten-free diet. We identified seven eligible RCTs (evaluating 397 participants) that provided dichotomous outcomes for a low FODMAP diet versus an alternative diet [43–49]. There was an overall effect of the low FODMAP diet in reducing IBS symptoms with a RR of remaining symptomatic on a low FODMAP diet of 0.69 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.88). The NNT was 5 (95% CI 3 to 11) (Table 1).Table 1: Summary of evidence from randomized controlled trials of pharmacological, psychological, and dietary therapies in irritable bowel syndromeSimilar to another recent systematic review [50], our analysis found that all trials were subject to high risk of bias. Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded as very low, which related to imprecision resulting from the relatively small number of patients included in the trials, significant heterogeneity, and issues around blinding. Three trials in 271 IBS patients compared the low FODMAP diet with an alternative diet [43, 44, 47], two with usual diet [46, 48], and one with a high FODMAP diet [45]. The three trials that had adequate concealment of allocation and an alternative dietary intervention in the control arm showed no statistically significant benefit of a low FODMAP diet (RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.02) with no heterogeneity between studies [43, 44, 47]. The results of these trials are more difficult to interpret as they were not placebocontrolled, but rather, comparative effectiveness trials assessing two active dietary interventions. In each of these RCTs, the low FODMAP diet led to adequate relief of IBS symptoms in roughly half of the patients. None of the RCTs have evaluated the long-term efficacy of, or adherence to, a low FODMAP diet, or the personalized maintenance diet that is instituted after individual FODMAP reintroduction. Potential harms, which should be balanced with benefit, include impact on quality of life (e.g., social encounters) and effects on the colonic microbiome, which could exert negative effects on colonic health [45, 51–53]. We identified two eligible trials evaluating a gluten-free diet in 111 patients with IBS [54, 55]. Both were re-challenge trials involving IBS patients that reported that their symptoms were controlled with a gluten-free diet, but in whom celiac disease had been rigorously excluded. Participants were then randomized to have this diet spiked with gluten or not. This design only indirectly addresses the research question, as withdrawing a significant food group from the diet and then introducing it may enhance the likelihood of a nocebo response. There was no statistically significant impact on IBS symptoms in the gluten challenge versus gluten-free diet (RR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.28) with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 86%, P = 0.008) (Table 1). Another RCT evaluated 150 patients with IBS randomized to exclude all foods for which they had abnormal levels of IgG antibodies, or a sham diet where patients were asked to avoid a similar number of foods, but this was not based upon the IgG antibody test results [56]. This trial had an unclear risk of bias. Participants were followed for 12 weeks and 18 (28%) of 65 in the active intervention arm noted a significant improvement in symptoms, compared with 11 (17%) of 66 in the sham diet arm. This difference in response rates was not statistically significant (P = 0.14). The authors reported marginal statistical significance in those that adhered to their diet. A more recent RCT utilized leukocyte activation testing to evaluate a true vs. sham elimination diet in 58 IBS patients [57]. This study reported no difference in the proportion of patients with adequate relief of their IBS symptoms (P = 0.31) or quality of life (P = 0.92) after 4 weeks (secondary endpoints). However, there was a significantly greater increase in IBS global improvement scale score (primary endpoint) with the true vs. sham elimination diet (P = 0.04) after 4 weeks. Summary. Dietary therapies for IBS are of growing interest to patients, providers, and investigators. At present, the largest body of literature pertains to the low FODMAP diet. The available evidence supports a possible benefit for overall IBS symptoms in roughly half of sufferers. There are much less data for a gluten-free diet or elimination diets based upon IgG antibody or leukocyte activation testing. Importantly, there are little or no data that address the longterm efficacy, adherence, or harms of dietary therapies for IBS. FIBER IN IBS We recommend fiber for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: strong; Quality of evidence: moderate) We recommend psyllium, but not wheat bran, for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: strong; Quality of evidence: moderate) The updated systematic review and meta-analysis on fiber in IBS performed for this guideline identified 15 RCTs, involving 946 patients [58–72]. Only one trial was at low risk of bias [70]. There was a statistically significant effect in favor of fiber compared with placebo (RR of IBS not improving = 0.87; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94) (Table 1). There was no significant heterogeneity between results (I2 = 0%, P = 0.53). Six studies used bran in a total of 411 patients [58, 59, 64, 65, 69, 70], seven studies ispaghula husk in a total of 499 patients [60–63, 66, 67, 70], and the remaining three studies used \"concentrated fiber\" [68], linseeds [71], or rice bran [72]. Bran had no significant effect on treatment of IBS (RR of IBS not improving = 0.90; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03), but ispaghula was effective in treating IBS (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94). The NNT with ispaghula was 7 (95% CI 4 to 25). Data on overall adverse events were only provided by seven trials [63, 64, 66, 68, 70–72]. These trials evaluated 606 patients. A total of 130 (36.6%) of 355 patients receiving fiber reported adverse events, compared with 63 (25.1%) of 251 in the placebo arms (RR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). There were insufficient data from individual studies to assess adverse events according to type of fiber administered. Summary. Poorly fermentable, soluble fiber remains an evidence-based treatment for IBS. Insoluble fiber may exacerbate pain and bloating in IBS, and has no evidence for efficacy. The low cost and lack of significant side effects makes soluble fiber a reasonable first-line therapy for IBS patients and, in combination with the moderate quality of evidence, is the basis of a strong recommendation. The ability to improve stool viscosity and frequency logically argues for the use of fiber in patients with IBS-C, although the evidence base to support this contention is far from conclusive. INTERVENTIONS THAT MODIFY THE MICROBIOTA: PREBIOTICS, SYNBIOTICS, PROBIOTICS AND ANTIBIOTICS Prebiotics and synbiotics We suggest against the use of prebiotics and synbiotics for overall symptom improvement in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: very low) The concept that alterations in the gut microbiome might be relevant to IBS arose from observations that symptoms of IBS developed after an infection (post-infectious IBS) [73], that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may cause symptoms indistinguishable from IBS [74], and that the colonic microbiota is altered in IBS [75, 76]. In addition, some IBS symptoms (e.g., bloating, slowed intestinal transit, and early satiety) have been associated with specific gut microbiota profiles [77, 78]. These observations have also led to the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics, as well as antibiotics, in the treatment of IBS. Prebiotics are food or dietary supplements that result in specific changes in the composition and/or activity of the GI microbiota. Probiotics have been defined as \"live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\" [79]. Synbiotics, which are also food or dietary supplements, are a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics that act synergistically to promote the growth and survival of beneficial organisms. The previous monograph identified no trials of prebiotics in IBS [4]. The updated search identified one RCT [80]. In this study 128 patients with IBS-D were recruited, and randomized to receive either prebiotics (derived from chicory) or placebo for 8 weeks. This double-blind trial was at unclear risk of bias due to failure to report the method used to conceal treatment allocation. Neither global IBS symptoms nor abdominal pain were reported as a dichotomous outcome by the investigators. Mean abdominal pain relief scores at 8 weeks were significantly higher with the prebiotic vs. the placebo (4.92 ± 0.86 vs. 3.13 ± 1.36, P < 0.001). Flatulence scores were also significantly improved with prebiotic (4.97 vs. 2.98, P = 0.037). Data on adverse events were incompletely reported. With regard to synbiotics, no new RCTs were identified since the last version of the monograph [4], but there were two studies that recruited a total of 198 patients [81, 82]. The first was a single-blind RCT conducted in Italy [81], recruiting 68 patients with IBS, and which used a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and helveticus, with Bifidobacterium species, in a vitamin and phytoextract-enriched medium for 12 weeks. Only this trial reported dichotomous data. There were 7 (20.6%) of 34 patients assigned to synbiotics with persistent symptoms, compared with 30 (88.2%) of 34 assigned to control therapy (P < 0.01). The second study, conducted in South Korea [82], used Bifidobacterium lactis in combination with acacia fiber for 8 weeks in 130 patients. This double-blind trial was at unclear risk of bias due to failure to report the method used to conceal treatment allocation. Both trials assessed IBS symptoms on a continuous scale in 185 patients. Even though both trials were individually positive, there was no statistically significant effect of synbiotics in reducing symptoms, due to significant heterogeneity between studies (SMD = -1.73; 95% CI -3.73 to 0.27, I2 = 96%, P = 0.09). In both synbiotic studies adverse events were reported, and no significant events occurred in either treatment arm. Probiotics We suggest probiotics, taken as a group, to improve global symptoms, as well as bloating and flatulence in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: low) Since the previous monograph a total of 18 new trials were identified [47, 83–99]. Therefore, in total, there were 53 RCTs [47, 83–134], involving 5545 patients. Twenty-six trials were at low risk of bias, [47, 83, 84, 87–90, 92, 93, 96, 98, 99, 103, 105, 110, 112, 114, 115, 119, 121, 123, 124, 126, 130, 132, 133] with the remainder being unclear. There were 37 RCTs involving 4403 patients that gave outcomes as a dichotomous variable [47, 84, 86–89, 91, 92, 94–104, 110, 112, 113, 115, 118, 119, 121, 123, 125–134].

This updated consensus focuses on proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease and Barrett9s oesophagus. <h3>Methods</h3> A steering committee identified three areas to address: (1) burden of disease and diagnosis of reflux disease; (2) proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease; (3) Barrett9s oesophagus. Three working groups formulated draft statements with supporting evidence. Discussions were done via email before a final face-to-face discussion. We used a Delphi consensus process, with a 70% agreement threshold, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to categorise the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 32 statements were proposed and 31 were accepted by consensus. A rise in the prevalence rates of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Asia was noted, with the majority being non-erosive reflux disease. Overweight and obesity contributed to the rise. Proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux disease was recognised to be common. A distinction was made between refractory symptoms and refractory reflux disease, with clarification of the roles of endoscopy and functional testing summarised in two algorithms. The definition of Barrett9s oesophagus was revised such that a minimum length of 1 cm was required and the presence of intestinal metaplasia no longer necessary.

Aim To develop and test a short questionnaire to aid patient–doctor communication. Methods The Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale was developed from a systematic literature review, focus groups of patients and primary care physicians, and patient cognitive interviews. A psychometric validation study was conducted based on two consultations in new ( n = 100) or chronic ( n = 105) gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients. Results The Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.68 to 0.82), reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient in stable patients ranged from 0.61 to 0.72) and construct validity (Spearman correlations with Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia instrument and Reflux Disease Questionnaire: 0.5–0.8 in both patient groups). Effect sizes in new and chronic gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease patients ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 and 0.32 to 0.42, respectively. Doctors reported altering their treatment decision based on information provided by the Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale in 35% of patients, and 77% of doctors found it to be useful.

Moreover, AI, through machine or deep learning, permits the ability to develop predictive models from large datasets. Possibilities of predictive model development in machine learning are numerous dependent on the clinical question. For example, binary classifiers aim to stratify allocation to a categorical outcome, such as the presence or absence of a gastrointestinal disease. In addition, continuous variable fitting techniques can be used to predict quantity of a therapeutic response, thus offering a tool to predict which therapeutic intervention may be most beneficial to the given patient. Namely, this permits an important opportunity for personalization of medicine, including a movement from guideline-specific treatment algorithms to patient-specific ones, providing both clinician and patient the capacity for data-driven decision making. Furthermore, such analyses could predict the development of GI disease prior to the manifestation of symptoms, raising the possibility of prevention or pre-treatment.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2333557250", "title": "Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition", "text": "Thirty years ago, responding to the growing interest, rapid expansion, and increase in research in pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition, we established the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (JPGN). The editorial of the first edition began, quo vadis? (1). Thirty years later, we are asking the same question. What should the vision of JPGN be? It seems mandatory to provide the pediatric gastroenterologist with research and knowledge of gastrointestinal ontogenic function and malfunction during early life. It was hoped that the Journal would serve as an intellectual stimulus and an international forum for the presentation and discussion of advances and controversies within the discipline. The findings of differential timing of the expression of the genes controlling various small intestinal disaccharidases, pancreatic exocrine enzymes, and so on, led to a new practical paradigm on gut development (2). The paradigm included interaction of genetic endowment, gene expression, intrinsic biological clocks, endogenous regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamic-hypophysial-thyroid-adrenal axis, gastrointestinal receptors and mediators, and environmental influences. The environmental influences affecting gut ontogeny included intrauterine growth retardation and malnutrition early in life (2). Barker (3) hypothesized that the effect of intrauterine growth retardation increases the risk of later-onset disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults (3). The ontogeny of gut enzymes in early infancy and the recognition of pancreatic amylase deficiency and the early appearance of intestinal α-glucosidases and salivary amylase led to another ontogenic paradigm of alternate pathways of digestion and absorption in early infancy. The pragmatic outcome of ontogenic research was to use α-glucosides, such as sucrose, maltose, maltodextrins, and short polymers of glucose, during the neonatal period and for the compromised infant. Studies focused on the investigation and clinical applications of gastrointestinal ontogeny exemplify the early emphasis of JPGN. The potential for new therapeutic modalities attributable to age-related changes in the gut can stimulate clinical and basic research. The human genome project, the availability of stem cell biology, advances in molecular mechanisms of growth and development, and discoveries of mucosal growth factors and receptors that occurred as a result of the inception of JPGN have led to dramatic expansion of the basic, translational, and clinical studies in the Journal. We aspired to be one of the journals that publish original articles on gut ontogeny. In addition, we decided to invite ontogenic review articles that provided a basis for understanding the importance of gut ontogeny. Conversely, we were successful publishing age-related clinical studies in pediatric gastroenterology, with an emphasis on early life. An example of clinical disorders that we began to address successfully is celiac disease (CD). Clinical studies in CD emerged in the Journal, including global prevalence and high prevalence of silent preschool- and school-aged children, association with autoimmune disorders, Down syndrome, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and atypical presentations. Mechanistic studies of the effect of several genetic factors together with an environmental trigger were published. The genetic predisposition to CD was studied as a complex of HLA-DQA1*05/DQB1*02 and HLA-DQA*0301/DQB*0302 genes as major factors. Two strategies of genetic research—linkage and association studies—led to the discovery of several susceptibility loci and genes such as a region on 5q, MYO9B, and CTLA4. In addition, a genomewide association study identified 8 new risk regions, 7 of which harbour genes controlling the immune response. Again, we solicited review articles on genetic molecular biology research and the pathogenesis of CD. Another example for specific age-related clinical presentation and therapeutic considerations is failure to gain weight and short stature associated with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Pediatric IBD is different in some major aspects from adult IBD. Early-onset IBD has a distinct phenotype with disease manifestations that are primarily colonic with severe perianal disease and extragastrointestinal manifestations. Furthermore, early-onset IBD is unique in its association with metabolic diseases, neutrophil defects, immunodeficiency states, chronic granulomatous disease, and leukocyte adhesion defects. IBD is thought to result from a complex interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. Large-scale genotyping techniques have resulted in identification of >30 IBD-associated genes. Pediatric IBD management must consider lifelong disease and treatment. Twenty-five percent of patients with IBD develop the disease in childhood and adolescence. Clinicians need to weigh the risks and benefits of selected therapies, particularly the effects of medications, such as steroids, on growth and development and lifetime of exposure. For the last 30 years, the Journal has published a significant number of articles addressing issues specifically focused on pediatric IBD. We realized that the greatest challenge facing JPGN was reaching out to the world in general and developing countries in particular. We solicited articles from developing countries and found worthwhile clinical observations, but we were challenged by the flaws of study design, such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, and statistical analyses; data presentation; results; and conclusions. We were confronted with English and grammatical mistakes, leading us to correct and rewrite articles, provided they had a sound scientific message for the pediatric gastroenterology community. A new dimension of the Journal was added when the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition started to develop and update clinical practice guidelines and recommendations (4,5). Overall, it is apparent that JPGN has evolved to become an important cornerstone for the discipline and a reference journal for the societies of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition. My suggestion for the future is that the clinical research emphasizes acute and chronic gut diseases, all the while continuing to consider the effect of the ontogeny of the gut. In the quest to improve the knowledge of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition, we should develop new areas of focus and analysis, perspectives, policy forums, and technical comments, similar to the journal Science. Presentation of the basic science news on the ontogeny of the gut, including cell biology, genetics, and immunology, should be a stimulus for inquiry and research to advance the frontiers of pediatric gastroenterology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0b013e318244d27e", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2333557250", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was thus to establish the optimal alternative posture for reducing reflux. <h3>METHODS</h3> 24 infants (&lt; 5 months) with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux were studied prospectively with 48 h pH monitoring. They were randomly assigned to one of the 24 permutations of the four positions (supine, prone, right, left). During the first 24 hours the infant was held horizontally, and then the permutation was repeated at 30 degrees head elevation, giving a total of eight study segments for each infant. Data were edited to remove all time when the infants were not in the prescribed positions.

The diagnostic value of a treatment test with omeprazole is unclear. Methods: Patients with dyspepsia including heartburn admitted for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind Scandinavian multicentre study. Before entry 188 patients were enrolled, and 160 were randomized to 1-week treatment with 20 mg omeprazole twice daily or placebo. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was defined as reflux oesophagitis Savary-Miller grades II-III at endoscopy or pH &lt;4 exceeding 4% of the total time at 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring and was found in 135 patients. The treatment test was considered positive when the patient's symptoms improved during the treatment week compared with the pretreatment day. Results: The sensitivity in diagnosing reflux disease was 71-81% with omeprazole as a diagnostic test, compared with 36-47% for placebo during treatment days 3-7. The specificity was similar for the two treatment arms during the first days of the study. During the end of the week a larger proportion of the patients with normal endoscopy and pH test responded to omeprazole treatment, giving omeprazole lower specificity than placebo. The investigators' overall evaluation of whether the patient was a responder to the test had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 55% in the omeprazole-treated patients. The corresponding figures in the placebo group were 17% and 92%, respectively. Conclusion: One week of omeprazole treatment is a simple diagnostic test with a fairly high sensitivity.

Guidelines are intended to be flexible, not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach, and should be distinguished from standards of care, which are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of choices in any health care problem, the physician should select the course best suited to the individual patient and the clinical situation presented.

These guidelines are also approved by the governing boards of American College of Gastroenterology and Practice Parameters Committee. Expert opinion is solicited from the outset for the document. Guidelines are reviewed in depth by the committee, with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields. The final recommendations are based on the data available at the time of the production of the document and may be updated with pertinent scientific developments at a later time. The following guidelines are intended for adults and not for pediatric patients.To develop practice guidelines for the management of gastrointestinal bleeding in adult patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.Randomized controlled trials published through October of 1993 were evaluated by members of the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee. Each paper was reviewed by three members of the committee and rated for quality of design by predetermined criteria. Meta-analysis of the studies for each treatment were evaluated for both outcome and quality of design and formed the basis for recommendations for treatment. Randomized controlled trials published between October of 1993 and August of 1995 have been added to update and modify the recommendations. The reader is referred to an excellent article by D'Amico et al. (The treatment of portal hypertension: A meta-analytic review. Hepatology 1995;22:332-354), which presents most of the meta-analyses reviewed by this committee.Once esophageal varices have been established by endoscopy as the site of bleeding, either sclerotherapy or endoscopic variceal ligation should be performed to control the bleeding episodes. Concomitant use of vasoactive drugs lowers portal pressure, potentially offers the endoscopist a clearer field in which to work, and is the only noninvasive treatment for nonesophagogastric variceal sites of bleeding related to portal hypertension. For patients failing medical therapy, the transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunt procedure is a reasonable alternative to an emergency surgically created shunt. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are the only proven therapy for prevention of first variceal hemorrhage. Both nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation (which has replaced sclerotherapy for this indication) are effective in reducing the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding. For patients failing these approaches, selective or total shunts or, in selected patients, liver transplantation are appropriate rescue procedures.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2410280742", "source": "openalex"}

Pepsin detection in saliva has been proposed as an ‘office-based’ method for GORD diagnosis. The aims of this study were to establish normal values of salivary pepsin in healthy asymptomatic subjects and to determine its value to discriminate patients with reflux-related symptoms (GORD, hypersensitive oesophagus (HO)) from functional heartburn (FH). <h3>Design</h3> 100 asymptomatic controls and 111 patients with heartburn underwent MII-pH monitoring and simultaneous salivary pepsin determination on waking, after lunch and dinner. Cut-off value for pepsin positivity was 16 ng/mL. Patients were divided into GORD (increased acid exposure time (AET), n=58); HO (normal AET and + Symptom Association Probability (SAP), n=26) and FH (normal AET and—SAP, n=27). <h3>Results</h3> 1/3 of asymptomatic subjects had pepsin in saliva at low concentration (0(0–59)ng/mL).

Typical symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are heartburn and regurgitation but gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis. The pathogenesis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease can be considered as the result of a complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W61329766", "source": "openalex"}

Compared with regurgitation, reflux episodes associated with heartburn were more frequently pure liquid (p = 0.009) and acidic (p = 0.027), had a lower nadir pH (p&lt;0.001), were more frequently preceded by acid reflux episodes (p&lt;0.001) and had a longer reflux bolus clearance time (p&lt;0.001). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> High proximal extent of the refluxate is the only factor associated with reflux perception in patients on double-dose PPI. However, compared with regurgitation, composition of the refluxate, sensitisation of the oesophagus by preceding acid exposure and delayed bolus clearance appear to play a role in heartburn perception.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2007.133470", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127647682", "source": "openalex"}

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted paediatric and adult data on primary (clinical failure) and secondary outcomes. <b>Results</b> 11 studies were included. Meta-analysis was limited to five studies in adults that compared proton pump inhibitors with placebo. All outcomes favoured proton pump inhibitors: the odds ratio for clinical failure (primary outcome) was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 1.27); number needed to treat (NNT) was 5 (harm 50 to ∞ to benefit 2.5). For secondary outcomes, the standardised mean difference between proton pump inhibitors and placebo was −0.51 (−1.02 to 0.01) for mean cough score at the end of the trial and −0.29 (−0.62 to 0.04) for change in cough score at the end of the trial. Subgroup analysis with generic inverse variance analysis showed a significant mean change in cough (−0.41 SD units, −0.75 to −0.07). <b>Conclusion</b> Use of a proton pump inhibitor to treat cough associated with GORD has some effect in some adults.

Design Population-based multi-centre prospective survey. Setting 29 public hospitals and 96 private specialists in gastroenterology in four administrative areas in France during 1996. Subjects A total of 2133 AUGIH patients 18 years and over were included in the six-month study. Outcome measures Incidence and mortality. Results The overall incidence in France was 143 cases per 100 000 persons per year, classified as out-patients (16%), emergency admissions (59%) and in-patients (25%). The incidence rates increased with age except for in-patients, and were higher in males. Peptic ulcer (36.6%), varices (13.7%) and erosive disease (12.3%) were the most frequent diagnoses. In 677 patients (31.7%), aspirin, antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids were taken on the 7 days before bleeding. The overall mortality (out-patients excluded) was 14.3% (10.7% for emergency patients and 23% for in-patients). Mortality was associated with comorbidities (especially malignancies, cirrhosis, asthma or respiratory deficiency), was lower in emergency patients using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and higher in in-patients using corticosteroids. Conclusions In France, patients with AUGIH are frequently managed as out-patients. Gastrotoxic drug use is frequently associated with AUGIH and constitutes a strategic opportunity for preventive treatment. Discrepancies between countries are not clearly explained either by demographic factors or by drug use, but this may be related to the emphasis on AUGIH in in-patients.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol12:175-181 © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology 2000, 12:175-181", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200012020-00007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048106278", "source": "openalex"}

Joint statement of the European Society for Paediatric Allergology and Clinical Immunology (ESPACI) Committee on Hypoallergenic Formulas and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition", "text": "For more than 50 years, many children with food protein allergies and other forms of dietary protein intolerance have been treated successfully with protein hydrolysates with highly reduced allergenicity and, more recently, also with products based on amino acid mixtures. Strategies for the prevention of allergy have been proposed, including the use of products with extensively reduced allergenicity. Products designed to have a moderately reduced allergenicity have also been proposed and marketed in Europe as hypoallergenic formulas. The European Society for Paediatric Allergology and Clinical Immunology (ESPACI) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) have commented previously on these issues,1 2 and the Commission of the European Union has issued a regulation for the requirements of infant formulas with reduced allergenicity or reduced antigenicity.3 This paper comments on the current developments and unresolved issues in the dietary treatment and prevention of food allergy in infancy to help inform paediatricians and other health care professionals, as well as manufacturers of infant foods. Adverse reactions to foods are a problem, particularly in infancy and early childhood, and can present with a wide spectrum of clinical reactions such as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, or other symptoms. Reproducible adverse reactions to food(s) can be the result of one or more immune mechanism(s) or they can be non-immunologically mediated. Immunologically mediated reactions, which are often immediate IgE mediated reactions, are defined as food protein allergy. Non-immunologically mediated reactions can be divided into enzymatic or transport defects (for example, lactase deficiency, or glucose/galactose malabsorption), pharmacological or other (undefined) reactions.2 4 The pattern and threshold of adverse reactions to foods varies. None of the symptoms related to immunologically or non- immunologically mediated adverse reactions to foods are pathognomonic, and no single laboratory test is diagnostic of food allergy.

Methods : Patients with GERD ( n = 6215) were included in a prospective cohort study (ProGERD). All patients underwent endoscopy and received esomeprazole. At baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment, symptoms and quality of life were assessed. Factors that influenced changes in the quality of life were determined by multiple regression analyses. Results : At baseline, the quality of life in GERD patients was lower than that in the general population, and was similar to that in patients after acute coronary events. No differences in symptoms or quality of life were observed between the subgroups of patients with non‐erosive GERD, erosive GERD and Barrett's oesophagus. After treatment with esomeprazole, the symptoms and quality of life were improved in all subscales within 2 weeks ( P &lt; 0.001). The mean score of the disease‐specific quality of life instrument (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Patients) increased from 4.6 to 6.2 points, representing a highly relevant clinical improvement. The generic quality of life (SF‐36) reached levels similar to those in the general population, but, again, no difference was found between the three different subgroups of GERD patients. The main factors associated with an improvement in the quality of life after treatment were symptom relief, severe erosive reflux disease, absence of extra‐oesophageal disorders, avoidance of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug intake and positive Helicobacter pylori status. Conclusions : GERD causes a significant impairment in the quality of life that can be attenuated or normalized within a time period as short as 2 weeks by treatment with esomeprazole. These findings were similar across the whole GERD patient spectrum.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2036.2003.01770.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061038149", "source": "openalex"}

Although the pathophysiology is similar to that of adults, symptoms of GERD in infants and children are often distinct from classic ones such as heartburn. The passage of gastric contents into the esophagus is a normal phenomenon occurring many times a day both in adults and children, but, in infants, several factors contribute to exacerbate this phenomenon, including a liquid milk-based diet, recumbent position and both structural and functional immaturity of the gastro-esophageal junction.

We investigated 33 patients (12 women, 21 men; mean age 36 years) with typical symptoms, a negative oesophagoscopy, and a 24 hour oesophageal pH-metry indicative of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux. All patients received antacids or prokinetic drugs or both for three to six months. Nineteen of 33 patients still had symptoms at the end of treatment, of whom five had developed erosive changes of the oesophageal mucosa. The other 14 discontinued treatment and remained asymptomatic during a six month follow up period. Comparison of the pretreatment pH-metry data of the 19 symptomatic patients and the 14 asymptomatic patients showed no differences in the pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the two groups. We conclude that in a substantial proportion of patients with pathological reflux without oesophagitis symptoms may persist and mucosal lesions may develop during conventional treatment without any apparent change in the reflux. Patients who developed endoscopic oesophagitis did not have a more severe pretreatment pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux when compared with those who did not develop oesophageal mucosal damage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.32.8.845", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009230817", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.46.7.479", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167382039", "source": "openalex"}
