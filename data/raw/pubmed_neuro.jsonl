{"id": "37827183", "title": "Pragmatic solutions to reduce the global burden of stroke: a World Stroke Organization-Lancet Neurology Commission.", "text": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The burden of disability after a stroke is also large, and is increasing at a faster pace in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Alarmingly, the incidence of stroke is increasing in young and middle-aged people (ie, age <55 years) globally. Should these trends continue, Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 (reducing the burden of stroke as part of the general target to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030) will not be met. In this Commission, we forecast the burden of stroke from 2020 to 2050. We project that stroke mortality will increase by 50%—from 6·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6·0 million–7·1 million) in 2020, to 9·7 million (8·0 million–11·6 million) in 2050—with <b>disability-adjusted life-years</b> (DALYs) growing over the same period from 144·8 million (133·9 million–156·9 million) in 2020, to 189·3 million (161·8 million–224·9 million) in 2050. These projections prompted us to do a situational analysis across the four pillars of the stroke quadrangle: surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation. We have also identified the barriers to, and facilitators for, the achievement of these four pillars. DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS (DALYS): The sum of the years of life lost as a result of premature mortality from a disease and the years lived with a disability associated with prevalent cases of the disease in a population. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health On the basis of our assessment, we have identified and prioritised several recommendations. For each of the four pillars (surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation), we propose pragmatic solutions for the implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce the global burden of stroke. The estimated direct (ie, treatment and rehabilitation) and indirect (considering productivity loss) costs of stroke globally are in excess of US$891 billion annually. The pragmatic solutions we put forwards for urgent implementation should help to mitigate these losses, reduce the global burden of stroke, and contribute to achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, the WHO Intersectoral Global Action Plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders (2022–2031), and the WHO Global Action Plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Reduction of the global burden of stroke, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, by implementing primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies and evidence-based acute care and rehabilitation services is urgently required. Measures to facilitate this goal include: the establishment of a framework to monitor and assess the burden of stroke (and its risk factors) and stroke services at a national level; the implementation of integrated population-level and individual-level prevention strategies for people at any increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, with emphasis on early detection and control of hypertension; planning and delivery of acute stroke care services, including the establishment of stroke units with access to reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke and workforce training and capacity building (and monitoring of quality indicators for these services nationally, regionally, and globally); the promotion of interdisciplinary stroke care services, training for caregivers, and capacity building for community health workers and other health-care providers working in stroke rehabilitation; and the creation of a stroke advocacy and implementation ecosystem that includes all relevant communities, organisations, and stakeholders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37827183/"}

The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened a writing group to develop an expert consensus document for an updated definition of stroke for the 21st century. Central nervous system infarction is defined as brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia, based on neuropathological, neuroimaging, and/or clinical evidence of permanent injury. Central nervous system infarction occurs over a clinical spectrum: Ischemic stroke specifically refers to central nervous system infarction accompanied by overt symptoms, while silent infarction by definition causes no known symptoms.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the effectiveness of interventions for ALS. Two systematic reviewers from Cochrane Response supported the guideline panel. The working group identified a total of 26 research questions, performed systematic reviews, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and made specific recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided where insufficient evidence was available. A guideline mapping effort revealed only one other ALS guideline that used GRADE methodology (a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guideline). The available evidence was scarce for many research questions. Of the 26 research questions evaluated, the NICE recommendations could be adapted for 8 questions. Other recommendations required updates of existing systematic reviews or de novo reviews. Recommendations were made on currently available disease-modifying treatments, multidisciplinary care, nutritional and respiratory support, communication aids, psychological support, treatments for common ALS symptoms (e.g., muscle cramps, spasticity, pseudobulbar affect, thick mucus, sialorrhea, pain), and end-of-life management.

These challenges reflect not only the growing public health effect of dementia in an aging global population, but also more specific ethical complexities including early loss of patients' capacity to make decisions regarding their own care, the stigma often associated with a dementia diagnosis, the difficulty of balancing concern for patients' welfare with respect for patients' remaining independence, and the effect on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of family caregivers. Caring for patients with dementia requires respecting patient autonomy while acknowledging progressively diminishing decisional capacity and continuing to provide care in accordance with other core ethical principles (beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence). Whereas these ethical principles remain unchanged, neurologists must reconsider how to apply them given changes across multiple domains including our understanding of disease, clinical and legal tools for addressing manifestations of illness, our expanding awareness of the crucial role of family caregivers in providing care and maintaining patient quality of life, and societal conceptions of dementia and individuals' personal expectations for aging. This revision to the American Academy of Neurology's 1996 position statement summarizes ethical considerations that often arise in caring for patients with dementia; although it addresses how such considerations influence patient management, it is not a clinical practice guideline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34524968/"}

Von Monakow (1885) and Dejerine and Vialet (1893) gave the first descriptions of patients with cortical blindness who were unaware of their disability, but did not distinguish this unawareness from the rest of the clinical description. Anton (1999) described patients with cortical deafness and cortical blindness, considering these defects of awareness as a symptom independent from the neurological dysfunction. He conceptualized them as a phenomenon in its own right and tried to link this unawareness of a disability with specific neuro-anatomical changes. Finally, Babinski (1914) coined the term \"anosognosia\" to designate the clinical entity conceptualized by Anton (1899) and extended this concept from the unawareness of cortical deafness and blindness to the unawareness of hemiplegia. The choice of the term \"anosognosia\" to denote the observed phenomenon was important, because referring to \"lack of knowledge of the disease\" (anosognosia), he not only emphasized the separation between \"lack of knowledge\" and \"disease, \" but also suggested a general use of this term, because disease can refer to many other disabilities besides hemiplegia. Further investigations have shown that: (a) brain-damaged patients may be unaware of different kinds of disabilities; (b) anosognosia can be selective, in that an affected person with multiple impairments may be unaware of only one handicap, while appearing fully aware of any others; and (c) lack of acknowledgment of a disease may not necessarily be due to a defective awareness, but must sometimes be considered as an extreme but understable pattern of adaptation to stress. For this condition, the term \"Denial of Illness\" seems preferable to that of anosognosia.

In line with this uniformity, and also with Charcot's concept of hysteria as a functional disorder, neuroimaging studies suggest that for some of these disorders, there might be some changes of neural connectivity in specific pathways at the origin of the behavioral aspects.

Using the term \"cholestérine\" (cholesterin), the name of cholesterol at the time, he identified the biological nature of atheromatous plaques, and made detailed drawings.

The implementation and the survey took place at a single academic comprehensive stroke center in northeast Ohio in the United States. \"Virtual rounding\" consisted of patient presentation and discussion in the morning in on-line virtual team format followed by in-person patient rounds in small groups. Acute stroke evaluations in the emergency department included direct in-person evaluation by neurology residents with supervision over telemedicine.The neurology residents, stroke fellows, stroke nurse practitioners, and stroke staff physicians were surveyed 2 months after implementation. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis, written responses in comment sections were analyzed using content analysis. Thirty-two of 42 (73%) surveys were completed. Nine (45%) residents and 5 (42%) experienced providers responded that virtual rounds did not compromise learning and education on stroke service. Fifteen (75%) residents and all experienced providers agreed that virtual rounds protected caregivers from exposure to the virus. While more than a third of residents (37%) did not feel comfortable utilizing telemedicine in ED, the majority of experienced providers (89%) were at ease with it. A total of 58% of residents and 67% of experienced providers felt that they were spending less time at the bedside, and 42% of residents and 58% of experienced providers felt less connected to patients during the pandemic. Majority of neurology residents' experience was not positive utilising telemedicine as compared to other staff providers. This is likely attributed to lack of prior exposure and unpreparedness. Incorporation of telemedicine curricula in medical school and residency training could prepare the next generation physicians to effectively use these technologies and meet the growing need for telehealth services for current and future pandemics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34798435/"}

Although interventional neurology techniques have existed for decades, recent landmark trials in stroke thrombectomy have catalyzed dramatic changes to the interventional neurology field, and there is rising neurology interest and representation. Unlike other neurology subspecialties, however, interventional neurology training and fellowship applications are not standardized. Thus, it can be difficult for neurology trainees to navigate this rapidly changing and multidisciplinary field. This article seeks to provide neurology residents and residency program directors with a brief overview of the modern interventional neurology field, the current fellowship application process, and tips on how neurologists can best prepare for a career in interventional neurology. To this end, we conducted a nationwide survey of interventional neurology fellowship program directors regarding training neurologists. We distill survey responses into concrete, actionable items for neurology trainees.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37652702/"}

Currently, little is known about the status of the quality of neurological care services available in China. As neurological primary care is mostly provided at the county hospital level, investigation of this geographical level is required. The aim of this study is to evaluate currently available neurology care services in Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations in east China. A multi-site, county-level hospital-based observational survey was conducted in east China from January 2017 to December 2017. A questionnaire was made to assess hospital and the departmental patient care capabilities, human resources and technical capacity in neurology departments. Of 228 hospitals across the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations, 217 documents were returned. Of these, 22 were excluded due to invalid hospital information or duplicate submission. Overall, most hospitals have neurology departments (162, 83.1%) while less than half of the hospitals have a stroke center (80, 41.0%) and neurology emergency department (46, 23.6%). Among 162 hospitals with neurology department, 5 were excluded due to inadequate sharing, leaving 157 hospitals for analysis. About 84.1% of these neurology departments can administer intravenous thrombolysis while about one third of them has the ability to perform arterial thrombectomy (36.9%). In addition, 46.2% of hospitals can carry out computed tomography angiography (CTA) in emergency room. Tertiary care hospitals are much more equipped with modern medical resources compared to the secondary hospitals. In four administrative regions, the neurology services are better in more economically advanced regions. Neurological care services need to be enhanced at the county-level hospitals to improve health care delivery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31744462/"}

Neglect has a significant impact on functional outcomes, so it is important to detect. However, there is no consensus on which are the best screening tests to administer to detect neglect in time-limited clinical environments. Members of the European Academy of Neurology Scientific Panel on Higher Cortical Functions, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, and researchers produced recommendations for primary and secondary tests for bedside neglect testing based on a rigorous literature review, data extraction, online consensus meeting, and subsequent iterations. A total of 512 articles were screened, and 42 were included. These reported data from 3367 stroke survivors assessed using 62 neglect screens. Tests were grouped into cancellation, line bisection, copying, reading/writing, and behavioral. Cancellation tasks were most frequently used (97.6% of studies), followed by bisection, copying, behavioral, and reading/writing assessments. The panel recommended a cancellation test as the primary screening test if there is time to administer only one test. One of several cancellation tests might be used, depending on availability. If time permits, one or more of line bisection, figure copying, and baking tray task were recommended as secondary tests. Finally, if a functional and ecological test is feasible, the Catherine Bergego Scale was recommended. Overall, the literature suggests that no single test on its own is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of neglect. Therefore, the panel recommended that multiple neglect tests should be used whenever possible. This study provides consensus recommendations for rapid bedside detection of neglect in real-world, clinical environments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510782/"}

Traditional methods for assessing neurological disorders rely on clinical scales and subjective measures. The snapshot of the disease progression at a particular time point, lack of cooperation by the children during assessments, and susceptibility to bias limit the utility of these measures. Wearable sensors, which capture data continuously in natural settings, offer a non-invasive and objective alternative to traditional methods. This review examines the role of wearable sensors in various paediatric neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, Gaucher disease, headaches, and sleep disorders. The review highlights their application in tracking motor function, seizure activity, and daily movement patterns to gain insights into disease progression and therapeutic response. Although challenges related to population size, compliance, ethics, and regulatory approval remain, wearable technology promises to improve clinical trials and outcomes for patients in paediatric neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39888848/"}

Most of these accounts date from the first Babylonian dynasty of the first half of the second millennium BC, within a millennium and a half of the origin of writing. The Babylonians were remarkably acute and objective observers of medical disorders and human behaviour. Their detailed descriptions are surprisingly similar to modern 19th and 20th century AD textbook accounts, with the exception of subjective thoughts and feelings which are more modern fields of enquiry. They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of brain CT angiography (CTA) with and without CT perfusion (CTP) between neurology senior residents and stroke fellows. In this neuroimaging study, nine practitioners (four senior neurology residents (SNRs) and five stroke fellows (SFs)) clinically assessed and interpreted the imaging data of 50 cases (15 normal images, 21 large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and 14 medium vessel occlusions (MeVOs) in two sessions, 1 week apart in comparison to final diagnosis of experienced neuroradiologist and experienced stroke neurologist consensus. Interrater agreement of CTA alone and CTA with CTP was quantified using kappa statistics, sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. Overall, arterial occlusions were correctly identified in 221/315 (70.1%) with CTA alone and in 266/315 (84.4%) with CTA and CTP (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The sensitivity of overall arterial occlusions detection with CTA alone was 94.2% (95% CI: 90.8%-96.6%) while with addition of CTP was 98% (95% CI: 95.6%-99.3%), The specificity of CTA alone was 74.7% (95% CI: 67.2%-81.3%) which increased with CTP to 84.4% (95% CI: 77.7%-89.8%). The likelihood of correct identification with CTA alone was 156/189 (82.54%) for LVOs and 65/126 (51.59%) for MeVOs. This increased to 169/189 (89.42%; <i>p</i> = 0.054) for LVOs and 97/126 (76.98%; <i>p</i> < 0.001) for MeVOs when the CTA images with CTP were viewed. There was good overall interrater agreement between readers when using CTA alone (<i>k</i> 0.71, 95% CI, 0.62-0.80) and almost perfect (<i>k</i> 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76-0.94) when CTP was added to the image for interpretation.

The resulting draft document had further input from contributors outside the synergium. Recommendations of the Synergium are: Basic Science, Drug Development and Technology: There is a need to develop: (1) New systems of working together to break down the prevalent 'silo' mentality; (2) New models of vertically integrated basic, clinical, and epidemiological disciplines; and (3) Efficient methods of identifying other relevant areas of science. Stroke Prevention: (1) Establish a global chronic disease prevention initiative with stroke as a major focus. (2) Recognize not only abrupt clinical stroke, but subtle subclinical stroke, the commonest type of cerebrovascular disease, leading to impairments of executive function. (3) Develop, implement and evaluate a population approach for stroke prevention. (4) Develop public health communication strategies using traditional and novel (eg, social media/marketing) techniques. Acute Stroke Management: Continue the establishment of stroke centers, stroke units, regional systems of emergency stroke care and telestroke networks. Brain Recovery and Rehabilitation: (1) Translate best neuroscience, including animal and human studies, into poststroke recovery research and clinical care. (2) Standardize poststroke rehabilitation based on best evidence. (3) Develop consensus on, then implementation of, standardized clinical and surrogate assessments. (4) Carry out rigorous clinical research to advance stroke recovery. Into the 21st Century: Web, Technology and Communications: (1) Work toward global unrestricted access to stroke-related information. (2) Build centralized electronic archives and registries. Foster Cooperation Among Stakeholders (large stroke organizations, nongovernmental organizations, governments, patient organizations and industry) to enhance stroke care. Educate and energize professionals, patients, the public and policy makers by using a 'Brain Health' concept that enables promotion of preventive measures.

Further, the early history of Munich neurology is described, with its slow pace of separation (in comparison to e.g. Heidelberg, Frankfurt and Hamburg) from the parent disciplines, psychiatry and internal medicine. In Munich, they were long shaped by psychiatrists such as Bernhard von Gudden, Emil Kraepelin, Kurt Kolle and Hanns Hippius and by Friedrich von Müller and, in particular, by Gustav Bodechtel in internal medicine.Once independent, further development of neurology in Munich was characterized by fast-paced, almost revolutionary changes in neuroimaging, electrophysiology, sonography, and engineering as well as in basic neuroscience, neurogenetics included. The new department thrived under the leadership of Adolf Schrader (from 1971), Thomas Brandt (from 1984) and Marianne Dieterich (from 2008) who enjoyed the support of an ever-increasing specialised clinical-scientific staff.Evidence-based treatment of neurological disorders became the overarching and internationally visible focus of Munich neurology, with respect to both practical implementation and to research. The exemplary diseases and syndromes of multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, movement disorders, dizziness and disorders of balance and gait as well as diseases of the musculature and peripheral nerves are cared for not only within the inpatient and outpatient sections of the Neurology Department but also by units such as the Friedrich Baur Institute (FBI), the German Dizziness and Balance Centre (DSGZ), the Institutes for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD) and for Clinical Neuroimmunology as well as in the interdisciplinary Department of Palliative Care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35831745/"}

Therefore, we investigated the incidence, risk factors, and the impact of AKI on the clinical outcomes in a group of Chinese patients with stroke. We retrospectively recruited 647 stroke patients from the neurology ICU between 2012 and 2013. AKI was identified according to the 2012 KDIGO criteria. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using modified Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation for Chinese patients. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was assessed for the stroke severity. A total of 135 (20.9%) patients developed AKI. Patients with AKI stages from 1 to 3 were 84 (62.2%), 26 (19.3%), and 25 (18.5%), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for AKI were higher NIHSS score (OR, 1.027; 95% CI 1.003-1.051), lower baseline eGFR (OR, 0.985; 95% CI 0.977-0.993), the presence of hypertension (OR, 1.592; 95% CI 1.003-2.529), and infectious complications (OR, 3.387; 95% CI 1.997-5.803) (P < 0.05 for all).

There is a growing body of literature that supports using ultrasonography to improve diagnostic accuracy and aid in performing procedures. Despite the increasing utilization of this imaging modality in medicine, there has been no comprehensive review of the clinical applications of ultrasound in the field of neurology. We discuss the current uses and limitations of ultrasound for various neurological conditions. We review the role for ultrasound in commonly performed neurologic procedures including lumbar puncture, botulinum toxin injections, nerve blocks, and trigger point injections. We specifically discuss the technique for ultrasound-assisted lumbar puncture and occipital nerve block as these are commonly performed. We then focus on the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of neurologic conditions. This includes neuromuscular diseases such as motor neuron disorders, focal neuropathies, and muscular dystrophy as well as vascular conditions such as stroke and vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage. We also address ultrasound's use in critically ill patients to aid in identifying increased intracranial pressure, hemodynamics, and arterial and/or venous catheterization.

It is possible that a positive EMG response to command, EEG reactivity to sensory stimuli, laser-evoked potentials, and the Perturbational Complexity Index can distinguish MCS from vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS). The natural history of recovery from prolonged VS/UWS is better in traumatic than nontraumatic cases. MCS is generally associated with a better prognosis than VS (conclusions of low to moderate confidence in adult populations), and traumatic injury is generally associated with a better prognosis than nontraumatic injury (conclusions of low to moderate confidence in adult and pediatric populations).

With the development of clinical EEG, the definition of electroclinical complexes became an essential tool to define epileptic syndromes, particularly focal epileptic syndromes. Modern advances in diagnostic technology, particularly in neuroimaging and molecular biology, now permit better definitions of epileptic syndromes. At the same time detailed studies showed that there does not necessarily exist a one-to-one relationship between epileptic seizures or electroclinical complexes and epileptic syndromes. These developments call for the reintroduction of an epileptic seizure classification based exclusively on clinical semiology, similar to the seizure classifications which were used by neurologists before the introduction of the modern diagnostic methods. This classification of epileptic seizures should always be complemented by an epileptic syndrome classification based on all the available clinical information (clinical history, neurological exam, ictal semiology, EEG, anatomical and functional neuroimaging, etc.). Such an approach is more consistent with mainstream clinical neurology and would avoid the current confusion between the classification of epileptic seizures (which in the International Seizure Classification is actually a classification of electroclinical complexes) and the classification of epileptic syndromes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10100955/"}

Pharmacological approaches to treatment include cholinesterase inhibitors, dopamine agonists and stimulants. CASE 1A 66-year-old man with progressive supranuclear palsy returned to clinic for review. His wife was upset and finding it difficult to cope. She described him as 'completely lazy', as he just sat in his chair all day watching television, even though he could still do things for himself. She felt that he could not be bothered to speak to her anymore because he was 'obsessed with TV'. He did not seem to engage with the visits to the grandchildren that she arranged. He said that he felt fine apart from the problems with his walking.The neurologist was confident that the patient was not depressed, and that the wife's concerns reflected the apathy that is often very pronounced in progressive supranuclear palsy. By explaining to the man's wife that these problems were due to his disease, their relationship improved and she felt more able to cope with caring for him. CASE 2A 75-year-old man attended clinic with his wife. She had worried about him for over a year, as he had become increasingly withdrawn. He used to enjoy going to the local pub but now stayed at home all day. He seemed less concerned about his personal appearance, about which he used to be meticulous. More recently, she had noticed that he had become forgetful.

It is less known that Dante had a sound level of medical knowledge, probably derived by his academic studies. In his works, medieval notions of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology (e.g. the connection between brain and spinal cord, function of optic nerve and peripheral nerves, knowledge of vegetative nervous system) and descriptions of neurological disorders (e.g. epileptic seizures, effects on nervous system by metal intoxication, and narcolepsy) may be found, specially in the Inferno, the first part of his masterpiece, the Divine Comedy. These accurate descriptions have led some authors to believe that the poet himself may have suffered from a neurological disease (epilepsy or hypersomnia). Damned souls of the Inferno seem to be also afflicted by psychiatric disorders, such as melancholia and depression. The analysis of Dante's works confirms that poetry - as well as literature in general - may be an important source of information for historians of neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25925207/"}

Although today we would classify the syndrome as a conversion disorder, it was considered a separate disease by Paul Blocq (1860-1896), who described this phenomenon as the inability to maintain an upright posture, despite normal function of the legs in the bed. Paul Blocq's original 1888 articles on astasia abasia were read, partly translated from French to English, and the cases were summarized. A review of a selection of the literature following Blocq's description on astasia abasia was performed. Present day literature was consulted as well. Blocq reviewed what was known about astasia abasia in two papers. Although he was the first to use the combined term astasia abasia, he referred to similar descriptions of Charcot, Richer, Mitchell, Jaccoud, Roméi, and Erlenmeyer. Blocq's contribution was in compiling the experiences and observations of preeminent 19th century neurologists. He recognized that paralysis, jumping, fits, tremor, and bizarre behavior could all be associated with the syndrome. He distinguished the disorder from hysteria. Moreover, he presented a formal delineation of the gait disorder and provided a pathophysiologic concept. Prognosis was considered favorable. Paul Blocq directed attention to psychogenic gait disorders by publishing a small case series on astasia abasia. Today, these case descriptions would be likely considered cases of conversion or psychogenic gait disorder, with or without other conversion/psychogenic movement disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17516452/"}

However, the scale and complexity of these data make them difficult to interpret and require the use of sophisticated bioinformatics applied to extensive datasets, including whole exome and genome sequences. Detailed analysis of genetic data has shown that accurate phenotype information is essential for correct interpretation of genetic variants and might necessitate re-evaluation of the patient in some cases. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates bioinformatics, clinical evaluation, and human genetics can help to address these challenges. However, despite numerous studies that show the efficacy of next-generation sequencing in establishing molecular diagnoses, pathogenic mutations are generally identified in fewer than half of all patients with genetic neurological disorders, exposing considerable gaps in the understanding of the human genome and providing opportunities to focus research on improving the usefulness of genomics in clinical practice.

The spectrum of neurologic insults in children is diverse and clinical practice is largely empirical, as few randomized, controlled trials have been reported. This lack of data poses a substantial challenge to the practice of pediatric neurocritical care (PNCC). PNCC has emerged as a novel subspecialty, and its presence is expanding within tertiary care centers. This review highlights the recent advances in the field, with a focus on traumatic brain injury (TBI), cardiac arrest, and stroke as disease models. Variable approaches to the structure of a PNCC service have been reported, comprising multidisciplinary teams from neurology, critical care, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and anesthesia. Neurologic morbidity is substantial in critically ill children and the increased use of continuous electroencephalography monitoring has highlighted this burden. Therapeutic hypothermia has not proven effective for treatment of children with severe TBI or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, results of studies of severe TBI suggest that multidisciplinary care in the ICU and adherence to guidelines for care can reduce mortality and improve outcome. There is an unmet need for clinicians with expertise in the practice of brain-directed critical care for children. Although much of the practice of PNCC may remain empiric, a focus on the regionalization of care, creating defined training paths, practice within multidisciplinary teams, protocol-directed care, and improved measures of long-term outcome to quantify the impact of such care can provide evidence to direct the maturation of this field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26863153/"}

Childhood AIS is instead associated with a variety of conditions including cerebral arteriopathies, congenital heart disease, infection, head and neck trauma, sickle cell anemia, and prothrombotic abnormalities. Although the pathophysiology and outcomes of adult AIS differ significantly from those in childhood AIS, therapeutic management remains similar, largely because of the paucity of evidence from devoted pediatric observational studies and clinical trials. The purpose of this article is to review the current guidelines and evidence in the treatment of childhood AIS, within the context of that which exists in adult AIS. Medical management of hypoxia, hyperglycemia, fever, blood pressure, and increased intracranial pressure has been insufficiently investigated in childhood stroke, resulting in a lack of guidance in these areas. Although acute antithrombotic management in childhood AIS has received relatively greater attention in published recommendations, it is based almost exclusively on consensus and expert opinion, and differs considerably among existing pediatric guidelines. Rehabilitation therapy in childhood AIS has great potential for meaningful improvements in long-term outcomes, especially given the plasticity of the young brain; however, little guidance for rehabilitative measures is provided by published recommendations. Ongoing and future multicenter cohort study efforts, and ultimately devoted pediatric clinical trials, will be essential to establish comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of childhood AIS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18496844/"}

Likewise, it changed the perception of classical neurology practice, research, and the way of looking at age-related conditions. Neurological disorders are the most frequent cause of major disability in the elderly and account for almost half of the incapacitation occurring beyond age 65 and more than 90% of serious dependency. However, a number of neurological changes occur also in the absence of a specific disease, making the assessment and management of neurological complaints and findings a specific expertise. Maximizing success in clinical care of the elderly requires expertise in geriatric neurology, which includes an understanding of current research regarding aging and age-related neurological dysfunctions, and the ability to work with other geriatric healthcare providers. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases mainly offer symptomatic relief without slowing progression, the landscape is evolving. Biomarkers of pathology and neuroimaging have continued to develop, with a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment. These advances have not only helped to improve our knowledge of disease pathophysiology but also disease stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring, and possible therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage. Neurological disorders are a leading cause of major disability and dependency in the elderly, underscoring the need for expertise in geriatric neurology for effective clinical care of this population. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases primarily provide symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, advancements in biomarkers and neuroimaging are significantly evolving. These advancements enhance our understanding of disease pathophysiology and stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring and potential therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage.

Ozone therapy increases interest in new neuroprotective strategies that may represent therapeutic targets for minimizing the effects of oxidative stress. The overview examines the latest literature in neurological pathologies treated with ozone therapy as well as our own experience with ozone therapy. The effectiveness of treatments is connected to the ability of ozone therapy to reactivate the antioxidant system to address oxidative stress for chronic neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, and other pathologies. Application options include large and small autohemotherapy, intramuscular application, intra-articular, intradiscal, paravertebral and epidural, non-invasive rectal, transdermal, mucosal, or ozonated oils and ointments.

Interestingly, the prevalence of migraine among the headache specialists themselves is much higher than in the general population. Although triptans have revolutionized the acute treatment of migraine, treatment is still problematic for the sizable percentages of patients with an incomplete or no response and recurrence of headache. Triptans are generally very safe when the physician, aware of the potential for coronary artery vasoconstriction, appropriately screens patients before and during their use. Serotonin syndrome as a complication of triptan use is quite rare. Although there is no definite evidence of teratogenesis, triptans should not be taken during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Caution is also advised when using a triptan during breastfeeding. The United States Headache Consortium parameters, which consider indications for preventative treatment and propose general principles of management, are reviewed. Unfortunately, the experience of many migraineurs with preventative medications is less than satisfactory because of side effects or lack of efficacy. Treatment of both migraine with prolonged aura and basilar migraine is anecdotally based. Many headache specialists do not use beta blockers for prevention for those with prolonged aura and basilar migraines because of concerns over the potential limitation of compensatory vasodilatory capacitance. There are seven case reports in the literature of an association between stroke and the use of beta blockers in migraineurs. Prevention using divalproex sodium and verapamil is favored by many headache specialists. Triptans are contraindicated in the treatment of patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine because of concern over the potential for cerebral vasoconstriction. The frequency of migraine is usually unchanged with the use of oral contraceptives although, occasionally, migraine may occur for the first time or increase in frequency. Studies have produced conflicting results as to whether low-dose estrogen oral contraception increases the risk of stroke. Migraine alone increases the risk of stroke, at least in women under the age of 45 years. Most women with migraine without aura and migraine with visual aura lasting less than 1 hour can safely use low-dose estrogen oral contraceptives when there are no other contraindications. Those with aura symptoms such as hemiparesis or dysphasia or prolonged focal neurologic symptoms and signs lasting more than 1 hour should avoid starting low-dose estrogen oral contraceptives and stop the medication if they are already taking it.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11471758/"}

In spite of the huge demand for qualified dysphagia diagnostics in neurology, a systematic FEES education has not yet been established. The structured training curriculum presented in this article aims to close this gap and intends to enforce a robust and qualified FEES service. As management of neurogenic dysphagia is not confined to neurologists, this educational programme is applicable to other clinicians and speech-language therapists with expertise in dysphagia as well. The systematic education in carrying out FEES across a variety of different professions proposed by this curriculum will help to spread this instrumental approach and to improve dysphagia management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26911194/"}

In many cases each specialty tends to assume a leading role in proposing guidelines minimising the aspects not commonly treated; the SPREAD experience allowed a valid cooperation and the confluence of selective opinions toward the goals of stroke care and the clinical decision supported by evidence. In the last years, some hospitals proposed a stroke clinical pathway performed on the basis of integrated actions of all specialists involved in stroke care. The organisation core is the stroke unit but a strong point is represented by the relationship with the emergency system and the post-discharge organisation. The Italian Stroke Forum is a scientific society linking several specialties, approaching different aspects of cerebrovascular disease, ranging from epidemiology to pathophysiology, diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment, and rehabilitation. For these characteristics the proposed guidelines published in SPREAD are accepted by 34 scientific societies and are largely adopted as the scientific background of the stroke clinical pathway. The Cerebrovascular Disease Association, was proposed as a Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society, has a similar organisation regarding the different neurological aspects involved in stroke care, from neuroepidemiology to neurorehabilitation. Recently, the American Board of Medical Specialties approved a Certification in Vascular Neurology as a new subspecialty requested by the American Academy of Neurology; maybe in the near future a Consensus Conference has to be organised in Italy also, with the aim of defining a common management of stroke and promoting the growth of vascular neurology disease as an independent area of medical expertise.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16752070/"}

In this article, we sought to answer five questions: 1) What is a neurohospitalist? 2) How many neurohospitalists practice in the United States? 3) What are potential advantages of neurohospitalists? 4) What are the challenges of implementing a neurohospitalist practice? 5) What effect does a neurohospitalist have on clinical outcomes? We queried biomedical databases (e.g., PubMed) by using the search terms \"hospitalist,\" \"neurohospitalist,\" and \"neurology hospitalist.\" We also searched the Society of Hospital Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology Dendrite classified advertisement Web sites for hospitalist and neurology hospitalist growth by using the same search terms. We defined neurology hospitalists (neurohospitalists) as neurologists who devote at least one-quarter of their time managing inpatients with neurologic disease. Although the number of hospitalists has grown considerably over the past decade, limited data on neurohospitalists exist. Advertisements for neurohospitalist positions have increased from 2003 through 2007, but accurate assessment of growth is limited by the lack of a central organizational affiliation and unifying terminology. Health care pressures spawned the growth of medicine and pediatric hospitalists, who provide efficient, cost-effective care by reducing the length of hospitalization. Because neurologists experience the same pressures, we expect neurohospitalists to increase in number, especially within areas that have sufficient inpatient volume and resources.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18337585/"}

A neuropaediatrician, before making indiscriminate use of such major complementary investigations as neurogenetics and imaging techniques to diagnose a dysmorphic syndrome, should obtain a detailed clinical history and, particularly, a very careful physical examination, including adequate neurological examination. Thus in neuropaediatrics the final diagnosis and early determination of normality or abnormality is based on two things: the clinical semiology derived from the clinical history and neurological examination, and complementary investigations (sophisticated or not) which make us relate these findings to clinical data. A large proportion of neurological disorders, especially those involving the intellect, are found in patients with some type of chromosome anomaly, which cause less than 6% of all malformations of the central nervous system. At the present time a wide range of dysmorphic syndromes are recognized, with or without accompanying chromosome anomalies. Many of these are also associated with mental deficiency or signs of neurological deficiency. Genetic studies should be requested when monogenetic disorders or mitochondrial disorders are suspected, and in multifactorial disorders. It has been shown that the presence of minor dysmorphic defects in children with epileptic seizures is associated with a much worse prognosis, possibly because it is also associated with cerebral malformations. Often these minor anomalies are seen in similar form in close relations of the children involved. It is therefore necessary to take care in evaluation of these defects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12389193/"}

As the leading cause of disability and second cause of dementia, primary prevention should be the main way to fight the disease, since therapy is not efficient enough. Several observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use. On the other side, family history of breast carcinoma, mastopathy, thromboembolism, in certain cases gallbladder disease, will discourage the commencement of HRT.

In this survey, I will discuss in a historical perspective the different interpretations provided by classical and contemporary authors to explain this puzzling observation. First, I will take into account the different positions of classical authorities on this topic, starting from the first debates (mainly based on anatomo-clinical observations) on the organisation of language in the brain. Then, I will attempt to summarize the work of authors who have tackled this complex issue more recently, in systematic investigations using methods drawn from experimental psychology, to clarify the meaning of non-verbal cognitive disorders in aphasia. Finally, in the last part of the survey, I will discuss the interpretation of proponents of the 'semantic hub' hypothesis who have tried to analyse and explain the differences between the non-verbal semantic defects of patients with semantic dementia and aphasic stroke patients. The hypothesis which assumes that most non-verbal cognitive disorders observed in aphasic patients are due to a preverbal conceptual disorder, which cannot be attributed to a loss of semantic representations but rather to a defect in their controlled retrieval, seems substantially confirmed. Nevertheless, two main issues must still be clarified. The first is that some of the non-verbal cognitive defects of aphasic patients seem due to the negative influence of language disturbances on abstract non-verbal cognitive activities, rather than to a preverbal conceptual disorder. The second issue concerns the exact nature and the neuroanatomical correlates of the defective controlled retrieval of unimpaired conceptual representations, which should subsume most of the non-verbal cognitive disorders of aphasic patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24607882/"}

An international panel was therefore convened, to agree on robust operational definitions for future studies and to validate them in an observational study involving 10 centres from the European Stroke Database Collaboration. Standardised neurological assessments were performed daily for the first 3 days on patients with acute stroke, consecutively admitted within 24 h of onset, using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) scoring system. An early deterioration episode (EDE) was defined as a >/=2 SSS-point worsening in either conscious level, arm, leg or eye movement scores, and/or a >/=3 SSS-point worsening in speech score, between consecutive neurological assessments. Stroke progression (SP) was defined as a similar neurological worsening comparing the day 3 assessment with the baseline assessment, or death occurring within 72 h of onset. The ability of SP to predict poor outcome (death or a Barthel ADL score <15/20 at 3 months), independently of initial stroke severity or other prognostic factors, was compared with possible alternative definitions, including one based on the Canadian Stroke Scale. The occurrence of EDEs and SP within the first 3 days of admission could be determined in 563 cases. EDEs occurred in 33% and SP in 26% of cases. Both were strong independent predictors of poor outcome. The prognostic efficiency of the European Progressing Stroke Study (EPSS) definition of SP was better than any of the alternatives examined, and clearly better than a definition based on changes in the total SSS score. The EPSS definitions of EDEs and SP have good construct and prognostic validity. They can be recommended as a standard for future studies on the aetiology and mechanisms of this common and important phenomenon.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14718754/"}

Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) is a member of the neuronal thread protein family and has a molecular weight of approximately 41 kD. AD7c-NTP has been identified as a biomarker for its specifically elevated levels in putative brain domains, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the urine of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Since the urine test is non-invasive, easy to perform, and patients accept it more easily than other methods, the urinary AD7c-NTP concentration has been recommended as a practical diagnostic tool for diagnosing AD and MCI. AD7c-NTP has undergone nearly 25 years of research course from its initial discovery to pathological verification, multi-center clinical evaluation, improvement of detection methods, epidemiological investigation, and combined application with other biomarkers. However, as a fluid biomarker, AD7c-NTP can be detected in urine instead of the traditional biomarker sources-CSF or blood, which has made the use of AD7c-NTP as a biomarker controversial.

Aspirin was the first antiplatelet agent to be used in this context and is still the most frequently prescribed preventive treatment for ischemic stroke. However, because the results of clinical studies with aspirin have been inconsistent, the dose of aspirin required for stroke prevention in persons with cerebrovascular disease has been a subject of debate among stroke neurologists. In the present discussion, low-dose aspirin is generally regarded by the experts as equivalent in effectiveness to high-dose aspirin, and its higher tolerability has the potential to significantly increase compliance with long-term therapy. Higher aspirin doses may have clinical utility in particular settings, but this requires further study. Despite the controversy, aspirin is now recognized as the treatment standard against which other antiplatelet agents are compared. Antiplatelet agents that may be more effective than aspirin have now been developed. Although each of these agents has been directly compared with aspirin in a large, randomized clinical trial, the lack of direct comparisons among these alternative antiplatelet therapies complicates decisions regarding long-term care of patients with cerebrovascular disease.

However, major advances have recently been made in our understanding of the genetic basis of monogenic inherited epilepsies. Progress has been particularly evident in familial idiopathic epilepsies and in many inherited symptomatic epilepsies, with the discovery that mutations in ion channel subunits are implicated, and direct molecular diagnosis of some phenotypes of epilepsy is now possible. This article reviews recent progress made in molecular genetics of epilepsy, focusing mostly on idiopathic epilepsy, and some types of myoclonus epilepsies. Mutations in the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 and beta2 subunit genes have been detected in families with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and those of two K(+) channel genes were identified to be responsible for underlying genetic abnormalities of benign familial neonatal convulsions. The voltage-gated Na(+) -channel (alpha1,2 and beta1 subunit), and GABA receptor (gamma2 subunit) may be involved in the pathogenesis of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy. Mutations of Ca(2+)-channel can cause some forms of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

In a primary headache disorder, headache itself is the illness and headache is not attributed to any other disorder (e.g. migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic cephalgias). In secondary headache disorders, headache is the symptom of identifiable structural, metabolic or other abnormality. Red flags include the first or worst headache ever in the life, recent headache onset, increasing severity or frequency, occipital location, awakening from sleep because of headache, headache occurring exclusively in the morning associated with severe vomiting and headache associated with straining. Thus, the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary headaches rests mainly on clinical criteria. A thorough evaluation of headache in children and adolescents is necessary to make the correct diagnosis and initiate treatment, bearing in mind that children with headache are more likely to experience psychosocial adversity and to grow up with an excess of both headache and other physical and psychiatric symptoms and this creates an important healthcare problem for their future life.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21359874/"}

Relevant literature was systematically reviewed and strength of evidence classified based on the American Academy of Neurology's criteria (Level A: established; Level B: probable; Level C: possible). An increased risk of falls is established among persons with diagnoses of stroke, dementia, and disorders of gait and balance (Level A) and probable among patients with Parkinson disease, peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity weakness or sensory loss, and substantial vision loss (Level B). A history of falling in the past year strongly predicts the likelihood of future falls (Level A). Screening measures have been developed to further assess risks of falls, including functional assessments that may be useful (Levels B and C). Several of these assess overlapping neurologic functions--i.e., gait, mobility, and balance--and there is insufficient evidence to assess whether they offer benefit beyond that provided by a standard neurologic examination. Patients with neurologic or general conditions associated with an increased risk of falling should be asked about recent falls and further examined for the presence of specific neurologic deficits that predict falls, which include gait and balance disorders; deficits of lower extremity strength, sensation, and coordination; and cognitive impairments. If substantial risks of falls are identified, appropriate interventions that are described in other evidence-based guidelines may be considered.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18250292/"}

We investigated how often a code stroke was initiated and the percentage of patients treated with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator, and draw attention to the resulting mismatch. From January 2010 to September 2011, we prospectively registered all consecutive code stroke patients. Patient characteristics, including demographic data, medical history, comorbidity conditions, treatments, and discharge diagnosis were collected, together with the exact time of onset (or last known normal time) and management. The eligibility of thrombolysis for each patient recorded originally on the chart was reviewed retrospectively on the basis of two sets of criteria, namely, the BNHI reimbursement criteria and the Taiwan Stroke Society (TSS) guideline. During the study period, code strokes were activated for 419 patients at an average of around 20 patients per month. About 57% of code strokes were initiated outside of office hours. Stroke was diagnosed in 377 (90%) patients and 304 (73%) patients had ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 42 (10%) patients according to the BNHI reimbursement criteria and 101 (24%) patients by the TSS guideline were eligible for IV thrombolytic therapy. Of all the code stroke patients, only 49 (12%) were actually treated. Before each additional patient was thrombolysed, about eight patients had been evaluated and excluded from treatment. The majority of code stroke patients were stroke patients; however, most of them could not be treated with thrombolytic therapy.

Though both are associated with right hemisphere cerebral dysfunction, notably stroke, each disorder had its own distinct literature. Anosognosia, as coined by Babinski in 1914, describes patients who seem to have no idea of their paralysis, despite general cognitive preservation. Certain patients seem more than unaware, with apparent resistance to awareness. More extreme, and qualitatively distinct, is denial of hemiplegia. Various interpretations of pathogenesis are still deliberated. As accounts of its captivating manifestations grew, anosognosia was established as a prominent symbol of neurological and psychic disturbance accompanying (right-hemisphere) stroke. Although reports of specific neglect-related symptomatology appeared earlier, not until nearly 2 decades after anosognosia's inaugural definition was neglect formally defined by Brain, paving a path spanning some years, to depict a class of disorder with heterogeneous variants. Disordered awareness of body and extrapersonal space with right parietal lesions, and other symptom variations, were gathered under the canopy of neglect. Viewed as a disorder of corporeal awareness, explanatory interpretations involve mechanisms of extinction and perceptual processing, disturbance of spatial attention, and others. Odd alterations involving apparent concern, attitudes, or belief characterize many right hemisphere conditions. Anosognosia and neglect are re-examined, from the perspective of unawareness, the nature of belief, and its baffling distortions. Conceptual parallels between these 2 distinct disorders emerge, as the major role of the right hemisphere in mental representation of self is highlighted by its most fascinating syndromes of altered awareness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927461/"}
{"id": "10532644", "title": "Risk factors and their management for stroke prevention: outlook for 1999 and beyond.", "text": "Stroke is a leading cause of death and morbidity, but incidence rates vary dramatically from one population to another. The reasons for this heterogeneity are being explored in several large-scale epidemiologic studies around the world. Much of the heterogeneity in stroke can be related to the prevalence of risk factors, but some populations have a higher stroke incidence than would be predicted from risk factor levels. Hypertension, including borderline hypertension, is probably the most important stroke risk factor based on degree of risk and prevalence. However, cardiac morbidity, cigarette smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, and high levels of alcohol consumption are also strongly related to stroke risk. High levels of blood cholesterol and homocysteine may also increase stroke risk. Mortality after stroke is highest within the first 30 days but remains elevated to a degree that depends on the presenting stroke syndrome, stroke subtype, and other co-morbidities. Lacunar strokes have the best short- and long-term prognoses. Strokes due to large-vessel atherosclerosis frequently worsen; these and cardioembolic strokes have the poorest long-term prognosis. The risk for recurrence is also highest within 30 days after a first stroke, depending on the type of infarct, history of hypertension, and blood glucose levels on admission. Predictors of late recurrence include cardiac disease, hypertension, and heavy alcohol use. Only about half of stroke survivors are independent 6 months after a stroke, and quality of life is decreased.

Stroke patients admitted to the Sheba Medical Center during the period March 2001 to June 2002 were included in a prospective study according to selection criteria. Data on demographics, risk factors, co-morbidities and stroke severity were collected. Indicators of process of care and outcome were assessed at hospital discharge and 30 days follow-up. Comparison between outcome variables by hospitalization ward was done using logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders. Of 616 acute stroke patients (mean age 70 years, 61% men, 84% ischemic stroke), 353 (57%) were admitted to general wards and 263 (43%) to the stroke unit. Diagnostic procedures were performed more often and the infection rate was lower in the setting of the stroke unit. Poor outcome (modified Rankin scale > or = 3 or death) was present less often in patients managed in the stroke unit both at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.8) and at 30 day follow-up (adjusted OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9).

Respondents identified multiple areas where child neurology residents need more training, including genetics and neuromuscular disease. A substantial majority (73%) believed child neurology and neurodevelopmental disability residents need less than 12 adult neurology training months; however, most (75%) also believed adult hospital service and man-power needs (55%) and finances (34%) would pose barriers to reducing adult neurology.

Equally important is how it translated to the bedside and how the clinical examination differentiated itself. This paper reviews primary sources pertaining to acute neurologic conditions described mostly in the 19th and 20th century. A review of monographs, treatises, textbooks, and peer-reviewed articles was conducted. The evolution of clinical signs and syndromes associated with dynamic intracranial pathologies was predicated on the idea that animal studies informed clinicians, who then linked clinical signs to these observations. A dominant theme is that innovative technologies could trace acute processes through all their various stages, affording a complete picture of the disease process. Just as clinical descriptors of central nervous system processes evolved, the presentation of acute neuromuscular respiratory failure became better defined. Once practices incorporated these acute clinical signs, textbooks cemented their \"gold standard\" status with relative impunity. The practise of acute neurology and neurocritical care must find out what, historically, others were seeking but could not find. Patterns of clinical presentation in acute neurology are sufficiently recognizable to guide practise decisions. Although, the currently well-documented clinical syndromes of acute neurologic conditions (at presentation and during deterioration) have been taught for generations, practitioners have noted that they lack consistency and predictability. History also taught us that part of this improved knowledge came with designated units-a clear example of how protean systems (not always innovative neurologists or neuroscientists or technologies) shaped the history of neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38403947/"}

Most of the countries reported a mortality rate of 2-3 % majorly due to cardiorespiratory failures. Recent studies highlighted the neurological involvement playing a key role in cardiorespiratory failures and other symptoms such as headache, anosmia, and ageusia observed in Covid-19 patients. Studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 entry via Olfactory Epithelium (OE), and the expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) in addition to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. The virus can either travel via peripheral blood vessel causing endothelial dysfunction, triggering coagulation cascade and multiple organ dysfunction or reach the systemic circulation and take a different route to the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), disrupting the BBB causing neuroinflammation or neuronal excitotoxicity resulting in the development of encephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, and strokes. SARS-CoV-2 invasion on the brain stem is believed to be responsible for the cardiorespiratory failures observed in Covid-19 patients. Apart from viral invasion via hematogenous route, SARS-CoV-2 neural invasion via PNS nerve terminal, results in viral replication and retrograde transportation to soma leading to invasion of the CNS including the brain producing neurological manifestations of the disease either in the initial stages or during the course of the disease and even for a long period post-infection in many cases. The ACE2 receptors are expressed in the brain and glial cells and SARS-CoV-2 acts via neuronal as well as nonneuronal pathways.

Stroke prevention, therefore, remains the key route for reducing morbidity and mortality. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are the most important modifiable risk factors for stroke. Several recent landmark studies have shown that lipid lowering with statins can reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke, as well as coronary heart disease. In addition, clinical trials evaluating the effects of blood pressure lowering have shown that antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can reduce stroke risk. Accumulating evidence suggests certain antihypertensive agents such as CCBs might also prevent the formation and progression of carotid atheroma, independently of their blood-pressure-lowering effects.

With respect to autonomy, discussion emphasizes legal dimensions of the doctrine of informed consent and the obligations of medical professionals to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their patients. The discussion of beneficence focuses on issues relating to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the care of patients and on the conduct of research involving human subjects. The section on justice considers how law aims to define protectable rights and interests of individuals and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving disputes. Applications of legal principles and doctrines are illustrated primarily through the examples afforded by judicial decisions. These cases demonstrate how law both promotes ethical decision-making and protects the rights and interests of those affected. The cases also highlight some of the ethical quandaries that evoke resort to litigation and the limits of law in advancing ethically appropriate outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24182366/"}

We performed a systematic literature review to assess the validity of administrative claims data for identifying patients with neuro-ophthalmic disorders. Two reviewers independently reviewed all eligible full-length articles and used a standardized abstraction form to identify ICD code-based definitions for 9 neuro-ophthalmic conditions and their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). A quality assessment of eligible studies was also performed. Eleven articles that met criteria for inclusion are as follows: 3 studies of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (PPV 54%-91% and NPV 74%-85%), 2 studies of giant cell arteritis (sensitivity 30%-96% and PPV 94%), 3 studies of optic neuritis (sensitivity 76%-99%, specificity 83%-100%, PPV 25%-100%, and NPV 98%-100%), 1 study of neuromyelitis optica (sensitivity 60%, specificity 100%, PPV 43%-100%, and NPV 98%-100%), 1 study of ocular motor cranial neuropathies (PPV 98%-99%), and 2 studies of myasthenia gravis (sensitivity 53%-97%, specificity 99%-100%, PPV 5%-90%, and NPV 100%). No studies met eligibility criteria for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, thyroid eye disease, and blepharospasm. Approximately 45.5% provided only one measure of diagnostic accuracy. Complete information about the validation cohorts, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data collection methods, and expertise of those reviewing charts for diagnostic accuracy was missing in 90.9%, 72.7%, 81.8%, and 36.4% of studies, respectively. Few studies have reported the validity of ICD codes for neuro-ophthalmic conditions. The range of diagnostic accuracy for some disorders and study quality varied widely. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting studies of neuro-ophthalmic conditions using administrative claims data.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33197163/"}

Two neuroradiologists re-evaluated all CT scans of consecutive SOS-NET patients in 2009 blinded to clinical information providing reference standard. We defined discrepant CT findings as all false-positive or false-negative EIC and brain pathology findings and ASPECTS deviations >1 point. We subsequently discussed the clinical impact of discrepant CT findings unblinded to clinical information. Weighted kappa (κ(w)) statistic was used to determine the interobserver agreement for ASPECTS. Of 582 patients, complete imaging data were available for 536 patients (351 cerebral ischemic events, 105 primary intracranial hemorrhages, and 80 stroke mimics). The neuroradiologists detected discrepant CT findings in 43 patients (8.0%) that were rated as clinically relevant in 9 patients (1.7%). Stroke neurologists recommended IV thrombolysis in 8 patients despite extensive EIC (ASPECTS ≤5). One of these patients had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. In 1 nonthrombolyzed patient, the stroke neurologist missed subdural hematoma. The interobserver agreement on ASPECTS between stroke neurologists and expert readers was substantial (κ(w) = 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.71). Clinically relevant misinterpretation of the CT scans was rare in our acute telestroke service.

The Child Neurology Society Research Committee engaged in collaborative, iterative literature review and committee deliberations to prepare this consensus statement. We identified important challenges for gene-targeted therapies that require resource investments, infrastructure development, and strategic planning. Barriers include inequities in diagnosis and delivery of therapies, high costs, and a need for long-term surveillance of efficacy and safety, including systematic tracking of unanticipated effects. Key uncertainties regarding technical aspects and usage of gene-targeted therapies should be addressed, and characterization of new natural histories of diseases will be needed. Counterbalanced with these obstacles and uncertainties is the tremendous potential being demonstrated in treatments and clinical trials of gene-targeted therapies. Given that gene-targeted therapies for neurological diseases are in their earliest phase, the pediatric neurology community can play a vital role in their guidance and implementation.

Historical review, physiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects].", "text": "Strokes have been known since ancient times. Today, stroke is the second most frequent cause of death and the most frequent cause of invalidity. In about 80% of cases, stroke is caused by cerebral ischemia and in about 20% by intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoidal hemorrhage, venous thrombosis and other cerebrovascular diseases. The brain is one of the most richly perfused tissues and depends fundamentally on the supply of oxygen and glucose. In order to assure adequate cerebral blood flow, the brain is capable of autoregulation through the interaction of diverse autoregulatory mechanisms (myogenic, neurogenic and metabolic factors, blood viscosity, renin-angiotensin-system and endothelium). Reduction of cerebral blood flow below the threshold of about 25 ml/100 g x min leads to an impairment of the functional metabolism and later to impairment of the structural metabolism. Pathophysiologically, a large number of isolated pathobiochemical processes (loss of energy, lactate acidosis, excitating amino acid release, ion balance disorders, calcium overload, free radical release, etc.) start to interfere with each other. Delayed edema and inflammation lead to secondary brain damage. Apoptosis is probably induced by ischemia and can cause secondary deterioration. The basic principles in the treatment of ischemia are firstly the rapid restoration of cerebral blood flow (lysis, carotid endarterectomy) and secondly--following infarction--a limitation of brain damage (preservation of ischemic but not necrotic brain tissue, prevention of secondary complications). Stroke treatment requires profound diagnostic and therapeutic expertise and interdisciplinary cooperation of neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, vascular surgeons and cardiologists. Stroke can best be managed in special \"stroke units\", which have now been established in nearly all parts of Germany. Beside acute management of stroke and neurological rehabilitative treatment, emphasis has to be laid on primary (public information, education, treatment of risk factors) and secondary prophylaxis (treatment with antiaggregants, anticoagulants, a. o.).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11715330/"}

In the current study we assessed PCS and PTSD in civilians following exposure to rocket attacks. We hypothesized that PCS symptomatology and brain connectivity will be associated with the objective physical exposure, while PTSD symptomatology will be associated with the subjective mental experience. Two hundred eighty nine residents of explosion sites have participated in the current study. Participants completed self-report of PCS and PTSD. The association between objective and subjective factors of blast and clinical outcomes was assessed using multivariate analysis. White-matter (WM) alterations and cognitive abilities were assessed in a sub-group of participants (n = 46) and non-exposed controls (n = 16). Non-parametric analysis was used to compare connectivity and cognition between the groups. Blast-exposed individuals reported higher PTSD and PCS symptomatology. Among exposed individuals, those who were directly exposed to blast, reported higher levels of subjective feeling of danger and presented WM hypoconnectivity. Cognitive abilities did not differ between groups. Several risk factors for the development of PCS and PTSD were identified. Civilians exposed to blast present higher PCS/PTSD symptomatology as well as WM hypoconnectivity. Although symptoms are sub-clinical, they might lead to the future development of a full-blown syndrome and should be considered carefully. The similarities between PCS and PTSD suggest that despite the different etiology, namely, the physical trauma in PCS and the emotional trauma in PTSD, these are not distinct syndromes, but rather represent a combined biopsychological disorder with a wide spectrum of behavioral, emotional, cognitive and neurological symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37312064/"}

As a result, more individuals are living with long-term disabilities from conditions such as stroke, dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Despite significant advances in neurology, there remains an urgent need for a preventive approach to mitigate these trends. Growing evidence highlights the effectiveness of preventive strategies, including lifestyle modifications and risk factor management, in preserving brain health and reducing the risk of stroke, neurodegenerative conditions, and cognitive decline. Preventive neurology operates within a multilevel framework, ranging from direct patient-centered interventions to systemic policy actions requiring organizational and societal support. Neurologists are uniquely positioned as advocates for brain health, promoting preventive strategies in line with the American Academy of Neurology's Brain Health Initiative. This article explores how neurologists can drive change across individual, family, community, and policy levels by leveraging their clinical expertise, community engagement, and health policy influence. Sustainable progress in brain health will also require system-level changes that integrate preventive goals into the fabric of health care delivery, public health infrastructure, and policy frameworks. Special attention is given to underserved populations, who bear a disproportionate burden of neurologic diseases. Through targeted interventions, public health initiatives, and collaborative care models, preventive neurologists can shape brain health outcomes across the lifespan. Training neurologists with a preventive focus will integrate brain health promotion into standard neurology practice, complementing disease management.

In the 1860s, Charcot and his pupils presented several major works dealing with cerebrovascular disease, including famous studies on miliary aneurysms in cerebral hemorrhage.

Further work on cerebrovascular disease by Charcot included histological studies of brain 'softening', paraneoplastic cerebral arterial occlusion and consequences of stroke (e.g. arthropathies, vegetative changes, contractures and abnormal movements). Brain localization, one of Charcot's major neurological topics, was also largely based on stroke case studies.

However, telephone consultation was also used linking stroke centres to smaller hospitals. We compared costs of telestroke services using audiovisual and telephone communication in different organizational models. Within a small network in Northern Bavaria video-based teleconsultation (VTC) and telephone advice (TA) was provided for evaluation of acute stroke patients on a weekly rotation. The costs of the admissions process with or without one of both methods of telemedicine were calculated and compared from the perspective of the spoke hospital. Different levels of service and network size were modelled and costs of transfers as well as loss of revenues were calculated. Yearly total labour costs were 415,000 € for an on-site service VTC-service compared to 61,000 € in an on-call service. Additional costs for one teleconsultation were 109.55 € in VTC and 49.82 € in TA (VTC/TA ratio 2.2). The ratio decreased to 0.8 when accounting for costs of transfer and loss of reimbursement for all patients transferred as transfer of patients to the stroke centre was more frequent after TA (9.1 vs. 14.9%full-time on-site ser). Costs of one QALY gained by using VTC instead of TA ranged from 115.00 € to 515.86 € depending on the different models. In the first view TA looks like the less expensive method as it is easy to access and works without additional costs. When accounting for all disadvantages TA becomes slightly more expensive. In telestroke care VTC should be recommended as the method of choice also from an economic perspective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082628/"}

We studied PCP attitudes and current practice in early management of suspected stroke patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 714 general practitioners, internists, and neurologists providing acute primary care for stroke patients in 4 different regions in Germany. PCP attitudes and practices were assessed with standardized questionnaires and case vignettes presenting suspected stroke patients contacting PCPs either by phone or in practice. Factors influencing the decision of the PCPs to admit patients with clear stroke symptoms as medical emergency to hospital were assessed using multivariate analysis. In total, 395 PCPs participated in the study (55.3%). Most PCPs agreed that stroke (94.7%) and transient ischemic attack (84.8%) were medical emergencies. In case vignettes, admission to hospital as medical emergency was preferred management after first contact to patients with clear stroke symptoms by phone or in practice (68.9% and 65.6%, respectively). Outpatient clarification was the preferred option of PCPs in patients with unclear stroke symptoms contacting PCPs by phone or in practice (54.7% and 75.5%, respectively) and in transient ischemic attack patients (50.9%). Working as general practitioner (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.6) and practice location outside metropolitan area (P=0.002) independently decreased probability of admitting suspected stroke patients as medical emergency when first contact to PCPs was by phone. PCP agreement that all stroke and transient ischemic attack patients must be admitted to hospital increased probability for early hospitalization of stroke and transient ischemic attack patients when first contact was in practice (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.3, and odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.8, respectively).

Their specific applications will depend upon available resources. The particular contributions of the neurologist include: early identification and differential diagnosis of rare and common brain disorders causing cognitive and behavioural symptoms, referral for and interpretation of ancillary investigations, and identification and treatment of vascular and other concurrent diseases. A review of the management of dementia in Europe revealed considerable variation. In some countries neurologists have taken the lead in the management of patients with dementia, while in other countries the neurologist is rarely involved. We recommend that neurologists should have a clear role in the management of dementia in the whole of Europe. They should be involved in the diagnostic evaluation of dementia and facilitate the development of multidisciplinary teams for evaluation and management of patients with cognitive disturbances.

Results of protocol audits conducted at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke from 2003 to 2019 on 97 research protocols were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the depth of auditing and provision of investigator research training, audit data were separated into four arms: 1) Early Period, 2003 to 2012; 2) Middle Period, 2013 to 2016; and Late Period, 2017 to 2019, further divided into 3) Late Period without SIVs; and 4) Late Period with SIVs. Events of noncompliance were classified by the type of protocol deviation, the category, and the cause. In total, 952 events occurred across 1080 participants. Protocols audited during the Middle Period, compared to the Early Period, showed a decrease in the percentage of protocols with at least 1 noncompliance event. Protocols with SIVs had a further decrease in major, minor, procedural, eligibility, and policy events. Additionally, protocols audited during the Early Period had on average 0.46 major deviations per participant, compared to 0.26 events in protocols audited during the Middle Period, and 0.08 events in protocols audited during the Late Period with SIVs.

Ethics issues in contemporary neuroscience as they apply separately to genetics and neuroimaging have been a growing focus for research but, to date, there has not yet been a rigorous exploration of the ethical dimensions of the territory in which they overlap. Here we propose that the ethics challenges associated with the combination of these methods call for an expanded \"neuro-space\" in which societal and ethical values are closely and explicitly integrated with the new science. We build specifically on the model delivered by Roffman et al. [Roffman JL, Weiss AP, Goff DC, Rauch SL, Weinberger DR (2006) Neuroimaging-genetic paradigms: a new approach to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Harv Rev Psychiatry 14:78-91] for neuroimaging, and develop the argument that the ethics issues parallel the heightened discriminative and cumulative power of imaging genetics. In the new combined space, features of discriminative power concern better differentiation of disease, sometimes by ethnicity, and incidental findings. Clinical utility, prediction and intervention, and stigma and labeling reflect a common ground between discriminative and cumulative power. Privacy, autonomy, response sensitivity and attitudes, resource allocation for research and for health care, and commercialization, are features of cumulative power. Parallel to the clinical features highlighted in the Roffman et al. map, the combined space yields additional neuroethics features. These are characterized by new knowledge and new implications for health care, justice, and policy. We conclude by examining these features in the context of public health at the interface of emerging new neurotechnologies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19409220/"}

We discuss the diagnostic groups treated by neurologists, the neurological services and their progressive organization. Using the current capacities as baseline, we propose patient groups to be treated by neurologists in the future, and the levels of services. Based on the tendencies seen in the last years we suggest to consider to allocate acute stroke services exclusively to stroke units in neurological departments, and we identify a few other diagnostic groups where neurology should have a larger share in patient care. We define three levels for inpatient care: university departments, regional/county hospitals, city hospitals. Instead of minimum criteria we assign outpatient and inpatient standards that are functional from the economic point of view as well. University departments cover all areas of neurological services, have a function in graduate and postgraduate training, and on a regional basis they participate in professional quality assurance activities at the county and city hospital levels, and would have a more independent role in residency training. As far as patient care is concerned, the task of the regional/county hospitals would be similar to that of university departments - without the exclusively university functions. A general neurological service would be offered at the city hospital level - the representation of all subspecialties of neurology is not required. Neurorehabilitation would be organized at special units of neurological wards at the city hospital level, at independent neurorehabilitation wards in regional/county hospitals, and also as an outpatient service offered at the patients' home. The most significant organizational change would affect the outpatient neurological services. In addition to the special outpatient units associated with university departments and regional/county hospitals, the general neurological outpatient services would be organized as private practices, similarly to the current system of general practitioners, where the individual practices contract independently with the health insurance fund. Their task would be a general neurological service offered 30 hours per week, and also basic, screening neurophysiological and neurosonological examinations, with proper equipment and trained assistance.

Since the resource utilization on regular neurological wards is widely unknown, we determined the costs for acute stroke care on regular neurological wards to compare both treatment settings. We included 253 consecutive in-patients with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke (IS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) treated on regular wards at a German University Department of Neurology, between 1 January and 30 June 1998. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to assess outcome. Costs of stroke care were calculated from the perspective of the healthcare provider (hospital) by using a bottom-up approach. Resource utilization was compared to stroke unit care as determined in a previous study. Prices of 2002 were used (in Euros). IS was present in 78% (n=196), TIA in 13% (n=34), and ICH in 9% (n=23) of patients. Length of stay was 11.1+/-8.9 (mean+/-S.D., IS), 11.1+/-6.5 (TIA), and 16.9+/-15.5 (ICH) days (p>0.05). Mean costs of stroke care were euro 3060 (US$ 3180) for TIA, euro 3070 (US$ 3200) for IS and euro 5210 (US$ 5430) for ICH (p<0.05, ICH versus IS and TIA). The highest costs were due to non-medical care (46%) and personnel (25%). The mRS improved during hospitalization from 3.0+/-1.6 to 2.2+/-1.8 (p<0.01). Compared to care on regular neurological wards, mean costs per admission with treatment on stroke units increased by 7.0%, mean costs per day by 15.6%. The comparison - considering a potential bias of patient selection - shows that acute stroke unit care is approximately 16% more costly than treatment on regular neurological wards due to higher resource use of personnel and diagnostic procedures. Stroke unit treatment tends to decrease post-acute in-patient care costs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16930763/"}

In order to harmonize several strategies to combat these neurological disorders in a reasonable way, it is critically important to promote lifetime education of stroke medicine for neurologist who has main responsibility to treat stroke patients. In the present presentation, to meet the changing medical needs of our population, I attempted to summarize recent progress of stroke neurology concerning acute stroke management, neurorehabilitation and prevention of stroke recurrence and focused on the importance of understanding evidence-based-medicine for stroke management.

We aimed to measure inter-rater reliability for the clinical assessment of stroke, with emphasis on items of history, timing of symptom onset, and diagnosis of stroke or mimic. We explored reasons for poor reliability. The study was based in an urban hospital with an acute stroke unit. Pairs of observers independently assessed suspected stroke patients. Findings from history, neurological examination, and the diagnosis of stroke or mimic, were recorded on a standard form. Reliability was measured by the kappa statistic. We assessed the impact of observer experience and confidence, time of assessment, and patient-related factors of age, confusion, and aphasia on inter-rater reliability. Ninety-eight patients were recruited. Most items of the history and the diagnosis of stroke were found to have moderate to good inter-rater reliability. There was agreement for the hour and minute of symptom onset in only 45% of cases. Observer experience and confidence improved reliability; patient-related factors of confusion and aphasia made the assessment more difficult. There was a trend for worse inter-rater reliability among patients assessed very early and very late after symptom onset. Clinicians should be aware that inter-rater reliability of the clinical assessment is affected by a variety of factors and is improved by experience and confidence. Our findings have implications for training of doctors who assess patients with suspected stroke and identifies the more reliable components of the clinical assessment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16484609/"}

This article focuses on his work concerning the relationship between hallucinations, sleep, and dreams. From 1910, Lhermitte became interested in sleep and its disorders, particularly narcolepsy and its accompanying symptoms. He also reported on sleep disorders and hallucinations occurring in people with lesions of the diencephalic region (\"infundibular syndrome\"), and later encephalitis lethargica. In 1922, he described a syndrome of complex, predominantly visual hallucinations in patients with vascular damage to the midbrain, known as peduncular hallucinosis. Twelve historical cases of peduncular hallucinosis, including 10 from Lhermitte, are reviewed. He gave a precise phenomenological description of peduncular hallucinosis, and put forward the hypothesis that the lesion disrupted the anatomy and connections of a center regulating wakefulness and sleep, thus enabling a dissociation of the mechanisms of dream and waking states. Although the pathophysiology of peduncular hallucinosis remains to this day partly obscure, the model of a limited subcortical lesion acting through complex mechanisms and ultimately involving the cortex remains valid. Lhermitte was also a pioneer in characterizing what contemporary sleep specialists call dissociation of states.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34711070/"}

It was hypothesised that ambulance-based assessment of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) using a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant mobile platform immediately prior to arrival is feasible. Methods This is a proof-of-concept feasibility pilot study in two phases. The first phase consisted of an ambulance-equipped HIPAA-compliant video platform for remote NIHSS assessment of a simulated stroke patient. The second phase consisted of remote NIHSS assessment by a hospital-based neurologist of acute stroke patients en route to our facility. Five ambulances were equipped with a 4G/LTE-enabled tablet preloaded with a secure HIPAA-compliant telemedicine application. Secondary outcomes assessed satisfaction of staff with the remote platform. Results Phase one was successful in the assessment of three out of three simulated patients. Phase two was successful in the assessment of 10 out of 11 (91%) cases. One video attempt was unsuccessful because local LTE was turned off on the device. The video signal was dropped transiently due to weather, which delayed NIHSS assessment in one case. Average NIHSS assessment time was 7.6 minutes (range 3-9.8 minutes). Neurologists rated 83% of encounters as 'satisfied' to 'very satisfied', and the emergency medical service (EMS) rated 90% of encounters as 'satisfied' to 'very satisfied'. The one failed video attempt was associated with 'poor' EMS satisfaction. Conclusion This proof-of-concept pilot demonstrates that remote ambulance-based NIHSS assessment is feasible.

Each healthline was called and the operator was presented with a standardized scripted stroke patient scenario. The operator was asked to choose 1 of 4 responses that could be given to the patient (wait for symptom resolution, contact a primary care physician, drive to a local urgent care center, call 911 for ambulance transport). The operator was then asked to name common signs and symptoms of stroke. If the operator transferred the call, the process was repeated. Forty-six healthlines participated, with 22% recommending that the patient contact a primary care physician. The remaining 78% recommended calling 911. Calls were transferred at least once in 18 cases, and 24% of the operators could not name 1 sign or symptom of stroke. Nearly one-quarter of potential stroke patients were routed away from emergent treatment for the described scenario.

The recent therapeutic methods and the acceptance of the ideology of evidence based medicine, which is based on confidence in statistics, changed the reasoning of the neurologists. Therapy protocols intrude into the field of individual medicine, and doctors accept treatment schemes to alleviate responsibility of their decisions. In contrast with this, recent achievements in pharmacogenetics emphasize the importance of individual drug therapies. The protocol of intravenous cerebral thrombolysis does not require defining the origin of cerebral ischaemia in the acute stage, therefore, this procedure can be regarded as human experiment. According to the strict protocol thrombolysis might be indicated only in 1-8% of patients with cerebral ischaemia. According to the Cohrane database more trials are needed to clarify which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment. Because of the change in therapeutic principles transient ischaemic attack has been newly defined as \"acute neurovascular syndrome\". Multiplication of neurological subspecialties has been facilitated by the development of diagnostic tools and the discovery of effective new drugs. The specialization led to narrowing of interest and competency of clinicians. Several new neurological scientific societies were founded for the representation of specific disorders. In Hungary, between 1993 and 2000 nine scientific societies were grounded within the field of clinical neurology. These societies should be thankful to the pharmaceutical industries for their existence. In some European countries in 2007 only three neurological subspecialties were accepted, which are neurophysiology, neuro-rehabilitation and child-neurology. Neuro-radiology is in the hands of general radiologists, the specialization is not granted for neurologists. Because of the subspecialization the general professionalism of neurologists has diminished. Among young neurologists the propedeutic skills suffered most seriously.

Technological innovations, advances in neuroimaging, and the development of therapeutic agents directly benefited patients with neurologic disorders and enhanced the role of the neurologist. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology was founded in 1934. It formally recognized child neurology as a special area of expertise in 1959 when Sidney Carter was appointed as a director and the clinical examination was changed to include an hour devoted specifically to child neurology. In 1969, special certificates in child neurology were issued. Thirty candidates, or more, have successfully passed the examination each year since then. As of Spring 1995, there had been 1007 certificates issued to child neurologists. In 1991 and 1992, alternative pathways to training in child neurology were developed. These substituted a year of internal medicine or a year of basic neuroscience research for 1 year of pediatrics. Relatively few child neurologists have chosen these alternative pathways. The performance of child neurologists, on Board examinations has generally been comparable to that of adult neurologists with the latter holding a slight edge. In 1990, a study of first-time takers of the certification examination was begun. In child neurology, 54% of the cohort passed both parts I and II on their first attempts, and as of July 1995, 81% of the original cohort was certified. In adult neurology, the comparable rates are 56% and 84%. Accreditation of child neurology training programs began in 1987. As of November 1995, there were 75 accredited child neurology training programs, which offered slightly over 200 total positions. Changes in health care delivery are currently taking place and have placed greater emphasis on primary care physicians. Proposals have been put forth that, if enacted, will reduce the current number of medical students and also reduce the total number of residents being trained. Reductions as great as 40% of current resident number have been proposed. Child neurology will need to reassess our current work force and training needs and re-evaluate our role in the training of primary care physicians. There appears to be a paradox.

A survey with multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding knowledge of and approaches to the evaluation of coagulopathies was sent to a convenience sample of 79 neurologists (26 academic neurology faculty, 24 residents/fellows, and 29 community-based practitioners). Fifty-nine (75%) surveys were completed (response rates: faculty 73%, residents/fellows 88%, and community-based practice 66%).

Wilson's stroke forced the American public to confront stroke, and laypeople came to identify stroke as a nervous disorder, rather than a condition rooted solely in psychological phenomena. His medical care was overseen by Cary Grayson, his personal internist, and Francis X. Dercum, a remarkably accomplished neurologist from Philadelphia. Dercum was very involved in the treatment of the President, from the day of the stroke until years later. While the medical records have been destroyed, some basic facts of Wilson's treatment and rehabilitation can be inferred from the literature. Although Woodrow Wilson was an exceptional patient, his care, albeit administered by some of the most famous physicians of the era, was typical of the time. Therefore, this paper's approach to Wilson's 1919 stroke contextualizes the President's case into the larger scheme of early twentieth-century neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160114/"}

Text mining offers a computational approach to investigate neurology literature and capture meaningful patterns. The overarching goal of this study is to provide a new perspective on case reports of neurological disease and syndrome analysis over the last six decades using text mining. We extracted diseases and syndromes (DsSs) from more than 65,000 neurology case reports from 66 journals in PubMed over the last six decades from 1955 to 2017. Text mining was applied to reports on the detected DsSs to investigate high-frequency DsSs, categorize them, and explore the linear trends over the 63-year time frame. The text mining methods explored high-frequency neurologic DsSs and the relationships between them from 1955 to 2017. We detected more than 18,000 unique DsSs and found 10 categories of neurologic DsSs. While the trend analysis showed the increasing trends in the case reports for top-10 high-frequency DsSs, the categories had mixed trends. Our study provided new insights into the application of text mining methods to investigate DsSs in a large number of medical case reports that occur over several decades. The proposed approach can be used to provide a macro level analysis of medical literature by discovering interesting patterns and tracking them over several years to help physicians explore these case reports more efficiently.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31128466/"}

This process is very important for not only stroke specialists, but also neurologists and NIHSS score is widely used as stroke score for neurological severity. Specially, when stroke patient is treated with t-PA, NIHSS score is used as inclusion or exclusion criteria for t-PA therapy. Examinations that stroke physician should acquire are neurosonography such as TCD, TCCS, carotid echo, and echocardiography, MRI and CT as neuroimaging, and cerebral angiography, and perfusion MRI, SPECT and PET as brain perfusion. In particular, the diagnosis of brain MRI and CT is essential, and cerebral angiography and ultrasound is important for the physician.

The view is discussed that the pyramidal tract is composed of subsystems with different cortical origin, fibre terminations and fibre sizes. The system shares its motor control function with other descending pathways and it also contributes to the phenomenon of descending control of sensory inflow.

ARIC is a community-based prospective cohort study including 15 792 individuals aged 45 to 64 years at baseline (1987-1989), selected by probability sampling from residents of Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi (black individuals only); the northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis, Minneapolis; and Washington County, Maryland (ie, center). The present study included ARIC participants free of stroke at baseline, followed up through December 31, 2017. Data were collected through personal interviews and physical examinations during study visits, annual/semiannual telephone interviews, and active surveillance of discharges from local hospitals. Stroke events were adjudicated by study-physicians reviewers. Analysis began September 2018. The main outcome was stroke incidence rates, which were computed with 95% CIs stratifying the analysis by age and calendar time. Trends in adjusted incidence rates were assessed using Poisson regression incidence rate ratios. Models included calendar time, age, sex, race/center, and time-varying risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cholesterol-lowering medication use, and smoking). Of 14 357 ARIC participants with 326 654 person-years of follow-up, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 54.1 (5.8) years and 7955 (55.4%) were women. From 1987 to 2017, a total of 1340 incident strokes occurred among ARIC participants, and among them, 1028 (76.7%) occurred in participants 65 years and older. Crude incidence rates of stroke for participants 65 years and older decreased progressively from 1987 to 2017. Incidence rates, adjusted for age, sex, race/center, and time-varying risk factors, decreased by 32% (95% CI, 23%-40%) per 10 years in participants 65 years and older.

Many MNN disorders follow a developmental trajectory. Thus, defining symptoms of MNN disorders may be conceived as the end product of a long developmental process. Many pharmaceutical therapies are aimed at the end symptoms, essentially attempting to reverse pathological brain function that has developed over a long time. A new paradigm is needed to leverage the developmental trajectory of MNN disorders, based on measuring brain function through the life span. Electroencephalography (EEG) is ideally suited for this task. New developments in several fields, including consumer EEG hardware, ubiquitous access to the Internet and electronic health records, and nonlinear mathematics to extract information from physiological signals have converged to enable new approaches to integrating EEG into routine health care. Research continues to demonstrate that EEG analysis can be used to discover digital biomarkers for a wide range of MNN disorders, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and dementias, and likely many others. When EEG-derived information about brain function is stored with an electronic health record, clinical decision support software may use these data to detect atypical brain development in the earliest stages, thus opening a potential window for early intervention. These developments create an opportunity for neurodiagnostics to merge with biomedical informatics to create clinical tools for monitoring brain function through the life span. Advanced professionals with neurodiagnostics and biomedical informatics skills and training are needed to lead the way in this emerging field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257174/"}

Current challenges include (1) limited diagnostic resources and difficult diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making, (2) need for greater continuity and familiarity between the field site and neurologist, (3) gaps in the US neurology curriculum to provide expertise for all sites, (4) lack of follow-up and feedback from the field to advise future cases, and (5) low frequency of consultations. Growth opportunities include eventual expansion to the development of a community of neurologists who can provide context-specific care and maximize use of multimedia at low Internet bandwidth. Lessons from our experience may help optimize teleneurology's effect and reduce disparities in neurologic care, particularly in humanitarian crises.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28716879/"}

Cotard's syndrome or Cotard's delusion comprises any one of a series of delusions ranging from the fixed and unshakable belief that one has lost organs, blood, or body parts to believing that one has lost one's soul or is dead. In its most profound form, the delusion takes the form of a professed belief that one does not exist. Encountered primarily in psychoses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Cotard's syndrome has also been described in organic lesions of the nondominant temporoparietal cortex as well as in migraine. Cotard's delusion is the only self-certifiable syndrome of delusional psychosis. Jules Cotard, a Parisian neurologist and psychiatrist and former military surgeon, was one of the first to induce cerebral atrophy by the experimental embolization of cerebral arteries in animals and a pioneer in studies of the clinicopathologic correlates of cerebral atrophy secondary to perinatal and postnatal pathologic changes. He was the first to record that unilateral cerebral atrophy in infancy does not necessarily lead to aphasia and was also the pioneer of studies of altered conscious states in diabetic hyperglycemia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12011289/"}

Gerstmann and Scheinker eventually immigrated to America, and Sträussler, although dismissed from his faculty position, remained protected from persecution in Vienna throughout the war likely because of his marriage to an \"Aryan woman.\" Although he attained some degree of success in exile, Gerstmann was never again director of a hospital and primarily maintained a private practice after some brief consulting positions in New York in the 1940s. His medical degree was retroactively stripped by the Nazis without his knowledge, and was not reinstated until 1955. Gerstmann also became embroiled in a bitter struggle to regain his confiscated property in Vienna. Scheinker, aided by the refugee resettlement committee, settled in Cincinnati where he had several successful years and published 3 textbooks, but was denied university tenure and entered private practice until his untimely death. All 3 neurologists lost significant career momentum, and had to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives after the war or their forced exile.

A defining feature of the fledgling society was its inclusiveness; its membership was less restrictive than that of the older American Neurological Association. At the same time, the society needed to preserve its core as a neurologic society rather than one of psychiatry or neurosurgery. Hence, the balance between inclusiveness and exclusive identity was a difficult one to maintain. The Associate membership category, more than any other, was at the heart of this issue of self-definition. Associate members were largely practitioners of psychiatry or neurosurgery.

This community does not contain an academic medical center, thus providing a \"real-world\" setting to capture patient arrival times. Onset time was recorded from the chart according to a prespecified methodology. From January 2000 to June 2005, 2347 patients with acute ischemic stroke were validated. The mean age was 71 years, and 53% were female. Thirty-one percent presented within 3 hours of symptom onset; 13% between 3 and 6 hours; and 15% between 6 and 12 hours. Forty-one percent presented beyond 12 hours from symptom onset. Nearly half of patients with moderate and severe strokes presented in the 0- to 3-hour time window, whereas only 28% of mildly affected patients presented early.

Its goal is an all-encompassing documentation of the early clinical treatment of patients in emergency departments. Using the example of the index disease acute ischemic stroke (stroke), the aim was to analyze how far this approach has been fulfilled. In this study German, European and US American guidelines were used to analyze the extent of coverage of the datasets on current emergency department guidelines and recommendations from professional societies. In addition, it was examined whether the dataset includes recommended quality indicators (QI) for quality management (QM) and in a third step it was examined to what extent national provisions for billing are included. In each case a differentiation was made whether the respective rationale was primary, i.e. directly apparent or whether it was merely secondarily depicted by expertise. In the evaluation an additional differentiation was made between the level of recommendations and further quality relevant criteria. The modular design of the emergency department dataset comprising 676 data fields is briefly described. A total of 401 individual fields, divided into basic documentation, monitoring and specific neurological documentation of the treatment of stroke patients were considered. For 247 data fields a rationale was found. Partially overlapping, 78.9 % of 214 medical recommendations in 3 guidelines and 85.8 % of the 106 identified quality indicators were primarily covered. Of the 67 requirements for billing of performance of services, 55.5 % are primarily part of the emergency department dataset. Through appropriate expertise and documentation by a board certified neurologist, the results can be improved to almost 100 %. The index disease stroke illustrates that the emergency department dataset of the DIVI covers medical guidelines, especially 100 % of the German guidelines with a grade of recommendation. All necessary information to document the specialized stroke treatment procedure in the German diagnosis-related groups (DRG) system is also covered. The dataset is also suitable as a documentation tool of quality management, for example, to participate in the registry of the German Stroke Society (ADSR). Best results are obtained if the dataset is applied by a physician specialized in the treatment of patients with stroke (e.g. board certified neurologist). Finally the results show that changes in medical guidelines and recommendations for quality management as well as billing-relevant content should be implemented in the development of datasets for documentation to avoid duplicate documentation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26248579/"}

Successful practitioners of translational neural engineering from academics, clinical medicine and industry were invited to share a diversity of perspectives and experiences on the translational process. The forum was targeted towards traditional academic researchers who may be interested in the expanded funding opportunities available for translational research that emphasizes product commercialization and clinical implementation. The seminar was funded by the NIH with support from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. We report here a summary of the speaker viewpoints with particular focus on extracting successful strategies for engaging in or conducting translational neural engineering research. Daryl Kipke, PhD, (Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan) and Molly Shoichet, PhD, (Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Toronto) gave details of their extensive experience with product commercialization while holding primary appointments in academic departments. They both encouraged strong clinical input at very early stages of research. Neurosurgeon Fady Charbel, MD, (Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Illinois at Chicago) discussed his role in product commercialization as a clinician. Todd Kuiken, MD, PhD, (Director of the Neural Engineering for Artificial Limbs at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, affiliated with Northwestern University) also a clinician, described a model of translational engineering that emphasized the development of clinically relevant technology, without a strong commercialization imperative. The clinicians emphasized the importance of communicating effectively with engineers. Representing commercial neural engineering was Doug Sheffield, PhD, (Director of New Technology at Vertis Neuroscience, Inc.) who strongly encouraged open industrial-academic partnerships as an efficient path forward in the translational process. Joe Pancrazio, PhD, a Program Director at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, emphasized that NIH funding for translational research was aimed at breaking down scientific barriers to clinic entrance. Vivian Weil, PhD, (Director of Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at the Illinois Institute of Technology) a specialist on ethics in science and engineering, spoke of the usefulness of developing a code of ethics for addressing ethical aspects of translation from the bench to clinical implementation and of translation across disciplines in multi-disciplinary projects. Finally, the patient perspective was represented by Mr Jesse Sullivan. A double-arm amputee and patient of Dr Kuiken's, Mr Sullivan demonstrated the critically important role of the patient in successful translational neural engineering research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18310805/"}

Systematic literature search (published in 1992-2002) using Medline and English-/German language guideline databases. A total of 626 hits resulted in 54 guideline articles. 13 articles (from Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the USA) fulfilled specific inclusion criteria (recommended for countrywide implementation, complete guidelines for prevention and/or diagnostic/treatment and/or rehabilitation). The systematic guideline appraisal consisted of a) the assessment of the methodological quality using the established \"German Guideline Appraisal Instrument\" attributing scores and ranking the guidelines according to their overall quality; b) the systematic documentation of appraisal using structured abstracts. The methodological quality of \"content and form\" (10-17 of a total of 17 points) of the 13 guidelines was comparable. Regarding the domains of the \"quality of the development process\" (the guidelines achieved 4-15 of 17 points) and \"guideline applicability\" (0-3 of 6 points), though, the appraised guidelines varied impressively. The 6 best guidelines (> or = 25 of a total of 40 points) were characterized by explicitly linking recommendations and supporting evidence, by expert reviews of the guidelines prior to publication, and the provision of instructions for guideline implementation. None of the 13 appraised guidelines covered all key methodological quality criteria.

We aimed to study the reliability of high-quality video teleconferencing using smartphones for conducting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Two vascular neurologists assessed 100 stroke patients with the NIHSS. The remote vascular neurologist assessed subjects using smartphone videoconferencing with the assistance of a bedside medical aide. The bedside vascular neurologist scored patients contemporaneously. Each vascular neurologist was blinded to the other's NIHSS scores. We tested the inter-method agreement and physician satisfaction with the device. We demonstrated high total NIHSS score correlation between the methods (r=0.949; P<0.001). The mean total NIHSS scores for bedside and remote assessments were 7.93±8.10 and 7.28±7.85, with ranges, of 0 to 35 and 0 to 37, respectively. Eight categories had high agreement: level of consciousness (questions), level of consciousness (commands), visual fields, motor left and right (arm and leg), and best language. Six categories had moderate agreement: level of consciousness (consciousness), best gaze, facial palsy, sensory, dysarthria, and extinction/inattention. Ataxia had poor agreement.

This complex neuropsychiatric disorder, later known as the 'Tourette's syndrome', nowadays is accepted as a specific entity of movement disorders. Gilles had started working under Charcot (1825-1893), the first physician to occupy a designated chair of neurology of neuropsychiatric history, in 1884. Then the Salpêtrière hospital was a centre of intensive research with an emphasis on hysteria and hypnosis. Tourette took an interest in hysteria, but also dedicated himself to various other neuropsychiatric disorders and to neuropathology. He published scientific works on epilepsia, neurasthenia and syphilitic myelitis. Although he devoted much time to his neuropsychiatric research and the publication of articles in medical journals, his career did not make significant progress, despite Charcot's unrestricted support. One reason was, that he disregarded questions, answers and problems, which were outside his interest fields. Hence, he was accused for having acquired an extremely filtered and one-sided knowledge. Also, his alienated and critical behaviour, which had not helped him to find many friends over the years, prevented him from professional promotion. In 1893 an assassination attempt on Gilles de la Tourette raised considerable public interest: Gilles was shot in his appartement in the Rue de l'Université 39 by a young woman, who had been his patient in the Salpêtrière and who claimed that she had been hypnotized without her agreement and thereby had lost her mental health. However, the patient was diagnosed with a disease nowadays called paranoid schizophrenia and therefore hypnosis was not attributed to any part of the disease. Due to episodes of melancholia and phases of delusions of grandeur and megalomania Gilles de la Tourette was forced to leave his hospital appointment in 1901. These symptoms and the corresponding neurological signs were attributed to the paretic neurosyphilis. He was institutionalized to the psychiatric hospital Cery near Lausanne, Switzerland. In the course of the following three years he became increasingly psychotic and demented, suffered from epileptic seizures and finally died in hospital on 22nd May 1904.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15168216/"}

Essay review.", "text": "The recent publication of Neurological Eponyms by Peter Koehler and colleagues has revived the interest in neurological eponyms and raised important questions about their use. Many investigators have contributed to the body of knowledge that defines the specialty of neurology. We honor them by associating their names with neurological diseases. The history of neurological eponyms provides us with an opportunity to reexamine the important question of who gets the credit. Additional issues have surfaced including why certain eponyms tend to stick in the literature and others disappear, as well as the important realization that lengthy modern descriptions may require name eponyms for simplification. Eponyms can be confusing as to whether they refer to a disease or a syndrome and this confusion can impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients. There is an inevitable evolution of certain eponyms as our understanding of entities expands. This paper provides an overview of neurological eponyms with the explanation of the potential reasons why names were associated with neurological diseases. These included first case reports, relating isolated cases, years of observation, defining neuroanatomy, physician sufferer, new physical examination maneuvers, academic climate, the advent of a new procedure, fame, and competition amongst investigators. Important issues have surfaced regarding sharing credit amongst investigators, name priority, crediting the wrong investigator, and lack of a defined system to award credit. Since eponym use is based on a peer dependent system, each neurologist must make a more critical appraisal of who gets the credit and understand the differences between diseases and syndromes in order to better preserve neurological history.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12785117/"}

We analysed data of 229 patients (29 with HS and 200 with IS). Functional outcome was evaluated by use of modified Rankin scale, Barthel Index and Scandinavian Neurological Stroke Scale at discharge. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test, coefficient of correlation and multivariate logistic regression. 94.8% (n = 217) of all the patients had one or more RF. The most common RF were: hypertension (78.2%), coronary heart disease (54.2%), obesity (29.2%), diabetes mellitus (24.8%) and dyslipidaemia (24%). No correlation between the number of RF and functional outcome at discharge was observed. Cigarette smoking (p < 0.01) and alcohol abuse (p < 0.005) were more frequent in young patients (< 55 years). Previous ischaemic stroke was more common in older patients (>55 years). In male patients cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse were found more frequently than in female (p < 0.001).

We made a sequential analysis from the stroke register comparing three groups of patients attended during the years 1994-1996. During 1994 the patients were attended in the neurology ward by the EI. In 1995 an acute UI was set up. The criteria for inclusion or exclusion, health staff and technical resources were similar. We analysed the average stay, complications, mortality, hospital costs, functional state and destination on discharge. We included 1,491 patients: 435 (1994), 529 (1995) and 527 (1996). Comparing UI with EI we observed a reduced average stay (29.5%; p<0.001), fewer complications (47.8%; p<0.001), better functional state on discharge (Rankin 1 +/- 2 against 2 +/- 2; p<0.0001), increased transference to rehabilitation units (78%; p<0.001) with less long-term hospitalisation (22%; VS) and a reduction in costs ( up to 14.2%). There was no difference in mortality.

Qualitative research based on constructivist grounded theory. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews of purposively sampled neurologists, coded, and concurrent comparative analysis performed. A substantive theory of the 'IF impacts' was developed after concept saturation. Neurologists managed the escalating workload caused by an increased number of referrals of 'patients' with IFs found during neuroimaging; however it was unclear whether this was sustainable in the future. Neurologists experienced IF management dilemmas and spent more time with 'patients' affected by anxiety. The lack of information provided to those undergoing neuroimaging by the referring clinician regarding the possibility of discovering IFs was highlighted.

In 1965, I served at chronic ward of Baltimore City Hospitals as a resident of neurology, where most of the patients were relaxed and enjoyed their hospital life. Since then, my dream had been growing that chronic ward for neurological diseases was necessary in Japan, good for chronic cares as well as clinical research. KUEH include 89 beds for neurological diseases, uniquely enough, of which 15 beds specially prepared for the patients with respiratory distress suffering from intractable neurological diseases. KUEH gave us a lot of medical informations, developed to clinical research. Some of them will be introduced briefly as follows; firstly, in three patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) we found high titers of serum IgM and IgG antibodies associated with acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. They also had high titers of IgM and IgG anti-GM2 antibodies. The titers of anti-GM2 antibodies decreased on absorption with CMV-infected cells. These new findings suggested that anti-GM2 antibodies are associated with acute CMV infections in GBS patients. Secondly, we have patients with autosomal dominant familial Parkinsonism in Sagamihara, Kanagawa. Their clinical features are not essentially different from solitary Parkinson disease, and they respond well to levodopa treatment. Three autopsied cases, however, revealed neuropathological findings much different from those of classical Parkinson disease, such as rather mild to moderate loss of melanin-containing cells, well-maintained locus ceruleus neurons in number and no Lewy bodies detected at all. There are no reports in literatures of familial Parkinsonism from clinical and neuropathological points of view. Thirty-eight years have passed since establishment of the Japan Neurological Society, meanwhile the expertise neurologists come out. Neurology is, however, still minor in medical practice. This is my opinion that neurologist should take leadership in clinical medicine as well as in academic fields.

His were the definitive studies of unilateral convulsions that led Charcot to introduce the term Jacksonian epilepsy. His radically new view of epilepsy in terms of discharging lesions was the first neuronal theory and the foundation stone of our modern understanding of the disorder. His theories were based on detailed clinical observation and were later confirmed by the experimental studies of Fritsch and Hitzig, and by his colleague David Ferrier.

A total of 746 demented patients were evaluated using clinical, neuropsychological and imaging information. For each patient, diagnoses of the dementing disorder used clinical criteria at the first visit. We examined the distribution of patients diagnosis and differences in sex and education between the young-onset dementia (YOD) and the late-onset dementia (LOD) groups. From a total of 746 registered demented patients (300 men, 446 women), there were 91 patients (12.2%) with YOD (from 36.5 to 65 years) and 655 patients with LOD (from 66 to 92 years). Among the 91 YOD patients, the most frequent causes were Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (18.7%), then Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia and posterior cortical atrophy (14.3% each), followed by progressive aphasia (11.0%), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLD) (9.9%), semantic dementia (8.8%), other causes (3.3%), vascular dementia (2.2%), undetermined dementia (2.2%), AD+cerebrovascular disease (1.1%). Among the 655 LOD patients, AD was the most frequent cause of dementia (57.4%). Referred cases by a specialist doctor were 50.5% in the YOD group and 12.7% in the LOD group (P<0.0001). In the ACP group, 68.4% patients began before 65 years. The number of YOD in our memory clinic was four-fold the number of expected patients in France. The characteristics of the Referral Center explain the high frequency of rare dementia such as progressive aphasia (5.2% of overall number), semantic dementia (3.6%) and posterior cortical atrophy (2.5%).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104064/"}

NMO was long considered a clinical variant of multiple sclerosis (MS). While the history of MS has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the early history of NMO. A dissertation written by Fernand Gault (1873-1936), a doctoral student to Eugène Devic (1858-1930), a Lyon-based neurologist after whom the disease would later be named, is considered by many the first review of NMO. We would like to draw attention to a forgotten earlier review by the German oculist Friedrich Albin Schanz (1863-1923)-still known to ophthalmologists as one of the inventors of the corneal microscope (\"slit lamp\")-on which Devic and Gault's work was based and which points to most of the clinical and pathological features nowadays considered characteristic for NMO. The discovery of aquaporin-4 antibodies (NMO-IgG) has revived the interest in NMO, which is now extensively studied as a prototypic autoimmune condition. We believe it is now time to do justice to those who were seminal in describing this rare yet intriguing disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28716289/"}

Two factors are probably responsible for the appearance of this book. It was written during the 17th century, a period when the number of medical books published in English increased six-fold. In addition, there was a need for texts in English. Most poor people could not afford a physician's care and were ministered to by laymen who could not read Latin. The text of De Morbis Capitis was based on the works of contemporary and ancient authors. It contains chapters on modern syndromes, eg, headache, paralysis, epilepsy, and vertigo, as well as disorders of the time, eg, incubus and phrenitide. Each chapter first describes the disease and its differential diagnosis and then provides remedies, including herbals and bleeding. Overall, the treatment of brain diseases, as outlined in De Morbis Capitis, is probably a description of a high standard of neurologic practice in the 17th century English countryside.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2644925/"}

However these authors only reviewed the incomplete written record left by Willis, describing how this case was the fourth consecutive child that the mother had lost to neonatal convulsions. The medical record is completed by notes taken by John Locke from a lecture delivered by Willis 3 or 4 years before the case was first published. Here, Locke relates how the mother subsequently had three further children who were all treated by Willis soon after birth and all survived uneventfully. Reviewing the post mortem findings and the full case histories modern medical science gives a different interpretation. Instead, I suggest that the case history given and pathological features described are more in keeping with a whiplash shaking injury than with cerebrovascular disease or a stroke. I believe that this is the earliest pathological description of shaking injury in childhood. We can never know why Willis did not publish the full success of his management of the subsequent children but it may have been due to his dramatic experience of a similar mother early on in his medical career.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11749103/"}

However, these procedures require an intricate combination of visual and tactile feedback and extensive training. In this paper, we describe a series of novel approaches that have led to the development of a high-fidelity simulation system for interventional neuroradiology. In particular, we focus on a new approach for real-time deformation of devices such as catheters and guidewires during navigation inside complex vascular networks. This approach combines a real-time incremental Finite Element Model (FEM), an optimization strategy based on substructure decomposition, and a new method for handling collision response in situations where the number of contact points is very large. We also briefly describe other aspects of the simulation system, from patient-specific segmentation to the simulation of contrast agent propagation and fast volume-rendering techniques for generating synthetic X-ray images in real time.

Gowers developed an almost obsessional interest in Pitman shorthand. During the later part of his active career (1894-1910), the bulk of his professional writing, comprising nearly 100 articles, was printed entirely in Pitman shorthand in the Phonographic Record of Clinical Teaching and Medical Science. The obscurity and rarity of this periodical, and the increasingly arcane nature of Pitman shorthand, has left the bulk of these articles \"buried in obscurity and locked up in code\" (M. Critchley, 1949). A complete set of Gowers' shorthand publications as listed in his standard bibliography was compiled. Transcription of the Pitman shorthand outlines was performed by a qualified Pitman shorthand transcriber and verified using the contemporaneous Phonographic Outlines of Medical Terms (1902) as an authoritative guide. The first transcription of Gowers' shorthand publications has now been completed. The history of Gowers' interest in shorthand and his efforts to proselytize the medical profession is reviewed. Selected excerpts are presented from his shorthand articles, which include papers devoted to problems in practical diagnosis, notes on clinical teaching, and the shorthand transcriptions of his lectures at Queen Square and at University College Hospital on such diverse subjects as myelitis, neurosyphilis, polio, muscular dystrophy, tumors, vascular disease, epilepsy, and the nervous system in old age. The previously unpublished transcriptions of his shorthand articles represent a major and previously inaccessible part of Gowers' neurologic opus.

Given that neurologists and neurosurgeons have special expertise in this area, the authors hypothesized that the density of neuroscience providers is associated with reduced mortality rates from stroke across US counties. This is a retrospective review of the Area Resource File 2009-2010, a national county-level health information database maintained by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The primary outcome variable was the 3-year (2004-2006) average in cerebrovascular disease deaths per million population for each county. The primary independent variable was the combined density of neurosurgeons and neurologists per million population in the year 2006. Multiple regression analysis was performed, adjusting for density of general practitioners (GPs), urbanicity of the county, and socioeconomic status of the residents of the county. In the 3141 counties analyzed, the median number of annual stroke deaths was 586 (interquartile range [IQR] 449-754), the median number of neuroscience providers was 0 (IQR 0-26), and the median number of GPs was 274 (IQR 175-410) per million population. On multivariate adjusted analysis, each increase of 1 neuroscience provider was associated with 0.38 fewer deaths from stroke per year (p < 0.001) per million population. Rural location (p < 0.001) and increased density of GPs (p < 0.001) were associated with increases in stroke-related mortality. Higher density of specialist neuroscience providers is associated with fewer deaths from stroke. This suggests that the availability of specialists is an important factor in survival after stroke, and underlines the importance of promoting specialist education and practice throughout the country.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23198833/"}

An example for the progress in investigative methods by medical technology is magnetic resonance imaging which allows a more refined diagnosis and which improves and reevaluates the importance of the clinical examination. There is a warning on the other hand about unnecessary and badly planned examinations. 3. Advances in clinical neurology are mentioned by describing neurogenetic diseases, infectious neurologic diseases and new forms of dementia. 4. Some therapeutical aspects concerning neuroprotection and neurologic intensive care are discussed. Finally, the aims for the training of future neurologists are briefly outlined.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8539499/"}

The foundation of the Zagreb School of Medicine in 1917 had paramount importance for the development of neurology, during the first period within the common specialty of neuropsychiatry. The interest for the CVD in Croatia became evident in the sixties of the past century, particularly when neurology has become a separate specialty in 1974. Fast progress in the field of CVD resulted from clinical applications of basic research and after discovery of risk factors in their occurrence. These advances and the appearance of a new medical specialty: intensive medicine, stimulated in Croatia the organization of the first Neurological Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in 1971. Clinical experience and investigations of the first neurological ICU stimulated this approach to CVD in other big hospitals in Croatia and in the surrounding countries. The results of new management were presented on national and international meetings, especially on 5 Zagreb Symposia on CVD. The concept of comprehensive care for CVD patients was promoted, as a continuum of prevention, early treatment--if necessary in the ICU followed by modern rehabilitation. The described efforts were stopped due to the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the last decade of the 20th century. The process has been reinstated with new enthusiasm and new teams at the beginning of the 21st century after the postwar consolidation in Croatia and in the region.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20102108/"}

Following stroke, the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased by a factor of around 2-3 compared with baseline. Indeed, after the first 30 days, stroke survivors are more likely to die from a cardiac event than from a cerebrovascular event. In patients with atherothrombotic stroke, preventing subsequent manifestations of the underlying disease is therefore an important therapeutic goal. A number of options have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke. Aggressively controlling stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and smoking, should provide significant benefit in reducing stroke risk; however, it is difficult to realize the full potential of these approaches in routine clinical practice. A number of classes of medication can reduce the risk of stroke and other vascular events, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. Several antiplatelet agents are approved to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, although only clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are approved for the reduction of both stroke and MI in such patients. In the CAPRIE study, clopidogrel showed a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 8.7% (p = 0.043) compared with ASA for the composite endpoint of ischaemic stroke, MI or vascular death. Evidence from animal studies, ex vivo models in humans, and patients undergoing coronary stent insertion or patients with unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI clearly demonstrates the synergistic antiplatelet effect of using clopidogrel with ASA. In summary, most patients with an ischaemic stroke should be treated with an antiplatelet agent to reduce their risk of recurrent stroke, MI, or vascular death. The use of aggressive antiplatelet therapy has the potential to become a new paradigm for managing patients with vascular disease due to atherothrombosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11803182/"}

The COVID-19 emergency led to a profound restructuring-in a very short time-of the Italian hospital system. Some factors that impose higher costs on hospitals are inappropriate hospitalization and length of stay (LOS). The length of stay (LOS) is a very useful parameter for the management of services within the hospital and is an index evaluated for the management of costs. <b>Methods:</b> This study analyzed how COVID-19 changed the activity of the Complex Operative Unit (COU) of the Neurology and Stroke Unit of the San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d'Aragona University Hospital of Salerno (Italy). The methodology used in this study was Lean Six Sigma. Problem solving in Lean Six Sigma is the DMAIC roadmap, characterized by five operational phases. To add even more value to the processing, a single clinical case, represented by stroke patients, was investigated to verify the specific impact of the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> The results obtained show a reduction in LOS for stroke patients and an increase in the value of the diagnosis related group relative weight. <b>Conclusions:</b> This work has shown how, thanks to the implementation of protocols for the management of the COU of the Neurology and Stroke Unit, the work of doctors has improved, and this is evident from the values of the parameters taken into consideration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35564627/"}

The early administration of specific treatment improves the prognosis of the patients. Emergency care systems with early warning for the hospital regarding patients who are candidates for this treatment (stroke code) increases the number of patients treated. Currently, reperfusion via thrombolysis for ischemic stroke and attention in stroke units are the bases of treatment. Healthcare professionals and health provision authorities need to work together to organize systems that ensure continuous quality care for the patients during the whole process of their disease. To implement this, there needs to be an appropriate analysis of the requirements and resources with the objective of their adjustment for efficient use. It is necessary to provide adequate information and continuous training for all professionals who are involved in stroke care, including primary care physicians, extrahospital emergency teams and all physicians involved in the care of stroke patients within the hospital. The neurologist has the function of coordinating the protocols of intrahospital care. These organizational plans should also take into account the process beyond the acute phase, to ensure the appropriate application of measures of secondary prevention, rehabilitation, and chronic care of the patients that remain in a dependent state.

{"id": "40118111", "title": "Population Health in Neurology and the Transformative Promise of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models.", "text": "This manuscript examines the expanding role of population health strategies in neurology, emphasizing systemic approaches that address neurological health at a community-wide level. Key themes include interdisciplinary training in public health, policy reform, biomedical informatics, and the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs). In doing so, neurologists increasingly adopt a holistic perspective that targets the social determinants of health, integrates advanced data analytics, and fosters cross-sector collaborations-ensuring that prevention and early intervention are central to their efforts. Innovative applications, such as predictive analytics for identifying high-risk populations, digital twin technologies for simulating patient outcomes, and AI-enhanced diagnostic tools, illustrate the transition in neurology from reactive care to proactive, data-driven interventions. Examples of transformative practices include leveraging wearable health technologies, telemedicine, and mobile clinics to improve early detection and management of neurological conditions, particularly in underserved populations. These emerging methodologies expand access to care while offering nuanced insights into disease progression and community-specific risk factors. The manuscript emphasizes health disparities and ethical considerations in designing inclusive, data-driven interventions. By harnessing emerging technologies within frameworks that prioritize equity, neurologists can reduce the burden of neurological diseases, improve health outcomes, and establish a sustainable, patient-centered model of care benefiting both individuals and entire communities. This integration of technology, interdisciplinary expertise, and community engagement fosters a future where brain health is preventive, accessible, and equitable.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40118111/"}

To survey the accessible MD clinical training in these regions. We designed a survey on clinical training in MD in different medical fields, at postgraduate and specialized levels. We assessed the characteristics of the participants and the facilities for MD care in their respective countries. We examined whether there are structured, or even accredited postgraduate, or subspecialty MD training programs in neurology, neurosurgery, internal medicine, geriatrics, neuroradiology, neuropediatrics, and general practice. Participants also shared their suggestions and needs. The survey was completed in 31/49 countries. Structured postgraduate MD programs in neurology exist in 20 countries; structured neurology subspecialty training exists in 14 countries and is being developed in two additional countries. Certified neurology subspecialty training was reported to exist in 7 countries. Recommended reading lists, printed books, and other materials are the most popular educational tools, while courses, lectures, webinars, and case presentations are the most popular learning formats. Mandatory activities and skills to be certified were not defined in 15/31 countries. Most participants expressed their need for a mandatory postgraduate MD program and for certified MD sub-specialization programs in neurology. Certified postgraduate and subspecialty training exists only in a minority of European countries and was not found in the surveyed Egypt and Tunisia.

Indeed, several neurological conditions have been associated with peripheral or central deficits of the olfactory system. In recent years, particular emphasis has been attributed to the early and severe olfactory impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease. Olfactory assessment has also been included in comprehensive pre- and post-surgical evaluations of temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, the request for standardized methods of olfactory evaluation by forensic and occupational medicine is greatly increasing. Despite this requirement, there is no agreement in the Italian neurological community on olfactory assessment. This lack prompted us to generate a battery of standardized tests capable of bypassing cross-cultural differences in olfactory assessment and to be potentially useful in the clinical as well as experimental settings. Procedures of assessment of olfactory acuity (detection threshold), identification (multiple choice odor naming), discrimination (differentiation between similar/dissimilar odorants) and memory (recognition of a substance previously smelled) are fully described. In order to control bias factors depending upon the nature of the investigated disorder and the applied olfactory tasks, a minimal complementary neuropsychological assessment is recommended.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10933437/"}

Research progress has been difficult, particularly in developing widely effective therapies. This is a review of the current state of knowledge, research gaps, and proposed research priorities. The NIH convened leaders in the field for a 2-day workshop. The participants addressed the natural history of the disease, the underlying etiology, the pathophysiology, relevant research technologies, research resources, and therapeutic approaches and attempted to prioritize dystonia research recommendations. The heterogeneity of dystonia poses challenges to research and therapy development. Much can be learned from specific genetic subtypes, and the disorder can be conceptualized along clinical, etiology, and pathophysiology axes. Advances in research technology and pooled resources can accelerate progress. Although etiologically based therapies would be optimal, a focus on circuit abnormalities can provide a convergent common target for symptomatic therapies across dystonia subtypes. The discussions have been integrated into a comprehensive review of all aspects of dystonia. Overall research priorities include the generation and integration of high-quality phenotypic and genotypic data, reproducing key features in cellular and animal models, both of basic cellular mechanisms and phenotypes, leveraging new research technologies, and targeting circuit-level dysfunction with therapeutic interventions.

This external etiological sphere pertained to the supernatural, although the Mesopotamians viewed it as a constituent part of reality. A similar deterministic approach may be traced in the earliest layers of Greek medicine, but it was repudiated by Hippocratic medical thought. The 40-tablet series of sakikkū (\"Symptoms\") shows a vast number of entries on neurological symptoms and syndromes pertaining to: headache, motor and sensory impairments, coma, seizure and epilepsy, cranial trauma, spinal cord trauma, brain tumors and abscesses, strokes, pediatric neurology, basal ganglia disorders, (perhaps) Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, rabies, tetanus, and cerebral malaria.

As the pendulum swings from the excesses of fee-for-service medicine (under which system the physician was paid more for doing more), to the equally egregious excesses of managed care (according to which the physician is paid more for doing less), it is the patient--especially the vulnerable patient with a debilitating neurological disease--who stands to lose the most. A survey of the historical roots of this transformation highlights the ethical dilemmas under the course of the pendulum. The ethical principles that should guide both the profession and the business of medicine are explored in search of a common ground on which both physicians and managers can work in concert for the benefit of the patients as well as the society whom both serve. The perils that beset that search must be recognized and avoided if the commons are to be preserved.

Although headache are among the most prevalent and most burdensome neurologic conditions, headache medicine is often considered underrepresented in neurology departments. Additionally, prior studies have shown that many neurology residency directors feel that training programs do not include an adequate amount of exposure to headache clinics or headache-related didactics. One important aspect of didactic education in neurology departments is adult neurology grand rounds. Previous publications have evaluated neither the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in academic neurology departments nor the residency program directors' views on appropriate amount of headache-related grand rounds. Our study has attempted to quantify this information to elucidate opportunities to improve practice educational gaps. In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed adult neurology residency directors (from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME] listing of academic adult neurology residency programs) between October 2018 and September 2019. In addition, we used two methods to obtain the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in neurology: (1) emailing residency directors a questionnaire asking for a list of prior grand rounds topics and (2) an online search for each academic neurology program. First, for our grand rounds analysis, headache medicine consisted of 3.7% of the lectures in 2017-2018 and 6.3% of the lectures in 2018-2019 (average of each institution; 17 institutions and 411 total lectures in 2017-2018, 21 institutions and 463 total lectures in 2018-2019). The most common number of lectures on headache medicine for each grand rounds series was zero (for 7 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 7 of 21 in 2018-2019), followed closely by one lecture (for 6 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 6 of 21 in 2018-2019). Second, for our survey, the response rate was 19.3% (29/150). No residency director thought their institution had too many grand rounds dedicated to headache medicine, and 62.1% (18/29) thought they had an adequate amount of headache grand rounds. Within the survey responders, 75.9% (22/29) of adult neurology residency programs have a board-certified headache specialist at their institution. Although most adult neurology residency directors believe that headache is adequately represented in adult neurology grand rounds, headache medicine makes up 4%-6% of all neurology grand rounds. Compared with other neurology subspecialties and the other core ACGME milestones, headache makes up the fewest grand rounds lectures that were assessed in this study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33990947/"}

Core network elements are: (1) establishing stroke wards in all hospitals; (2) continuous training in stroke treatment; (3) telemedicine service staffed by a 24 h/day 'strokologist' with capability for high-speed videoconferencing and transfer of CT/MRI images. Data were prospectively documented in the databank of the telestroke service, in the Bavarian Stroke Registry and in the controlling departments. In 2003, 4,179 stroke patients were admitted to the regional network hospitals. Between February 2003 and January 2004 a total of 2,182 teleconsultations were conducted. 250 teleconsultations yielded a nonvascular diagnosis. Indicators for stroke management quality improved compared with other hospitals without stroke unit: the frequency of CT/MRI within 3 h was 59% compared to 46%, frequency of speech therapy 36% (21%), and of occupational therapy 38% (12%).

Neurological disorders are a major cause of disability and death worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, neurological diseases are the second most common cause of death and 16.8% of total deaths are caused by neurological diseases worldwide. Neurological disease deaths have risen 36% worldwide in 25 years. Melatonin is a neuroregulator hormone that has free radical scavenger, strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive actions. These major properties of melatonin can play an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological diseases. In addition, melatonin is necessary for circadian rhythm. Studies have shown that melatonin levels are low in people with neurological diseases. Both preventive and therapeutic effects of melatonin are known for many diseases, including neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, headache, etc.). Based on all these reasons, clinical trials of melatonin were performed and successful results were declared. In this review, biological and chemical knowledge of melatonin, its experimental effects, and the clinical impact on patients with neurological disorders were described. According to all of the beneficial results obtained from experimental and clinical trials, melatonin may have a prophylactic and therapeutic effect on neurological diseases. Strong collaboration between neurologists and health service policy makers is needed to encourage use of melatonin in the patients suffering from neurological diseases. Melatonin may be the solution we have been looking for.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31718830/"}

Whatever the merits of this diagnosis, his undeniable accomplishments and the rationality of many of his actions cannot be explained by the workings of a disturbed mind. In his last years, however, his life-long suspiciousness became florid paranoia. He eschewed medical advice, listening to a veterinarian and treating his hypertension with iodine drops. Stalin feared his own shadow and trusted no-one, even himself. He increasingly withdrew from official functions and he muttered menacingly to his close associates that it was time for another purge. Stalin suffered at least one stroke prior to his fatal intracerebral haemorrhage in 1953. Given his untreated hypertension and the autopsy report, it is probable that he had a number of lacunar strokes. These tend to predominate in the fronto-basal areas, and disconnect the circuits that underpin cognition and behaviour. The most plausible explanation of Stalin's late behaviour is the dimming of a superior intellect and the unleashing of a paranoid personality by a multi-infarct state.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10053223/"}

A thorough review of the literature allows us to conclude that the frequency of neurological complaints in general practice varies between 7% and 15% and that complaints of sleep disorders reach about 26% in those cases. However, general practitioners do not refer all these neurological cases to a neurologist. They screen the cases and refer only 9% of all observed patients. Next, we briefly analyse the impact of telemedicine in general practice. Given this technique's novelty, we present a predictive model for the utility of teleconsultation, which we are currently developing and testing. We then summarise the current status of general practitioners' referrals to our hospital's neurological outpatient clinic, given previous measures that targeted waiting list reduction and adequate referral. After this overview, we present our methodology, which includes the development and implementation of the technologies needed for teleconsultation and the discussion and application of medical protocols for clinical data, benefits and costs. Simultaneously, we investigated the real need for teleconsultation in Neurology according to the literature and to several, more or less optimistic, models of acceptance. Based on this method, teleconsultation began its regular operation in July 1998. We discuss the result of the first 14 weeks of operation. We observed that referral developed according to calculated predictions and that there were clear advantages regarding diagnostics, medication, exam requests, cost avoidance and patient trips to the central hospital.

The system has continued with little modifications after a switch of internship to Basic Residency Program (PG1) in the late 1960s. In comparison, the neurology training in Japan suffers from following deficiencies: 1) a paucity of bedside teaching in most medical schools, necessitating the initiation of unprepared residents into patient care; 2) an insufficient number of staff, especially at a governmental school, precluding an adequate coverage of neurological subspecialities such as electrophysiology and neuropathology; 3) absence of a tutorialship from senior to junior residents, and from interns to medical students, mostly for the lack of organization and logistics; and 4) no incentive to specialize without board certification by the governmental agencies or proper recognition by insurance providers.

A symbiosis between writers of fiction and doctors has been well recognised. From Shakespeare to Cervantes by way of Dickens and Cela to writer - physicians such as Anton Chekhov or António Lobo Antunes have contributed through their medically informed literature to the better understanding of neurology. Some writers like Dostoevsky, Machado de Assis and Margiad Evans have written about their own experiences with disease thus bringing new insights to medicine. Furthermore, some neurological disorders have been largely based on literary descriptions. For instance, Dostoevsky's epilepsy has been retrospectively analysed by famous neurologists including Freud, Alajouanine or Gastaut, whilst his writings and biography have prompted others like Waxman and Geschwind to describe typical behavioural changes in temporal lobe epilepsy, finding their source of inspiration in Dostoevsky. Likewise, Cirignotta et al have named an unusual type of seizure after the Russian novelist. Inspired by Lewis Carroll, Todd introduced the term Alice in Wonderland Syndrome to refer to visual distortions generally associated with migraine.

Most interest centred around the works of famous physicians and their writings. Especially in the classical era, non-medical testimonies have received little attention. This makes it a particularly pleasant surprise for a medical histroical in search of such material to come across a description of a \"neurological illness\" in a history book from ancient times. 'Rerum gestarum libri' by Ammianus Marcellinus, the last Roman historiographer of note, gives a fairly descriptive account of the fatal illness of Emperor Valentine I (30, 6, 1-6). Valentine was suddenly taken ill with apoplectiform symptoms during a campaign in Pannonia in 375 AD. He died few hours later, despite the attempts of a physician quickly brought to the scene. The account of Ammianus Marcellinus combines literary features with a clear interpretation of medical symptoms according to contemporary doctrines. This description was later to become a model for non medical references and commentaries dealing with this \"famous case\", written by Christian authors including Orosius, St. Jerome, Socrates and the pagan historian Zosimos.A retrospective diagnosis of Valentine's last disease is difficult. It is impossible to prove that he really died from a stroke. Death by infectious disease might also be supposed. Finally, similar symptoms can be found in the case of the Emperor Claudius, who was poisoned by his last spouse in Agrippina in 54 AD. Our study is an attempt to analyse this very important case report from a medical, historical and cultural perspective, thus contributing to the historiography of \"neurology in the ancient world\".", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15637805/"}

Feedback was obtained by surveys of students and faculty lecturers and from student focus groups and faculty. Student performance on the end-of-clerkship examination was analyzed. Between October 2016 and April 2017, 135 students participated in the curriculum, and 56 students (41.5%) responded to the surveys. Most students agreed or strongly agreed that the new curriculum enhanced their learning and promoted their sense of responsibility in learning the content. Faculty agreed that this pedagogy helped prepare students for class. Most students watched the entire video-based lecture, although there was a trend toward decreased audience retention with longer lectures. There were no significant changes in performance on the end-of-clerkship examination after implementation of just-in-time teaching.

Original letters from Friedrich Nietzsche, descriptions by relatives and friends, and medical descriptions. Original German sources were investigated. Biographical papers published in medical journals were also consulted. Nietzsche suffered from migraine without aura which started in his childhood. In the second half of his life he suffered from a psychiatric illness with depression. During his last years, a progressive cognitive decline evolved and ended in a profound dementia with stroke. He died from pneumonia in 1900. The family history includes a possible vascular-related mental illness in his father who died from stroke at 36. Friedrich Nietzsche's disease consisted of migraine, psychiatric disturbances, cognitive decline with dementia, and stroke. Despite the prevalent opinion that neurosyphilis caused Nietzsche's illness, there is lack of evidence to support this diagnosis. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) accounts for all the signs and symptoms of Nietzsche's illness.

Charcot worked extensively with hysteria and female patients, although he energetically rejected the idea that the disorder was restricted to women. He categorically deplored ovariectomy as a treatment for women with hysteria. His most important scientific contribution in the study of hysteria was his identification of the disorder in men. Although overtly apolitical throughout his life and certainly not a feminist in the modern definition of the term, Charcot worked to incorporate women professionally into neurology, advanced areas of women's health through his long-term commitment to work in a largely women's hospital (the Salpêtrière), and dispelled the prejudice that hysteria was a woman's malady.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10331699/"}

Better training would allow clinicians to make a diagnosis earlier, to better explain it to patients, and to limit the costs associated with diagnosis delays. A better training of clinicians about FND would also improve the prognosis of patients, as early diagnosis and good explanation is associated with a better prognosis.

Views from past to present.", "text": "In the last few centuries, there has been a constant sway between organic and psychogenic explanations for dystonia. In the current study, we investigate this history, assuming the perspective of a spectrum from organic to psychogenic, between which ideas were moving. We have focussed on (i) primary generalized dystonia, (ii) cervical dystonia, (iii) writer's cramp and (iv) fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome. We have studied medical texts published since the 19th century and their references. Jean-Martin Charcot advocated the concept of hysteria, disorders in which, besides predisposition, environmental factors were involved in their pathogenesis. Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis as an explanatory therapy for psychic disorders. Previous theories, together with the lack of an organic substrate for dystonia, made a strong case for psychogenic explanations. Consequently, many dystonia patients were told that they suffered from psychological conflicts and were treated for them. However, after the description of new hereditary cases in the 1950s, the limited efficacy of psychotherapy in torsion dystonia, the effects of surgical treatments and the lesion studies in the 1960s, more physicians became convinced of the organic nature. The culminating point was the discovery of the DYT1 gene in 1997. In the meantime, experts had already convinced the neurological community that cervical dystonia and writer's cramp were focal dystonias, i.e. minor forms of generalized dystonia, and therefore organic disorders. In contrast, the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome remained controversial. Knowledge of this history, which played on the border between neurology and psychiatry, is instructive and reflects the difficulty in discriminating between them. Today, new insights from functional imaging and neurophysiological studies again challenge the interpretation of these disorders, while the border between psychogenic and organic has become more blurred. Abnormalities of sensorimotor integration and cortical excitability that are currently supposed to be the underlying cause of dystonia bring us back to Sherringtonian physiology. We suggest that this may lead to a common explanation of the four afflictions of which we have traced the history.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350935/"}

The emergence of neuroproteomics, with its sophisticated techniques and non-biased ability to quantify proteins, provides a methodology with which to study the changes in neurons that are associated with neurodegeneration. Neuroproteomics is an emerging tool to establish disease-associated protein profiles, while also generating a greater understanding as to how these proteins interact and undergo post-translational modifications. Furthermore, due to the advances made in bioinformatics, insight is created concerning their functional characteristics. In this review, we first summarize the most prominent proteomics techniques and then discuss the major advances in the fast-growing field of neuroproteomics in PD. Ultimately, it is hoped that the application of this technology will lead towards a presymptomatic diagnosis of PD, and the identification of risk factors and new therapeutic targets at which pharmacological intervention can be aimed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18523721/"}
{"id": "39347854", "title": "Emerging Trends: Neurofilament Biomarkers in Precision Neurology.", "text": "Neurofilaments are structural proteins found in the cytoplasm of neurons, particularly in axons, providing structural support and stability to the axon. They consist of multiple subunits, including NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L, which form long filaments along the axon's length. Neurofilaments are crucial for maintaining the shape and integrity of neurons, promoting axonal transport, and regulating neuronal function. They are part of the intermediate filament (IF) family, which has approximately 70 tissue-specific genes. This diversity allows for a customizable cytoplasmic meshwork, adapting to the unique structural demands of different tissues and cell types. Neurofilament proteins show increased levels in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood after neuroaxonal damage, indicating injury regardless of the underlying etiology. Precise measurement and long-term monitoring of damage are necessary for determining prognosis, assessing disease activity, tracking therapeutic responses, and creating treatments. These investigations contribute to our understanding of the importance of proper NF composition in fundamental neuronal processes and have implications for neurological disorders associated with NF abnormalities along with its alteration in different animal and human models. Here in this review, we have highlighted various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Dementia, and paved the way to use neurofilament as a marker in managing neurological disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39347854/"}

Neuronal stimulation is prerequisite for deep tissue light penetration or insertion of optrode for light illumination to the neurons that have been proven to be compromised due to poor light penetration and invasiveness of the procedure, respectively. In this review, the application of nanotechnology is being elaborated by the use of metal nanoparticles (AuNPs), upconversion nanocrystals (UCNPs), and quantum dots (CdSe) for targeting particular organs or tissues, and their potential to emit a specific light on excitation to overcome the limitations associated with earlier methods has been elucidated. The optothermal and magnetothermal properties, photoluminescence, and higher photostability of nanomaterials are explored in context of therapeutic applicability of optogenetics. The nanostructure characteristics and specific ion channel targeting have shown promising therapeutic potential against neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's), epilepsy, and blindness. This review compiles mechanical and optical characteristics of nanomaterials that endow superior optogenetic therapeutic potentials to cure immedicable infirmities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31244053/"}

Charcot's personal files on neurasthenia from the Bibliothèque Charcot, Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, were studied and his teaching lessons and lectures were examined. Charcot presented numerous cases of neurasthenia, always crediting Beard with the original name and description. Calling Beard's 1880 work a \"remarkable monograph,\" Charcot emphasized that patients with neurasthenia also comprised the bulk of his own private practice. Focusing on the signs of sexual impotency, fatigue, and a tight band of pressure around the head, Charcot categorically distinguished patients with neurasthenica from patients with hysteria. Like Beard, Charcot concluded that the origin of neurasthenia was psychological stress and felt the European society also fostered the environment to precipitate the disease. Charcot adamantly opposed extrapolations that called for early childhood educational reforms to reduce current classroom stress. Charcot sympathized more with the treating physician than the patient, calling neurasthenics insufferable (insupportables). On the front sheet of his neurasthenia file, he wrote in large script, \"Poor Beard!!\" By emphasizing the prevalence of neurasthenia and extending Beard's observations, Charcot internationally legitimized the new diagnosis. Adding neurasthenia to the other neurologic descriptions from the United States by Hammond, Mitchell, and Dana, Charcot helped to foster the recognition of the American Neurologic School.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11502922/"}

Concerns have been raised that older patients may be targeted by HMOs for more stringent cost-containment mechanisms, including reduced access to expensive specialty care. We investigated the relationship between membership in an HMO and the decision to consult with a neurologist or admit to a neurology ward for patients hospitalized with acute stroke. We then compared 1-year mortality of patients who received neurology care to the 1-year mortality of those who did not receive neurology care. Retrospective medical record review. A sample of hospitalized acute stroke patients (age range, 30-79 years) who were discharged from Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan hospitals with a diagnosis code of acute cerebrovascular disease from 1991 to 1993. Trained nurses abstracted the medical records. Stroke events (n = 2,320) were validated using clinical criteria and neuroimaging reports. Mortality data were obtained from the Minnesota Death Index. Among patients enrolled in HMOs, 30% of validated stroke patients did not receive neurology care in comparison with 19% of patients not enrolled in HMOs. After adjusting for patient mix and hospital characteristics, the odds of receiving neurology care were half as great for patients enrolled in HMOs as compared with patients not enrolled in HMOs (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.74). The association of membership in HMOs with lower use of neurology care was concentrated in older patients. Within each age group, the odds ratios and 95% CI of receiving neurology care for patients enrolled in HMOs versus patients not enrolled in HMOs were: < 55 years (1.06, 0.42-2.67), 55 to 64 years (0.54, 0.34-0.87), 65 to 74 years (0.51, 0.36-0.71), and >75 years (0.40, 0.24-0.68). Using Cox regression, 30-day mortality did not differ between patients who received neurology care and those who did not. Among 30-day survivors, the mortality hazards ratio (HR) during the next 11 months for patients who received neurology care was 71% of the hazard for patients who did not receive neurology care (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55-0.91). These data suggest that membership in an HMO was associated with reduced access to neurology care for older patients with acute stroke and that patients who received neurology care had a lower risk of death during the year after their stroke. It remains to be determined if these differences in outcome are caused by true differences in stroke management or by unmeasured characteristics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10599600/"}

We studied Brouwer's reports of the lecture tours and pertinent materials obtained from several institutes in the United States where he lectured. Brouwer read the Herter Lectures at The Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md) in April 1926 and subsequently visited several American cities. His second tour was by invitation from the Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease in New York, NY (1933), and he accepted invitations to visit New Haven, Conn; Boston, Mass; and Montreal, Quebec. According to Brouwer, neuroanatomy in the United States was studied on a wider experimental basis than in Europe. American colleagues, frequently working in teams, tended to have their theoretical-scientific work led by direct practical results. The scientific level among various universities ranged more widely than in the Netherlands, where the levels were homogeneous. In the United States, Brouwer encountered a general willingness to engage in scientific investigations, usually manifesting already in young students and residents, their inquisitive minds being stimulated early. His US colleagues had more assistants in the clinics and laboratories than those in the Netherlands.

Specific characteristics of neurological disease that affect palliative care in neurology were identified: 1) timelines of disease progression, 2) barriers to communication arising from neurologic disease, 3) variability across disease progression, and 4) threat to personhood arising from functional and cognitive impairments related to neurologic disease. Moreover, three key challenges that shaped and complicated palliative care in neurology were identified: 1) uncertainty with respect to prognosis, support availability and disease trajectory, 2) inconsistency in information, attitudes and skills among care providers, care teams, caregivers and families, and 3) existential distress specific to neurological disease, including emotional, psychological and spiritual distress resulting from loss of function, autonomy and death. These challenges were experienced across groups, but manifested themselves in different ways for each group.

Acupuncture-induced analgesia is mediated by inhibition of pain transmission at a spinal level and activation of central pain-modulating centers by release of opioids and other peptides that can be prevented by opioid antagonists (naloxone). Modern neuroimaging methods (functional MRI) confirmed the activation of subcortical and cortical centers, while transcranial Doppler sonography and SPECT showed an increase of cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen supply in normal subjects. Clinical experience and controlled studies confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture in various pain syndromes (tension headache, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, posttraumatic pain, lumbar syndrome, ischialgia, etc.) and suggest favorable effects in the rehabilitation of peripheral facial nerve palsy and after stroke. Appropriate techniques, hygiene safeguards and knowledge of contraindications will minimize the risks of rare side effects of acupuncture which represents a valuable adjunction to the treatment repertoire in modern neurology.

Neurologists identified a cause of DSP in 291 patients (63.5%) before their diagnostic testing. Seventy-one patients (15.5%) had a new DSP cause discovered after testing by neurologists. The most common new diagnoses were prediabetes (28 [6.1%]), vitamin B12 deficiency (20 [4.4%]), diabetes mellitus (8 [1.7%]), and thyroid disease (8 [1.7%]). Management changes were common (289 [63.1%]) and usually related to neuropathic pain management (224 [48.9%]). A potential disease-modifying management change was made in 113 patients (24.7%), with the most common changes being diabetes management in 45 (9.8%), treatment with vitamins in 39 (8.5%), diet and exercise in 33 (7.2%), and adjustment of thyroid medications in 10 (2.2%). Electrodiagnostic testing and magnetic resonance imaging of the neuroaxis rarely led to management changes. Neurologists diagnosed the cause of DSP in nearly two-thirds of patients before their diagnostic testing. Inexpensive blood tests for diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, and vitamin B12 deficiency allowed neurologists to identify a new cause of DSP in 71 patients (15.5%). In contrast, expensive electrodiagnostic tests and magnetic resonance imaging rarely changed patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25048157/"}

This article describes the earliest pioneering examples of the use of the phonograph in neurology. In France, the use of the phonograph for obtaining audio recordings of delusions and speech or language disturbances was first proposed by Victor Maurice Dupont (1857-1910) in 1889 and in Italy by the physician Gaetano Rummo (1853-1917), who had studied at La Salpêtrière under Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893). The applicability of the phonograph to the record of speech disturbances was illustrated in England by John Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911) and William Halse Rivers (1864-1922), and by William Hale White (1857-1949) and Cuthbert Hilton Golding-Bird (1848-1939) in 1891. Since then, audio recordings have been used rarely in neurology, a branch of medicine where the visual aspects dominate, to the extent that inspection can be enough to reach a definite clinical diagnosis. In the mid-20th century, the advent of audio and video recordings supplanted audio recordings alone, relegating them to a very marginal role.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36150939/"}

It exacerbates the fundamental pathology by generating a plethora of inflammatory mediators and neurotoxic compounds. Inflammatory cytokines, complement components, and toxic free radicals are among the many species that are generated. Microglia attack the pathological entities and may inadvertently injure host neurons. Recent evidence indicates that microglia can be stimulated to assume an antiinflammatory state rather than a proinflammatory state which may have therapeutic potential. Proinflammatory cytokines include IL-1, IL-6 and TNF, while antiinflammatory cytokines include IL-4 and IL-10. Complement activation is a separate process which causes extensive neuronal damage in AD through assembly of the membrane attack complex. Aggregated amyloid-beta is a potent activator of human complement but not of mouse complement. This is an important difference between AD and transgenic mouse models of AD. Many so far unexplored molecules may contribute to neuroinflammation or act to inhibit it. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis identified 174 proteins that were upregulated by two-fold or more, and 189 that were downregulated by 2-fold or more following inflammatory stimulation of microglial-like THP-1 cells. Neurotoxicity may result from any combination of these and further exploration is clearly warranted. In addition, many small molecules may play a significant role. One example is hydrogen sulfide which appears to be an endogenous antiinflammatory agent.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20061650/"}

However, with a changing emphasis of addiction away from purely pharmacological models that emphasize tolerance and withdrawal, towards one of behavioral dyscontrol, is there still a place for abnormal dopamine signaling in addiction? Here we recast the dopamine theory of addiction based on the idea that tonic dopamine may index a continuous phenotype that goes from apathy to impulsivity and compulsivity. Higher tonic dopamine signaling would make individuals vulnerable to drug reinforcement and cue-induced craving. We relate this to computational models of dopamine signaling, and review clinical and neuroimaging evidence from Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in support of this model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171904/"}

Medical readiness for discharge criteria for patients diagnosed with transient ischaemic attack, seizure, demyelinating disease or syncope were generated by expert consensus at our institution. A standardised discharge pathway was developed for eligible patients based on discussions with stakeholders and staff. Discharge timing and readmissions were tracked for 6 months pre-intervention and 12 months post-intervention (divided into 6 months of implementation and post-implementation periods). The primary outcome was a discharge time of ≤2 hours for 60% of patients during the implementation period. Secondary outcomes included reduced time to discharge (TTD) and LOS compared with the pre-intervention period. 318 total patient visits were included across the baseline, implementation and post-implementation periods. Median TTD improved from 171 min at baseline to 88 and 92 min, respectively, during the implementation and post-implementation periods. Median LOS similarly decreased from 94 hours to 35 and 30 hours, respectively. All primary and secondary outcomes were achieved during the implementation period and sustained post-implementation. The rate of emergency department visits and hospital readmissions within 30 days remained low (~1.5%) post-intervention. Additionally, most providers reported that the intervention improved clinical workflow. This standardised discharge framework improved discharge efficiency for patients with four common diagnoses during an 18-month quality improvement study. The framework and its implementation are highly scalable, and similar systems-level approaches should be considered by hospitals to improve throughput.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40846567/"}

Thirteen patients underwent carotid artery BTO. Placement of temporary occlusion balloons was performed with patients positioned on the CT scanner table. If neurological testing revealed no changes within 10 minutes after balloon inflation, patients were positioned within the CT scanner gantry for xenon-enhanced CT CBF evaluation. CBF evaluations were begun 12 to 15 minutes after balloon inflation and required 8 minutes for completion. After completion of CBF evaluation, neurological testing continued during 30 minutes of arterial occlusion. One patient did not tolerate BTO, with the development of reversible hemiparesis. Reliable CBF data were not obtained because of patient motion in one case. Eleven patients clinically tolerated BTO and completed CBF evaluation. For five patients, xenon-enhanced CT scanning revealed no regions with CBF of less than 30 ml/100 g/min. For four patients, xenon-enhanced CT scanning revealed small regions with CBF of less than 30 ml/100 g/min within the anterior frontal lobe on the occluded side. For two patients, ipsilateral CBF decreased dramatically during BTO, with CBF in many regions of less than 30 ml/100 g/min and in some of less than 20 ml/100 g/min. Xenon-enhanced CT CBF evaluation can be combined with clinical testing during BTO without patient transfer, balloon reinflation, or increases in the duration of the procedure. We recognize that the value of CBF evaluation during BTO remains to be proven; our technique does, however, eliminate abbreviated clinical neurological evaluation, patient transfer, and balloon reinflation, which were previously associated with the use of xenon-enhanced CT CBF evaluation during carotid artery BTO.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9733323/"}

These workers spurred interest in assessing delimited mental abilities in relation to discrete cerebral areas. With roots in experimental and educational psychology, the intelligence testing movement added assessment tools that could be applied to neurological patients. Early- to mid-20th-century landmarks were Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon's intelligence scale, Howard Knox's nonverbal performance tests, and the intelligence quotient conceived by Lewis Terman and refined by David Wechsler. Also developed during this era were Henry Head's Serial Tests for aphasic patients and Kurt Goldstein's tests for brain-injured patients with impairments in \"abstract attitude\" and concept formation. Other investigators have contributed procedures for the evaluation of language functions, memory, visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills, praxis, and executive functions. A further milestone was the development of short standardized cognitive instruments for dementia assessment. Within a neurological arena, the historical emphasis has been on a flexible, process-driven approach to the service of neurological diagnosis and syndrome identification. Advances in clinical psychology, neurology, and the cognate clinical neurosciences continue to enrich assessment options.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19892120/"}

At the age of nineteen he began his medical studies at the University of Paris and after having passed his internship he continued his education in the Paris hospital system and successively passed from chief of clinic to physician to the hospitals of Paris and to professor at the Faculty of Medicine. Early in his academic medical career he was concerned chiefly with problems of internal medicine and produced lasting tributes to clinical and pathological understanding of especially rheumatism. His interests eventually settled to the study of disorders of the nervous system. In 1862 he was appointed physician to the Hospital of the Salpêtrière, which was to become the center of his discoveries and fame. The Salpêtrière, which had a long history as asylum and prison, was when Charcot arrived still a custodial institution for unclassified and displaced unfortunates, numbering about five thousand. Out of this hodge-podge Charcot developed in a few years the world's greatest center for clinical neurological research and introduced his famous clinico-pathological approach to the study of neurological disorders, by which he was able to classify, for the first time, a number of unknown diseases of the nervous system, the spinal cord as well as the cerebrum. Even to day his clinical descriptions of some of these disorders are unsurpassed, and they are still registrated with his name as an eponym. In 1882 a Chair of Clinical Diseases of the Nervous System, the first in medical history, was created for Charcot in the Salpêtrière. His fame as a scientist, practioner and especially as a teacher attracted students and patients from all parts of the world. He was an artist as well as a scientist, and he was the first to use projection material in medical teaching, using his own drawings as illustrations. ...", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11625138/"}

We conducted a survey across Europe, featuring one expert per country. We asked experts to compare training and services for people with FND to those provided to people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

FND was part of final neurology examinations in 3/17 countries, unlike MS that was included in all 17. Seventeen countries reported neurologists with an interest in FND but the estimated mean ratio of FND-interested neurologists to MS neurologists was 1:20. FND coding varied, with psychiatric coding for FND impacting treatment access and disability benefits in the majority of countries. Twenty countries reported services refusing to see FND patients.

The Optum proprietary claims dataset (2010-2012) was examined to describe direct health care costs, as well as specific outcome metrics for a large population of persons with chronic neurologic illnesses. In phase I of the study, we detail neurologist involvement and differences in annualized allowed third--party payments within episode treatment groups (ETGs) for 10 neurologic illnesses. For phase II, we examined health care utilization for ETGs of epilepsy, Parkinson disease (PD), stroke, and multiple sclerosis (MS) with and without neurologist involvement. Reported outcomes were unadjusted differences and odds ratios between treatment groups. For phase I, a total of 1,913,605 ETGs for 10 neurologic conditions were identified, 30.1% meeting criteria for neurologist involvement. All conditions had higher direct costs when neurologists were involved with care, ranging from a 25% increase for Alzheimer dementia to 100% more for MS care. In phase II, fractures, infections, emergent care, and inpatient admission were less with neurologist ambulatory care, while neurologist care was associated with greater utilization of disease-specific treatments (immunotherapies in MS anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation-associated stroke, deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic therapies in PD). Neurologist involvement with care is associated with greater unadjusted allowed payments, but fewer adverse events and less acute care utilization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26701378/"}

A 4-year prospective study of consecutive second- to fourth-year medical students rotating through a required 4-week neurology clerkship was conducted. A goal-generating cohort (first 2 years) was enrolled to describe the breadth of student-derived goals. A goal-evaluating cohort (second 2 years) was used to evaluate the frequency of goal achievement and assess associations with performance (e.g., National Board of Medical Examiners [NBME], examination), satisfaction, and SDL behaviors (both based on 5-point Likert scale). Of 440 evaluable students, 201 were goal-generating and 239 goal-evaluating. The top 3 goals were (1) improvement in neurologic examination, (2) understanding neurologic disease, and (3) deriving a differential diagnosis. More than 90% (n = 216/239) of students reported achieving goals. Achievers reported significantly higher clerkship satisfaction (4.2 ± 0.8 vs. 2.8 ± 1.0, p < 0.0001), greater interest in neurology (71% vs. 35%, p = 0.001), and higher observed tendency toward SDL (4.5 ± 0.5 vs. 4.1 ± 0.8, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for age and training, NBME scores were 1.7 points higher in achievers (95% confidence interval 0.1-3.2, p = 0.04). Students consistently generated similar goals for a required neurology clerkship. Goal achievers had better adjusted standardized test scores, higher satisfaction, and greater tendency toward SDL. This student-generated, goal-setting program may be particularly appealing to clinicians, educators, and researchers seeking resource-lean mechanisms to improve student experience and performance in the clinical clerkships.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26718569/"}

In his teaching, he used artistic representations from previous centuries to illustrate the historical developments of hysteria, mainly with the help of his pupil Paul Richer. Charcot liked to draw portraits (in particular, sketches of colleagues during boring faculty meetings and students' examinations), caricatures of himself and others, church sculptures, landscapes, soldiers, etc. He also used this skill in his clinical and scientific work; he drew histological or anatomic specimens, as well as patients' features and demeanor. His most daring artistic experiments were drawing under the influence of hashish. Charcot's tastes in art were conservative; he displayed no affinity for the avant-gardes of his time, including impressionism, or for contemporary musicians, such as César Franck or Hector Berlioz. Léon Daudet, son of Charcot's former friend and famous writer Alphonse Daudet, described Charcot's home as a pseudo-gothic kitsch accumulation of heteroclite pieces of furniture and materials.

In addition, randomized controlled trials (RCT) at a population level have led to many new drugs and devices to treat neurological disease, including disease-modifying therapies. We are now at a crossroads. Combinatorially profound increases in data about individuals has led to an alternative to population-based RCTs. Genotyping and comprehensive \"deep\" phenotyping can sort individuals into smaller groups, enabling precise medical decisions at a personal level. In neurology, precision medicine that includes prediction, prevention and personalization requires that genomic and phenomic information further incorporate imaging and behavioral data. In this article, we review the genomic, phenomic, and computational aspects of precision medicine for neurology.

Charcot's work on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brought together neurological entities formerly considered as disparate disorders, primary amyotrophy and primary lateral sclerosis.

This review discusses the application of translational research to both diagnosis and treatment of dementia disorders. The development of biomarkers has yielded imaging and biochemical methods that assist the physician more than ever in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias, especially Alzheimer disease. New diagnostic criteria for disease are based on these molecular-based techniques. And these biomarkers are of potential use in monitoring disease activity during therapeutic trials. Translational investigations likewise have led toward new avenues in targeted dementia research. This is particularly so in the development and testing of disease-modifying treatments that might slow or deter progressive deterioration.

Etiologically, Charcot posited a dual model of a hereditary diathèse, or constitutional predilection to nervous degeneration, and an environmental agent provocateur. Increasingly during the 1880s, he emphasized the role of 'psychical shock'. These writings of Charcot also exhibit many of the same, superb clinical qualities that distinguish his work on other medical topics. Charcot isolated several hystero-traumatic formations and provided outstanding clinical depictions of subgenres of the disorder, most notably brachial monoplegias. His clinical demonstrations of the differential diagnosis of organic and functional post-traumatic pathologies represent Charcot the virtuoso neurologist at his finest. Taken together, these writings offer a penetrating exploration of the complex and elaborate functional sequelae of minor bodily injury and the phenomenon of traumatic psychogenic somatic symptom-formation. The revival today of medical interest in psycho-traumatic pathology, including the traumatic origins of certain dissociative states, provides an important context for the renewed appreciation of Charcot's work in this area.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11619017/"}

Le Fanu's works should be appreciated for the insights he provides into the psychology of his characters; his fiction was written prior to what historians of psychology date as the formal establishment of the discipline in 1879, which occurred after his death. His fiction also illustrates the emerging medical specialty of neurology, although Le Fanu's later writings are more illustrative of his interest in the mystical works of Emanuel Swedenborg. His characters frequently suffer from \"brain fevers\" and other maladies that were the subject of intense debate in England, continental Europe, and America. His male characters in particular suffer from guilty consciences, and suicide is a frequent fate. Each of these aspects of Le Fanu's fiction can be found in the 1872 collection In a Glass Darkly, which purports to contain five case histories of the German metaphysical physician Doctor Martin Hesselius. In this chapter, each of the stories in the collection will be described and analyzed for Hesselius' use of psychological, neurological, or mystical explanations for the events occurring within the story.

Other medical specialties, such as oncology, have developed assessment methods similar to the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to address this issue. Here we report the implementation of an OSCE focused on the diagnosis announcement of chronic disease in neurology by residents. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and validity in routine practice of an OSCE combined with a theoretical course focused on diagnosis announcement in neurology. Eighteen neurology residents were prospectively included between 2019 and 2022. First, they answered a questionnaire on their previous level of training in diagnosis announcement. Second, in a practical session with a simulated patient, they made a 15-min diagnosis announcement and then had 5mins of immediate feedback with an expert observer, present in the room. The OSCE consisted of 4 different stations, with standardized scenarios dedicated to the announcement of multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Third, in a theory session, expert observers covered the essential theoretical points. All residents and expert observers completed an evaluation of the \"practical session\" and the \"theory session\". Residents estimated their previous level of diagnosis announcement training at 3.1/5. The most feared announcements were AD and ALS. The \"practical session\" was rated at a mean of 4.1/5 by the residents and 4.8/5 by the expert observers, and the \"theory session\" at a mean of 4.7/5 by the residents and 5/5 by the expert observers. After the OSCEs, 11 residents felt more confident about making an announcement.

The primary goal of this study is to define the specificity of neuro-ophthalmology within the realm of visual health. The secondary goal is to review clinical care pathways by studying the organization of management, in terms of accessibility to care and personalization of the care pathway. A field study was carried out from February to June 2015, within the ophthalmology service of the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Medical Center in Paris. A 30-minute interview with the patient before or after his or her neuro-ophthalmology consultation was performed, so as to describe the clinical care pathway. The medical records of interviewed patients were also analyzed. Seventeen care pathways (10 women and 7 men) were reviewed. The mean age at appearance of visual involvement was 44.5 years (±8.4 years). If we exclude 3 patients over 66 years and retired, 35.71% were active, 35.71% were disabled, and 28.57% were on sick leave. Ten patients (58.82%) met the criteria for admission to long-term care. The first step had been carried out by local private practitioners. The first physician seen was the general medicine physician (59%), then the private ophthalmologist on an emergency basis (17%). On average, patients went through 8 steps during their care pathway (from 6 to 10 steps) and 14 medical departments were involved. The study showed collaboration with the other services of the University Hospital Department of Vision and Disabilities (notably with the Fondation Rothschild, the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital and the Fondation Sainte-Marie). In addition to rehabilitation services, health care professionals participating in the outpatient care of the patients included an orthoptist (11.7%), a psychologist (11.7%), and an optician specializing in low vision for visual aids. And finally, patient support groups, AFM-Téléthon (myasthenia) and the ARIBa Association (visual disability) were solicited by 2 patients for their involvement. A disturbance in activities of daily living leading to disabilities with psychological repercussions was noted by a number of patients. The most frequent complaints involve mobility (29.41%) and reading (23.52%). In total, 77% of patients state that their well-being has been affected and they are disturbed by the progression of their disease. The review of the clinical care pathway of patients affected by neuro-ophthalmological conditions shows that these pathologies are, on the one hand, often poorly understood, and on the other hand complex, leading to an often significant number of steps for the patient. This also emphasizes the necessity of a care network, specialized and structured to improve the efficiency of this management. Finally, these results demonstrate the existence of a very frequent disability, which may affect all aspects of the patients' lives, highlighting the importance of rehabilitation services and individuals participating in the follow-up of these patients beyond their acute care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28623040/"}

In contrast to general screening cognitive tests, an NBSE consists of tests of individual cognitive domains (e.g., memory or language) that provide a more comprehensive diagnostic assessment. Workgroups for each of 5 cognitive domains (attention, executive function, memory, language, and spatial cognition) conducted evidence-based reviews of frequently used tests. Reviews focused on suitability for office-based clinical practice, including test administration time, accessibility of normative data, disease populations studied, and availability in the public domain. Demographic and clinical practice data were obtained from 200 respondents who reported using a wide range of cognitive tests.

Defining neuroimaging characteristics of TBM include thick basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and parenchymal infarctions most commonly involving the basal ganglia and internal capsule. Traditional cerebrospinal fluid sample analysis frequently requires lengthy times-to-result and have low sensitivity. Given the pitfalls of conventional CNS TB diagnostic methods, various molecular-based methods, including immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have emerged as alternative diagnostic tools due to their rapidity, sensitivity, and specificity. Expert panels on TBM have recently emphasized the need for standard research procedures with updated case definitions and standardized study methods, which will hopefully pave the way for more robust multicenter international studies.

Most health care professionals were aged 35-44 years, with >15 years of work experience. The key findings of their observations were as follows. (i) Clinical services were cut back in all neurological subspecialties during the most restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period. The most affected neurological subspecialties were services for patients with dementia, and neuromuscular and movement disorders. The levels of reduction and the pace of recovery were distinct for acute emergencies and in- and outpatient care. Recovery was slow for sleep medicine, autonomic nervous system disorders, neurorehabilitation, and dementia care. (ii) Student and residency rotations and grand rounds were reorganized, and congresses were converted into a virtual format. Conferences are partly maintained in a hybrid format. (iii) Affordability of neurological care and medication shortage are emerging issues. Recovery of neurological services up to spring 2023 has been incomplete following substantial disruption of neurological care, medical education, and health economics in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The continued limitations for the delivery of neurological care threaten brain health and call for action on a global scale.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38038262/"}

It was, however, the remarkable clinical and scientific advances in neurology and pediatrics at the end of the 19th century that helped create its scientific foundation. Like other pediatric disciplines, child neurology evolved into a distinct clinical and scientific specialty early in the 20th century. Remarkable advances in the neurosciences, particularly in the fields of genetics, molecular biology, metabolism, immunology and nutrition, have greatly advanced our understanding of how the brain develops and responds to environmental influences. Advances in neuroimaging, electroencephalography, electromyography, muscle histology, biochemistry, and neuropharmacology have considerably improved our ability to evaluate and treat children with neurological disorders. These advances have allowed new and expanding approaches, unique to children, in the fields of epilepsy, neurodegenerative and neurometabolic disorders, nervous system infections, demyelinating diseases and tumors, neonatal neurological conditions, and neuromuscular diseases. They have also led to a better understanding of the neurobiologic basis of common problems such as global developmental delay, cerebral palsy, and autism. As remarkable as the advances have been in the past century, the accelerating pace of our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for brain development will lead to even greater achievements in the clinical care of children with neurological disorders in the 21st century", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12538797/"}

We reviewed patient logs of all 212 neurology clerkship students from the 2005-2006 academic year and determined the number of patients each student saw in five diagnostic categories (seizure, headache, stroke, acute mental status change, and dementia). We compared these numbers with the students' written examination scores (total and category-specific) and clinical evaluation scores using Pearson product-moment correlations. The more patients in a given diagnostic category that students saw, the lower the students' examination subscores in that disease category (r = -0.066, p = 0.03). The total number of patients each student saw did not correlate with the student's total examination score (r = -0.021, p = 0.77) or the student's overall clinical performance rating (r = 0.089, p = 0.23). Higher numbers of logged patients did not correlate with better clerkship performance, whether the outcome measures were written tests or faculty ratings, and whether the analysis involved total or disease-specific patient counts. Thus, patient census may not be a meaningful index of educational experience or outcome.

As a young physician, he worked in pathology and medicine under Rayer for nine years, and wrote on diseases of the heart, lungs and kidneys, on rheumatism and gout. In 1862, he was appointed as medical superintendent to the Hospice de la Salpêtrière. This institution contained a population of over 5000 persons, affected with every kind of chronic maladies, particularly with diseases of the nervous system. As a clinician, he could begin to observe, examine and describe with his excellent master Duchenne de Boulogne. And as an anatomo-pathologist in his association with his colleague Vulpian, he devoted himself to compare the pathological findings with clinical records, to bring order into this chaos. During the 8-year period from 1862 to 1870, Charcot made many discoveries that made firm basis for neurology as one new specialty in medicine. The first beautiful fruit of their effort was the clinico-pathological identification of \"Disseminated Sclerosis\", clearly differentiated from \"Paralysis agitans\" of which first reported by Parkinson 1817. He succeeded Vulpian to the chair of pathological anatomy in 1872.

A case series and brief literature review.", "text": "Catatonia is a well-described clinical syndrome characterized by features that range from mutism, negativism and stupor to agitation, mannerisms and stereotype. Causes of catatonia may range from organic brain disorders to psychiatric conditions. Despite a characteristic syndrome, catatonia is grossly under diagnosed. The reason for missed diagnosis of catatonia in neurology setting is not clear. Poor awareness is an unlikely cause because catatonia is taught among conditions with deregulated consciousness like vegetative state, locked-in state and akinetic mutism. We determined the proportion of catatonia patients correctly identified by neurology residents in neurology emergency. We also looked at the alternate diagnosis they received to identify catatonia mimics. Twelve patients (age 22-55 years, 7 females) of catatonia were discharged from a single unit of neurology department from 2007 to 2017. In the emergency department, neurology residents diagnosed none of the patients as catatonia. They offered diagnosis of extrapyramidal syndrome in 7, meningitis in 2, and conversion reaction, acute psychosis/encephalopathy and non-convulsive status epilepticus in one each. Their final diagnosis at discharge was catatonia due to general medical condition in 6 (progressive supranuclear palsy in 2, post-status epilepticus, uremic encephalopathy, glioblastoma multiforme and tuberculous meningitis in one each), catatonia due to major depression in 4, schizophrenia and idiopathic catatonia in one each. Extrapyramidal syndrome appeared as common mimic of catatonia. The literature reviewed also revealed the majority of organic catatonia secondary to causes that are usually associated with extrapyramidal features. Therefore, we suggest that neurologists should consider catatonia in patients presenting with extrapyramidal syndromes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31147176/"}

Moritz Jastrowitz dealt with behavioral abnormalities due to frontal brain injuries 1 year earlier and used the term \"moria\" for a form of mental disorder associated with a kind of childish behavior and inappropriate jocularity. Oppenheim was critical of this and differentiated his \"witzelsucht\" from this. With this term he wanted to describe humoristic feeble-mindedness in a much narrower sense, which stands in striking contrast to the usual symptoms in cases of cerebral tumors. Oppenheim recognized the frontal brain, particularly the right brain, to be an important functional unit for humorous behavior. Modern research has confirmed that the processing of humor requires a complex interaction of multiple brain regions. Damage to the right frontal lobe or to connecting structures can lead to the disorder \"witzelsucht\".

Contrary to a common view, and in spite of an established tradition for mental diseases, emerging neurology had a much stronger influence on psychiatry ('alienism') than the reverse. This was largely due to the school built up by Jean-Martin Charcot, which was organized around the study and management of hysteria. Although Charcot himself always claimed his disinterest in mental medicine, he stimulated the development of an original scientific approach to nervous system conditions, along with a structured academic teaching, while alienism paradoxically remained stuck in organicism, after Antoine Bayle's report in 1822 of 'arachnitis' as the substratum of general paresis of the insane. Contrary to alienism, the young neurological school was able of self-criticism, and progressively underscored mental factors in hysteria. This led to the paradox that neurologists were active in a disease with a recognized lack of organic lesion, while alienists were postulating brain lesions in all mental disorders. The neurological activity thus indirectly and involuntarily led to the first developments of psychodynamic concepts in mental diseases. The academic evolution led to the launch of a faculty chair of mental and brain diseases in 1875, which was taken over for nearly half a century by direct pupils of Charcot: Benjamin Ball, Alix Joffroy, and Gilbert Ballet held the position until 1916, supporting the development of modern psychiatry in general hospitals, while alienism progressively disappeared at the turn of the century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19690418/"}

We hypothesized that Neurology shelf exam scores would remain stable for students in a shortened 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual rotation as compared to the traditional 4-week Neurology clerkship with direct patient care supplemented by didactics. This is a retrospective observational cohort study. In April 2020, the neurology clerkship at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School switched from a traditional 4-week in-person clinical rotation supplemented by didactics to a 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual-only curriculum decoupled from a supplementary 2-week in-person clinical rotation to be completed later. Students were offered the opportunity to test after the 2-week virtual curriculum. NBME shelf scores for these \"exam before clinical rotation\" (EBC) students over the final quarter of the academic year 2019-2020 were compared to those of the \"exam after clinical\" (EAC) students undergoing the 4-week traditional rotation from July 2018 to March 2020. 321 students completed the shelf exam between July 2018 and June 2020, of which 284 students comprised the EAC cohort and 37 students, the EBC cohort. Mean scores did not differ between the EBC and EAC cohorts (81.8 ± 6.7 versus 81.8 ± 6.5, p = 0.96). Additional analyses showed no significant differences in the performance of EBC students as compared to the EAC students that tested within the same academic year 2019-2020 or within the matched quarter of the prior academic year 2018-2019, and students completing the virtual rotation who delayed testing after the clinical experience. Testing after a 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual curriculum in Neurology without additional clinical training did not negatively affect neurology NBME shelf scores. Decoupling clinical experiences from knowledge acquisition and the evaluation of that knowledge base by means of NBME shelf examination is not likely to disadvantage learners with respect to shelf examination performance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39501257/"}

Despite the discipline's growth, variability in NNCC service delivery, patient care, and clinical training poses significant challenges and potentially adversely impacts patient outcomes. Variations in neuroprotective strategies, postnatal care, and training methodologies highlight the urgent need for a unified approach to optimize both short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for these vulnerable population.

The neurological diseases manifesting with such symptoms (dementia, epilepsy, Korsakoff's disease, brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, migraine, right hemisphere stroke and others) would be the key to understand their biological mechanisms, while the cognitive sciences, neuropharmacology and functional neuroimaging would be the tools of such researches. It is possible to understand the perceptive rules of the mind and the mechanisms of the human consciousness based on these symptoms. However, hallucinations and delusions manifest with extraordinary vehemence with psychiatric disorders such as psychosis and schizophrenia, with which there is no evidence of brain lesions. Furthermore, they are subjective symptoms, and they do not have biological markers. Hence, they are prone to high inter-individual variability and depend on other variables (such as education, history of trauma), and are therefore difficult to reduce to unequivocal constructs. Causative mechanisms are probably multiple. For understanding these symptoms, a common framework between neurology and psychiatry is still missing. The psychopathology of French alienists over the 19th century, of S. Freud, and of Henry Ey over the 20th century gave way, in the second half of the 20th century, to the adoption of the DSM and neurosciences, to pursue a pure neurological perspective. However, although psychodynamic models seem nowadays (in a technological era) less influential, detailed clinical evaluations focusing on emotional-cognitive paradigms are probably the only way to lead to new neurobiological researches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31220856/"}

Charcot's cases record a highly diverse clinique tableau of symptoms. Etiologically, Charcot posited a dual model of a hereditary diathèse, or constitutional predilection to nervous degeneration, and an environment agent provocateur. Increasingly during the 1880s, he emphasized the role of \"psychical shock\". These writings of Charcot also exhibit many of the same, superb clinical qualities that distinguish his work on other medical topics. Charcot isolated several hystero-traumatic formations and provided outstanding clinical depictions of subgenres of the disorder, most notably brachial monoplegias. His clinical demonstrations of the differential diagnosis of organic and functional post-traumatic pathologies represent Charcot the virtuoso neurologist at his finest. Taken together, these writings offer a penetrating exploration of the complex and elaborate functional sequelae of minor bodily injury and the phenomenon of traumatic psychogenic somatic symptom-formation. The revival today of medical interest in psycho-traumatic pathology, particularly in the traumatic origins of dissociative states and post-traumatic stress disorders, provide an important context for the renewed appreciation of Charcot's work in this area.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7754283/"}

The historical origins of modern differential diagnosis in neuromuscular disease.", "text": "The concept of the differential diagnosis has a central place in all clinical medicine. In neurology and paediatrics, evolution of thought concerning the differential diagnosis of the child presenting with symptoms of neuromuscular disease was far in advance of similar diagnostic approaches to problems of infectious, infective and neoplastic disease; and as such forms a significant historical model for the development of modern clinical approaches to the sick or disabled child. The account presented in this paper provides a detailed historical review of the development of thought relating to the causes of neuromuscular disease. Nosological developments concerning diseases of the motor unit can be conveniently classified into three periods: (a) a \"state of the art\" period to 1850; (b) 1850-1890 - a period of parallel and interdependent advances in both normal neuro-anatomy and neurophysiology, and diseases recognized as variations from such norms. In this era Duchenne was the first to write about the differential diagnosis of the progressive muscular paralysis in childhood; and Gowers was the first to write specifically on the hereditary transmission of this group of diseases; (c) in 1891 was described the first case of childhood neuronopathy recognized as such, and with this development was ushered in the modern era of clinical differential diagnosis of childhood neuromuscular disease. The \"splitters\" have won the great debate concerning the clinical approach to neurological diseases. The continual further refining of an exact diagnosis is the only way in which a realistic prognosis can be forecast, correct genetic counseling can be offered, and (if the condition is treatable) optimal therapy can be introduced.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6376716/"}

{"id": "17495507", "title": "Marcel Proust's diseases and doctors: the neurological story of a life.", "text": "Marcel Proust (1871-1922), one of the greatest writers of all times, suffered from asthma beginning at age 9, in an era when the illness was considered a 'nervous' disorder belonging to what Beard, in 1870, called 'neurasthenia'. Proust's father, Adrien, was himself a professor of medicine (hygiene) who had met Charcot, and who contributed to neurology with studies on aphasia, stroke, hysteria, and neurasthenia - a condition about which he, along with Gilbert Ballet, published a book in 1897. Through his father, Proust met Edouard Brissaud, the co-founder of the Revue Neurologique in 1893, and, in 1896, the author of The Hygiene of the Asthmatics, with a foreword by Adrien Proust. Shortly after his mother's death in 1905, Proust contemplated admitting himself to a private hospital to reset his irregular sleep patterns and to improve his asthma. He hesitated in his choice of care between Jules Dejerine in Paris, Henry-Auguste Widmer at Valmont, and Paul Dubois in Bern. Finally, he decided to enter Paul Sollier's clinic, in Boulogne-sur-Seine, on the advice of Brissaud, and stayed there for 6 weeks in semi-isolation. Together with Babinski, Sollier was, at that time, considered the most gifted follower of Charcot. He was a forerunner of studies on emotional memory, which strongly influenced Proust. In Proust's opus magnum work In Search of Lost Time, 'involuntary memory' indeed forms the core mechanism of the entire novel, counterbalancing the decaying effects of time. A few years before his death from complicated bronchopneumonia at age 52, Proust became terrified of developing a stroke, like his mother and father, and he consulted with Joseph Babinski, who tried to reassure him. Proust's life followed an unusual neurological itinerary, which has been largely overlooked, but which is in fact critical for an understanding of his literary work.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17495507/"}
{"id": "27772665", "title": "[Reconciliating neurology and psychiatry: The prototypical case of frontotemporal dementia].", "text": "Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) in its behavioral variant (bvFTD) is probably one of the conditions that best illustrates the links between psychiatry and neurology. It is indeed admitted that between a third and half of patients with this condition, especially in early-onset forms, receive an initial diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and are then referred to a psychiatric ward. BvFTD can thus be considered a neurological disorder with a psychiatric presentation. Among psychiatric symptoms reported in this disease, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, especially of persecution), which have long been underestimated in bvFTD and are not part of the current diagnostic criteria, are present in about 20% of cases and may be inaugural. They are particularly common in the genetic forms related to a mutation in the C9orf72 gene (up to 50%), and to a lesser extent in the GRN gene (up to 25%). C9orf72 gene mutation is often associated with a family history of dementia or motor neuron disease but also of psychiatric disorders. It has also been described in sporadic presentation forms. Sometimes, the moderate degree of brain atrophy on MRI described in patients carrying this mutation may complicate the differential diagnosis with late-onset psychiatric diseases. In the present article, we underline the importance of considering that psychiatric - especially psychotic - symptoms are not rare in bvFTD, which should lead to a revision of the diagnostic criteria of this disease by taking greater account of this fact. We also propose a diagnostic chart, based on concerted evaluation by neurologists and psychiatrists for cases of atypical psychiatric symptoms (late-onset or pharmacoresistant troubles) leading to consider the possibility of a neurological disorder, in order to shed a new light on these difficult clinical situations. In the field of research, bvFTD may constitute a model to explore the neural basis of certain psychiatric disorders, and a possible molecular link between bvFTD and psychoses, which could eventually lead to new therapeutic approaches, has been recently suggested. Thus, bvFTD illustrates how the links between neurology and psychiatry are close and tend to evolve with the progress of scientific knowledge. It is necessary to strengthen collaboration between the two disciplines both to improve the care - diagnosis and management of these patients - and to promote the emergence of innovative clinical research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27772665/"}

The aim of this study is to determine the views of the relatives of patients treated in the neurology service about the risk of aspiration through metaphors. This article analyzed metaphors of patients' relatives' about the risk of aspiration. The analysis uses metaphor identification and analysis. The research sample consisted of 31 patients. First of all, in the study, evaluation of the data was conducted by performing content analysis, as a result of which it was divided into metaphors and conceptual categories, and the relevant field was associated with the text (event, thought, feelings, related in speech or writing). In the reporting of research, the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist was used. It was seen that the patients' relatives produced 31 different metaphors in response to the statement 'Aspiration risk is like …, because it is …' The patients' relatives mostly compared the concept of 'fear of aspiration' to the concept of 'fear' (n: 24). In this study, relatives mostly described the concept of fear related to the risk of aspiration. According to this result, patients' relatives have a great fear of aspiration increasing the risk of readmission to hospital and of malnutrition. This result shows that informing patients' relatives will increase awareness and will allow them to provide informed care.

In his writings Reynolds was the first English author to apply the approach to classification of neurological disorders that is still often used, though now in modified form. He was also the first to enunciate the notion of positive and negative symptoms arising from neurological disease and to suggest their pathogenesis, and was arguably the originator of the influential concept that an idiopathic disease, epilepsy, existed, one to be distinguished from 'epileptiform' seizures due to brain pathology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17236774/"}

The general accessibility, rapid response time and comprehensive training database might enable ChatGPT to serve as a diagnostic augmentation tool in certain clinical settings. The diagnostic process in neurology is often challenging and complex. In certain time-sensitive scenarios, rapid evaluation and diagnostic decisions are needed, while in other cases clinicians are faced with rare disorders and atypical disease manifestations. Due to these factors, the diagnostic accuracy in neurology is often suboptimal. Here we evaluated whether ChatGPT can be utilized as a valuable and innovative diagnostic augmentation tool in various neurological settings. We used synthetic data generated by neurological experts to represent descriptive anamneses of patients with known neurology-related diseases, then the probability for an appropriate diagnosis made by ChatGPT was measured. To give clarity to the accuracy of the AI-determined diagnosis, all cases have been cross-validated by other experts and general medical doctors as well. We found that ChatGPT-determined diagnostic accuracy (ranging from 68.5% ± 3.28% to 83.83% ± 2.73%) can reach the accuracy of other experts (81.66% ± 2.02%), furthermore, it surpasses the probability of an appropriate diagnosis if the examiner is a general medical doctor (57.15% ± 2.64%).

Although there is much potential for the use of immersive virtual reality environments in clinical applications, there are problems which could limit their ultimate usability. Some users have experienced side-effects during and after exposure to virtual reality environments. The symptoms include ocular problems, disorientation and balance disturbances, and nausea. Susceptibility to side-effects can be affected by age, ethnicity, experience, gender and physical fitness, as well as the characteristics of the display, the virtual environment and the tasks. The characteristics of the virtual reality system have also been shown to affect the ability of users to perform tasks in a virtual environment. Many of these effects can be attributed to delays between the sampling of head and limb positions and the presentation of an appropriate image on the display. The introduction of patients to virtual reality environments, for assessment, therapy or rehabilitation, raises particular safety and ethical issues. Patients exposed to virtual reality environments for assessment and rehabilitation may have disabilities which increase their susceptibility to certain side-effects. Special precautions therefore need to be taken to ensure the safety and effectiveness of such virtual reality applications. These precautions include minimisation of possible side-effects at the design stage. Factors are identified which are likely to affect the incidence of side-effects during and after exposures, and which need to be understood in order to minimise undesirable consequences.

It has useful characteristics, such as low cost, ease of use, reliable sham methodology, and relatively powerful effects on cortical excitability. Because of its potential to modulate cortical excitability noninvasively, tDCS has been tested for the treatment of depression for several decades. Therefore, we reviewed evidence on the use of tDCS for major depression examining evidence from past and recent tDCS studies. We also briefly compared tDCS with other techniques of neuromodulation, namely deep brain stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation; and suggest future directions for the use of tDCS in major depression. Results from past clinical trials testing direct current stimulation as a therapeutic tool had mixed methodology and showed heterogeneous results. Recent studies on tDCS and depression using novel approaches, such as different parameters of stimulation, have improved its neuromodulatory effect thus resulting in larger clinical effects. In fact, two recent small trials have shown that tDCS is associated with significant clinical gains. On the basis of these findings there is still not enough evidence to support tDCS as a therapeutic modality for depression. However, findings to date encourage further studies in this area that should explore novel parameters of stimulation. In fact, it appears that current methods of tDCS might not be fully optimized and, in fact, (1) individualized parameters of stimulation, (2) longer stimulation sessions, and (3) methods to focalize tDCS might be useful strategies to provide greater clinical benefits.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19339889/"}

Charcot discussed the music abilities of several patients in the context of his 'Friday Lessons' on aphasia, which took place at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris in 1883-84. In his most comprehensive discussion about music, Charcot described a professional trombone player who developed difficulty copying music notation and playing his instrument, thereby identifying a new isolated syndrome of music agraphia without aphasia. Because the description of this case was published only in Italian by one of his students, Domenico Miliotti, there has been considerable confusion and under-acknowledgement of Charcot's ideas about music and the brain. In this paper, we describe Charcot's ideas regarding music and place them within the historical context of the growing interest in the neurological underpinnings of music abilities that took place in the 1880s.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23576129/"}

A total of 1332 new patients (85% adult, 15% pediatric) were seen during a 3-year period. This total represented 970 inpatients (73% of all patients) and 362 outpatients (27%). The resident encountered more patients in the hospital (7.5 admissions or 13 consultations per week) and fewer patients in the clinic (2.5 new outpatients per week) than does the average community neurologist (two admissions, 8.7 consultations, and 13.2 new outpatients). The most common diagnosis for an admission encounter was acute ischemic infarct; for a consultation, metabolic encephalopathy; and for an outpatient encounter, radiculopathy. Less prevalent neurologic disorders in the United States (eg, cognitive, demyelinating, movement, and neoplastic disorders) were encountered more frequently in residency than were very prevalent neurologic disorders (eg, headache and trauma). This is the first reported summary of all patients one resident actually encountered during neurology training. The patient encounter profile suggests that this residency training overemphasized acute inpatient care of less prevalent neurologic disorders compared with outpatient care of more prevalent disorders commonly seen in a neurology practice.

A few pilot subspecialties adopted this timeline for 2021 recruitment for positions beginning in 2022. All United States-based AAN-affiliated neurology and child neurology residents who recently completed the fellowship application process received a survey about their fellowship application experience. Of the 291 residents who responded to the survey, 96% agree that applications should not be submitted before March 1 of the penultimate year of training and 72% believe that August 1 of the final year is a reasonable time to begin offering positions. Nearly half (49%) of residents believe that there is too little time for subspecialty/clinical exposure before applying for fellowship and 88% feel the current process and timeline are stressful. Residents who applied to programs in pilot subspecialties report more time to choose, less stress, and a lower number of time-pressured offers. A large majority of residents (89%) prefer to submit a single application through a centralized system. The survey results suggest that residents who just completed the fellowship application process agree with the AAN recommended timeline for all subspecialties and that all neurology subspecialties should consider adopting a fellowship match.

His relation to Charcot first and the reception of his papers by Charcot's followers (mainly Raymond, Marie, Brissaud) later represent a particular chapter of history. This is well documented by Charcot's letters to Freud (hitherto published only in French), by Freud's French articles as well as by many medical theses (Paris, Lyon, Nancy, Bordeaux) discussing the pros and cons. Two topics were focussed. First there was a neurological dispute about Little's disease, its clinical vignette, etiologies, and its spinal and cerebral localisations. Freud argued there to be a nosographic entity. Most of Charcot's disciples, however, pleaded against the idea of an entity for such different pathological forms. This was followed by a discussion about Freuds doctrine of neuroses and their sexual origin, which Freud opposed to the French theories of heredity and degeneration. Both of the discussions were without personal encounter and without a direct exchange of views between the protagonists. Which did not cause it to be less vivid and intense. This proves Freud's standing as an internationally acknowledged expert for neuropathological aspects of the child. However, starting in 1900, Freud retired from the neurological discussion and the Paris scene. The dispute about Little's disease faded away and the discussion about neuroses became occupied by Janet's writings. The neuropathologist Freud eclipsed the psychoanalyst Freud. Hence Freud's repeated complaints not to have been well received by the French.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10478298/"}

The Stella Maris Institute has evaluated systematically patients with developmental delay (DD)/MR and performed various laboratory studies and neuroimaging in almost all patients. We report a retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of 120 consecutive patients observed at our Institute during the first 6 months of 1996. There were 77 males and 43 females; 47 were mildly delayed (IQ 70-50), 31 were moderately delayed (IQ 50-35), and 42 were severely delayed (IQ 35-20). Diagnostic studies (history, physical examination, standard cytogenetics, fragile X testing, molecular studies, electroencephalography, electromyography, nerve conduction studies, neuroimaging, and metabolic screening tests) yielded a causal diagnosis in 50 (41.6%) and a pathogenetic diagnosis in 47 (39.2%) of the 120 patients. Causal categories included chromosomal abnormalities (14), Fra(X) syndromes (4), known MCA/MR syndromes (19), fetal environmental syndromes (1), neurometabolic (3) disorders, neurocutaneous (3) disorders, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3), other encephalopathies (1), and congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome (2). Pathogenetic categories included idiopathic MCA/MR syndromes (35), epileptic syndromes (10), and isolated lissencephaly sequence (2). Diagnostic yield did not differ across categories and degree of DD. Our results, while confirming the diagnostic utility of cytogenetic/molecular genetic, and neuroimaging studies, suggest the usefulness of accurate electroencephalogram recordings, and stress the importance of a thorough physical examination.

This review considers whether it is time for such a specialized service to be developed in pediatrics. Recent reports describe how some institutions and pediatric professional bodies have set about transferring the specialist neurocritical care experience in adults to pediatric practice. The issue, now, is whether such a development would improve pediatric healthcare, medical education and training in the newly defined field. Adult neurocritical care did not develop in a void. The historical influences were the polio epidemics and the investment in experimental neuroprotection. These traditions provided a foundation for success in recent clinical trials, patient outcomes and healthcare research. Pediatric neurocritical care does not have the equivalent parallels and track record in healthcare research. Size of practice and casemix is also significantly different, with one-third of potential beneficiaries of the new field having a primary medical, rather than neurological, disorder. Three types of development for pediatric neurocritical services are, therefore, suggested by the literature and the implications of these on cross-discipline staffing and education are discussed. Pediatric neurocritical care is the new frontier for pediatric critical care medicine and pediatric neurology.

The denomination of the syndrome has changed over time, from hysteria (reinvestigated by Paul Briquet and Jean-Martin Charcot) to pithiatism (Joseph Babinski), then to conversion neurosis (Sigmund Freud), and today functional neurological disorders according to the 2013 American Neurological Association DSM-5 classification. The treatment was renewed in the second half of the 19th century in Paris by Paul Briquet and then by Jean-Martin Charcot. Hysterical women, who represented the great majority of cases, were cured by physical therapy (notably physio-, hydro-, and electrotherapy, and in some cases ovary compression) and 'moral' therapies (general, causal therapy, rest, isolation, hypnosis, and suggestion). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, and persuasion were established respectively by Pierre Janet, Sigmund Freud, and Joseph Babinski. During World War I, military forces faced a large number of posttrauma neurosis cases among soldiers (named the 'Babinski-Froment war neurosis' and Myers 'shell shock', in the French and English literature, respectively). This led to the use of more brutal therapies in military hospitals, combining electrical shock and persuasion, particularly in France with Clovis Vincent and Gustave Roussy, but also in Great Britain and Germany. After World War I, this method was abandoned and there was a marked decrease in interest in hysteria for a long period of time. Today, the current treatment comprises (if possible intensive) physiotherapy, together with psychotherapy, and in some cases psychoanalysis. Antidepressants and anxiolytics may be required, and more recently cognitive and behavioral therapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new technique under investigation which may be promising in patients presenting with motor conversion syndrome (motor deficit or movement disorder). Functional neurological disorders remain a difficult problem to manage with frequent failures and chronic handicapping evolution.

There are various reasons accounting for a differentiation of palliative care in neurology and for the development of specific expertise; the long duration of the advanced stages of many neurological diseases and the distinguishing features of some clinical problems (cognitive disorders, psychic disorders, etc.), in addition to the deterioration of some general aspects (nutrition, etc.), make the general criteria adopted for cancer, severe respiratory, hepatic or renal failures and heart failure inadequate.

Both systems affect and regulate the development of each other during embryogenesis and the early postnatal period. Specialized neural crest cells contribute to cardiac structures, and a number of growth factors released from the cardiac tissue (e.g., glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, nerve growth factor, Neurotrophin-3) ensure proper maturation of the incoming parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons. Physiologically, the cardiovascular and nervous systems operate in harmony to adapt to various physical and emotional conditions to maintain homeostasis through sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Moreover, neurocardiac regulation involves a neuroaxis consisting of cortex, amygdala, and other subcortical structures, which have the ability to modify lower-level neurons in the hierarchy. Given the interconnectivity of cardiac and neural systems, when one undergoes pathological changes, the other is affected to a certain extent. In addition, there are specific neurocardiac diseases that affect both systems simultaneously, such as Huntington disease, Lewy body diseases, Friedreich ataxia, congenital heart diseases, Danon disease, and Timothy syndrome. Over the last decade, in vitro modeling of neurocardiac diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided an invaluable opportunity to elevate our knowledge about the brain-heart connection, since previously primary cardiomyocytes and neurons had been extremely difficult to maintain long-term in vitro. Ultimately, the ability of iPSC technology to model abnormal functional phenotypes of human neurocardiac disorders, combined with the ease of therapeutic screening using this approach, will transform patient care through personalized medicine in the future. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27629698/"}

ONSD measurement is simple, easy to learn, and has diverse applications. ONSD has utility for ICP measurement in intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke, meningitis and encephalitis, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). It is also valuable for lesser known syndromes, where an increase of ICP is postulated, such as acute mountain sickness and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. ONSD changes develop in inflammatory or ischemic optic neuropathies. Some papers demonstrate the usefulness of ONSD studies in symptomatic intracranial hypotension.

A survey was undertaken of 280 neurologists from the United States and 270 neurologists from Canada. Brief vignettes were presented for the following 5 scenarios: stroke in evolution, atrial fibrillation-related stroke (A FIB), vertebrobasilar stroke, carotid territory stroke, and multiple transient ischemic attacks. The effect of medicolegal factors was also ascertained. Statistical comparisons were done with chi-squared testing. US neurologists were significantly more likely than Canadian neurologists to use intravenous heparin for patients with stroke in evolution (51% versus 33%, P<0.001), vertebrobasilar stroke (30% versus 8%, P<0.001), carotid territory stroke (31% versus 4%, P<0.001), and multiple transient ischemic attacks (47% versus 9%, P<0.001). The vast majority of US and Canadian neurologists would use intravenous heparin for acute stroke patients with A FIB (88% and 84%, respectively). US neurologists more often cited medicolegal factors as a potential influence on the decision-making process than Canadian neurologists (33% versus 10%, P<0.001). In several clinical scenarios, US neurologists were significantly more likely than Canadian neurologists to use intravenous heparin. Fears regarding medicolegal consequences may partially explain the treatment disparity. Despite the publication of 4 clinical trials, which have not shown any long-term benefit for patients with acute stroke and A FIB (International Stroke Trial, Heparin in Acute Embolic Stroke Trial) or cardioembolic stroke (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, the Tinzaparin in Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial), both US and Canadian neurologists would use intravenous heparin in large numbers for this condition.

{"id": "9480576", "title": "[Dr. John Hughlings Jackson].", "text": "The great English neurologist, Dr. John Hughlings Jackson was born in Providence Green, Yorkshire, north England, in 1835. He spent his apprenticeship in the city of York, continued his medical education at St. Bartholomew's hospital in London, and qualified in medicine in 1856. After working in the city of York, he studied in London and in 1860 graduated at St. Andrews university in Scotland. He died in London in 1911, famous and celebrated by his colleagues as the \"father of British neurology\". Jackson was a prolific writer, witty and ingenious person, but also solitary and absent minded, with a lat of \"tiny peculiarities of a genius\". At first he was committed to become a philosopher but was persuaded by Jonathan Hutchinson, one of his rare friends, to enter medicine. His \"Selected Writings\" were first published in 1931 and reprinted recently, in 1996, by Arts & Boeve. Jackson, unlike William Richard Gowers, wrote his articles in a style which was not palatable to his contemporary colleagues. This could be the reason that his medical work was not widely known and would have remained in shadow had it not been rediscovered mostly by German neurologists, who preceded their English colleagues and collected the fame. Jackson gave the first classification of epileptic seizures acceptable, to a degree, even today. It was twofold: the first, taxonomic, which corresponds to contemporary classification of seizures, he compared to the attitude of a gardener who classifies flowers according to their beauty, height or color, and was aware of its purely phenotypic, descriptive and utilitarian character; the second was scientific, physiologic and it would correspond nowadays to the current concept of syndromic classification. Jackson was aware that this 'scientific classification' was to await for the future time, when the knowledge of the real nature of epilepsy became fundamentally broadened. On the other hand, he thought that all the epilepsies were partial becoming generalized only secondarily. Partial epilepsies were the starting point in his work. He realized that epileptic attacks are not different types of epilepsies with different pathophysiological mechanisms, but that they differ in respect to the focus of origin; he stressed their gray matter (cortical) arigin with the cause located as the rule \"on the side of the brain, opposite to the body convulsed\". Jackson's ideas on epileptogenesis and the localization of epileptogenic processes represent his fundamental contribution to the understanding of their pathophysiology. His most philosophical contribution to neurology was the concept of the evolution and dissolution of the nervous system, which was the consequence of his ideas on its organization. Symptoms observed after the lesion of a certain part of the brain are not the consequence of its function; they are the result of the function of the remaining non-lesioned regions which are in a certain way freed from the adjacent or a higher control. This concept of interpretation af the symptoms of the nervous diseases remains applicable even today. Jackson was the first to stress the importance of ophthalmoscopy in neurology in all cases of neurologic disease, especially in cases of optic neuritis (papilloedema) which may be present even if the patient did not notice the minimized visual acuity. The way of thinking that Jackson introduced in medicine and neurology may be his most precious legacy to the generations that followed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9480576/"}

Furthermore, regulating neuronal cell death after SCI through various means has been proven to be beneficial for the recovery of neural function. In recent years, emerging therapies for SCI have also provided new potential methods to restore neural function. Thus, the relationship between SCI and cell death plays an important role in the occurrence and development of SCI.

A thorough understanding of the clinically defined syndrome is essential. Along with the other psychiatric diseases listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), autism is defined by gross behavioral macros that, in all probability, are only indirectly related to basic biological systems. The diagnostic schema is not etiologically based. The diagnostic triad of symptoms that defines autism--impaired communication, impaired social interaction, and restricted and repetitive interests and activities--has been found to be present in the general population with no clear demarcation between pathological severity and being a common trait. In addition, the three basic symptoms of autism appear not to associate highly, thus leaving undetermined the validity of studying autism in its currently defined triad of symptoms.

To provide an historical overview of the different views about the disease of Gilles de la Tourette and the Tourette Syndrome. Literature review. In 1885 Gilles de la Tourette published a paper on a rare disorder whose symptoms were sudden movements (tics) and the shouting out of obscene language (coprolalia). According to Charcot it was a specific neurological disease which he named after his pupil: la maladie des tics de Gilles de la Tourette. Gilles de la Tourette was potentially successor to Charcot as Professor of Neurology. His bad temper, the first symptoms of neurolues with megalomania, and the fact that the ideas of hysteria had undergone a drastic change, deterred him from taking up the position. After his premature death in 1904 his name was soon forgotten. In the early part of the 20th century the disease of tics was regarded as a psychiatric disorder and from 1920 those suffering from tics were referred for psychoanalysis. After 1970 the disease of Gilles de la Tourette experienced a revival. The American couple Shapiro rediscovered the disorder as a neurological disease and named it the Tourette Syndrome. Thanks to the efforts of an influential American patient organisation Gilles de la Tourette has become famous worldwide with the exception of France.

The existing guidelines on unipolar depression from Germany and other countries were synoptically compared and supplemented with systematic literature searches. After 14 consensus conferences, a total of 107 evidence-based recommendations were issued. Unipolar depression should be diagnosed in accordance with ICD-10 criteria. Screening questionnaires are useful aids to diagnostic classification. When a treatment is chosen, shared decision-making with the patient is essential. Mild depressive episodes can be treated initially by watchful waiting for 14 days. For moderate depressive episodes, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are equally effective treatment options. For severe depression, a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is recommended. If 4 to 6 weeks of acute therapy are insufficiently effective, lithium augmentation is recommended, rather than combination antidepressant therapy or a switch to another antidepressant. After remission, maintenance therapy should be continued for 4 to 9 months. In recurrent depression, pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, where appropriate, should be continued for at least two years. Specific recommendations are given for patients who have somatic or mental comorbidities or are acutely suicidal, and recommendations are also given for coordination of care. This guideline is a comprehensive set of evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of unipolar depression.

The aim of this narrative review is to update and summarise the effect and clinical applicability of probiotics in paediatric neurogastroenterology. The Cochrane Database and PubMed were searched using keywords relating to different subtypes of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and their symptoms, those relating to the CNS and related neurological or behavioural dysfunction as well as 'probiotic' OR 'probiotics'. Included papers were limited to those including children (aged 0-18 years) and using English language. Although significant effects of specific strains have been reported in infants with FGIDs, heterogeneity amongst the studies (different products and concentrations used and FGID subtypes), has limited the ability to draw an overall conclusion on the clinical value of probiotics. According to different meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, the use of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> (DSM 17938) was associated with a significant decrease in average crying time in infantile colic. There is moderate evidence for this strain and LGG and limited evidence (based on one study each) for the beneficial effect of VSL#3 and a three-strain bifidobacteria mix in abdominal pain FGIDs, particularly in the irritable bowel disease subgroup of children, but not in functional dyspepsia. There is currently no clear evidence of positive effects of oral probiotics in autistic spectrum disorder. Efficacy and safety of other strains or beneficial effects in other conditions still need to be proven, as probiotic properties are strain-specific, and data cannot be extrapolated to other brain-gut or mood diseases or to other probiotics of the same or different species. To transform the use of probiotics from a tempting suggestion to a promising treatment modality in neurogastroenterological disorders more accurate differentiation of the efficacy-proven strains, clarification of dose, duration, and outcome and a careful selection of the target patients are still necessary.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30198327/"}

While studying the Weir Mitchell papers (Philadelphia College of Physicians), the author came across an early report of the maneuver. The 531-word 1859 report, published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, was written by a pro tem reporter who observed Mitchell's demonstration of the phenomenon. The other attendees, including Dr. William Hammond, were so well aware of the phenomena that Dr. Mitchell \"did not consider it necessary to describe them more fully.\" Mitchell viewed the response as muscular in nature and the relationship between this response and disease was not explored in the report. This 1859 report preceded the Erb and Westphal publications by nearly two decades. It is perhaps the first concrete proof that neurologists were observing this phenomenon as early as the mid-1800s. Mitchell viewed the phenomenon as a local muscle response. While the concepts that later allowed Erb to correctly interpret the phenomenon as a reflex arc were already in place, Mitchell did not synthesize these concepts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18347320/"}

We propose an integrative framework to explain neuro-cardiac interactions in health and disease, with a focus on clinical applications and emerging therapies. The neuro-cardiac axis comprises hierarchical neural networks, from the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to subcortical and cortical brain regions. This structure underlies a range of clinical syndromes. Acute brain injuries can induce cardiac dysfunction via autonomic dysregulation, as seen in neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM), while cardiac disease contributes to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and cognitive decline. Cardioception-the brain's processing of cardiac signals-is increasingly recognized as a key mediator of autonomic control and emotional experience. Clinical trials highlight the value of targeted interventions, including extended cardiac monitoring to detect occult atrial fibrillation, improved risk stratification for managing patent foramen ovale, and intensive vascular risk control for cerebrovascular protection. Growing awareness of neuro-cardiac pathways is reshaping clinical care. Understanding how brain insults provoke cardiac dysfunction via disrupted autonomic outflow is critical, particularly in NSM. Meanwhile, cardioception is gaining relevance as a therapeutic target in the regulation of emotions and the autonomic nervous system. Conversely, cardiac pathology promotes stroke, CSVD, and cognitive impairment not only through embolism but also through altered perfusion and autonomic imbalance. Comprehensive management of modifiable vascular risks confers dual protection for the heart and brain. Interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly vital for managing disorders along the heart-brain continuum. Translating insights from neurocardiac mechanisms into precision therapies marks a new frontier. Advances in neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and neuromodulation offer opportunities for personalized care. The ongoing development of cross-specialty training and integrated research platforms will be essential for translating scientific progress into improved outcomes in neurocardiac disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40810888/"}

Pressure ulcers have accompanied humans since the beginning and respective descriptions are found in the 19th century literature. Pressure ulcer is a major medical, social and health-economic problem because it is associated with a number of complications that require multidisciplinary approach in care and treatment. In affected patients, pressure ulcer causes quality of life reduction, discomforts, pain, emotional problems and social isolation. If the process of tissue decay is not halted, tissue damage will spread involving deep and wider structures, thus seriously compromising the patient general condition. Pressure ulcer usually develops at the sites of protrusions formed by lumbar spine, ischium, hip, ankle, knee or elbow, as well as in the areas with less developed adipose tissue. Any temporary or permanent immobility should be perceived as a milieu favoring the onset of pressure ulcer. Advances in medicine and standards of living in general have prolonged life expectancy, thus also increasing the population at risk of chronic diseases including pressure ulcer. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the length of bed-ridden condition and the occurrence of pressure ulcers in patients treated at Department of Cerebrovascular Diseases and Intensive Neurology from January 1, 2012 until December 31, 2015. The study included patients with pressure ulcer verified on admission and those having developed pressure ulcer during hospital stay. Clinical picture of severe stroke predominated in the majority of study patients. Patients were divided into groups according to health care requirements as classified by the Croatian Chamber of Nurses. Preliminary results indicated the length of bed-ridden condition to be associated with the occurrence of chronic wounds, and thus with increased cost and length of hospital treatment. Therefore, health care methods and procedures should be focused on reduction of pressure ulcer development, quality health care, implementation of preventive measures, and continuous education of health care professionals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29087649/"}

Survey data was collected from attendees at a national educational conference and at a large academic medical school. Two proportion z-tests were used to assess responses among students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. 199 students participated in the survey. Compared to their Asian and White counterparts, Black students were significantly less likely to choose or consider a career in Neurology. In addition, we found that these students relied more heavily on their pre-clinical experiences to make this determination, citing preference for another specialty, lack of exposure, a preference for a different patient population, and a lack of racial/ethnic diversity as key reasons to not choose a career in Neurology. Neurological disorders are important contributors to morbidity and mortality. It is imperative that the field attract medical students toward careers in Neurology, particularly those students from traditionally and persistently underrepresented backgrounds. Our findings suggest that Black medical students consider Neurology as a specialty choice less frequently than their counterparts do, and this decision may be made prior to training. We conclude that a multifaceted approach is best to improve the racial/ethnic diversity within the neurological workforce, which should include targeted interventions prior to and after matriculation to medical school.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34311968/"}

Chronic disease management programmes allow seamless care provision across a spectrum of healthcare facilities and allow appropriate services to be brought to the stroke patient and the family. Randomised controlled trials have provided evidence for efficacious interventions. After the management of acute stroke in a stroke unit, most stable stroke patients can be sent to their family physician for continued treatment and rehabilitation supervision. Disabled stroke survivors may need added home-based services. Suitable community resources will need to be harnessed. Clinic-based stroke nurses may enhance service provision and coordination. Close collaboration between the specialist and family physician would be needed to right-site patients and also allow referrals in either direction where necessary. Barriers to integration can be surmounted by trust and improved communication. Audits would allow monitoring of care provision and quality care enhancement. The Wagner model of chronic care delivery involves self-management support, shared clinical information systems, delivery system redesign, decision support, healthcare organisation and community resources.

Exactly 36 (49%) out of the 73 evaluated patients were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and 11 were deemed eligible for treatment with i.v. tPA by the stroke neurologist. Agreement with the stroke neurologist for rt-PA eligibility was 93% [95% CI: 84%, 98%] (sensitivity = 82% [48%, 98%], PPV = 82% [48%, 99%]) for the ED attendings, 79% [65%, 90%] (sensitivity = 75% [35%, 97%], PPV = 43% [18% 71%]) for the ED residents, and 84% [73%, 92%] (sensitivity = 100% [74%, 100%], PPV = 52% [31%, 73%]) for the neurology residents. There were two false positive cases identified by ED attendings, eight, by ED residents, and 11 by neurology residents.

OCD can have an enormous impact on the lives of those with the disorder, with some studies suggesting suicidal ideation is present in over 50% of individuals with OCD, and other data showing a significant number of individuals attempt suicide. It is therefore important that individuals with OCD receive the best possible treatment. A greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders among professionals and future clinicians can lead to improved treatment. However, data suggests that many students and clinicians experience \"neurophobia\", a lack of knowledge or confidence in cases involving the nervous system. In addition, research suggests that the relationship many students have with neurological conditions deteriorates over time, and can persist into practice.If individuals living with conditions such as OCD are to receive the best possible treatment, it is crucial that those administering care are equipped with a thorough understanding of such disorders. While research has shown that the use of interactive 3D models can improve anatomy education and more specifically neurology education, the efficacy of using of such models to engage with neuropsychiatric conditions, specifically OCD, has not been assessed. This study seeks to address this gap.In this study an interactive application for Android devices was designed using standardised software engineering methods in order to improve neuropsychiatry literacy by empowering self-pace learning through interactive 3D visualisations and animations of the neural circuitry involved in OCD. A pilot test and a usability assessment were conducted among five postgraduate life science students. Findings relating to user experience were promising, and pre-test vs. post-test evaluation suggested encouraging outcomes regarding the effectiveness of the application in improving the knowledge and understanding of OCD. In short, this study suggests that interactive 3D visualisations can improve neuropsychiatry education. For this reason, more efforts should be made to construct similar applications in order to ensure patients always receive the best possible care.

We review as well the milestones in his scientific work. His arrival in 1862 at the Salpêtrière which he would never leave; there in 1866, he started a \"free\" course which became the point of departure for his reputation. Taking advantage of histology together with a mastery of the anatomical-clinical method permitted him to achieve considerable progress with a few years (associating locomotor ataxia with lesions of the posterior roots and columns; acute and chronic progressive muscular atrophy with those of the anterior horn: separating multiple sclerosis from Parkinson's disease) which culminated in the masterful description of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1874), the pathological anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord (1873) and cerebral localisations of motor areas (1875). Beginning in 1878, he applied the nosological method to the study of hysteria, relying on the notion of \"analogous anatomy\" in seeking a correspondence between organic lesions and \"dynamic lesions\". In 1883 and 1884, his approach to aphasia led him to introduce beyond the anatomical-clinical fact a new speculative dimension, that of psycho-physiology. This he applied to interpret hysterical ailments and \"psychic paralyses\". The personality of Charcot is briefly sketched.

However, the extent of their adoption, and any differences or similarities across European communities, remain to be established. Members of the Czech and Slovak Neurological Societies were invited via e-mail to participate in a 14- -item web-based survey investigating their approach to FND.

Similarities were found between CZ- -SK and Italian neurologists in their preference for the term 'FND' over other psychological-related terms and in explaining symptoms as due to abnormal functioning of the nervous system rather than attributing them to mental illness. However, only fewer than 5% in both groups thought that simulation was highly unlikely. Both groups reported relying on positive signs (e.g. inconsistency, distractibility) according to the current diagnostic criteria, but also a tendency to perform additional tests to exclude other causes. However, some differences were observed: Italian neurologists placed a greater emphasis on psychological factors including litigation. CZ-SK neurologists were more likely to suggest physiotherapy as a treatment option and to provide educational intervention for patients and their relatives. Overall, our findings suggest that although Czech, Slovak, and Italian neurologists have adopted some new developments in the field of FND, significant gaps still exist in their understanding and common practices regarding conceptualisation, diagnosis, and treatment. Our results suggest that promoting knowledge through postgraduate curricula and teaching courses for neurologists is necessary to optimise patient management in various European countries.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38916493/"}

The diagnosis of primary headaches is exclusively a clinical task but, for this reason, it is sometimes subjective and arbitrary. However, until today no single diagnostic tool is able to define, ensure or differentiate idiopathic headache syndromes, although, in the clinical setting, conventional neuroimaging techniques are often widely and improperly used in headache patients. Recent years have seen rapid growth of neuroimaging methodology which has provided new insights into functional brain organization of migraine patients. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging has today little or no value in clinical practice, clinicians role is crucial since without a proper clinical selection neuroimaging studies could generate inconclusive results. Likewise, functional neuroimaging is crucial for clinicians in order to further elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this complex and often disabling disease and to provide new therapeutical approaches for migraine patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22644179/"}

This can have significant implications on patient care, especially given the increasing burden of chronic neurological disorders. The negative perception and lack of confidence amongst general practitioners and hospital physicians may lead to increased referrals to neurology, thereby increasing waiting times and inpatient stay. The onus, therefore, should be on improving training and stimulating interest in neurology. There is emerging evidence that integrating e-learning to traditional pedagogies can improve delivery of neurology education and help combat neurophobia. However, embracing e-learning may be challenging for contemporary neurologists, mostly 'digital immigrants', involved in the training of tomorrow's doctors who are largely 'digital natives'.

These conditions include the autistic spectrum disorders and attention deficit disorder. The dramatic advances in neural imaging and genetics in helping to explain different pediatric neurological conditions are also discussed as well as concepts and understanding concerning recovery from brain damage. The changing epidemiology of neurodisability through effective advances in acute neonatal and pediatric medical care, screening programs and social interventions are also related.

As a research member of Inserm (French Institute for Medical Research), she soon joined the team of Carlton Gajdusek (the NINCDS - National Institute of Nervous Central System and Stroke - of NIH), who first demonstrated the transmissibility of kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to monkeys. When she came back to Paris, where she was followed by one of NIH members, Paul Brown, she joined the Centre de Recherches du Service de Santé des Armées (Army Health Research Center), in Percy-Clamart, where she found the experimental design and the attentive help needed for her research, which appeared heretical to many French virologists, including some authorities. A large number of research programs were set up with numerous collaborations involving CEA (Center for Atomic Energy) and other institutions in Paris and Marseilles on epidemiology, results of tissue inoculation, electrophysiology and neuropathology of human and animal prions diseases, and resistance of the infectious agent. International symposia were set up, where met, in the Val-de-Grâce hospital in Paris, the research community on \"slow viral diseases\". Stanley Prusiner introduced the concept - then badly accepted and still in evolution - of prion, a protein only infectious agent. Before retiring from Inserm, Françoise Cathala predicted and was involved in some of the huge sanitary crises in France. These were, first, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from contaminated growth hormone extracted from cadavers, which led parents to instigate legal procedure - a quite unusual practice in France. The second was Mad cow disease in the United Kingdom then in France, followed by new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob human epidemics, paradigmatic food safety crisis bringing together the poles of production (beef and meat-and-bone meal) and consumption, and leading to an unexpected social bang.

Here, we explore the history and current focus of a newly emerging field called neuroethics and explore its relationship (or lack thereof) to a newly created clinical syndrome called involuntary emotional expressive disorder (IEED). The main argument concerns the lack of neuroethical discussion of issues pertinent to social influences on disease and the construction of professional specialization. We are critical of the processes associated with the creation of both the field and the syndrome, and express concern about their eventual outcomes. The interaction of social, political, and business institutions, the inherent interests of the advancement of larger research projects (and the individuals that compose them), their potential for profit, and other incentives to enhance marketability and public attention toward certain research programs will be examined as we discuss the development of the field of neuroethics. Similarly, we argue that these social factors and forces are instrumental in the development of IEED as a recognizable category and condition.

Building local training opportunities in resource-limited settings is a foundational step to enhancing the neurological workforce and improving access to neurological care in these regions. In this article, we describe the development and growth of the first neurology residency program in East Africa, which was established in 2006 at Zewditu Memorial Hospital and the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. We highlight the impact of the program on clinical care, research, collaborations between neurologists across Ethiopia, and ways to build educational opportunities and mentorship while faced with limited resources. The main challenges in starting the residency program included lack of faculty with neurological expertise, lack of a precedent for subspecialty training in our setting, as well as limited resources and space. The formation of sustainable international collaborations with clinicians at established institutions in high-income countries and neurological societies has been a major source of support in developing the initial infrastructure, curriculum and educational content, knowledge assessments, and mentored research projects. Local partnerships with related medical specialties, including internal medicine, critical care, neurological surgery, and psychiatry, were also instrumental in creating training opportunities. As the program continues to evolve, many challenges remain, including limited diagnostics, lack of access to advanced treatment modalities, lack of fellowship training opportunities in various neurological subspecialties, and insufficient training and experience in scientific writing. Despite these challenges, the residency program has persevered and its creation resulted in many positive changes: since its inception in 2006, we graduated 80 neurologists and the number of practicing neurologists in Ethiopia has increased from 5 to 78, our institution has evolved into a national referral center for neurology, graduates have published 61 articles in the past 3 years and contributed to international neurology research, and alumni of the program have grown the Association of Ethiopian Neurologists.

The author presents a brief historical overview of developments in neurology and psychiatry from the late 19th century. The histories of research and prevailing scientific opinion on two neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease and Tourette's syndrome, are compared to illustrate the effects of viewing a disease process from, respectively, the neurologic/organic and psychiatric/functional perspectives. Research on Alzheimer's disease, because of its early pathologic demonstration, moved rapidly toward identification of associated synaptic abnormalities and genetic mutations. In Tourette's syndrome, the absence of evident brain pathology resulted in vacillation between organic and functional explanations and persistent controversy about the nature of the illness. Neurology and psychiatry have, for much of the past century, been separated by an artificial wall created by the divergence of their philosophical approaches and research and treatment methods. Scientific advances in recent decades have made it clear that this separation is arbitrary and counterproductive. Neurologic and psychiatric research are moving closer together in the tools they use, the questions they ask, and the theoretical frameworks they employ. The interests of neurology and psychiatry converge within the framework of modern neuroscience.

In cerebrovascular disease, it is important to highlight that patients with stroke are those with the highest rates of cerebral reinfarction and also show the highest combined rate of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Special care must be taken in patients who have had a transient ischemic attack since these patients accumulate a number of vascular risk factors. Data from the REACH registry suggest that preventive treatment and control of vascular risk factors could be improved, especially control of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Consequently, preventive measures should be intensified in these patients to achieve adequate control of risk factors through encouraging healthy lifestyle habits, appropriate use of drugs and treatment adherence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19631836/"}

In the past, the delay in scientific communication was the main explanation presented for the lack of understanding of clinical pictures of unknown nosographic origin. The history of medicine provides excellent examples of this dispersion of human capital, even if the history of clinical neurology presents \"exceptions\" (the pictures that we now call de la Tourette's syndrome and Parkinson's disease) that indicate that major clinical syndromes could be clearly detected and relatively rapidly diffused even in the 19th century. Contrary to the past, the delay in scientific communication no longer seems an obstacle to the sharing of medical knowledge. Nevertheless, the problem of the in-depth comprehension of clinical pictures of unknown nosographic origin still remains dominant, mainly because of the limited spread of ample and flexible online accessible databases of unknown nosographic origin clinical syndromes.

However, Hitler never received the mixture, this implies that the SS intended to remove the severely diseased 'Leader'. Two different character traits can be analysed in Hitler's personality: on the one hand the typical premorbid personality of parkinsonian patients with uncorrectable mental rigidity, extreme inflexibility and insupportable pedantry. On the other an antisocial personality disorder with lack of ethical and social values, a deeply rooted tendency to betray others and to deceive himself and uncontrollable emotional reactions. This special combination in Hitler's personality resulted in the uncritical conviction of his mission and an enormous driving for recognition.

The survey compared experiences using the supervisory methods of telephone, robotic telepresence (RTP), and in-person interaction. Participants answered 10 questions addressing their experience relevant to faculty-trainee interaction quality and clinical supervision, achieved with the three supervisory methods under study. Surveys were received from 20 of 36 trainees (56%) and 8 of 10 faculty members (80%). More than 90% of trainees and faculty strongly agreed that in-person communication was satisfactory for patient data review, problem synthesis, and refinement of the trainees' impressions, with RTP ranking a close second. Moreover, 38% of faculty and 70% of trainees reported the telephone method as unsatisfactory for reacquisition of patient history, data synthesis, and direct observation of trainees' clinical skills. RTP provided more than 90% of trainees with sufficient staff support and facilitated trainee autonomy. Overall, 85% of both trainees and faculty preferred in-person supervision most, with RTP ranked second and telephone being least favored. Although in-person faculty supervision of trainees' management of neurologic emergencies is always preferred, it is not always practical.

In the course of time ideas about the aetiology of hysteria were adjusted twice. The clinical symptoms also underwent a metamorphosis and over the years different interpretations of hysteria were accepted by other groups as well. Up till 1870 hysteria had been regarded as a gynaecological illness that affected almost exclusively women; as a result of Charcot's work the illness was transformed into a neurological disorder. However, shortly before his death Charcot had to acknowledge that he had been mistaken and that hysteria was in fact a psychiatric disorder. The course of the 19th century nervous disorder ran parallel to Charcot's medical career. After 1885 both had passed their peak.

Over nearly all the subsequent centuries the popular belief has been that epilepsy is a disorder of supernatural origin, and to some extent such ideas have carried over into medical thought. In Western civilisation, the long dominant belief was that epilepsy was due to possession by a devil or a demon, an interpretation given authoritative support by the miracle story of the cure of the epileptic child which is recorded in all three synoptic Gospels. However, there have been many other interpretations e.g. epilepsy as a consequence of wrong doing or of lunar or magical influences. Such ideas began to die out only in the past 200 years. From Hippocrates (c. 400 BC) onwards, there has been a continuing line of thought that considered epilepsy a medical condition due to natural causes. The hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis have ranged from excess phlegm in the brain, through boiling up of the vital spirits in the brain (Paracelsus), explosion of the animal spirits in the centre of the brain (Willis), heightened reflex activity at a spinal (Marshall Hall) or medullary level (Brown Séquard), to Hughlings Jackson's notion of an occasional, an excessive, and a disorderly discharge' in part of the cerebral cortex.

It is generally divided into pre-graduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education, with the physician as the main target.

Neurology is a large field in medical science, focusing on diseases of the brain, the spinal cord, the peripheral nerves and muscles. They tend to be chronic and, often progressive, leading to long-term disability and handicap for the individual, frequently associated with personal, social and emotional consequences. In the time span of a patient with a neurological disease, interaction with physicians is important and often vital, but interaction with other health groups and relatives or other caregivers is longer and more intensive. The knowledge and experience of the patient and caregiver is equally important, in that an informed patient or caregiver is more likely to participate actively and be of greater benefit in disease management. This paper promotes the concept that education in neurology should be integrated to include the physicians and other professionals as well as patients, caregivers and public.

Finkelnburg addressed the Society of the Lower Rhine in Bonn on the popular topic of aphasia. He challenged the prevailing view that aphasia was a disorder of speech only and the emphasis that had been given to the issue of cerebral localization. The disorder, he pointed out, not only extended beyond the speech modality to include verbal comprehension, reading, and writing but also included many extraverbal disturbances of symbolic usage. In support of his argument, he presented five detailed case studies of aphasics (two with autopsy data) who demonstrated a variety of verbal and extraverbal deficits. Because the term aphasia referred specifically to speech disturbance and inadequately signified the full extent of the disorder, Finkelnburg proposed the more generic term asymbolia as a more accurate representation of the nature of the disorder. This translation makes available a previously inaccessible but historically important and still viable contribution to the study of the nature of aphasia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/388077/"}

Electroencephalogram is increasingly used for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment decisions in critically ill patients with neurologic and nonneurologic disorders. Continuous EEG monitoring has an expanded role in the intensive care unit as an additional evaluation tool for critically ill patients with altered mental status. During a neurosurgical intensive care rotation, pulmonary critical care fellows participated in an EEG curriculum covering didactics, clinical exposure, and EEG interpretations. Using 25-question evaluation tools, including EEG interpretations, participants were assessed before EEG instruction and after curriculum completion. Nine fellows completed the pilot study. Evaluation scores increased from 7.56±2.24 to 16.67±2.96 (P<.001). An interdisciplinary approach was effective for increasing EEG knowledge in critical care fellows as measured by the assessment tools. As an added potential benefit, the pulmonary fellows also learned about sleep disorder-related EEG. This model can be replicated in other institutions for trainees of other specialties interested in critical care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25056845/"}

There was no indication in the analysis or interpretation that age was thought to play a role in the signs or symptoms displayed, or in the prognosis. The role of age in the manifestation of language disorders only became explicit in the late 19th century in the elaboration of ideas regarding perinatal illnesses, developmental difficulties, and the emerging clinical category of \"cerebral palsy\" as evinced in the work of Bastian, Osler, Sachs and Peterson, and Freud. Their patient series studies afforded the opportunity to identify relations between age at symptom onset and patterns of language acquisition and impairment. These analyses contributed directly to the elaboration of hypotheses regarding localization of function, hemispheric specialization, and patterns of recovery. The factor of \"age at symptom onset\" would steadily assume even greater theoretical importance, as explanations of patterns of symptom co-occurrence, etiology, and prognosis were elaborated through the increasing appreciation of a developmental/maturational perspective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19892155/"}

For this reason, the Spanish Ministry of Health approved the Stroke National Strategy (SNS) in 2008 to improve the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of stroke patients. This plan intends to guarantee 24-hour, 365-days neurological assistance in the whole country by the end of 2010. Our aim was to analyse the situation of stroke assistance in Spain in 2009. A committee of neurologists practicing in the different autonomous communities (AC), and who had not participated in the preparation of the SNS, was created. A national survey was performed including the number of stroke units (SU) and their characteristics (monitoring, 24-h/7-day on-call neurology service, nursing staff ratio and the use of protocols), bed ratio of SU/100,000 people, availability of intravenous thrombolysis therapy, neurovascular intervention (NI) and telemedicine. We included data from 145 hospitals. There are 39 SU in Spain, unevenly distributed. The ratio between SU bed/number of people/AC varied from 1/75,000 to 1/1,037,000 inhabitants; Navarra and Cantabria met the goal. Intravenous thrombolysis therapy is used in 80 hospitals; the number of treatments per AC was between 7 and 536 in 2008. NI was performed in the 63% of the AC, with a total of 28 qualified hospitals (although only 1 hospital performed it 24h, 7 days a week in 2009). There were 3 hospitals offering clinical telemedicine services. Assistance for stroke patients has improved in Spain compared to previous years, but there are still some important differences between the AC that must be eliminated to achieve the objectives of the SNS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21440962/"}

Continuous EEG video telemetry monitoring has an established role in the diagnosis of non-epileptic pseudo-seizures and in localizing the seizure focus for epilepsy surgery.

A student of Pierre Bretonneau (1778-1862), the famous physician from the western French city of Tours, Trousseau carried forward Bretonneau's clinical description of infectious diseases, developing the notion of their contagion and paving the way toward the discovery of their microbial aetiology by Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) at the end of the century. His teachings, Les Leçons cliniques de l'Hôtel-Dieu, transcribed by his students, played a role in training young physicians for half a century. In this work, Trousseau covered several neurological diseases such as apoplexy, epilepsy, chorea, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The rich, Balzac-like detail of his clinical pictures would be unthinkable today. While he cannot be credited with any seminal descriptions in particular, some of his observations contain significant nuggets, such as a case of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, twenty years before the seminal publication. After a biographical account, we will present the main lessons given by Trousseau on neurological subjects. One of Trousseau's little-known contributions is to have invited Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875) to his department at the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, setting Duchenne on the path to becoming a pioneer of Parisian neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31924312/"}

The year 1995 is the bicentennial anniversary of his birth. Hiroshi Kawahara was born at Ohmura, Nagasaki, in 1865. His medical studies were pursued at the University of Tokyo under the guidance of Prof. Elwin von Baelz. He was the first neurologist in Japan, to give particular attention to the neurological diseases. In 1897, Kawahara described two brother cases belonging to a family suffering from muscle atrophy, and characterized it as having sex-linked recessive inheritance, adult onset, prominent fasciculation of the tongue and four limbs, and relatively benign course of illness. The Kawahara's paper on this familial disease later known as \"bulbo-spinal muscle atrophy\" or \"Kennedy-Alter-Sung disease\" is the first description in the world.

Treatment plans tend to focus on the disease rather than the individual living with it, and patients are often not involved in clinical decision making. By use of Parkinson's disease as a model condition, we show an integrated care concept with a patient-centred perspective that includes evidence-based solutions to improve health-care delivery for people with chronic neurological conditions.

Moreover, previous studies have stated that the placebo response is greater in pediatric patients than in adults and that a reduction in the attack frequency in the absence of any pharmacological treatment is observed more frequently in pediatric migraine patients than in adults. Besides these preliminary considerations, the shorter duration of migraine attacks and other characteristic semeiological features of the clinical picture in children are such that the design of randomized controlled trial (RCT) is more problematic in the developmental age than in the adult.

This modernisation of sexuality was closely linked to the recognition of sexual diversity, as it was articulated in the medical-psychiatric understanding of what, at that time, was labelled as perversion. From around 1870, psychiatrists shifted the focus from immoral acts, a temporary deviation of the norm, to an innate morbid condition. In the late nineteenth century, several psychiatrists, collecting and publishing more and more case histories, classified and explained the wide range of deviant sexual behaviours they traced. The emergence of medical sexology meant that perversions could be diagnosed and discussed. Against this background both Krafft-Ebing and Moll articulated a new perspective, not only on perversion, but also on sexuality in general. Krafft-Ebing initiated and Moll elaborated a shift from a psychiatric perspective in which deviant sexuality was explained as a derived, episodic and more or less singular symptom of a more fundamental mental disorder, to a consideration of perversion as an integral part of a more general, autonomous and continuous sexual instinct. Before Sigmund Freud and others had expressed similar views, it was primarily through the writings of Krafft-Ebing and Moll that a new understanding of human sexuality emerged.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23002290/"}

Basic to these assertions is the assumption that information gained from such research can be extrapolated to \"analogous\" human conditions. Analogies may involve modeling at levels of bio-organization from molecules to the behaviour of the total, integrated organism: toxicity of exposure to a chemical varies with the structure(s) or function(s) modeled. Important decisions by regulators are always influenced by trade-offs between biological limitations and social cost-benefits, much information about the former coming from research on animals. This places great importance on the validities of extrapolations from the animal data, which may be expected to satisfy a hierarchy of five criteria. These range from evidence of superficial similarity (\"face validity\") to demonstration that knowledge obtained from the model is related to predictable outcomes in humans (\"predictive validity\"). Given the nature of the problems to be solved, which drastically limits the use of humans as subjects, animal models play essential roles in the biomedical sciences and technologies provided that due precautions are taken in creating models and in generalizing from them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2052201/"}

Dr. Bielschowsky was one of the founders of neuro-ophthalmology. This review, with biographical notes, is presented in his honor. Dr. Bielschowsky and the author had similar disruptive experiences, of historic interest, during the Hitler regime in Nazi Germany. Professor Bielschowsky's legacy begins with his contributions to ocular physiology. For instance, his after-image test establishes the presence of retinal correspondence, important for stereoscopic vision. Alfred Bielschowsky taught how an ocular examination is critical for neuro-ophthalmologic diagnosis, localization, prognostication, and treatment. Much of our knowledge is linked with his name. Examples include \"Bielschowsky's Phenomenon\", explaining dissociated vertical movements, and \"Bielschowsky's Doll's Head Phenomenon\" (Doll's Eyes), describing proprioceptive reflexes important for localizing intracranial lesions. Dr. Bielschowsky emphasized many pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of oculomotor anomalies. For example, he cautioned against mistaking the compensatory head position in congenital fourth cranial nerve paresis for neck muscle disease. Dr. Bielschowsky's emphasis on the clinical examination remains critical despite today's advanced diagnostic equipment. His legacy is the application of physiology to patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9736210/"}

The approaches to translational genomics can be broadly grouped into two methodologies, forward and reverse genomic translation. Traditional (forward) genomic translation begins with model systems and aims at using unbiased genetic associations in these models to derive insight into biological mechanisms that may also be relevant in human disease. Reverse genomic translation begins with observations made through human genomic studies and refines these observations through follow-up studies using model systems. The ultimate goal of these approaches is to clarify intervenable processes as targets for therapeutic development. In this review, we describe some of the approaches being taken to apply translational genomics to the study of diseases commonly encountered in the neurocritical care setting, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and status epilepticus, utilizing both forward and reverse genomic translational techniques. Further, we highlight approaches in the field that could be applied in neurocritical care to improve our ability to identify new treatment modalities as well as to provide important information to patients about risk and prognosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32080794/"}

Désiré Bourneville had triggered Charcot's interest in hysteria during his stay as an <i>interne</i> in his department, while Charles Richet's 1875 article on somnambulism was the trigger for Charcot to develop hypnotism. Charcot's collaborators Paul Richer, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, Paul Sollier, Joseph Babinski, Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet subsequently became most famous in hysteria. In 1908, a \"quarrel of hysteria\" opposed several of Charcot's pupils, from which Babinski, who had developed the concept of \"pithiatism\", was considered victorious against Charcot's first successor Fulgence Raymond. There was a surge of interest in hysteria associated with war psycho-neuroses in 1914-1918, and Babinski's pupil Clovis Vincent developed a treatment called <i>torpillage</i> (torpedoing) against war hysteria, associating painful galvanic current discharges with \"persuasion\". After World War I, the neurological and psychiatric interest in hysteria again faded away, before a renewed interest at the turn of the last century. Contrary to a common view, the modernity of several of Charcot's concepts in hysteria is remarkable, still today, mainly for: (1) his traumatic theory, which encompassed psychological and certain sexual factors several years before Freud; (2) his personal evolution towards the role of emotional factors, which opened the way to Janet and Freud; (3) his claim of specific differences vs. similarities in mental states such as hypnotism, hysteria, and simulation, which has recently been confirmed by functional imaging; and (4) his \"dynamic lesion\" theory, which now correlates well with recently established neurophysiological mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32500757/"}

He studied medicine in Paris and became a physician in 1831. He practiced general medicine in his native town for about 11 years and then returned to Paris to initiate pioneering studies on electrical stimulation of muscles. Duchenne used electricity not only as a therapeutic agent, as it was commonly the case earlier in the 19th century, but chiefly as a physiological investigation tool to study the anatomy of the living body. Without formal appointment he visited hospital wards across Paris searching for rare cases of neuromuscular disorders. He built a portable electrical device that he used to functionally map all bodily muscles and to study their coordinating action in health and disease. He gave accurate descriptions of many neuromuscular disorders, including pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy to which his name is still attached (Duchenne muscular dystrophy). He also invented a needle system (Duchenne's histological harpoon) for percutaneous sampling of muscular tissue without anesthesia, a forerunner of today's biopsy. Duchenne summarized his work in two major treatises entitled De l'électrisation localisée (1855) and Physiologie des mouvements (1867). Duchenne's iconographic work stands at the crossroads of three major discoveries of the 19th century: electricity, physiology and photography. This is best exemplified by his investigation of the mechanisms of human physiognomy in which he used localized faradic stimulation to reproduce various forms of human facial expression. The album that complements his book on this issue is considered a true incunabulum of photography. Duchenne de Boulogne, a shy but hard-working, acute and ingenious observer, became one of most original clinicians of the 19th century.

His impact on the development of knowledge on migraine has likewise been pointed to. This study compares the monograph published by Möbius on the illness in 1894 with contemporary publications and with present day best practice to establish if the author really made an essential contribution to the problem of migraine. As a representative of the central theory Möbius assumed that migraine was caused by aberrations in the brain. At the same time he made it clear that due to very limited diagnostic options this was only a hypothesis. Apart from a genetic factor and these cerebral changes, for Möbius the general state of health was a decisive factor and prevention and change in lifestyle therefore played a crucial role in his therapeutic recommendations. Basically there were only few differences between the views of Möbius and his colleagues, the major dissimilarity being that Möbius postulated a merely suggestive impact but no physical effect of electrotherapy. Although Möbius's monograph on migraine lacks originality, it provides a concise, easy to understand and stylistically impressive overview on the state of knowledge at that time. Therefore, the book can be considered as a benchmark publication of German speaking neurology around 1890 on migraine and it is highly recommended to present day headache and migraine researchers as well as historians of psychiatry and neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23836302/"}

After more than a century of both clinical and theoretical interest, the exact nature of such emotional disorders responsible for hysterical symptoms, and their functional consequences on neural systems in the brain, still remain largely unknown. However, several recent studies have used functional brain imaging techniques (such as EEG, fMRI, PET, or SPECT) in the attempt to identify specific neural correlates associated with hysterical conversion symptoms. This article presents a general overview of these findings and of previous neuropsychologically based accounts of hysteria. Functional neuroimaging has revealed selective decreases in the activity of frontal and subcortical circuits involved in motor control during hysterical paralysis, decreases in somatosensory cortices during hysterical anesthesia, or decreases in visual cortex during hysterical blindness. Such changes are usually not accompanied by any significant changes in elementary stages of sensory or motor processing as measured by evoked potentials, although some changes in later stages of integration (such as P300 responses) have been reported. On the other hand, several neuroimaging results have shown increased activation in limbic regions, such as cingulate or orbitofrontal cortex during conversion symptoms affecting different sensory or motor modalities. Taken together, these data generally do not support previous proposals that hysteria might involve an exclusion of sensorimotor representations from awareness through attentional processes. They rather seem to point to a modulation of such representations by primary affective or stress-related factors, perhaps involving primitive reflexive mechanisms of protection and alertness that are partly independent of conscious control, and mediated by dynamic modulatory interactions between limbic and sensorimotor networks. A better understanding of the neuropsychobiological bases of hysterical conversion disorder might therefore be obtained by future imaging studies that compare different conversion symptoms and employ functional connectivity analyses. This should not only lead to improve clinical management of these patients, but also provide new insights on the brain mechanisms of self-awareness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16186033/"}

Contrary to the commonly held view, and in spite of an established tradition concerning mental diseases, emerging neurology had a much stronger influence on psychiatry ('alienism') than the reverse. This was largely due to the school built up by Jean-Martin Charcot himself, which was organized around the study and management of hysteria. Although Charcot always claimed to be uninterested in mental medicine, he stimulated the development of an original scientific approach to nervous system conditions, based on Claude Bernard's method, along with structured academic teaching. Conversely, alienism paradoxically remained stuck in organicism, after Antoine Bayle's report in 1822 of 'arachnitis' as the substratum of general paresis of the insane. Contrary to alienism, the young neurological school was capable of self-criticism, and progressively highlighted mental factors in hysteria. This led to the paradox that neurologists were active in a disease with no organic cerebral lesion, while alienists were postulating brain lesions in all mental disorders. Pushed by Charcot, the academic evolution led to the launch of a faculty chair of mental and brain diseases in 1875, which was taken over for nearly half a century by his direct pupils Benjamin Ball, Alix Joffroy and Gilbert Ballet, who held the position until 1916, supporting the development of modern psychiatry in general hospitals, while alienism progressively disappeared at the turn of the century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20938143/"}

Flies continue to offer virtually unparalleled versatility and speed for genetic manipulation, strong genomic conservation, and a nervous system that recapitulates a range of cellular and network properties relevant to human disease. I focus here on four critical challenges emerging from recent advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of human neurologic disorders where innovative experimental strategies are urgently needed: (1) pinpointing causal genes from associated genomic loci; (2) confirming the functional impact of allelic variants; (3) elucidating nervous system roles for novel or poorly studied genes; and (4) probing network interactions within implicated regulatory pathways. Drosophila genetic approaches are ideally suited to address each of these potential translational roadblocks, and will therefore contribute to mechanistic insights and potential breakthrough therapies for complex genetic disorders in the coming years. Strategic collaboration between neurologists, human geneticists, and the Drosophila research community holds great promise to accelerate progress in the post-genomic era.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25814441/"}

This is a new situation for most stroke teams that often leads to uncertainty among physicians, nurses, and technicians who are in immediate contact with patients. The situation is made even more complicated by numerous new regulations and protocols that are released in rapid succession. Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols. One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them. It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation. We therefore strongly encourage other hospitals to adopt simulation training to prepare their medical teams for code strokes during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32432995/"}

The conflicts are examined from transcribed meeting debates (1949-1963), salient original publications (1949-1963), public addresses of protagonists touching on these issues (1971, 1984), and oral histories and less formal interviews of the protagonists and their associates (1979-2014). Contributing to these conflicts were contrasting personalities and outlooks on American neurology in the mid-twentieth century. Adams and Foley prevailed with their characterization of the neurologic and neuropathologic features of liver failure, whereas Baker triumphed with the need for and importance of an inclusive neurological society that would develop continuing medical education for neurologists at a national level, garner federal financial support for neurology training programs, and facilitate the development of neurology as a strong, independent medical discipline in the United States.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38621223/"}

No even reasonably satisfactory hypotheses about epileptogenesis were available till Marshall Hall (1790-1857), from 1836 onwards, popularised the concept of reflex action which had earlier been described by Robert Whytt (1714-1776) under the name 'sympathy'. Marshall Hall interpreted epilepsy as due to abnormal irritability in the afferent limb or central section of what later came to be called the reflex arc, loss of consciousness in the seizures being the result of secondary cerebral venous congestion. This concept of epileptogenesis was refined by Brown-Séquard, who in 1858 ascribed a more important role to overt or occult peripheral afferent nerve irritability, considered that the central element of the relevant reflex mechanism involved the medulla oblongata, and believed that reflex cerebral vasospasm, rather than cerebral venous congestion, caused loss of consciousness in the seizures. Almost contemporaneously, Schroeder van der Kolk placed considerably greater emphasis on the medullary element in causing the increased excitability of the reflex arc that produced epileptic seizures. These ideas of exaggerated reflex activity as the mechanism of epilepsy were made redundant by the work of Hughlings Jackson (1837-1911), who from 1860 onwards demonstrated that epilepsy arose in the cerebrum itself, rather than from altered function at lower levels of the nervous system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1343867/"}
{"id": "1449251", "title": "Neurological rehabilitation.", "text": "Increasingly, neurologists are participating in the rehabilitation of disorders of the nervous system. Compelling reasons why neurologists, especially those with academic interests, should become involved in rehabilitation include the opportunity to observe patients in the recovery phases of their illnesses and to study issues relating to functional recovery, exposure to patients (such as those with spinal cord injury) who are often not seen by neurologists in the acute phase, and the opportunity to help establish a scientific base for rehabilitation medicine. Many areas of investigation can contribute to the scientific basis of neurological rehabilitation. Among the most promising are regeneration in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems, adaptive mechanisms following CNS injury, computational neuroscience, neuromuscular physiology of chronic denervating conditions (e.g., the post-polio syndrome), and outcome studies of both physical and pharmacological therapeutic modalities.

Logistic regression was used to assess demographic characteristics and responses to training and career-related questions in association with specialty choice (intent to enter neurology). Of the 51,816 students with complete data, 1,456 (2.8%) indicated an intent to enter a neurology residency. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of entering neurology were a student's rating of excellent for their basic neuroscience course and neurology clerkship, participation in an MD/PhD program, majoring in neuroscience or psychology as an undergraduate, a selection response of \"content of the specialty was a strong influence on career choice,\" and indicating interest in neurology on the MSQ. Factors associated with a decreased likelihood of entering neurology were a higher-priority response on the GQ for salary, work/life balance, and personal fit of the specialty.

This article discusses whether these methods are ready to make their entrance into clinical practice. The underlying principles of classification will be explored, as well as the potential pitfalls. Strengths of machine learning methods are that they are unbiased and very sensitive to patterns emerging from small changes spread across a large number of variables. Potential pitfalls are that building reliable classifiers requires large amounts of well-selected data and extensive validation. Currently, machine learning classifiers offer neurologists a new diagnostic tool which can aid in the diagnosis of cases with a high degree of uncertainty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30073503/"}

The 431 Hippocratic case histories have been studied for reports and communication on the diagnostics, treatment and prognosis of single persons and groups of patients suffering from neurological and psychiatric diseases. In the 7 books of the Hippocratic Epidemics, a total of 128 patients with neurological and psychiatric symptoms are described. Epidemic fever and its variants were the leading predisposing conditions and the main symptoms were delirium, coma, insomnia, headache, speech disorders and convulsions. A number of patients with phrenitis and opisthotonos are also reported. The majority of the sick persons were male, were teenagers or adults and 47 of them are mentioned by name. The patient's information about the course is often just as informative as the doctor's observations. Treatment was limited to physical and dietary measures. The Hippocratic physician diagnosed and attempted to treat a large number of neurological and psychiatric diseases. The often almost continuous observations of the patients led to astonishingly precise predictions of the course and the prospects of recovery. Numerous symptoms described in the case studies, including carphologia and opisthotonus, have entered the neurological vocabulary. The retrospective etiological analysis of the reports leads to the almost explicit identification of neurosyphilis and encephalitis lethargica. The therapeutic measures described by the author were, as the changeable course of the diseases shows, only of limited effectiveness despite a very differentiated application over time, both against the underlying diseases and the neurological and psychiatric complications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937324/"}

Advances in medicine rest largely on the use of models of biological systems, including animal models. Model systems used by most biomedical scientists can be considered in four categories: theoretical, in vitro, nonmammalian and mammalian. Each category has advantages and limitations in describing the dynamic milieu of events that characterize human biologic response. Although individual models can be good predictors, multiple models are better than single models; the most critical drawback is lack of human information for comparison. The scientific community must improve the methodologies necessary to extrapolate data from the various model systems to the human, because these model systems are the foundation of discovery in biomedicine and the bedrock upon which to base valid risk assessments. It is vital that we communicate the importance of these techniques to the general public.

The education of medical students in the basic and clinical neurosciences must be integrated into a seamless curriculum over the four years of medical education. This education experience must be taught through a team approach and must be led by both a clinician and a basic scientist. All medical students must acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to perform an initial evaluation of the patient with a neurologic complaint. Finally, students must understand the role and recognize the importance of the neurologist and know when consultation is needed.

While psychiatry and neurology, both of which deal with brain diseases, have a historical standing as distinct disciplines, there has been an increasing need to have a combined neuropsychiatric approach to deal with many conditions and disorders. Additionally, there is a body of disorders and conditions that warrants the skills sets and knowledge bases of both disciplines. This is the territory covered by the subspecialty of Neuropsychiatry from a 'mental' health perspective and Behavioural Neurology from a 'brain' health perspective. This paper elaborates the neuropsychiatric approach to dealing with brain diseases, but also argues for the delineation of a neuropsychiatric territory. In the process, it describes a curriculum for the training of a neuropsychiatrist or a behavioural neurologist who is competent in providing a unified approach to the diagnosis and management of this set of conditions and disorders. The paper describes in some detail the objectives of training in neuropsychiatry and the key competencies that should be achieved in such higher training after a foundational training in psychiatry and neurology. While aiming for an internationally relevant training program, the paper acknowledges the local and regional differences in training expertise and requirements. It provides a common framework of training for both Neuropsychiatry and Behavioural Neurology, while accepting the differences in skills and emphasis that basic training in psychiatry or neurology will bring to the subspecialty training. The future of Neuropsychiatry (or Behavioural Neurology) as a discipline will be influenced by the successful adoption of such a unified training curriculum.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29037334/"}

American neurology was largely born during the Civil War through the work of S.W. Mitchell at Turner's Lane Hospital. With the closing of this military facility, the United States was left without an institution dedicated to neurologic research and the treatment of nervous system diseases. Nineteenth century archival data, including original Trustees' minutes, annual board of managers reports, patient case books, and published research from the Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital and Infirmary for Nervous Diseases were studied. The Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital and Infirmary for Nervous Diseases promoted the development of neurology in the United States through three main activities. First, it offered patients with primary nervous system diseases, arthritis, and orthopedic disorders specialized care that was unavailable at medical universities. Second, its medical staff, especially Mitchell, provided opportunities for advanced neurologic education. Postgraduate physicians interested in neurologic disease attended formal lectures and directly participated in the operation of outpatient clinics and inpatient rounds. Finally, its formalized record system in the form of case books facilitated neurologic research. These records formed the basis of landmark publications by Mitchell, Sinkler, Osler, and others on rest therapy, spastic palsies, chorea, and other topics. As America's first and comprehensive peacetime neurologic facility, the Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital and Infirmary for Nervous Diseases fostered the evolution of neurology as a separate, viable specialty in the post-Civil War period and provided a particular focus for the study of interactions among orthopedic, nutritional, and neurologic disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9633739/"}

These methods are also termed \"heroic\" medicine by modern medical historians. I analysed doctoral dissertations on the subject of NS diseases, clinical reports from 1806 to 1842 from the Vilnius University clinics, and other primary sources. This study was conducted in the vein of a historical-medical analysis and synthesis of primary sources, using comparative analysis, analogy, descriptive methods, and the method of retrospective diagnosis. Copious bloodletting, purgatives, leeches, cupping therapy, and other potentially harmful methods were frequently employed as habitual treatments for patients with NS diseases. Calomel was used as a purgative and an anti-inflammatory drug, and acidum borussicum was prescribed for patients with hydrophobia. After analysing three clinical cases, I revealed how principles of desperate, \"heroic\" medicine were applied to treat severe NS diseases with the \"strongest\" drugs, described in the scientific literature of the time. My work was not intended to judge or criticize historical treatment methods but to demonstrate on what contemporary scientific theories they were based.

After World War I, the increased need for differential diagnosis of what might now be called functional neurological disorders resulted in the military encouraging combined residency training in neurology and psychiatry and the promulgation of the term \"neuropsychiatry\" for this specialty. Thirty-six percent of physicians certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in its first decade (1935-1945) held certification in both neurology and psychiatry. However, the term neuropsychiatry gradually became used interchangeably with general psychiatry-to distinguish it from psychoanalysis-and lost its specificity. It is widely held that the popularity of psychoanalysis resulted in psychiatrists perceiving less need for neurological knowledge, and inclusion of neurology content in psychiatry training decreased. Dual residency training programs in neurology and psychiatry began to increase in popularity again in the 1980s as advances in neuroscience, neuroimaging, and pharmacology, paired with the growth of behavioral neurology, laid the foundation for meaningful practice of neuropsychiatry. The author surveyed 207 physicians who graduated from both a neurology and psychiatry residency and 18 current trainees in combined neuropsychiatry residency programs to collect information on their current practice, academic activity, and opinions about their training. The response rate was 64%. Respondents' attitudes toward the value of their dual neurology and psychiatry training were overwhelmingly positive.

Gall's phrenology and Vincenzo Malacarne's studies of encephalous anatomy and mental disorders, especially in the ideas developed by the latter from 1760 to 1794. Malacarne came to believe in those years that mental disorders were organic in nature, being exhibited through alterations in the endocranium organs that could be anatomically detected and diagnosed by studying the patient's cranium. His correspondence with Bonnet enabled Malacarne to anticipate Gall in positing that the faculties of the intellect are congenital and those of the endocranium are organs consisting of individual parts each of which controls a specific intellectual activity. This in turn strengthened Malacarrne's conviction that the cranium's structure matched the development of its parts and led him to invent the cephalometer. Thus convinced of the compound nature of the endocranium's organs, Malacarne went on to develop Bonnet's thesis whereby the peculiarity of the nerve cells and their interaction were assigned a central role in intellectual activities. Yet, despite the evident fact that Malacarne attributed to the cerebellum functions proper to the brain, the points at which his and Gall's ideas overlapped were such as to make ambiguous the former's violent polemics against the latter. Many of the cricticisms he directed at Gall seemed to be dictated by Malacarne's desire to side with Napoleon's and the Catholic Church's condemnation of the former. Others showed that Malacarne wove together personal motives, especially irritation over Gall's outright rejection of his Encefalotomia and scientifically well-grounded criticism of Gall's erroneous ideas concerning the substance of the cortex and the latter's links to nerves, to name the most prominent of many such errors. Even more damaging was Malacarne's unfounded allegation that Gall had less than a thorough grasp of anatomy in that it led the Italian medical establishment to view phrenology as a popular science for many decades thereafter.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11640160/"}

The epileptic was examined by Hippocrates, the first to recognize epilepsy as a disease and not as a supernatural manifestation called Morbus Sacer. The dark years of the Middle Ages were the worst for the disease, where the sufferer was even subjected to torture. The period of the Renaissance saw the epileptic isolated from society while the Enlightenment century improved the knowledge about the disease, thanks also to the first autopsies that showed post traumatic neurological lesions. However, some stigmata of the disease that prevented the marriage of epileptics persisted. It was the prelude to the years 1800-1900, characterized by Lombrosian concepts and Nazi convictions. Lombroso included epileptics among delinquents and criminals, identifying them as such on the basis of physical alterations. Nazi racism introduced the concept of eugenics excluding the epileptic from the so-called pure race. Today, epilepsy is considered a treatable neurological disorder. Morbus Sacer belongs to a remote past.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31897942/"}

This process is reflected in the numerous case report publications as well as in debates taking place at the Lisbon Society of Medical Sciences, the major scientific forum of that time. The 'Ajuda Paralyses' were a mysterious succession of epidemics that occurred during 1860-64 in the Ajuda asylum for cholera and yellow fever orphans, which were extensively discussed during 1865-66 by Bernardino Antonio Gomes, Antonio Maria Barbosa, Abel Jordão and Eduardo Motta. Studying this debate helps understand the initial stages of development and the great interest that 'nervous diseases' had for Portuguese clinicians in the mid-19th century and possibly provides one of the first modern descriptions of nutrition-related polyradiculoneuropathy and the ocular findings associated with avitaminosis A. This debate took place at a decisive time for the scientific development of neurology and psychiatry, concurrent with the widespread application of the clinical-anatomical method and neuropathology to the study of diseases of the nervous system, which would set the foundations for our own modern pathophysiological framework. Therefore, the 'Ajuda paralyses' debate also provides a good basis for a discussion on the evolution of the concepts of hysteria and psychosomatic disease and the description of peripheral neuropathy from among a wealth of other entities that did not withstand the test of science.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20719878/"}

Serial events that occur before one or multiple pregnancies impact successive generations. A maternal-child dyad history highlights this continuity of health risk, beginning with a maternal grandmother's pregnancy. Her daughter was born preterm and later experienced polycystic ovarian syndrome further complicated by cognitive and mental health disorders. Medical problems during her pregnancy contributed to MPF triad diseases that resulted in her son's extreme prematurity. Postpartum maternal death from the complications of diabetic ketoacidosis and her child's severe global neurodevelopmental delay were adverse mother-child outcomes. A horizontal/vertical diagnostic approach to reach shared clinical decisions during FNN training requires perspectives of a dynamic neural exposome. Career-long learning is then strengthened by continued interactions from al stakeholders. Developmental origins theory applied to neuroplasticity principles help interpret phenotypic expressions as dynamic gene-environment interactions across a person's lifetime. Debiasing strategies applied to the cognitive process reduce bias to preserve therapeutic and prognostic accuracy. Social determinants of health are essential components of this strategy to be initiated during FNN training. Reduction of the global burden of neurologic disorders requires applying the positive effects from reproductive and pregnancy exposomes that will benefit the neural exposome across the lifespan.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38658296/"}

After praising Aran's \"beautiful description\", G.B. Duchenne de Boulogne subsequently persisted in claiming paternity, untiringly referring to a memoir on \"muscular atrophy with fatty transformation\" said to have been submitted to the Académie des Sciences in 1849. There is no trace of this memoir, and while it is true that the \"localized electrisation\" technique was applied by Duchenne to all the patients in Aran's memoir, and that he was the sole author of two of his observations, it is Aran who must be credited with the clinical description, the synthetic presentation and the appellation of \"progressive muscular atrophy\". Initially, this term covered a number of disparate facts which were later identified and put in their proper nosological place, even though this dismemberment left standing what Charcot called \"Duchenne-Aran disease\" before the Aran-Duchenne denomination prevailed.

Development of neuroimaging led neurosurgeons to achieve tumorectomy according to the oncological limits provided by preoperative or intraoperative structural and metabolic imaging. However, this principle is not coherent, neither with the infiltrative nature of DLGGs nor with the limited resolution of current neuroimaging. Indeed, despite technical advances, MRI still underestimates the actual spatial extent of gliomas, since tumoral cells are present several millimeters to centimeters beyond the area of signal abnormalities. Furthermore, cortical and subcortical structures may be still crucial for brain functions despite their invasion by this diffuse tumoral disease. Finally, the lack of reliability of functional MRI has also been demonstrated. Therefore, to talk about \"maximal safe resection\" based upon neuroimaging is a non-sense, because oncological MRI does not show the tumor and functional MRI does not show critical neural pathways. This review proposes an original concept in neuro-oncological surgery, i.e. to resect DLGG to the boundaries of brain functions, thanks to intraoperative electrical mapping performed in awake patients. This paradigmatic shift from image-guided resection to functional mapping-guided resection, based upon an accurate study of brain connectomics and neuroplasticity in each patient throughout tumor removal has permitted to solve the classical dilemma, by increasing both survival and quality of life in DLGG patients. With this in mind, brain surgeons should also be neuroscientists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25907410/"}

Taking advantage of institutional reforms at the Salpêtrière-notably, the establishment of his professorship in nervous diseases-Charcot from the early 1880s focused his teaching increasingly on case histories of hysteria in male as well as female patients. Already renown for his earlier dramatic public lessons on female hysteria, his lessons of the 1880s, of which two volumes were published at the end of the decade, elaborated the issue of psychology in terms of altered states of patient's suggestibility. By the decade's end, Charcot's worldwide reputation rested on the prospects of this work as acknowledged by numerous students, notably medical psychologists Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. Yet Charcot's views remained sketchy. They were discussed at length in his unpublished notes for a lesson intended for May 1893, just a few months before his sudden death.

Charcot's work on hysteria and hypnosis, as well as Brown-Séquard's rejuvenation experiments with testicular extracts played an important role with this respect; (3) Charcot's relationship with the Daudets, in particular his treatment of Alphonse's tabes dorsalis and the ambivalent attitude of his son Léon Daudet towards Charcot; (4) the influence of the lectures at the Salpêtrière on the work of Guy de Maupassant, who attended the lessons in the mid-1880s.

Consumption of dietary toxins predominated at the beginning and gave birth to the geographic entity. The story moved from lathyrism through Jamaican neuropathy to cassava-induced epidemic neuropathy, which was contrasted with Konzo, also associated with cassava. Other tropical diseases enumerated with chronological details include: Chaga's diseases, kwashiorkor, Madras type of motor neuron disease, atlanto-axial dislocation, Burkitt's lymphoma and Kuru, associated with cannibalism among the Fore linguistic group in New Guinea. More recent documentation includes the Cuban neuropathy in 1991 with an epidemic of visual loss and neuropathy, Anaphe venata entomophagy in Nigeria presenting as seasonal ataxia, and neurological aspects of the human immunodeficiency virus infection complete the picture. With time, professional associations were formed and the pioneers were given prominence. The World Federation of Neurology featured Geographic Neurology as a theme in 1977 and Tropical Neurology was given prominence at its 1989 meeting in New Delhi, India. The situation remains unchanged with regards to rare diseases like Meniere's, multiple sclerosis, hereditary disorders. However, with westernization and continued urbanization, changing disease patterns are being observed and tropical neurology may depart from dietary toxins to more western world-type disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19892153/"}

Teleneurology is a part of Telemedicine which uses modern communication technologies to allow neurology to be practiced when the doctor and patient are not present in the same place, and possibly not at the same time. This study focuses on identifying regional spots as potential territorial stations for the telemedicine service through the GIS (Geographical Information System), a computerized systems that allows placement of data of different types and sources into one system to manage and form spatial relationships that allow the display and analysis of relationships of geographic, environmental, and population factors (Scholten & de Lepper, 1991). We analyzed the optimal location of territorial telemedicine spots in correspondence of general practitioner clinics. It could be intended as a way to involve general practitioners in the management of those patients. The aim of this study is to improve the quality of life of patients and their caregivers providing a continuity of care through this system that reduces the inconvenience of travel and related costs.

Many American opinion leaders in neurology hold to the maxim that the rising incidence and prevalence of AD in an aging population will create an increasing demand for the services of neurologists. With managed care on the march, however, a declining workload for practicing neurologists is far more likely, because until 2010 the number of neurologists will continue to expand more rapidly than the increasing burden of illness. Reform of medical education in support of the World Health Organization \"Health for All\" initiative can provide all physicians with a population-based perspective and a sense of social mission that encourages appropriate utilization of specialized resources and personnel. In the era of managed care, neurologic education should be broadened into the domain of mental illness to increase practice opportunities for graduating residents as behavioral neuroscientists. The capacity of AD referral centers to thrive in a cost-conscious managed care environment is crucially dependent on the ability and willingness of office-based neurologists with managed care contracts to make appropriate patient referrals to such centers. Neurologists who question the capacity of primary care physicians to provide the full range of specialized services should likewise question the quality of tertiary care carried out in a community framework of service provision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9674764/"}

There exists an abundant body of literature on Jackson, although it is far less extensive and substantive than his own writings (about 350 in number) in understanding his position and attitude concerning the study of diseases of the nervous system. This elucidation of the nature Jackson's pursuits throughout his career draws upon primary sources of information-the elaborate writings of Jackson himself and of his Victorian mentors and confreres. The latter constituted Jackson's thought collective, who contributed to a unique and previously undescribed document: Testimonials of Dr. J. Hughlings Jackson, M.D. (London, 1863). These medical men also contributed to the Medical Times and Gazette and belonged to the London Pathological Society and the New Sydenham Society. Jackson's thought collective and their shared beliefs and pursuits were instrumental in shaping Jackson's career as reflected by his later works. Jackson's professional pursuits and extensive writings marked a lifetime dedicated to developing a \"Science of the Nervous System\" according to a Millian-Spencerian form of deductive reasoning, to ultimately establish a rational basis for the treatment of nervous disease. Jackson and his contemporaries initiated and developed a deductive ideology and methodology that continue to be widely employed by neurologists today, and thus form the basis of the current neurological paradigm.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9040741/"}

Systematic review of the literature was completed. Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme. Recommendations were based on the evidence. 1. Early falls, poor response to levodopa, symmetry of motor manifestations, lack of tremor, and early autonomic dysfunction are probably useful in distinguishing other parkinsonian syndromes from Parkinson disease (PD). 2. Levodopa or apomorphine challenge and olfactory testing are probably useful in distinguishing PD from other parkinsonian syndromes. 3. Predictive factors for more rapid motor progression, nursing home placement, and shorter survival time include older age at onset of PD, associated comorbidities, presentation with rigidity and bradykinesia, and decreased dopamine responsiveness.

The modern neuroscience intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) is grounded in close collaboration between neurointensivists and neurosurgeons in the management of patients with such conditions as ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematomas, and traumatic brain injury. Neuro-ICUs are also capable of specialized monitoring such as serial neurological examinations by trained neuro-ICU nurses; invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygenation, and cerebral hemodynamics; cerebral microdialysis; and noninvasive monitoring, including the use of pupillometry, ultrasound monitoring of optic nerve sheath diameters, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, and continuous electroencephalography. Neuro-ICUs are also capable of specialized neuroprotective management of medical complications, including sodium disorders, renal failure, respiratory failure, and hypertension. These units depend on an interdisciplinary team including speech and language pathologists, occupational and physical therapists, and social workers and case managers, who work to implement early mobilization and successful transition to rehabilitation centers. There are numerous models of neuro-ICUs ranging from \"open\" units in which patients are cared for in an ICU by an admitting attending, generally without involvement of an intensivist, to \"semi-open\" units in which intensivists act as consultants, to \"closed\" units in which the neurointensivist is the admitting attending.

This database was searched to retrieve abstracts of claims concerning neurological disease treated by clinicians of all specialties. Abstracts were systematically reviewed to extract the following information: specialty of clinician, pathology involved, misadventure, patient injury and value of claim. A complete data set was available for 559 cases. The chi-squared test was used to investigate differences in negligence claims between neurologists/neurosurgeons and non-specialists. The specialty most frequently cited was neurosurgery (241) followed by neurology (172). Non-neurologists and non-neurosurgeons were the defendant in 146 cases, predominantly general physicians (42), orthopaedic surgeons (39) and emergency physicians (33). The most common pathologies were intervertebral disc disease (27%), CNS tumours (21%), CNS infection (11%) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (9%). The most frequent misadventure was diagnostic error (44%). In 47% of cases major permanent injury (e.g. blindness, hemiplegia) resulted from the misadventure. The patient died in 17% of cases.

After becoming interne (residents) at the same institute in 1848, both were involved in shaping the cradle of what would become modern neurology. Both started work as chiefs at a La Salpêtrière service on January 1, 1862, making common rounds and studies, with several common publications. While their friendship remained 'for life', as stated by Charcot at Vulpian's funeral, their career paths differed. Vulpian progressed quicker and higher, being appointed full professor and elected at the Académie Nationale de Médecine and the Académie des Sciences several years before Charcot, as well as becoming dean of the Paris Faculty of Medicine. These positions also enabled him to support his friend Charcot in getting appointed full clinical professor and becoming the first holder of the chair of Clinique des Maladies du Système Nerveux in 1882. Before studying medicine, Vulpian had worked in physiology with Pierre Flourens, and his career always remained balanced between physiology and neurology, with remarkable papers. He introduced Charcot to optic microscopy during their La Salpêtrière years, indirectly helping him to become his successor to the chair of pathological anatomy in 1872. While Vulpian succeeded so well in local medical affairs, Charcot spent his time building up a huge clinical service and a teaching 'school' at La Salpêtrière, which he never left for over 31 years until his death. This 'school' progressively became synonymous with clinical neurology itself and perpetuated the master's memory for decades. Vulpian never had such support, although Jules Déjerine was his pupil and Joseph Babinski was his interne before becoming Charcot's chef de clinique (chief of staff) in 1885. This unusual switch in Parisian medicine contributed to Charcot's unaltered celebrity over more than a century, while Vulpian was progressively relegated to the studies of historians.

The focus of his various research studies was the central nervous system, including balance disorders (the role of the cerebellum and semicircular canals), taste innervation, pain and speech disorders (theories of brain localisation). Lussana's clinical method and direct dealings with patients laid the groundwork for his subsequent academic activities as a neurophysiologist, in Parma and later in Padua. Influenced by phrenological theories, he also conducted interesting studies on synaesthesia for which he determined a brain site. He contributed to the neurophysiology of taste, emphasising the role of the facial nerve. With his study on muscle sense, he also joined the debate on the role of the cerebellum in balance, setting the foundation for later studies on this organ by Luigi Luciani.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21948119/"}

Based on a literature review, we identified criteria for key PVCs for use in paediatric neurology. We then performed a multi-round Delphi analysis to obtain agreement between 28 expert clinician teachers concerning key PVCs for four learner levels. We identified two major criteria: key PVCs should demonstrate key movements, and these movements should be subtle and/or difficult to note. The expert clinician teachers subsequently assessed a list of 14 topics for key PVCs. We found a clear, increasing trend in relevance scores, from medical students to young residents to experienced residents and specialists. For medical students and residents, epileptic spasms, Down syndrome, developmental delay, cerebral palsy and absence epilepsy were highly ranked. For specialists, conditions like chorea, focal seizures or eye movement disorders topped the ranking list, although ranking was less clear for this group of advanced learners. Key PVCs should demonstrate movements that are difficult to note for learners. Ranked lists of key PVCs for teaching and learning at different learner levels are now available and may help institutions build validated local libraries of PVCs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29274891/"}

WGS can result into unexpected information (incidental findings, IFs), and information with uncertain clinical significance. In the context of a Genome Canada project on 'Personalized Medicine in the Treatment of Epilepsy', we intended to address these challenges surveying neurologists' opinions about the type of results that should be returned, and their professional responsibility toward recontacting patients regarding new discovered mutations. Potential participants were contacted through professional organizations or direct invitations. A total of 204 neurologists were recruited. Fifty nine percent indicated that to be conveyed, WGS results should have a demonstrated clinical utility for diagnosis, prognosis or treatment. Yet, 41% deemed appropriate to return results without clinical utility, when they could impact patients' reproductive decisions, or on patients' request. Current use of targeted genetic testing and age of patients influenced respondents' answers. Respondents stated that analysis of genomics data resulting from WGS should be limited to the genes likely to be relevant for the patient's specific medical condition (69%), so as to limit IFs. Respondents felt responsible to recontact patients and inform them about newly discovered mutations related to the medical condition that triggered the test (75%) for as long as they are following up on the patient (55%). Finally, 53.5% of the respondents felt responsible to recontact and inform patients of clinically significant, newly discovered IFs.

While neuroimmunologists originally focused on classical neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and infections, there is strong evidence to suggest that the immune response contributes to genetic white matter disorders, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, peripheral nervous system and neuro-oncological conditions, as well as ageing. Technological advances have greatly aided our knowledge of how the immune system influences the nervous system during development and ageing, and how such responses contribute to disease as well as regeneration and repair. Here, we highlight historical aspects and milestones in the field of neuroimmunology and discuss the paradigm shifts that have helped provide novel insights into disease mechanisms. We propose future perspectives including molecular biological studies and experimental models that may have the potential to push many areas of neuroimmunology.

While neurology teaching initiatives and training programs are growing in the region, innovative teaching methods are needed to improve neurology knowledge, reduce neurophobia, and encourage medical students to pursue careers in neurology. Furthermore, studies formally evaluating the effectiveness of different neurology teaching methods are needed. Fifth and seventh year undergraduate medical students on their internal medicine clinical clerkship were randomized by clerkship group (i.e. all students completing the clerkship in a given time period were randomized together) to either a traditional lecture or flipped classroom curriculum for delivery of the neurology content of their clerkship. In the traditional classroom arm, students attended in-person neurology lectures and accessed corresponding clinical case presentations online. In the flipped classroom arm, students watched pre-recorded neurology lectures, and class time was dedicated to interactive small group review of clinical cases. Students completed anonymous pre- and post-course surveys consisting of knowledge assessments, self-reported confidence in diagnosing/managing neurologic disorders, neurophobia surveys, and course satisfaction surveys. Pre-and post- course score differences and differences in change scores were compared between instructional models along with quantified effect sizes. In total, 263 fifth year students (100 traditional, 163 flipped) and 99 seventh year students (48 traditional, 51 flipped) had complete data and were included in final analysis. A greater increase in knowledge assessment scores was observed in both the fifth and seventh year flipped classroom groups compared to the traditional groups (p < 0.01 for both). Both fifth and seventh year students in the flipped classroom groups also demonstrated a greater increase in confidence diagnosing and managing common neurologic conditions compared to students in the traditional groups. Flipped classroom students in both year groups reported significantly greater course satisfaction, effective learning, course participation, and course collaboration. Neurophobia scores significantly decreased only in the fifth year flipped classroom group. A flipped classroom approach improved neurology knowledge, confidence diagnosing/managing neurologic disorders, and course satisfaction in Zambian medical students compared to traditional lectures. The flipped classroom approach may represent a promising pedagogical model for improving neurology education in similar resource-limited settings with few neurologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40543399/"}

Although before the 17th century there were British doctors who took an interest in diseases of the nervous system, e.g. Gilbertus Anglicus (c. 1230), who distinguished epilepsy from apoplexy, and Bartholomeus Anglicus, whose encyclopedia (c. 1260) provided the first picture of a dissection printed in English, John of Gaddesden (1280-1361) was the first in Britain to produce a manuscript on neurological disorders. Thomas Willis (1621-1675) was the founder of Neurology, being the first to use the term, and was also the leader of the first multidisciplinary team in neurological science, helping to shift attention from the chambers of the brain to the brain substance itself. He wrote seven books, all but the last in Latin, and his second one, Cerebri anatome (1664) was the first on the nervous system to include the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, introducing such new terms as lentiform body, corpus striatum, optic thalamus, inferior olives and peduncles. Most of his neurology was in his fifth book, De anima brutorum (1672). Before Willis the brain was a mystery, but his work laid the foundations for neurological advances.

Results of a multicentre mapping exercise.", "text": "Patients affected by progressive long-term neurological conditions might benefit from specialist palliative care involvement. However, little is known on how neurology and specialist palliative care services interact. This study aimed to map the current level of connections and integration between these services. The mapping exercise was conducted in eight centres with neurology and palliative care services in the United Kingdom. The data were provided by the respective neurology and specialist palliative care teams. Questions focused on: i) catchment and population served; ii) service provision and staffing; iii) integration and relationships. Centres varied in size of catchment areas (39-5,840 square miles) and population served (142,000-3,500,000). Neurology and specialist palliative care were often not co-terminus. Service provisions for neurology and specialist palliative care were also varied. For example, neurology services varied in the number and type of provided clinics and palliative care services in the settings they work in. Integration was most developed in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), e.g., joint meetings were often held, followed by Parkinsonism (made up of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple-System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), with integration being more developed for MSA and PSP) and least in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), e.g., most sites had no formal links. The number of neurology patients per annum receiving specialist palliative care reflected these differences in integration (range: 9-88 MND, 3-25 Parkinsonism, and 0-5 MS). This mapping exercise showed heterogeneity in service provision and integration between neurology and specialist palliative care services, which varied not only between sites but also between diseases. This highlights the need and opportunities for improved models of integration, which should be rigorously tested for effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27165157/"}

Applicants to neurology residencies submit personal statements describing themselves and their motivations. Textual analysis of personal statements has been performed in internal medicine and general surgery, but never before in neurology. We hypothesized that specific words and themes would be mentioned in residency personal statements with high frequencies indicating students' motivations. We used computational linguistics software to assess key words and thereby study motivations, expectations, and themes present among neurology applicants. A total of 2,405 personal statements submitted over 5 years to our institution were de-identified and compiled into a database for evaluation through 3 computational linguistics software programs. We performed calculations of term frequencies (TF) and TF-inverse document frequencies and performed K-means clustering to identify unique words and common themes. Specific disease states were discussed. For example, stroke (TF 2,178), epilepsy (TF 970), and dementia (TF 944) were referenced more often than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (TF 220) and carpal tunnel (TF 10). The most common proper names cited were Oliver Sacks (TF 94) and Sherlock Holmes (TF 41). Common themes included fascination with the brain, interest in research, desire to help patients, early interests in neurology, continued pursuit of learning, appreciation for time with patients, family history with neurologic illness, and intellectual curiosity. This first computational linguistic analysis of neurology personal statements provides understanding into medical students' motivations and interests.

For those patients who retain peripheral motor function, rigorous behavioral assessment supported by structural imaging and electrophysiological findings is usually sufficient to establish a patient's level of wakefulness and awareness. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that in some patients damage to the peripheral motor system may prevent overt responses to command although the cognitive ability to perceive and understand such commands may remain intact. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging suggest a novel solution to this problem; in several cases, so-called activation studies have been used to identify residual cognitive function and conscious awareness in patients who are assumed to be in a vegetative state yet retain cognitive abilities that have evaded detection using standard clinical methods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17698699/"}

Significant knowledge and competencies in this area are necessary to be effective in clinical practice. The need for this is driven by the high burden of disease from neurologic conditions in children and the effect on their families. As the first part of a multistaged project under the auspices of the International Child Neurology Association, in collaboration with key stakeholders, a survey was undertaken to establish which countries have practicing child neurologists. For those countries that have child neurologists, the survey established the number of practitioners and which countries have access to in-country child neurology training. Responses were obtained from 177 countries. Worldwide, there is a median of 0.07 and mean of 0.39 child neurologists per 100,000 population. The greatest deficits in child neurology specialists and access to training were evident in countries which fell under the World Bank rating of low-income country status (range of 0-0.008 child neurologists per 100,000 population). Seventy-three percent of low-income countries lack access to child neurologists: The majority are in the African and South-East Asia regions.

E-learning has been described as a way to deliver interactive and facilitated lower-cost learning to address global gaps in medical care. We describe here the development of a novel, international, hybrid, and asynchronous curriculum with both self-paced modules and class-based lectures on neuropalliative care topics designed for the neurologist interested in palliative care, the palliative care physician interested in caring for neurological patients, and any other physician or advanced care providers interested in neuropalliative care. The course consisted of 12 modules, one per every four weeks, beginning July 2022. Each module is based on a case and relevant topics. Course content was divided into three streams (Neurology Basics, Palliative Care Basics, and Neuropalliative Care Essentials) of which two were optional and one was mandatory, and consisted of classroom sessions, webinars, and an in-person skills session. Evaluation of learners consisted of multiple choice questions and written assignments for each module. Evaluation of the course was based on semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with both educator and learner, the latter of which will be published separately. Audio files were transcribed and underwent thematic analysis. For the discussion of the results, Khan's e-learning framework was used. Ten of the 12 participating educators were interviewed. Of the educators, three identified as mid-career and seven as senior faculty, ranging from six to 33 years of experience. Nine of ten reported an academic affiliation and all reported association with a teaching hospital. Themes identified from the educators' evaluations were: bridging the global gap, getting everybody on board, defining the educational scope, investing extensive hours of voluntary time and resources, benefiting within and beyond the curriculum, understanding the learner's experience, creating a community of shared learning, adapting future teaching and learning strategies, and envisioning long term sustainability. The first year of a novel, international, hybrid, and asynchronous neuropalliative care curriculum has been completed, and its educators have described both successes and avenues for improvement.

Progress continues to be hampered by issues related to terminology and assessment. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy and a novel assessment approach to addressing distinct aspects of fatigue and fatigability in clinical and research settings. This taxonomy is based on our current knowledge of the pathophysiology and phenomenology of fatigue and fatigability. Application of our approach indicates that the assessment and reporting of fatigue can be clarified and improved by utilizing this taxonomy and creating measures to address distinct aspects of fatigue and fatigability. We review the strengths and weaknesses of several common measures of fatigue and suggest, based on our model, that many research questions may be better addressed by using multiple measures.

The following analysis was done to assess the interrater agreement in classifying epilepsy syndromes in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy. In a prospective, community-based study, 613 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy were recruited. Based on information available at diagnosis or generated as part of the initial diagnostic assessment, three pediatric neurologists independently classified epilepsy syndromes. Interrater agreement was assessed with kappa. Interrater agreement was extremely good, with kappa scores > or = 0.80 for almost all comparisons. Relatively limited quality of the EEG and seizure information in some cases, as well as discrepancies between the two, were associated with a tendency for more disagreement. A high degree of interrater agreement was obtained in this study, indicating that the system for classifying syndromes can be meaningfully used in a community-based sample. Quality of the information, which is often, by necessity, less than optimal in newly diagnosed epilepsy, is a potential barrier to identification of syndromes. A substantial proportion of children were classified into relatively nonspecific syndromes. Over time, additional information may come to light to allow more precise identification of their forms of epilepsy. In an epidemiologic setting, the ILAE classification of the epilepsies can be successfully used with a high degree of reliability to classify newly diagnosed epilepsy in children.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10219269/"}

In this article, is explored the relationship between psychodynamic theory and experimental research using examples of evidence-based studies in the fields of (i) psychotherapeutic intervention assessment, (ii) placebo response in children and adolescents, (iii) unconscious lasting traumatic effects in children and adolescents, (iv) psychodynamic-oriented psychological testing. There are now a sufficient number of evidence-based studies to support the use of psychodynamic therapy in mental disorders, particularly in personality disorder and anxious/depressive disorder. In addition, placebo responses in children and adolescents with internalizing disorders are significantly higher in major depression compared to obsessive-compulsive disorder or other anxiety disorders, which highlights differential psychopathologies regarding the experience of loss. Also, using an experimental task, psychoanalysts are able to identify, without explicit knowledge and above the level of chance, healthy adults whose siblings had experienced cancer during childhood. This experiment suggests that implicit information regarding a participant's history is conveyed in interpersonal exchanges that can be intuitively perceived by judges experienced in listening to free associations from a psychodynamic perspective. Finally, psychodynamic-oriented psychological testing may predict the transition to schizophrenia in adolescents with a history of manic/mixed episodes. It can be concluded that there are no discrepancies between psychodynamic views and experimental data, whether one tests psychotherapeutic approaches, discusses data from other fields such as psychopharmacology, or designs experiments based on psychodynamic theory.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21963530/"}

He found it difficult to place the peripheral nerve within his classification of disorders; it appeared to be an exception to his theories. Even the pathology that he described in 1886 with Pierre Marie (1853-1940), at the same time as Henry Tooth (1856-1925), and which is now known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, was considered by Charcot to be a potential myelopathy. Charcot, like other physicians, paid little heed to the observations made by Louis Duménil (1823-1890) to support the existence of primitive damage to the peripheral nerve. Charcot approached peripheral nerve pathologies through two indirect routes: amyotrophies not explained by spinal or muscular damage, and the trophic cutaneous consequences of what he called névrites (neuritis), the lesional site of which remains debated. It is noteworthy that Charcot's approach to peripheral nervous system disorders differed from that of other neurologists of the same time. Augusta Dejerine-Klumpke (1859-1927) in France was more precise than Charcot in her anatomical and clinical descriptions, and Hugo von Ziemssen (1829-1902) in Germany made effective use of electrodiagnostics. Charcot supported the electrical work of Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875), whom he sometimes presented as one of his mentors. The German physician Wilhelm Erb (1840-1921) developed electrodiagnosis by galvanic and faradic currents. Charcot never made use of Erb's electrological advancements. With his electrophysiologist Romain Vigouroux (1831-1911), Charcot used medical electricity only for electrotherapy in hysteria.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39207094/"}

Past studies of severe head trauma estimate the risk of late seizures, which are synonymous with epilepsy, to be from 26 to 53%. Furthermore, head trauma accounts for 5% of all epilepsy cases and 20% of symptomatic epilepsy. Although potentially preventable, no effective prophylaxis for posttraumatic epilepsy currently exists. Prior attempts to prevent posttraumatic epileptogenesis used various anticonvulsants, usually given many hours after injury. Generally these studies showed these agents suppressed seizures in the first week after trauma, but had no effect on the incidence of late posttraumatic seizures. Brain trauma engages a rapid excitotoxic process triggered by glutamate release, similar to that seen with ischemia. For ischemic cell damage early and rapid delivery of agents has been a key to rescuing or protecting neurons. Yet, no study has addressed whether the rapidity of drug delivery is critical in the prophylaxis of late seizures. Perhaps excitotoxicity proximate to the brain injury also leads to the neurological deficits seen after severe trauma, initiating and promoting epileptogenesis, and that disrupting this process may prevent epilepsy. While experimental models of epileptogenesis have shown that GABAergic drugs, including valproate (VPA), may be antiepileptogenic, the timing of treatment with putative prophylactic drugs has not been studied. Recent laboratory work explored this issue using an in vitro model of posttraumatic epileptogenesis. The data suggest that a limited time domain exists for VPA to intervene in the epileptogenic process, requiring the earliest possible intervention. We contend that protection from posttraumatic epileptogenesis can be conferred only if agents are given soon after trauma. A pilot study is proposed to begin to translate these findings to explore the feasibility of early VPA delivery to severe head trauma patients admitted to Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, NY, a Level 1 trauma center.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14511392/"}

Further advances in clinical manifestations of aging and more detailed examination of disease states in the elderly accelerated in the last quarter of the 20th century. Basic, translational, and clinical research support of geriatric neurology studies expanded and advanced during this period and into the 21st century. The size and sophistication of this movement was stimulated by a number of factors: the successful development of geriatrics as a specialty in primary care, internal medicine, and psychiatry; the projected growth of the geriatric population; and the projections of the number of people with Alzheimer's disease. However, there were and continue to be inadequate numbers of trained geriatric neurologists available to care for the \"silver tsunami\" of elderly patients with age-related diseases that will present in the next 3 decades. The combination of massive investment in dementia/Alzheimer's research in the past decade, widespread awareness among researchers and trainees of the opportunities to do research in age-related diseases, and the need for further knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases led to a broad expansion of research efforts. Longitudinal clinical studies of the elderly and the advent of sophisticated neuroimaging, genetics, and laboratory techniques are advancing the field.

Microcephaly may result from any insult that disturbs early brain growth and can be seen in association with hundreds of genetic syndromes. Annually, approximately 25,000 infants in the United States will be diagnosed with microcephaly (head circumference <-2 SD). Few data are available to inform evidence-based recommendations regarding diagnostic testing. The yield of neuroimaging ranges from 43% to 80%. Genetic etiologies have been reported in 15.5% to 53.3%. The prevalence of metabolic disorders is unknown but is estimated to be 1%. Children with severe microcephaly (head circumference <-3 SD) are more likely ( approximately 80%) to have imaging abnormalities and more severe developmental impairments than those with milder microcephaly (-2 to -3 SD; approximately 40%). Coexistent conditions include epilepsy ( approximately 40%), cerebral palsy ( approximately 20%), mental retardation ( approximately 50%), and ophthalmologic disorders ( approximately 20% to approximately 50%). Neuroimaging may be considered useful in identifying structural causes in the evaluation of the child with microcephaly (Level C).

The evolving design of the helmet has grown to show improvement in image quality and the ability to image the brain with useful information on different neurologic disorders and diseases. When the ambulatory microdose PET scanner is compared with a conventional PET scanner, it not only provides higher-resolution images and increased sensitivity while allowing the patient to have a greater range of motion but also allows for the introduction of newer radiotracers and lower radiation doses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31182665/"}

Pediatric neurocritical care is a collaborative effort to provide consultative care among pediatric subspecialists, coordinated by neonatal and pediatric intensivists. Valuable perspectives for clinical care, training, and research can also be learned through collaboration with adult neurointensivists. Pediatric neurointensive care is thus an emerging subspecialty that optimally functions by applying a broad collaborative effort among colleagues across multiple medical specialties in pediatric and adult medicine. Innovations in clinical services, educational pathways, and research agendas need to be developed for children that can be modified for younger and older adults. This review also stresses cross-disciplinary research and training opportunities in pediatric neurointensive care beyond physician training. Nonmedical faculty from multiple academic disciplines should also serve as mentors to design appropriate curricula and research plans for the specific trainee in their respective fields and across specialties. The discipline of neurocritical care must consider a life-course approach for the patient requiring neurointensive care from neonatal through childhood and adult ages, with cross-fertilization from diverse academic disciplines and investigative points of view.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18555165/"}

Economic evaluation is a set of formal quantitative methods to capture the outcomes and costs of alternate intervention strategies. There are four basic types of economic evaluations used to assess interventions, are classified on the basis of the outcomes employed: 1. Cost minimization (CMA) is the comparison of costs of alternative interventions when the outcomes are assumed to be equal or similar, and the control intervention has been established. 2. Cost-effectiveness (CEA) is appropriate when the health outcomes are measured in common physical units, such as death or disability, or years gained or increased function, or points on cognitive scales. 3. Cost utility (CUA) is an extension of cost-effectiveness, where different types of health outcomes are weighted according to assigned values of 'quality of life' to produce a composite of both the physical measurement and the value assigned to it, e.g. quality-adjusted life years (QALY) or disability-adjusted life years (DALY). A common denominator measure of effectiveness is thus the life years of expected survival, or the QALY. The global burden disease (GBD) researchers adopted an internationally standardized form of the QALY, which they called the DALY. A quality of life measure can be translated into a scale that ranges from a low of 0.0 (the worst possible health state, usually taken as death) to 1.0 (perfect health). The purpose is to make explicit the measurement of costs and value assigned to benefits. 4. Cost-benefit (CBA) analysis value health outcomes in monetary terms, often based on the concept of 'willingness to pay'. The common drugs used by the neurologists had been discussed in this article based on the point view of pharmacoeconomics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15478681/"}

The addition of GP teaching to the programme increased availability of patients with neurological problems accessible to students and provided a safe, supportive environment for students to learn their fundamental clinical skills. Students gained valuable insights into the impact of neurological disease from the perspective of patients, their families and carers. GP teaching of neurology was well regarded by students. Some GP tutors felt they lacked adequate experience to teach more technical aspects of neurology, and some students shared this concern. Concepts of professional boundaries between generalists and specialists were not observed, but GP teaching was perceived to be 'other' or outside normal medical school activity. General practitioners can successfully facilitate students' access to patients with neurological disease and employ their generalist to enhance neurological learning.

There is a clinical need for portable neural imaging systems, such as fNIRS, to accommodate patients who are unable to tolerate an MR environment. Our objective was to compare task-related full-head fNIRS and fMRI signals across cortical regions. Eighteen healthy adults completed a same-day fNIRS-fMRI study, in which they performed right- and left-hand finger tapping tasks and a semantic-decision tones-decision task. First- and second-level general linear models were applied to both datasets. The finger tapping task showed that significant fNIRS channel activity over the contralateral primary motor cortex corresponded to surface fMRI activity. Similarly, significant fNIRS channel activity over the bilateral temporal lobe corresponded to the same primary auditory regions as surface fMRI during the semantic-decision tones-decision task. Additional channels were significant for this task that did not correspond to surface fMRI activity. Although both imaging modalities showed left-lateralized activation for language processing, the current fNIRS analysis did not show concordant or expected localization at the level necessary for clinical use in individual pediatric epileptic patients. Future work is needed to show whether fNIRS and fMRI are comparable at the source level so that fNIRS can be used in a clinical setting on individual patients.

Understanding career choices among neurology residents, particularly decisions regarding subspecialty training, is critical, as neurologists with specialized knowledge can help meet the needs of patients with specific disease conditions. This study addresses the knowledge gap about subspecialty training decisions by examining factors associated with neurology residents' interest in pursuing subspecialty training and the types of subspecialty training neurology residents consider. We surveyed a geographically stratified sample of neurology residents in U.S. training programs using a two-stage survey design. In Stage 1, we randomly sampled half of the accredited neurology residency programs stratified by U.S. census region; Stage 2 involved a survey of neurology residents within these programs. The majority (approximately 81%) of residents expressed interest in subspecialty training. Resident demographic characteristics and educational debt did not influence interest in pursuing subspecialty training. Residents were more likely to express interest in subspecialty training when they participated in any neurology research (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39), 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.13, 5.07], p = .02, and indicated more interest in careers involving teaching (OR = 8.33), 95% CI [1.64, 42.19], p = .01. Considering the \"medical content of subspecialty\" as a more important factor approached but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 3.12), 95% CI [0.97, 10.06], p = .06.

Further research is needed to determine whether exposure to research and teaching stimulates interest in subspecialty training and whether residents believe that subspecialty training is instrumental in pursuing an academic career.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893935/"}

The countries of Europe share a close geographical proximity that facilitates international exchanges, particularly between university faculties. In recent years, this has, indeed, been the working basis of European educational endeavours in the field of headache. For a number of years, annual summer schools were organized in different European countries and a permanent Summer Headache School was set up in Cambridge (to be held every alternate year). The last summer headache school was held in Vilnius in 2002. In the past decade, a patronage scheme was also set up, which, combining two or more countries (one developed, one or more developing), allowed international exchanges of doctors and students for training purposes. In some centres, participants were also able to gain clinical practice and research experience by staying at the host institutions for extended periods of time. As a result of all this activity there have emerged, in Europe, \"clusters\" of people with a particular interest in headache. However, the rapid growth of insight into headache (new molecules, new headache categories, etc.) has contributed to a widening of the scientific gap between developing and developed countries. Moreover, in the past four years, due to the relative restriction of national/international drug company budgets, it has proved possible to organize only relatively inexpensive teaching courses. As a result, countries whose medical communities had been developing a \"headache culture\" now find themselves destined to be increasingly held back. Therefore, the EHF, in order to promote education on headache in Europe at national level, felt there was a need for guidelines for the organization of educational courses that meet uniform standards of excellence and in terms of code of conduct: guaranteed courses that will attract investors and those seeking to increase their knowledge, skills and understanding in the area of primary and secondary headache.

Accordingly, his argument begins with this fundamental concept. His views of the brain-mind relationship and of mind, or self, resemble modern conceptions. He viewed the self as double and focused on those disruptions of the self system which he called the \"dreamy state.\" This state involves an \"uncoupling\" of normal consciousness, resulting in the loss of the most recently developed forms of memory and of the stream of consciousness. Dissociation is seen here as analogous to the dreamy state. Jacksonian theory predicts the main features of dissociation, i.e., constriction of consciousness, a particular form of amnesia, disaggregation of perceptual phenomena, depersonalization, derealization, and hallucinosis.

New advances in technology and in the understanding of genetic disorders have led to changes in the diagnostic approach to a child with unexplained GDD or ID. Chromosomal microarray has become a first-line test for evaluation of patients in this population and has both significantly increased diagnostic yield and introduced new challenges in the interpretation of copy number variants of uncertain significance. The G-banded karyotype is now frequently utilized as an adjunct to the microarray rather than as a first-line test in individuals with GDD or ID. Fragile X DNA testing continues to be recommended in the initial evaluation of the child with GDD or ID. The presence or absence of certain cardinal features (such as microcephaly or macrocephaly, seizures, autism, abnormal neurologic examination, and facial dysmorphism) can be utilized to direct single-gene molecular testing. The availability of next-generation and massively parallel sequencing technologies has enabled the use of genetic testing panels, in which dozens of genes associated with GDD or ID may be rapidly analyzed. Most recently, the clinical availability of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing has opened new possibilities for the evaluation of individuals with GDD or ID who have previously eluded a genetic diagnosis. Consultation with a medical geneticist is recommended when progressing beyond first-tier analyses to most efficiently prioritize testing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23245550/"}

Moreover, it is a symptom situated at, more than any other pain condition, a crosspoint where several disciplines meet, for example, dentists; manual therapists; ophthalmologists; psychologists; and ear-nose-throat, pain, and internal medicine physicians besides neurologists and neurosurgeons. Recently, a new version of the most widely used classification system among neurologists for headache and facial pain, the International Classification of Headache Disorders, has been published. The aims of this study were to provide an overview of the most prevalent etiologies of facial pain and to provide a generic framework for the neurologist on how to manage patients presenting with facial pain. An overview of the different etiologies of facial pain is provided from the viewpoint of the respective clinical specialties that are confronted with facial pain. Key message: Caregivers should \"think outside their own box\" and refer to other disciplines when indicated. If not, a correct diagnosis can be delayed and unnecessary treatments might be given. The presented framework is aimed at excluding life- or organ-threatening diseases, providing several clinical clues and indications for technical investigations, and ultimately leading to the correct diagnosis and/or referral to other disciplines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32222701/"}
{"id": "25553845", "title": "Current role of melatonin in pediatric neurology: clinical recommendations.", "text": "Melatonin, an indoleamine secreted by the pineal gland, plays a key role in regulating circadian rhythm. It has chronobiotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. A conference in Rome in 2014 aimed to establish consensus on the roles of melatonin in children and on treatment guidelines. The best evidence for efficacy is in sleep onset insomnia and delayed sleep phase syndrome. It is most effective when administered 3-5 h before physiological dim light melatonin onset. There is no evidence that extended-release melatonin confers advantage over immediate release. Many children with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability have sleep disturbance and can benefit from melatonin treatment. Melatonin decreases sleep onset latency and increases total sleep time but does not decrease night awakenings. Decreased CYP 1A2 activity, genetically determined or from concomitant medication, can slow metabolism, with loss of variation in melatonin level and loss of effect. Decreasing the dose can remedy this. Animal work and limited human data suggest that melatonin does not exacerbate seizures and might decrease them. Melatonin has been used successfully in treating headache. Animal work has confirmed a neuroprotective effect of melatonin, suggesting a role in minimising neuronal damage from birth asphyxia; results from human studies are awaited. Melatonin can also be of value in the performance of sleep EEGs and as sedation for brainstem auditory evoked potential assessments. No serious adverse effects of melatonin in humans have been identified.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25553845/"}

The purpose of this investigation was to study these structures in the anterior temporal lobe and the external and extreme capsules and to correlate the dissected anatomy with the cross-sectional MR anatomy. Progressive dissection was guided by three-dimensional MR renderings and cross-sectional images. Dissected segments of the tracts and the temporal stem were traced and projected onto reformatted images. The method of dissection tractography is detailed in a companion article. The temporal stem extends posteriorly from the level of the amygdala to the level of the lateral geniculate body. The uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi pass from the temporal lobe into the extreme and external capsules via the temporal stem. Meyer's loop extends to the level of the amygdala, adjacent to the uncinate fasciculus and anterior commissure. These anatomic features were demonstrated on correlative cross-sectional MR images and compared with clinical examples. This study clarified the MR anatomy of the uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi and Meyer's loop in the temporal stem and in the external and extreme capsules, helping to explain patterns of tumor spread. The inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus is an important yet previously neglected tract.

Thus, this contribution to the special issue on neurology in Germany between 1933 and 1945 focuses exemplarily on epilepsy research. By drawing on primary sources and secondary literature the article tries to reconstruct the scientific discourse of the time and consider the implications for patients. National socialistic ideology was based on eugenic thinking and the implementation of eugenic policies was a major political objective. An immediate effect of this policy was the passing of the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring (Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses) in 1933. According to this law \"hereditary epilepsy\" along with various other neurological and psychiatric disorders was regarded as a mandatory indication for forced sterilization. Subsequently, funding of epileptological research was generously increased and extended, e. g. at the German Research Institute (Deutsche Forschungsanstalt) in Munich and the Rheinische Provinzial-Institut in Bonn. The main focus was placed on idiopathic forms of the disease, which were a priori considered as hereditary. At the annual meetings of the Society of German Neurologists and Psychiatrists (Gesellschaft deutscher Neurologen und Psychiater), lectures and debates on epilepsy repeatedly constituted a key topic. Some participants opted for a broad interpretation of \"endogeneity\" and thus favored an extension of the practice of sterilization but others advocated a more differentiated and restricted attitude.

In step one, neurologists and neurology residents at University of Calgary were surveyed about their perception of teaching NHA and asked to rank 56 neurological diseases on a Likert scale based on how well they lend themselves to teaching health advocacy. In step two, curricular items were developed for the top five neurological diseases, using a modified Delphi procedure. The reliability of the survey instrument was determined by Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the underlying components of NHA. Forty-six neurologists and 14 neurology residents were surveyed, with a response rate of 88.33%.

The top five neurological presentations, that lend themselves easily to teaching NHA were: stroke/transient ischemic attacks, alcoholism, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The survey instrument reliability was 0.97. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors that can explain the variability in the survey instrument: multidisciplinary approach to neurological disorders, prevention of recurrence of neurological disease, collaboration with other medical subspecialties, and communication with professions outside the medical field.

Experts from 20 specialty societies and other organizations evaluated the evidence for each treatment option from all available randomized clinical trials and from a synthesis of the recommendations of already existing international and German guidelines. 403 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. It was concluded that anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy, psychopharmacological drugs, or both. Response rates to initial treatment vary from 45% to 65%. Cognitive behavioral therapy is supported by higher-level evidence than any other psychotherapeutic technique. Psychodynamic therapy is recommended as a second-line treatment. Among anxiolytic drugs, the agents of first choice are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The patient's preference should be considered in the choice of treatment. Drug treatment should be continued for 6 to 12 months after remission. If psychotherapy or drug treatment is not adequately effective, then the treatment should be switched to the other form, or to a combination of both.

This article argues that this development should prompt a new focus in medical care. The key questions should not only be how can we improve treatment of age-related disorders but also how can we prevent age-related disorders in the first place or at least substantially delay their onset? These questions touch on an even more profound question: how can successful aging be accomplished? That is, which factors and processes characterize successful aging both on a system and on a molecular level? Thus, the crucial societal, scientific and medical challenges for Western societies are to develop and implement measures of primary prevention of dysfunctional aging. The disease-centered framework which currently determines most clinical thinking, scientific research and third party funding has to be supplemented by a novel framework of successful aging. This article defines dysfunctional aging as a convergent downstream result of multiple interacting system processes. Each of these detrimental system processes must be targeted by specific measures of geriatric primary prevention. This, in turn, implies that geriatrics does not start in the elderly or with the onset of particular geriatric disorders. Instead, it starts in the daily practice of neurology and other medical disciplines taking care of persons aged 20-40 years who are largely healthy and in the middle of their professional and personal career.

Despite this potential, applications of TMS in neurology have only been approved for diagnostic clinical neurophysiology, pre-surgical mapping of motor and language cortex, and the treatment of migraines. In this article, we discuss the principles of TMS and its clinical applications in neurology, including experimental applications in stroke rehabilitation, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, neurodegenerative disorders, movement disorders, tinnitus, chronic pain and functional neurological disorder. To promote increased cross-talk across neurology and psychiatry, we also succinctly review the TMS literature for the treatment of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.

The focus of neurology remained the diagnosis and treatment of aphasias and epilepsies, while cognitive impairments and developmental disorders were classified as functional (psychological) disorders. Geschwind was troubled by the fact that many of the patients he saw with neurological deficits also presented with behavioral (developmental) disorders. Geschwind's generation also had been taught that aphasias resulted from global rather than localized or focal neurological lesions. These holists, including the prepsychoanalytic Sigmund Freud, targeted the work of aphasiologist Carl Wernicke as an exemplar of the flaws of the localizationist hypothesis. Reading Wernicke in the original, Geschwind discovered a complex and multilayered explanation for aphasias that implicated lesions located in association pathways that, when extensive, resulted in behavioral disorders. Geschwind also reread the works of the holists, discovering that, while their rhetoric rejected Wernicke, their explanations of aphasias actually reinforced Wernicke's hypothesis. Building on his reading of these historical documents and his clinical experiences, Geschwind urged the resurrection of Wernicke's disconnection syndromes that Geschwind labeled as Behavioral Neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25210887/"}

The complexities of management are further encumbered by the relatively few effective choices for acute and preventive therapies available to the headache specialist to treat these diverse disorders. As advances have been made in uncovering headache pathophysiology, new therapies have surfaced and others are forthcoming. This article will highlight new lines of care in development. There are several novel delivery mechanisms of familiar medications which bypass the limitations of current delivery systems, including the sumatriptan iontophoretic patch Zecuity, the intranasal sumatriptan OptiNose system, the zolmitriptan Rapidfilm orally dissolvable film and the orally inhaled dihydroergotamine Levadex system. New lines of care based upon recently discovered therapeutic targets will also be discussed including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, serotonin receptor agonists, and sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) intermittent stimulation. Finally, emerging targets for future therapeutics will be explored including transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) receptor modulators, nitric oxide (NO) antagonists, gap junction modulators, glutamate receptor antagonists, orexin receptor antagonists and prostanoid receptor antagonists. Therapies developing over the next several years will be welcome additions to the headache specialist's armamentarium.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23695055/"}

With the passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act in 2011, an Advisory Council for Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services was convened to advise the Department of Health and Human Services. In May 2012, the Council produced the first National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease, and prominent in its recommendations is a call for quality measures suitable for evaluating and tracking dementia care in clinical settings. Although other efforts have been made to set dementia care quality standards, such as those pioneered by RAND in its series Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE), practitioners, healthcare systems, and insurers have not widely embraced implementation. This executive summary (full manuscript available at www.neurology.org) reports on a new measurement set for dementia management developed by an interdisciplinary Dementia Measures Work Group (DWG) representing the major national organizations and advocacy organizations concerned with the care of individuals with dementia. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the American Geriatrics Society, the American Medical Directors Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Medical Association-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement led this effort. The ACOVE measures and the measurement set described here apply to individuals whose dementia has already been identified and properly diagnosed. Although similar in concept to ACOVE, the DWG measurement set differs in several important ways; it includes all stages of dementia in a single measure set, calls for the use of functional staging in planning care, prompts the use of validated instruments in patient and caregiver assessment and intervention, highlights the relevance of using palliative care concepts to guide care before the advanced stages of illness, and provides evidence-based support for its recommendations and guidance on the selection of instruments useful in tracking patient-centered outcomes. It also specifies annual reassessment and updating of interventions and care plans for dementia-related problems that affect families and other caregivers as well as individuals with dementia. Here, a brief synopsis of why major reforms in healthcare design and delivery are needed to achieve substantive improvements in the quality of care is first provided, and then the final measures approved for publication, dissemination, and implementation are listed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24397784/"}

The discovery of a non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) innervation of the gut in the sixties was made by considerable contributions from the Nordic countries with the Martinson group in Sweden as central innovators. Important discoveries regarding the intramural nerve ganglia as mediators of the autonomic nervous input has also been produced from this research. In clinical motility research, the study of the migrating motor complex in the small bowel has revealed its ability to act as a retroperistaltic pump in the proximal duodenum (Sweden) and its important role for gut microbial homeostasis (Norway). Also in the development of methodology to study gut sensory-motor function, the Nordic countries has contributed. Examples are the physical characteristics of the esophageal manometry catheter (Denmark), the use of ultrasound for assessment of gastric function (Norway), a temporary electrical stimulation method in patients with severe nausea and vomiting (Sweden), a rectal barostat method for clinical evaluation of recto-anal function and a colonic transit time method utilizing radio-opaque markers (Sweden).

Campbell's Australian career: 1905-1937.", "text": "The Australian Alfred Walter Campbell (1868-1937) is remembered as one of the two chief pioneers of the study of the cytoarchitectonics of the primate cerebral cortex. He had worked in Britain carrying out neuroanatomical and neuropathological research for almost two decades before his famous monograph on Histological Studies on the Localisation of Cerebral Function appeared in 1905. In that year he returned to his native Australia and practiced for over 30 years in Sydney as a neurologist rather than a neuropathologist, publishing mainly clinical material though he was involved in the investigation of the epidemic of Australian X disease, a viral encephalitis. His abrupt change in both the nature and the location of his career at a time when he was well established in Britain appears to have been a consequence of his marriage and the need to provide for a family. His simultaneous apparent abandonment of research seems not to have really been the case. As judged from the contents of a paper presented to a local medical congress in Sydney in 1911, it appears that, in Australia, Campbell did carry out a major comparative anatomical and histological investigation of the possibility of localization of function in the cerebellar cortex. He never published this work in detail. His investigation let him to conclude that no such localization of function existed, a view contrary to the then topical interpretation of Bolk (1906), but one in accordance with Gordon Holmes' views a decade later. Campbell's circumstances in Sydney, his extremely reticent nature and the essentially negative outcome of his investigation probably explain his failure to make his study more widely known.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11787461/"}

The goal of this study was to establish the feasibility and efficacy of a neurosurgical curriculum designed to teach future primary care physicians about these diseases. A compact, seven-lecture curriculum was developed to teach 3rd-year medical students about degenerative spine disease, stroke, tumor- and hydrocephalus-related raised intracranial pressure, head and spine injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This curriculum was given as part of a 6-week pilot course that included neurology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and rehabilitation medicine components. This course was administered to two groups of 18 medical students, and an examination was administered at the end of the pilot course. The same examination was administered to an additional 19 students immediately after their completion of the neurology course currently required. Students enrolled in the pilot neuroscience course performed significantly better (p<0.001) on the examination than those who had completed the standard neurology course. Striking improvements were noted in the recognition and management of head injury, hydrocephalus, and radiculopathy. Inclusion of a short neurosurgery-related curriculum in a combined neuroscience course significantly improved student performance on an examination focusing on the recognition and management of common neurosurgical disorders.

Others try to maintain a distinction by saying that neurology deals with abnormalities of neural structure while psychiatry deals with specific abnormalities of neural functioning. It is not clear that neurologists would accept this division, nor that they should. I argue that if we take seriously the notion that psychiatric illnesses are mental illnesses we can draw a more defensible boundary between psychiatry and neurology. As mental illnesses, psychiatric illnesses must have symptoms that affect our mental capacities and that the sufferer is capable of being aware of, even if they are not always self-consciously aware of them. Neurological illnesses, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, may be diagnosed even if they are silent, just as the person may not be aware of having high blood pressure or may suffer a silent myocardial infarction. It does not make sense to speak of panic disorder if the person has never had a panic attack, however, or of bipolar disorder in the absence of mood swings. This does not mean psychiatric illnesses are not biologically based. Mental illnesses are illnesses of persons, whereas other illnesses are illnesses of biological individuals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444362/"}

Pharmacotherapeutic approaches include: neuropeptides (agonists such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and antagonists such as corticotropin-releasing hormone), neurotrophic factors (especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and glutamatergic mechanisms (such as riluzole, ketamine, and antagonists of the NR-2B subunit of the glutamate receptor). Physiological interventions that would offer alternatives to electroconvulsive therapy include: repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation, especially at more intense stimulation parameters; magnetic stimulation therapy (seizures induced more focally by magnetic rather than electrical stimulation with resulting reduced meaning loss); vagal nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. However, these, as well as the panoply of existing treatments, require further intensive investigation to place each of them in the proper therapeutic sequence and combination for the individual patient, based on development of better clinical and biological predictors of response. Large clinical trial networks and development of systematic research in clinical practice settings, such as that featured by the National Cancer Institute for cancer chemotherapy, would greatly accelerate the progress in incorporating new, as well as existing, agents into the best treatment strategies. The bipolar disorders, which are increasingly recognized as complex, highly comorbid conditions with a high morbidity and mortality, of which the majority start in childhood and adolescence, are not likely to respond completely to any single new treatment agent, and new public health initiatives and research strategies are needed as much as any new single treatment advance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18689289/"}

Bouillaud argued that if the frontal lobes are crucial to speech, 2 conditions must be satisfied: when the frontal lobes are affected, speech must also be affected; conversely, when the frontal lobes are spared, speech is also spared. Following these principles, he tested and argued in support of Gall's theory by analyzing the data from 2 neuropathological casebooks (Lallemand, 1820-1823; Rostan, 1820 and 1823). We now know that Bouillaud was wrong, since the crucial dichotomy is between the left and right hemispheres and not between the anterior and posterior areas. What is interesting is that the actual data refute Bouillaud's conclusion. We replicated his experiment by reanalyzing the 147 clinical cases described by Lallemand. There were, of course, some cases with frontal lesions and speech disorders; other cases, however, had speech disorders with lesions outside the frontal lobes, and still others had frontal lesions without speech disorders. Although Bouillaud did not notice it, as we expected, almost all patients with speech disorders had a left hemisphere lesion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11448309/"}

Patients in the U.K. find that GPs are accessible and have good communication skills. There is, however, inadequate time in short consultations to provide the quality of care suggested by the latest review of services for patients with epilepsy (CSAG). This is further complicated by the heterogeneous and stigmatising nature of the condition. An improvement in the process of care in the primary-care setting can result from three important strategies: appropriately trained practice nurses running practice nurse-led clinics; structured management of care, possible because of the unique system of registration, which facilitates audit, prescription monitoring, and recall; and, finally, improved teamwork and communication based on protocols locally agreed upon between primary and secondary care.

Such disorders can arise as complications of acute brain injury, but most neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) providers do not receive formal training in cPOCUS. Caption artificial intelligence (AI) uses a novel deep learning (DL) algorithm to guide novice cPOCUS users in obtaining diagnostic-quality cardiac images. The primary objective of this study was to determine how often NICU providers with minimal cPOCUS experience capture quality images using DL-guided cPOCUS as well as the association between DL-guided cPOCUS and change in management and time to formal echocardiograms in the NICU. From September 2020 to November 2021, neurology-trained physician assistants, residents, and fellows used DL software to perform clinically indicated cPOCUS scans in an academic tertiary NICU. Certified echocardiographers evaluated each scan independently to assess the quality of images and global interpretability of left ventricular function, right ventricular function, inferior vena cava size, and presence of pericardial effusion. Descriptive statistics with exact confidence intervals were used to calculate proportions of obtained images that were of adequate quality and that changed management. Time to first adequate cardiac images (either cPOCUS or formal echocardiography) was compared using a similar population from 2018. In 153 patients, 184 scans were performed for a total of 943 image views. Three certified echocardiographers deemed 63.4% of scans as interpretable for a qualitative assessment of left ventricular size and function, 52.6% of scans as interpretable for right ventricular size and function, 34.8% of scans as interpretable for inferior vena cava size and variability, and 47.2% of scans as interpretable for the presence of pericardial effusion. Thirty-seven percent of screening scans changed management, most commonly adjusting fluid goals (81.2%). Time to first adequate cardiac images decreased significantly from 3.1 to 1.7 days (p < 0.001).

Thus, a resolve was made to increase the numbers of specialists by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) with the help of the Ministry of Health of Malaysia. A study was made to evaluate the number of referral centers needed in strategic parts of Malaysia.

Neuroimaging education is essential for enhancing these skills, typically provided through neurology residency programs and specialized neuroimaging fellowships. Neuroimaging training experience in neurology residency programs can be quite variable. Neurology residents typically gain substantial exposure to neuroimaging techniques through the sheer volume of cases they encounter during training, often under direct guidance of subspeciality neurologists. However, curriculum implementation and proper documentation of training often lacks consistency, and opportunities for advanced neuroimaging training are limited. The number of fellowship-trained neuroimaging specialists is insufficient to meet the growing demand for neuroimaging expertise. Credentialing and certification issues related to neuroimaging training for neurologists hinder the integration of qualified neurologists into the neuroimaging field. The need for additional years of specialized training, financial burden associated with maintaining certification, opposition by radiological societies, complexities of reimbursement which vary by insurer, region, and hospital policies are some of the challenges. This article explores these issues and suggests that solutions may include the establishment of more accredited neuroimaging fellowship programs or an increase in the neuroimaging component of subspecialty training, as well as addressing credentialing and hospital privileging issues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40739942/"}

This summary is based on the responses to a questionnaire that was sent to the persons in charge of education and training at 180 institutions affiliated with the Japanese Society of Neurology and 478 education and training institutions among Japanese city hospitals, excluding university hospitals and special research institutions. Replies were received from 305 hospitals, amounting to a response rate of 63.8%. The number of doctors working in the department of neurology was found to be low at 2 in 84 hospitals and 3 in 65 hospitals. The majority of neurologists at general hospitals are fully engaged in examining outpatients as well as inpatients, and they do not have adequate time for research, education and training and participation in the activities of academic associations. Of the 10 items cited in the questionnaire relating to the types of postgraduate neurology training desired by neurologists employed in general hospitals, the most common selections in order of decreasing frequency were improvement in the capacity to manage common disorders (such as headache, dizziness, numbness, etc.) diagnosed in the outpatient clinic, improvement in the capacity to diagnose the acute phase of cerebral apoplexy, further education about EEG (electroencephalogram) and EMG (electromyogram), and medical ethical issues such as informed consent. The views about postgraduate neurological education and training described in detail in writing by the respondents were as follows. 1) Neurologists required by a city general hospital Numerous respondents commented that the capacity to diagnose medical neurological diseases associated with internal (systemic) medical disorders is needed since there are remarkably few doctors in general hospitals whose interest is confined only to neurological diseases ranging from rare to common complaints. In contrast, neurologists whose knowledge and training derives from a wide clinical base of internal medicine are in great demand. 2) Points of disparity between postgraduate neurology training in a university hospital and neurologists required by a city general hospital In addition, many respondents expressed the view that under the medical school system, neuroscience and research are given a higher priority than the cultivation of clinical medical skills and although there may be keen academic interest in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, there is not necessarily the same level of keen interest in common diseases, hence the universities may be educating researchers effectively, but are not necessarily producing capable clinicians. 3) Measures that should be taken to address this difference in postgraduate neurology training between university and city general hospitals The university hospital is separated into research and clinical groups and the time has now come for a system of management under which a professor leads the research group and another professor leads the clinical group. There should be a clear-cut clarification of the responsible roles of university and city general hospitals in the postgraduate education and training of neurologists. Furthermore, the professional staff and facilities of general hospitals that are affiliated with universities should be upgraded and expanded to enable them to serve more effectively as sites of clinical education and training. The position and status of neurologists at city general hospitals should be raised to the same level as that of university professors and institutions affiliated with the Japanese Society of Neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11464485/"}

This neonate treatment proved unique when compared to rats lesioned as adults with 6-hydroxydopamine--prompting the discovery of differing functional characteristics resulting from the age at which brain dopamine is reduced. A realization was that neonate-lesioned rats modeled the loss of central dopamine and the increased susceptibility for self-injury in Lesch-Nyhan disease, which allowed identification of drugs useful in treating self-injury in mentally retarded patients. The neonate-lesioned rat has also been proposed to model the hyperactivity observed in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Because the neonate-lesioned rat exhibits enhanced sensitization to repeated NMDA receptor antagonist administration and has functional changes characteristic of schizophrenia, the neonate lesioning is believed to emulate the hypothesized NMDA hypofunction in this psychiatric disorder. Besides modeling features of neurological and psychiatric disorders, important neurobiological concepts emerged from pharmacological studies in the neonate-lesioned rats. One was the discovery of coupling of D1/D2-dopamine receptor function. Another was the progressive increase in responsiveness to repeated D1-dopamine agonist administration referred to as \"priming\" of D1-dopamine receptor function. Additionally, a unique profile of signaling protein expression related to neonate reduction of dopamine has been identified. Thus, from modeling characteristics of disease to defining adaptive mechanisms related to neonatal loss of dopamine, the neonate-lesioned rat has had a persisting influence on neuroscience. Despite an extraordinary legacy from studies of the neurobiology of this treatment, a host of unknowns remain that will inspire future investigations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15708628/"}

All three intensified therapy measures are increasingly applied in Germany. The mean age of therapy implementation is rising and more male than female patients receive treatments.

{"id": "26723231", "title": "Neuropharmacology beyond reductionism - A likely prospect.", "text": "Neuropharmacology had several major past successes, but the last few decades did not witness any leap forward in the drug treatment of brain disorders. Moreover, current drugs used in neurology and psychiatry alleviate the symptoms, while hardly curing any cause of disease, basically because the etiology of most neuro-psychic syndromes is but poorly known. This review argues that this largely derives from the unbalanced prevalence in neuroscience of the analytic reductionist approach, focused on the cellular and molecular level, while the understanding of integrated brain activities remains flimsier. The decline of drug discovery output in the last decades, quite obvious in neuropharmacology, coincided with the advent of the single target-focused search of potent ligands selective for a well-defined protein, deemed critical in a given pathology. However, all the widespread neuro-psychic troubles are multi-mechanistic and polygenic, their complex etiology making unsuited the single-target drug discovery. An evolving approach, based on systems biology considers that a disease expresses a disturbance of the network of interactions underlying organismic functions, rather than alteration of single molecular components. Accordingly, systems pharmacology seeks to restore a disturbed network via multi-targeted drugs. This review notices that neuropharmacology in fact relies on drugs which are multi-target, this feature having occurred just because those drugs were selected by phenotypic screening in vivo, or emerged from serendipitous clinical observations. The novel systems pharmacology aims, however, to devise ab initio multi-target drugs that will appropriately act on multiple molecular entities. Though this is a task much more complex than the single-target strategy, major informatics resources and computational tools for the systemic approach of drug discovery are already set forth and their rapid progress forecasts promising outcomes for neuropharmacology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26723231/"}

Vestibular disorders can be divided into peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Most of the peripheral vestibular disorders have a clinical diagnosis, and a thorough history and examination will often provide a clear direction as to the diagnosis. Correct diagnosis allows treatment for many of the peripheral and central vestibular disorders. As inner ear damage is generally irreversible, early diagnosis allowing prompt treatment is important. The aim of this review is to discuss some audiovestibular conditions that may well appear in a neurology clinic, and to discuss some recent advances within the audiovestibular field that may be of interest to neurologists.

{"id": "9492949", "title": "The cerebral ventricles, the animal spirits and the dawn of brain localization of function.", "text": "This paper reviews the early history of brain localization of function. It analyses the doctrines professed in ancient times by philosophers and physicians, who believed that brain functions were carried out in the cerebral ventricles by the psychic pneuma, or animal spirit, a sort of special and light substance endowed with the power to perform sensory, motor and mental activities. This theory, conceived in the Classic Age and called \"ventricular-pneumatic doctrine\", evolved in the 4th-5th centuries A.D. into the \"three-cell theory\", according to which each cerebral ventricle was the seat of a specific function, and contained a unique type of spirit with the power to perform that function. The three-cell theory represents the earliest attempt to localize different mind functions in separate brain sites and was held true by Byzantine, Arabian and Western Latin scholars well beyond the Renaissance. The paper is subdivided into an Introduction and eight sections. The first two sections report a brief history of the philosophical and medical doctrines about the pneuma as mediator of all vital functions, the ventricular-pneumatic doctrine elaborated by Galen of Pergamon, and his theory of nerve physiology based on the assumption that the pneuma, set in motion by active brain movements and flowing in the hollow nerves, could transfer sensations from the sense organs to the anterior ventricles, and motor commands from the posterior ventricle to the muscles. The third and fourth sections trace the ways in which these doctrines were transmitted to the Byzantine physicians and then to the Arabs, until they reached the Latin West. Here, throughout the Middle Ages they not only formed the background of medical and natural philosophy, but also influenced Christian theologians. The fifth section is devoted to the ventricular localization of mind faculties, called internal senses by Arabian and Western Latin scholars. Most authors recognized three basic internal senses: imagination, cognition and memory, and generally localized imagination in the anterior ventricle, cognition in the middle and memory in the posterior one, while other scholars adopted complex lists including up to seven faculties, each carried out by a specific type of animal spirit and localized, or sub-localized, in different ventricular sites according to complex topographical patterns. This section reports more than sixty patterns of ventricular localization from various authors (summarized in a Table), the rationale of complex ventricular localization, and the naive interpretations of Medieval physicians and surgeons of the impairment of the internal senses caused by brain disease and trauma. The sixth section deals with the decline of the three-cell theory, which was first challenged in the early 16th century and then drastically revised by several Renaissance and post-Renaissance experimentalists, anatomists and philosophers, although some remnants of the Galenic pneumatic neurophysiology survived in medicine until the 18th century. The penultimate section analyses bibliographical data on the earliest localizationists and shows that, independently of chronological priority, Nemesius of Emesa was the source of the pattern of ventricular localization of function adopted by later Byzantines and by the Arabs, and then transmitted to Latin Western scholars. The last section discusses the legacy of the three-cell theory to later generations of neuroscientists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9492949/"}

The positivist-behaviourist hegemony of the twentieth century involved an implicit devaluation of that which is essentially human. The influence of this tradition brings with it the risk of an understanding and treatment of mental illness which leaves out issues at the core of humanity. I suggest we need to recover something of the manner of thinking of the great figures in psychological thought who were writing before the rise of behaviourism and who were contributing to the origins of dynamic psychiatry. A study of the phenomena of human consciousness was central to their work.

Over the past 300 years, the history of gustatory sweating has included observations of typhus-induced parotiditis, war injuries, and occupational accidents. Despite religious and personal persecution, Lucja Frey (1889-1943) systematically investigated gustatory sweating. Following the discovery of a German World War II document regarding Lucja Frey, an international committee was organized to research the history of gustatory sweating and of Dr. Frey's contributions to the understanding of the syndrome. Twenty original scientific publications from 1700 to 1950 on gustatory sweating were reviewed. Frey was the first to describe gustatory sweating as a disorder of both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. She proposed novel pathologic and pharmacologic mechanisms to explain the syndrome. Subsequent discoveries, including the work of André-Thomas in 1927, have provided a more complete understanding of gustatory sweating and the pathologic mechanism of aberrant neuronal regeneration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12269550/"}

Quantitative methods in neuropathology.", "text": "The last decade has seen a considerable increase in the application of quantitative methods in the study of histological sections of brain tissue and especially in the study of neurodegenerative disease. These disorders are characterised by the deposition and aggregation of abnormal or misfolded proteins in the form of extracellular protein deposits such as senile plaques (SP) and intracellular inclusions such as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Quantification of brain lesions and studying the relationships between lesions and normal anatomical features of the brain, including neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels, has become an important method of elucidating disease pathogenesis. This review describes methods for quantifying the abundance of a histological feature such as density, frequency, and 'load' and the sampling methods by which quantitative measures can be obtained including plot/quadrant sampling, transect sampling, and the point-quarter method. In addition, methods for determining the spatial pattern of a histological feature, i.e., whether the feature is distributed at random, regularly, or is aggregated into clusters, are described. These methods include the use of the Poisson and binomial distributions, pattern analysis by regression, Fourier analysis, and methods based on mapped point patterns. Finally, the statistical methods available for studying the degree of spatial correlation between pathological lesions and neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels are described.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21225504/"}

This literary characterisation of insanity is endowed with a number of clinical connotations that suggest that Cervantes was quite familiar with certain elements of medicine; although such knowledge may well have come from relatives and friends, he also showed a personal interest in the mentally ill (there is evidence that he visited the Hospital de Inocentes--a mental asylum--in Seville). Likewise, it seems obvious that Cervantes was also familiar with several medical treatises concerning the neurosciences, which were very much in vogue in Spain in the late Renaissance period. In fact, his personal library included two works that, in addition to serving to inspire the Alcalá-born author on some points, are cited almost literally in some of his novels. These references are The Examination of Men's Wits, written by Juan Huarte de San Juan in 1575, and the annotated Spanish version of Dioscorides (On medical matters and mortal poisons) by Andrés Laguna, from 1555. Similarly, the clinical description of the main character in the novela ejemplar Vidriera, the Lawyer seems to have been taken from the medical tract Dignotio et cura affectuum melancholicorum (1569) by Alfonso de Santa Cruz. Lastly, it has also been suggested that, in the construction of his literature, Cervantes drew on the humanistic approaches advocated by Erasmus of Rotterdam in his In Praise of Folly (1509). These four works may have served as a source of medical information that allowed Cervantes to develop some of his characters and to write his accurate comments on therapeutic matters.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18428107/"}

After publication of the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II), need arose for revisions in the classification of medication overuse headache and chronic migraine. These changes made apparent a further need for broader revisions to the standard formulation of diagnostic criteria for the secondary headaches. Currently, the fourth criterion makes impossible the definitive diagnosis of a secondary headache until the underlying cause has resolved or been cured or greatly ameliorated by therapy, at which time the headache may no longer be present. Given that the main purpose of diagnostic criteria is to enable a diagnosis at the onset of a disease in order to guide treatment, this is unhelpful in clinical practice. In the present paper we propose maintaining a standard approach to the secondary headaches using a set of four criteria A, B, C and D, but we construct these so that the requirement for resolution or successful treatment is removed. The proposal for general diagnostic criteria for the secondary headaches will be entered into the internet-based version of the appendix of ICHD-II. During 2009 the Classification Committee will apply the general criteria to all the specific types of secondary headaches. These, and other changes, will be included in a revision of the entire classification entitled ICHD-IIR, expected to be published in 2010. ICHD-IIR will be printed and posted on the website and will be the official classification of the International Headache Society. Unfortunately, it will be necessary to translate ICHD-IIR into the many languages of the world, but the good news is that no major changes to the headache classification are then foreseen for the next 10 years. Until the printing of ICHD-IIR, the printed ICHD-II criteria remain in place for all other purposes. We issue a plea to the headache community to use and study these proposed general criteria for the secondary headaches in order to provide more evidence for their utility-before their incorporation in the main body of the classification.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19673917/"}

In 1910 Emil Kraepelin (Alois Alzheimer's superior) coined the term \"Alzheimer's disease\" to distinguish the presenile form of dementia from the more common senile variant. Alzheimer's findings were followed up, and soon a number of reports of similar cases appeared in the literature. During the time, both pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease became the gold standard for post-mortem diagnosis of the disease.

However, diagnosis of TBI, particularly in the emergency department (ED), can be difficult because the symptoms of TBI are vague and nonspecific, and patients with suspected TBI may present with additional injuries that require immediate medical attention. We performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate accuracy of TBI diagnosis in the ED. Records of 1641 patients presenting to the ED with suspected TBI and a head computed tomography (CT) were reviewed. We found only 47% of patients meeting the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for TBI received a documented ED diagnosis of TBI in medical records. After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, patients presenting at a level I trauma center, with cause of injury other than fall, without CT findings of TBI, and without loss of consciousness were more likely to lack documented diagnosis despite meeting diagnostic criteria for TBI. A greater proportion of patients without documented ED diagnosis of TBI were discharged home compared to those with a documented diagnosis of TBI (58% vs. 40%; p < 0.001). Together, these data suggest that many patients who have sustained a TBI are discharged home from the ED without a documented diagnosis of TBI, and that improved awareness and implementation of diagnostic criteria for TBI is important in the ED and for in- and outpatient providers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30351183/"}

We present a core curriculum outlining the clinical neurology skills and knowledge necessary to achieve that degree of preparation. The curriculum emphasizes general principles and a systematic approach to patients with neurologic symptoms and signs. The ability to perform and interpret the neurologic examination is fundamental to that approach, so the curriculum delineates the essential components of the examination in three different clinical settings. The focus of the curriculum is on symptom-based rather than disease-based learning. The only specific diseases selected for inclusion are conditions that are common or require urgent management. This curriculum has been approved by the national organization of neurology clerkship directors and endorsed by the major national professional organizations of neurologists. It is intended as a template for planning a neurology clerkship and as a benchmark for evaluating existing clerkships. It should be especially helpful to clerkship directors, neurology chairs, deans of medical education, and members of external accreditation groups.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11914397/"}

The neurology outpatient clinic is a pivotal setting for both initial consultations and follow-up visits. It plays a significant role in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing monitoring of neurological disorders, and is a critical platform for clinical education. Under the guidance of experienced physicians during their clinical rotations, medical students enhance their clinical reasoning ability and skills by learning about the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases, thereby laying a solid foundation for becoming competent doctors. Despite the advancements in this field, there is a lack of comprehensive reports on the current status and challenges of teaching neurology in outpatient settings. This gap significantly impedes the development of scientific policies to improve teaching standards. We need to clarify the existing issues to develop effective strategies, such as actively embracing advanced educational achievements and experiences, continuously refining teaching models and methods, and enhancing the quality of education, to cultivate more outstanding medical professionals.

He introduced in Britain the use of the ophthalmoscope in the neurological exploration and founded the journal Brain. He was specially interested in language disorders, paralysis, vertigo, mental disorders, cerebral tumours and above all epilepsy. He systematized what we today know as complex partial crisis, establishing the link between the function of the temporal lobe and the sensorial auras, automatism's, déjà-vu and jamais vu phenomena. He described the uncinate crisis, the topographic progression of the motor partial crisis and its posterior generalisation, establishing the motor pattern of cerebral cortex. The clinical observations of epileptic phenomena, with the influence of the evolutive ideas from Spencer, were the seeds for the elaboration of the evolutive development of the function of the nervous system. His theory about evolution and dissolution of the neurological functions was the starting point for Freud's clinical investigation.

In the nearly 20 years that have elapsed since the development of the initial American Academy of Neurology (AAN)-endorsed core curriculum for neurology clerkships, many medical school curricula have evolved to include self-directed learning, shortened foundational coursework, earlier clinical experiences, and increased utilization of longitudinal clerkships. A workgroup of both the Undergraduate Education Subcommittee and Consortium of Neurology Clerkship Directors of the AAN was formed to update the prior curriculum to ensure that the content is current and the format is consistent with evolving medical school curricula. The updated curriculum document replaces the term clerkship with experience, to allow for its use in nontraditional curricular structures. Other changes include a more streamlined list of symptom complexes, provision of a list of recommended clinical encounters, and incorporation of midrotation feedback. The hope is that these additions will provide a helpful resource to curriculum leaders in meeting national accreditation standards.

They advocate both integrated training for all residents in the two fields and a system of \"nested hierarchies\" to reclassify brain disorders according to their effect on levels of brain function. The unspoken premise of their article is that it is time for psychiatry and neurology to reunite.This Commentary takes the view that reuniting the long-separated specialties of neurology and psychiatry would not necessarily create better care for all patients with brain disorders but that trainees in both fields would benefit from increased training in the complementary specialty. The new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education clinical neuroscience milestones for psychiatry training and psychiatry milestones for neurology training are steps in the right direction. Increasing opportunities for combined neurology-psychiatry training will help create a cadre of specialists equipped to efficiently care for complex patients within emerging accountable care organizations.

In the sixteenth-century medical discourses, female hysteria was caused by excess pollution of the womb, with fluids that were labelled 'female sperm' as the probable cause. In the work of Shakespeare, there is a reference to hysterica passio, a term used by King Lear to self-diagnose his affliction. Shakespeare shows how a disease associated with women, and the 'wandering womb' phenomenon could have been spoken of in an associative way. At this time, there is a transformation of the nature of hysteria from a neurological consequence of the sick womb, to sexual deviance. Portrayals of the male deviant would evolve by the Victorian era, concurrent with the diagnosis of 'spermatorrhea'. There are very direct correspondences between the hysteria of spermatorrhea and the notion in Western medicine of the direct links between female hysteria and too much or not enough sexual energy release. Hysteria in both sexes was famously diagnosed and catalogued by Jean-Martin Charcot at the end of the nineteenth century.

Motor and somatosensory functions were initially localized in a broad frontoparietal region. At the beginning of the 20th century the motor cortex was restricted to the posterior frontal lobe. The separate attribution of somatosensory functions to the parietal lobe was initially based on anatomic considerations, but mostly on localized bodily sensations elicited by electric stimulation in awake patients. Patients and nonhuman primates with anterior parietal damage showed deficits in somatic sensation (tactile discrimination and position sense, less markedly pain and thermal sensitivity). Somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated in all mammals that the body is orderly and multiply represented in the anterior parietal cortex. The parietal lobe was divided into an anterior and a posterior cortex (PPC). The PPC is particularly developed in primates, where it includes a superior and an inferior parietal lobule. The PPC was initially thought to be a higher-order region for somatosensory information processing, but its functional specialization proved soon to be greater and more complex. PPC damage in humans gives rise to a variety of neuropsychologic disorders: pain asymbolia, sensory extinction, spatial neglect, optic ataxia and limb apraxia, alexia and agraphia. Single-neuron recordings in freely behaving monkeys furnished the complementary information that the PPC is involved in body-environment interactions, for visual exploration and hand use as a sensor and a tool. The PPC is now believed to underpin higher-order processes of sensory inputs, multisensory and sensorimotor integration, spatial attention, intention, and the conjoint representation of external space and the body. The symptoms in which disorders of these processes manifest after PPC damage are considerably different in humans and nonhuman primates.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29519464/"}

{"id": "20375529", "title": "Visual experiences of Blaise Pascal.", "text": "The writings of Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), mathematician, physicist, and theologian, are often thought of as an ideal example of classical French prose. In fact, Pascal's scientific contributions include the principle of hydrostatics, known as Pascal's Law. In mathematics, he helped develop the probability theory and also made significant contributions to the realization of infinite series and the geometry of curves. He is also considered one of the most important French philosophers principally due to his book entitled 'Pensées'. Pascal had a religious conversion in the 1650s and following this he devoted himself more to religion than science. There is evidence that Pascal suffered from visual migraines with recurring headaches, episodes of blindness in half of his visual field, zigzag, fortification spectra, and other visual hallucinations. It is believed that the migraine aura experiences might have acted as a source of inspiration for Pascal's philosophical reflections. Pascal's sudden religious conversion, probably the most decisive moment in Pascal's personal life, during the night of the 23rd to 24th of November 1654, was accompanied by a lighted vision which he interpreted as fire which brought him the total conviction of God's 'reality and presence'. This experience may have been based on the effects of a migraine aura attack. In fact, this spiritual experience led him to dedicate the rest of his life to religious and philosophical interests.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20375529/"}

These disorders can affect how individuals interact with their environment, and as a result, many ethical concerns may arise related to their medical care. Key ethical issues in neuropalliative care include shared decision-making, evolving autonomy and capacity, best interest and harm principles, beneficence and nonmaleficence, futile and inappropriate care, justice and equity, and ableism. The four core principles of medical ethics, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, and autonomy, are foundational in considering approaches to these ethical challenges. Shared decision-making is rooted in the principle of autonomy. Evolving autonomy and capacity evoke autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence. The best interest and harm principles are rooted in beneficence and nonmaleficence. Questions of futility and inappropriate care are founded in the principles of nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice. Ableism invokes questions of nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice. Practitioners of neurology will encounter ethical challenges in their practice. Framing decisions around the core ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice will help clinicians navigate challenging situations while acknowledging and respecting each patient's individual story.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38914125/"}

Simulator classes should be part of continuing medical education, generating advances that make it necessary for technical development and specialization in complex, complicated, or difficult-to-reproduce scenarios that students may face, based on clinical problems with negative feedback, allowing for learning from mistakes. The objective of the review is to identify the usefulness of simulation in teaching the new medicine. Using the PRISMA 2020 declaration, articles published in the last 5 years on simulation teaching in neurology were reviewed. These articles were sourced from databases such as PubMed, Mendeley, Wiley, Web of Science, Cochrane, Latindex, and Google Scholar. In the summary of results, only those studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for analysis. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials on medical education and training were selected. The analysis showed that simulation improved skill scores to support simulation-based medical diagnosis and treatment. Simulation-based education has demonstrated statistical benefits in learning, skill acquisition, feedback, and stress reduction, particularly in the specialties of ophthalmology, emergency medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology, providing great relevance to the present review. No study reported beneficial effects or effects on mortality: despite improved surgical skill times among participants, no statistically significant data were found on a reduction in operative complications.

Along with expanding molecular explanations for brain diseases, parallel and independent hypotheses based on morphological observations are particularly useful and necessary for reasonable understanding of the brain and its dysfunction. For example, with classical methods such as silver impregnations, it is possible to differentiate underlying molecular pathologies (three-repeat tau/Campbell-Switzer vs. four-repeat tau/Gallyas silver impregnation) for improved histological diagnosis. Innovations with 3D reconstruction not only provide more realistic reproduction of the targets but also allow quantitative measurement on a 3D basis (3D volumetry). Contrary to the prevailing impression that pathological deposits are generally toxic to cells, quantification demonstrated possible countertoxic potentials of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in CAG-repeat disorders on a two-dimensional basis and of glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy on 3D volumetry. Furthermore, 3D extension of neurites around target lesions is now traceable in relation to the relevant clinical consequences. This neurite neuropathology may pave the way for early specific diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, as established through (123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy for Parkinson disease, aiming at therapeutic intervention before depletion of mother neurons is feasible. For appropriate translation of sequence biology into the frame of human neuropathology, it is necessary to expand further the morphological dimensions so that comprehensive understanding of these disorders leads to specific diagnosis and treatment as early as possible.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21615512/"}

Direct medical/non-medical and indirect costs were computed. Population-based samples and national or regional registries were used. The Italian population expected with a brain disorder was 12.4 million in 2004. The highest cost per case was for tumours and multiple sclerosis; the lowest was for anxiety disorders and migraine. Dementia (8.6 billion euros), psychotic and affective disorders (18.7 billion euros), migraine (3.5 billion euros) and stroke (3.4 billion euros) represented the highest total costs. Direct medical costs were predominant for psychiatric and neurosurgical disorders, direct non-medical costs for dementia, and indirect costs for neurological disorders.

The exponential growth of genetic testing is due to its increased speed and decreasing cost, and it is now a routine part of the clinical care for a number of neurologic patients. In addition, phenotypic pleiotropy (mutations in the same gene causing very disparate phenotypes) and genetic heterogeneity (the same clinical phenotype resulting from mutations in different genes) are now known to exist in a number of conditions, adding an additional layer of complexity for genetic testing in these disorders. Although the growing complexity of technical knowledge in the ordering and interpretation of genetic tests makes it necessary for neurologists to consult medical geneticists, limitations in the availability of such professionals often means neurologists will be on the front line dealing with suspected or confirmed neurogenetic conditions. The growing availability of broad genetic testing through chromosomal microarray and next-generation sequencing and the expanded phenotypic spectrum of many conditions has implications for genetic counseling and medical management. This article discusses the various forms of genetic variability and how to test for each of them.

Seven physicians from 6 laboratories in Europe sent a total of 156 prospectively collected cases of PNP with electromyography (EMG) data including diagnosis (examination diagnosis) to the database. Each physician interpreted the electrophysiological data from all cases (interpretation diagnosis) and a final diagnosis was given at the consensus meetings of the group (consensus diagnosis). Comparison of each physician's examination diagnosis with his/her interpretation diagnosis, i.e. intra-physician variation, showed a change towards less classified PNPs (P < 0.05). Interpretation diagnoses showed large inter-physician variation in the classification of PNPs. The consensus group was more cautious than individual physicians in classifying PNPs as mixed and axonal. The probability of the consensus diagnosis increased with increasing number of abnormal motor and sensory segments tested.

The main disappointment is the broad chasm between the progress made in diagnostic methods and the low effectiveness of therapy in strokes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative neurological diseases. Many problems arose with the introduction of levodopa changing the course and clinical pattern of Parkinson's disease. The problem of our times are the adverse effects of pharmacotherapy.

Despite several advances in therapy in recent years, some problems such as the prognostic criteria are imperfectly understood. Several experimental trials of therapy in multiple sclerosis are in course in order to discover a successful treatment. Most of these research studies use a clinical rating scale named Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) as an evaluation tool for the effects of drugs. This scale is defined by a set of rules written in English which provide a numerical quantification of the neurological examination. Although EDSS has been widely used for almost 20 years, its application still depends on the interpretation of the neurologist who performs the neurological examination, and many applications of the scale performed by different neurologist on the same patient can give different results. This is a serious problem for international trials because they lack of a reliable measure of the effects of drugs. Here, we present an expert system for the automatic evaluation of EDSS in multiple sclerosis, which has been developed to overcome this problem. The expert system exploits an explicit representation of EDSS rules, it is able to explain its conclusions and it provides a revision tool to support the user if no satisfying solution can be reached.

This study was conducted to investigate nonreferral and nonacceptance to dialysis by primary care physicians (PCPs) and nephrologists in these countries. We surveyed a random sample of Canadian and US PCPs and nephrologists concerning their attitudes toward and experience with withholding dialysis in patients with advanced chronic renal failure. In response to a question about whether the physician believes there should be an age beyond which dialysis should not be offered, 12% of Canadian PCPs, 20% of US PCPs, 4% of Canadian nephrologists, and 9% of US nephrologists answered yes. When asked about their recommendations concerning dialysis initiation in 10 vignettes of patients with impending end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the responses of Canadian and US physicians were similar. PCPs compared with nephrologists were less likely to recommend dialysis in cases with physical illnesses and more likely to recommend it in cases with neuropsychiatric impairments. Over a 3-year period, 13% of Canadian PCPs and 19% of US PCPs reported nonreferral to dialysis at least once. Withholding rates were 25% for Canadian PCPs, 16% for US PCPs, 13% for Canadian nephrologists, and 17% for US nephrologists. We conclude that although nonreferral of patients who might benefit from dialysis still occurs, it does not seem to be common, and the attitudes of Canadian and US physicians toward this issue are similar and could not entirely account for the much greater incidence of treated ESRD in the United States.

On each, neuropsychiatry has been known to ally itself to a cause: currently it is the big business of neurobiology. This move can be seen as scientific progress or as a side-effect of the (professional rather than scientific) infighting that affected neuromedicine during the late 19(th) century and which led to the construction of the notion of \"neurological disease.\" Alienists responded to this variously: some, like Kahlbaum and Kraepelin accepted the split and returned to the more botanico approach; others, like Ziehen chose psychology; yet others, like Freud, delved in hermeneutics; lastly, there were those, like Meynert, Wernicke, Von Monakow, and Liepmann who sought an accommodation with neurology. Born out of this compromise, neuropsychiatry has remained a blurred activity (whose definitions range from \"psychiatry of neurology\" to a crusade for the \"naturalization of the mind\"). Neuropsychiatric assessment is a methodology designed to collect information about patients whose mental symptoms are thought to be caused by brain disease. When it first appeared, it was torn by the debate between \"nomothetic versus idiographic\" science. For a time, the neuropsychiatry assessment techniques stuck to the old personalized narratives characteristic of 19(th) century \"casenotes\" (trying to meet its descriptive, explanatory, therapeutic, legal, and ethical obligations). But during the late 19(th) century, measurement and quantification became part of the new rhetoric of science. Soon enough this affected psychology in general and neuropsychology in particular and neuropsychiatric assessment followed suit. It has changed little since except that now and again old tests and markers are replaced by more \"reliable\" ones and phenomenological data are squeezed out further. Its laudable enthusiasm for objectivity and truth was ab initio justified by 19(th) century Positivism; currently, it seems to be supported by a naïve version of Popperian falsificationism. In the meantime, the scientific worth of the neuropsychiatric assessment remains unclear; indeed, in an age of evidence-based medicine, it is surprising that both its informational and communicational value and its efficiency as a general epistemic tool have not been subjected to any serious empirical testing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11782886/"}

A survey of local neurologists was conducted, and legal opinion was sought from the Canadian Medical Protective Association. There were no studies directly assessing the risks of lumbar puncture in meningitis; however, all sources were culled for other pertinent information. No cases could be found of patients with acute meningitis deteriorating as a result of lumbar puncture. The neurologic consensus refuted the need for CT in typical acute meningitis. All sources stressed speedy lumbar puncture and the early institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy to minimize the severity of the illness and the risk of death.

We created a web-based survey regarding changes in clinical, research, and educational activity of neurology trainees in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures undertaken by local institutions to reduce the risk of contagion. Seventy-nine residents working in Italy completed the survey. A total of 87.3% of trainees reported a substantial reduction in their neurologic duties since COVID-19 appeared in Italy, and 17.8% were also recruited or volunteered for COVID-19-dedicated wards. Likewise, more than 60% of trainees experienced a reduction or interruption in research activity. As regards the perceived effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on their neurologic training, almost 70% of surveyed trainees believe that the COVID-19 pandemic had or will have a negative effect on their formation as neurologists, for different reasons. Furthermore, trainees reported a consistent exposure (69.6%) to confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at work, with divergent surveillance and preventive measures taken by local institutions. Overall, the survey shows that the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy has had a subjective negative effect on neurology residents on didactics, clinical, and research training as well as training abroad. The COVID-19 outbreak poses many challenges to academic institutions and training programs, and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to ensure continued quality of trainees' neurologic education.

Medical students from the University of Bordeaux were recruited during their 4-year course at the beginning of the academic education program in psychiatry. Medical students who were concomitantly in a clinical posting in wards of psychiatry or neurology were invited to participate in the study. The medical student version of the scale Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) was used to measure their attitudes towards psychiatry and persons with psychiatric disorder. This 16-item scale is designed to measure attitudes of health care professionals towards people with mental illness, a higher score indicating more stigmatizing attitudes. Items exploring history of psychiatric disorders in close persons were added at the end of the MICA scale. The questionnaire was completed twice by each student, at the beginning and the end of the 11-week clinical posting. All questionnaires were strictly anonymized. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify the variables independently associated with MICA total score. At the beginning of the education program and clinical posting, 174 students completed the MICA scale: the mean MICA total score was equal to 46.4 (SD 6.9) in students in clinical posting in psychiatry (n=72) and 45.1 (SD 7.01) in those in neurology (n=102). At the end of the academic and clinical training, 138 students again completed the questionnaire, with mean MICA total scores equal to 41.4 (SD 8.1) in students in clinical posting in psychiatry (n=51) and 43.5 (SD 7.3) in those in neurology (n=87). Multivariate analyses showed that lower total MICA scores were independently associated with the time of assessment (lower scores at the end of education program and clinical posting) (b=-2.8; P=0.001), female gender (b=-1.8; P=0.03) and history of a psychiatric disorder in a close person (b=-1.92; P=0.02). Type of clinical posting (psychiatry vs. neurology) was not independently associated with MICA total scores (b=-0.02; P=0.98). A significant interaction was found between the variables \"time of assessment\" and \"type of clinical posting\" (P=0.05): stratified analyses showed that MICA total scores decreased significantly only when the clinical posting was in psychiatry (b=-4.66; P=0.001), with no significant change in medical students in neurology wards (b=-1.45; P=0.16). Stigmatizing attitudes of medical students towards psychiatry and psychiatric disorders are reduced by an education program in psychiatry, with a positive impact more marked when the education program is concomitant to a clinical posting in psychiatry. As future health professionals in charge of persons with psychiatric disorders, medical students are key targets of actions aimed at reducing stigma towards mental health disorders. It is hence of great importance to promote clinical training in psychiatric wards during medical studies for all future practitioners, irrespective of their future specialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28606624/"}

The European Committee of Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) have joined forces to meet this need. The objective was to develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment of people with MS to guide healthcare professionals in the decision-making process. This guideline has been developed using the GRADE methodology and following the recently updated EAN recommendations for guideline development. Clinical questions were formulated in PICO format (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) and outcomes were prioritized according to their relevance to clinical practice. An exhaustive literature search up to December 2016 was performed for each question and the evidence is presented narratively and, when possible, combined in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. The quality of evidence for each outcome was rated into four categories - very high, high, low and very low - according to the risk of bias. GRADE evidence profiles were created using GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro) software (Version 3.6). The recommendations with assigned strength (strong, weak) were formulated based on the quality of evidence and the risk-benefit balance. Consensus between the panellists was reached by use of the modified nominal group technique. A total of 10 questions have been agreed, encompassing treatment efficacy, response criteria, strategies to address suboptimal response and safety concerns and treatment strategies in MS and pregnancy.

Seventy-four cases that were referred to the specialist neurology clinic with complaints of chronic and recurrent headaches without focal neurological deficit that had CT scan were reviewed consecutively using the short form of the International Classification of Headache Disorders second edition (ICHD 2) criteria after their demographics of age, sex were captured, to find out the proportion and characteristics of study cases that had identifiable cranial lesions on cranial CT scan. All cases were reviewed by a specialist Neurologist before CT scan and all CT films were reviewed by a specialist Radiologist. Age, sex and the distribution of CT findings were described from a frequency table and mean age of study cases with and without identifiable lesions on CT were compared with t-test for any significant difference and the effect of gender on the presence of identifiable lesions was tested with chi square and the agreement between clinical and CT diagnoses were tested on kappa statistics.

For training on the objective assessment of dyskinesia, seventy PD patients spanning the gamut of dyskinesias (none to severe) were videotaped during four tasks of daily living (speaking, drinking from a cup, putting on a coat, and walking). Dyskinesia severity in seven body parts was rated by 20 international movement disorder specialists using the UDysRS for impairment. Each task was also rated for disability. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with generalized weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients. For the teaching program, examples of each severity level and each body part were selected based on the criterion that they received a uniform rating (+/- 1 point) by at least 75% of the raters. For the certification exercise, four cases were selected to represent the four quartiles of overall objective UDysRS scores to reflect slight, mild, moderate, and severe dyskinesia. Each selection was based on the highest inter-rater reliability score for that quartile (minimum kappa or intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.6).

Most importantly, the possibility to study these parameters in the same subject repeatedly over time makes molecular imaging an attractive technology to obtain reliable data and to safe recourse; for example, molecular imaging enables the assessment of an exogenously introduced therapeutic gene and the related alterations of endogenously regulated gene functions directly in the same subject.

The 270 Neurological Care Units in Italy (of which 243 open to the emergency care) are equipped with an average number of 7.7 neurologists per unit, inadequate to ensure on duty care 24 h a day, 7 days a week. In addition, the mean age of hospital neurologists is quite high, with provision for large retirement. It is therefore required to increase in the next few years the number of neurologists by at least 30 %, with an increase of 562 units. To meet the need for neurology specialists committed to hospital care in Italy is also necessary to increase the number of scholarships for residents in post-graduate schools.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23619531/"}

Concerted efforts should be made to pinpoint major gaps in knowledge in healthcare professionals to facilitate better educational policies in headache training. The aim of this study was to identify deficiencies and barriers in headache training among residents in neurology in Denmark. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey of residents in neurology in Denmark from April 2019 to September 2019. The survey included questions on participant demographics, knowledge of and barriers in headache disorders, guidelines and diagnostic tools usage, contact with primary and tertiary care, medication overuse, and non-pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, respondents were asked to provide a ranked list from most to least interesting for six sub-specializations/disorders, i.e., cerebrovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, headache, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease. Sixty (40%) out of estimated a population of ~ 150 resident across Denmark accepted the invitation. Of these, 54/60 (90%) completed the survey. Although two-thirds, 35/54 (65%), of the respondents had prior formalized training in headache disorders, we identified gaps in all explored domains including diagnosis, management, and referral patterns. Particularly, there was an inconsistent use of guidelines and diagnostic criteria from the Danish Headache Society (2.74 (± 1.14)), the Danish Neurological Society (3.15 (± 0.86)), and the International Classification of Headache Disorders (2.33 (± 1.08)); 1: never/have not heard of, 4: always. Headache was ranked second to last out of six sub-specializations in interest. Overall knowledge on headache disorders amongst neurology residents in Denmark do not meet the expectations set out by national and international recommendations. Stakeholders should make strategic initiatives for structured education in headache for improved clinical outcomes in parallel with costs reduction through resource optimization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35365132/"}

NIRVE also facilitates resident exchanges among participating sites. In this descriptive article, we report NIRVE's structure and its cumulative productivity. Since its creation, NIRVE has held more than 90 videoconference rounds and has connected 16 sites in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. We describe challenges encountered since the inception of the program eleven years ago. NIRVE also fosters a culture of long-term international connection and collaboration. During global disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, videoconference rounds serve as a sustainable alternative means to deliver education. Future goals include increasing the number of sites involved, including a focus on Africa and Asia, and fostering resident-led advocacy projects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33223147/"}

The response rate was 16.9%. Analysis of the responses showed that 46% of the neurologists were aware of the term \"carry-over\" in epilepsy care, and 78% felt difficulties with epilepsy care in general. The most common reasons included \"not familiar with interpreting EEG\" and \"not familiar with the laws, regulations and medical and welfare systems specific to epilepsy\". Among the neurologists who felt difficulties when accepting epilepsy patients aged 20 years or older referred from the pediatric department, 68% had experienced accepting these patients. The two major reasons for feeling difficulties when accepting these patients were \"difficult to have good understanding of the disease course from infancy\" and \"not familiar with the epilepsy syndrome specific to infancy\". The above findings highlight the importance of recognizing the existence of the issue of carry-over in adult epilepsy care and its significance, and to resolve the factors that hinder the transition of care.

He was the author of over 200 published articles and 20 books on neurology including his pioneer work on developmental dyslexia, the parietal lobe, cerebral hemisphere dominance and aphasiology. He also published articles on migraine, epilepsy, dementia, visual perseveration, anterior cerebral artery syndromes, indifference to pain, sleep disorders, movement disorders, and myotonia. He was very erudite and talented in linguistics; his interests were broad and eclectic. He wrote extensively on non-medical topics, such as plays, horror stories, mythology, and biographies of distinguished neuroscientists, philosophers or artists. His articles were written in the elegant prose style with thorough reference citations and extensive reviews of the literature worldwide. He was born in Bristol in 1900. From an early age, he was fascinated with the functioning brain and retained a life-long interest in languages. He was appointed to the Consultant staff of the National Hospital, Queen Square, and to King's College Hospital at the age of 27, and was elected to become FRCP at 30. He was Dean of the Institute of Neurology from 1948 to 1953. When I was studying advanced neurology at Queen Square in 1960-1961, I was fascinated by his outstanding lectures on Huntington's Disease and Non-verbal Communication. Although he did not read the manuscripts and used only a few slides for illustrations in his lectures, he could describe the details of historical accounts and relevant figures. He was an altruistic, instructive teacher with keen attention to responses from the audience. His clinical demonstrations, teaching rounds and tutorials were hugely popular among postgraduate students from all over the world. He emphasized the importance of shrewd observation and careful history taking in neurological practice. Macdonald Critchley was President of the World Federation of Neurology (1965-1973) and Editor of Journal of the Neurological Sciences. I met him at the 2nd Asian and Oceanian Congress of Neurology held in Melbourne in 1967. He was interested to know more about aphasia and dyslexia among people speaking and reading Chinese. He kindly invited me to speak on 'Linguistic Implications of Chinese Characters' at the meeting of the Research Group on Developmental Dyslexia in Dallas. Critchley's prominent achievements in teaching, writings and research on neurology derived from his creative thinking, powers of shrewd observation, wide knowledge of literature, and indefatigable assiduity in scientific pursuits. He died peacefully at home at the age of 97 and entered the pantheon of distinguished neuroscientists of the 20th century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18686654/"}

Our goal was to engage clinical and engineering experts to develop guiding principles for creating a pediatric neurology intensive care unit (neuroPICU) monitor that integrates and displays data from multiple sources in an intuitive and informative manner. To accomplish this goal, an international group of physicians and engineers communicated regularly for one year. We integrated findings from clinical observations, interviews, a survey, signal processing, and visualization exercises to develop a concept for a neuroPICU display. Key conclusions from our efforts include: (1) A neuroPICU display should support (a) rapid review of retrospective time series (i.e. cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic physiology data), (b) rapidly modifiable formats for viewing that data according to the specialty of the reviewer, and (c) communication of the degree of risk of clinical decline. (2) Specialized visualizations of physiologic parameters can highlight abnormalities in multivariable temporal data. Examples include 3-D stacked spider plots and color coded time series plots. (3) Visual summaries of EEG with spectral tools (i.e. hemispheric asymmetry and median power) can highlight seizures via patient-specific \"fingerprints.\" (4) Intuitive displays should emphasize subsets of physiology and processed EEG data to provide a rapid gestalt of the current status and medical stability of a patient.

Great advances have been made in the construction of vectors of expression and carriers of viral genes, thus work is starting on the characterization of target cells for neuronal genetic therapy. As a result of advances in this field, two methods of genetic transference have evolved. One, 'in vivo', involves transfection of genetic material by means of chemical or viral agents. The 'ex vivo' variant depends on manipulation of culture cells to subsequently inject them into the host organism with a view to correcting the cell phenotype. Both methods have been used in preliminary experiments designed to test the efficacy of genetic transference for improvement of dysfunction of the nervous system. At the present time there is much experimentation with the use of genetic transference using modified cells to synthetize growth factors or key enzymes of the neurotransmission process in biomodels of Parkinsonism and Alzheimer amongst other conditions. Genetic therapy, as is shown in this review, has great therapeutic potential for nervous diseases which are very severe and complex. There is certainly a long way to go to perfect these techniques, particularly with regard to biological security and regulation of the element transferred.

Both groups of doctors professed a greater understanding of epilepsy than NEAD (p<.001). Psychiatrists alone believed epilepsy to be more chronic than NEAD (p=.002). Psychiatrists felt that epilepsy had less of an emotional impact on patients (p=.004) and were more likely to endorse psychological causes for epilepsy (p=.008) when compared to neurologists. Psychiatrists felt that NEAD had less negative consequences (p=.014) and were more likely to endorse nonpsychological causes for NEAD (p=.020) when compared to neurologists. The IPQ-R and Symptom Attribution Question demonstrated important differences in attitudes of neurologists and psychiatrists towards epilepsy and NEAD. Different attitudes towards the two seizure disorders may cause problems with communication and treatment if patients are referred from one speciality to the other.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22024729/"}

Hermann Oppenheim. At Oppenheim's instigation, Hoppe published the pathology of a case that Oppenheim had diagnosed during life; he collected all the reported similar cases and tried to establish a symptom-complex, for which he was given credit in Oppenheim's great neurology textbook of 1894. Upon his return to Cincinnati, Ohio, Hoppe's European experience qualified him as a specialist in nervous and mental diseases. His private practice of \"neuropsychiatry\" was his main occupation, but he also volunteered to teach as Professor of Nervous and Mental Diseases at the University of Cincinnati. In 1901 Oppenheim published the first monograph about what he called \"Die Myasthenische Paralyse (Bulbarparalyse ohne anatomischen Befund)\", summarizing 60 cases described in the medical literature up to that time. Hoppe, on the other hand, wrote on myasthenia gravis only once again, a review article in 1914 in a Cincinnati weekly, giving Oppenheim credit for the establishment of the disease as a clinical entity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12953619/"}

Throughout most of its recorded history of 3 to 4 millennia epilepsy has been viewed as a supernatural or mental disorder. Although first suggested by Hippocrates in the 5th century B.C., the concept of epilepsy as a brain disorder only began to take root in the 17th and 18th centuries. The discipline of neurology emerged from \"nervous disorders\" or neuropsychiatry in the late 19th century, when vascular theories of epilepsy predominated. By the turn of the 19th century psychiatry and neurology were diverging and epilepsy remained to some extent in both disciplines. It was only in the middle of the 20th century with the development of electromagnetic theories of epilepsy that the concept of epilepsy per se as a neurological disorder was finally adopted in international classifications of disease. This was associated with a refined definition of the ictal, pre-, post-, and interictal psychological disorders of epilepsy, which have contributed to a renaissance of neuropsychiatry. At the beginning of the 21st century and the centenary of the ILAE psychiatry and neurology have been converging again, led in some respects by epilepsy, which has provided several useful models of mental illness and a bridge between the two disciplines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19298432/"}

There is a disparity in the number of clinicians specially trained to treat patients with headache disorders and the number of people who have them. Early education and exposure to headache medicine is crucial to address this disparity. However, the current state of headache education within medical schools across the United States and Canada is unknown. The authors created a medical student headache education survey, which is a 20-question REDCap survey that was distributed via email to the neurology clerkship director, curriculum dean, or similar role at each US and Canadian MD or DO conferring medical school. The email listserv was created using the American Academy of Neurology Clerkship Directory, the Association of American Medical Colleges Organization Directory, the American Association of College of Osteopathic Medicine Organization Directory, manual searches of the institutions' websites, and phone calls and emails to administrators as needed. Of the 249 individuals contacted, 78 completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 31.3%. Of those responses, 84.6% of respondents (66/78) reported that their institution has at least one mandatory session on headache disorders. Many of these sessions (72.7% (48/78)) occurred during preclinical training, and 74.2% (49/78) occurred as part of the clinical curricula. Of respondents, 44.9% (39/78) reported that their institutions coordinate headache education across training levels (i.e., from preclinical to clinical), and only 17.9% (14/78) coordinate across clinical rotations. The most common topics covered were headache red flags, migraine, pharmacologic management, and differentiating primary versus secondary headache. 65.4% of respondents (51/78) felt that the preclinical headache curriculum prepares their students for the clinical experience, and 55.1% (43/78) felt that medical students were learning enough about headache medicine at their institution. Barriers to educating medical students about headache included insufficient time during courses, lack of administrative support in curricula development, lack of available resources, and lack of student interest. Case-based learning modules and online lectures were the most desired educational materials to improve medical student headache education at their institution. The majority of medical schools report incorporating headache medicine education into preclinical or clinical curricula and cover a range of topics in headache medicine. Yet there remains a lack of consistency, with some reporting limited headache education, citing barriers such as lack of administrative support and available educational resources. There is also variation in what is being taught at the medical student level. Future projects should aim to address said barriers, with the goal of providing a standardized headache medicine curriculum for use across medical schools.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34184273/"}

He described the two implicit-memory phenomena which are today called \"priming effects\" and \"skill learning\". Edouard Claparède also showed the influence of the implicit and explicit memories in recognition. His approach places him in the tradition of the multisystem theories of the memory: he made a distinction between habits and memories and then integrated the idea of familiar knowledge in this architecture of the memory, which is very close to that of Tulving (1985). Moreover, the importance that he gaves to perceptive data in recognition and the self in voluntary recall bring to mind the more recent distinction between data-driven and concept-driven processes in functional theories of memory. This integration of the two approaches, the structural and functional, must place Edouard Claparède among the most important precursors of the theories of human memory.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9033952/"}

Cushing arranged for Viets to take a fellowship in Oxford in the year after his graduation. With Cushing's recommendation, he lived with Sir William and Lady Osler and did research with the famous neurologist Sir Charles Sherrington. Viets was in London in 1935 when he heard about the remarkable success of Mary Walker in treating myasthenia gravis, first with physostigmine and then with neostigmine (Prostigmin). Securing an ampoule of this drug, he took it to the Massachusetts General Hospital where he was an attending neurologist and in March 1935 injected it into a myasthenic patient with great success. He established the first Myasthenia Gravis clinic in the world and was a pioneer in the treatment of this once obscure disease; he evaluated hundreds of patients and published many articles on myasthenia. He continued this association for more than 30 years. Under the tutelage of Cushing and Osler, Viets became a medical historian and bibliophile, publishing hundreds of articles and several books on many different subjects in the history of medicine. He was a president of the American Association for the History of Medicine and curator of the Boston Medical Library that eventually joined with the Harvard Medical School Library.

The aim of this study was to investigate the medical students' attitudes and emotions towards neurology before and after the four week clinical course at two Finnish Universities in order to find elements to improve effective learning by decreasing the emotional stress in medical studies. In this two-stage study, 58 medical students participated in an internet survey with open-ended questions after completing a clinical neurology course. In the content analysis of this survey 20 students (35%) were identified with negative anticipation towards neurology before undertaking the clinical neurology course. In the second phase of the study, the narrative analysis method was used to analyse the face-to-face interviews. Two of these interviews are described in this paper and represent cases who expressed negative emotions in both online survey and narrative interview. According to the content analysis, the principal emotions that were experienced at the beginning of the clinical neurology course were insecurity about personal performance (n = 19, 95%) anxiety (n = 9, 45%) and fear (n = 6, 30%). During the course the combined negative emotions (insecurity, anxiety, and fear) decreased in 80% of students (16/20 cases), remained unchanged in 15% (3/20) and could not be evaluated in 1 (5%) case. The main reasons for the observed negative anticipation were the complexity of neurology and challenges in the interpretation of clinical findings. Based on content analysis and narratives, elements that were evaluated as the most significant contributors in reducing this included small group teaching with real patients, teachers' expertise and the increase in self-confidence. Teaching with appropriate didactic methodology and feedback, and plenty of practical training can improve effective learning in neurology. We suggest that the pedagogic competence of the clinical teacher influences a student's motivation and proficiency and reduce stress in neurology-related learning tasks.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28376787/"}

Students emphasized the importance of making stronger links between the 2 disciplines for their learning and to improve patient care; however, they did not observe this clinical approach in the workplace.

This enlargement of etiopathogenic concepts, including biperspective observation, occurred in the fields of internal medicine (Gustav von Bergmann), psychiatry (Erwin Straus), and neurology (Kurt Goldstein). In the light of Goldsteins's understanding of the Babinski phenomenon, the present paper seeks to show what fundamental questions spring from a theory of the human organism that takes into account both morphe and structure and function.

Their phagocytic capacity is exercised during the brain remodelling that marks brain maturation. They then convert to the ramified resting microglial cell visualized in the silver carbonate staining technique of Hortega and by modern lectin-binding methods. In response to injury, reactive microglia exhibit hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and may or may not go on to form typical lipid-laden phagocytes. Activated microglia show upregulation of the many marker antigens they share with circulating monocytes, including the major histocompatibility class (MHC) class II antigens that bespeak their immunocompetent nature. However, MHC class I and II expression and development of immunohistochemical positivity for cytoplasmic and plasma membrane antigens that characterize the monocyte-macrophage do not necessarily indicate an immunological response though there is ample evidence that microglia can serve as antigen-presenting cells. Rather, microglia are extraordinarily sensitive to changes in the brain microenvironment, whatever the nature of the exciting mechanism or substance. They may be considered to serve an ever alert, protective and supportive function that can be assembled rapidly to deal with infections, physical injuries, physiologic changes and systemic influences. In addition to elaboration and secretion of cytokines with varied actions, e.g., suppression of astrogliosis, they secrete factors, including nerve growth factor, which are supportive of neurons. They have an important role in iron metabolism and the storage of iron and ferritin. They may promote central nervous system regeneration. They are prominently involved in such pathologic processes as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, multiple sclerosis, prion diseases and the degenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. With aging, they grow more numerous, become richer in iron and ferritin and exhibit phenotypic alteration, e.g., the expression of MHC class II antigens that are not ordinarily demonstrable immunohistochemically in the resting state.

Admission and discharge scores were generated for the BI and the three scales of the FIM (total, motor, and cognitive). Appropriateness of the measures to the study samples was determined by examining score distributions, floor and ceiling effects. Responsiveness was determined using an effect size calculation. The BI, FIM total, and FIM motor scales show good variability and have small floor and ceiling effects in the study samples. The FIM cognitive scale showed a notable ceiling effect in patients with multiple sclerosis. Comparable effect sizes were found for the BI, and two FIM scales (total and motor) in both patients with multiple sclerosis and stroke patients. All measures were appropriate to the study sample. The FIM cognitive scale, however, has limited usefulness as an outcome measure in progressive multiple sclerosis.

All neurologists coordinated findings from the 3 domains to arrive at a final diagnosis. This practice of coordination varied across common disease categories (e.g., meningitis vs dementia). To codify this variance, we developed a provisional model of diagnostic practice derived from the data consisting of a 3-point coordinate shorthand (Cx Lx Nx) and a graphic. This model shows the relative emphasis of each of the 3 core domains for 9 common diagnoses (e.g., stroke is C4 L1 N4 with \"4\" as the highest priority per domain). The data reveal a heavy emphasis on the clinical domain for most diagnoses. The model may be useful for trainees to learn how to allocate time to make a diagnosis. It may help educators build curricula and evaluation systems that emphasize concrete activities of diagnostic practice. Lastly, our model provides a structure to teach resource utilization and cost containment relating to neurologic diagnoses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24049130/"}

In addition, the proper eponymic designation for the provocative positioning test used to diagnose BPPV has been unclear, because authors use a variety of different terms, including Bárány, Nylén-Bárány, Nylén, Hallpike, Hallpike-Dix, and Dix-Hallpike to refer to the procedure in current use. Based on a review of the extant medical literature, Bárány was the first to describe the condition in detail, and Dix and Hallpike were the first to clearly describe both the currently used provocative positioning technique and the essential clinical manifestations of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo elicited by that technique. Nevertheless, despite their important contributions, neither Bárány nor Dix and Hallpike understood the pathophysiology of BPPV nor did they appreciate that the positioning techniques they used actually demonstrated pathology in the semicircular canals rather than the utricle. The modern understanding of the pathophysiology of BPPV began with Schuknecht's proposal that the dysfunction resulted from the gravity-dependent movement of loose or fixed dense material within the posterior semicircular canal (\"cupulolithiasis\"). Although Schuknecht's formulations were not consistent with all clinical features of the disease, they led to the modern \"canalolithiasis theory\" and highly effective canalith repositioning or \"liberatory\" maneuvers for BPPV.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9153438/"}

This transformative methodology concentrates on the exonic portions of DNA, which constitute approximately 1% of the human genome, thus facilitating an expedited and efficient sequencing process. WES has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, neuro-oncology, cerebrovascular disorders, and epilepsy by revealing rare variants and novel mutations and providing intricate insights into their genetic complexities. This has been achieved while maintaining a substantial diagnostic yield, thereby offering novel perspectives on the pathophysiology and personalized management of these conditions. The utilization of WES boasts several advantages over alternative genetic sequencing methodologies, including cost-effectiveness, reduced incidental findings, simplified analysis and interpretation process, and reduced computational demands. However, despite its benefits, there are challenges, such as the interpretation of variants of unknown significance, cost considerations, and limited accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Additionally, ethical, legal, and social concerns are raised, particularly in the context of incidental findings and patient consent.

This revolutionary shift has left a lasting impact on the field of neurology in Brazil. The current review article examines key developments and milestones achieved in Brazil through the application of WES in neurology and discusses forthcoming challenges and essential steps to advance molecular diagnosis. Several studies report the use of WES to diagnose genetic disorders with neurological manifestations in Brazil, underscoring the growing importance of molecular diagnosis in neurogenetics. These studies often provide detailed phenotypic analyses and clinical descriptions, offering valuable insights into the genetic underpinnings of several neurological conditions. Many reports highlight the use of WES in the investigation of complex neurological conditions in Brazil, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, hereditary spastic paraplegia, movement disorders, and ataxia. The discovery of new genes implicated in monogenic diseases with neurological manifestations through WES was a significant breakthrough. Despite these advances, the availability of large cohort studies on rare diseases in Brazil remains limited, hindering the ability to generalize findings and explore the full spectrum of genetic diversity. However, a few larger cohort studies have substantially contributed to our understanding of rare diseases and specific neurological disorders.While WES has limitations and may eventually be supplanted by more advanced diagnostic tools, it left a permanent mark on the neurology field in Brazil.

Several of the most promising new approaches include oncogenic signal transduction inhibition, angiogenesis inhibition, targeting canonical stem cell pathways in glioblastoma stem cells, and immunotherapy. As promising as many of these approaches appear, they have not had an impact yet on the natural history of the disease or on patient long-term outcomes.

We hypothesized that during the 19th century, conflict between psychiatrists and neurologists over control of treatment of the mentally ill fueled a misunderstanding of the nature of MS which led neurologists to treat diseases of the body, and psychiatrists, diseases of the mind. The importance of cognitive deficits in MS was thus minimized until scientific breakthroughs could once again bring them to light.

Thus, we posit that managing the crisis in chronic pain care in the United States is contingent upon the development of a multi-focal healthcare paradigm that more thoroughly enables and fortifies research, its translation (in education and practice), and the implementation of, and support for, both the curative and healing approaches in medicine in general, and pain care specifically. These steps necessitate re-examination, if not revision of the health care system and its economics. The ethical imperative to consider and prudently employ cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic technologies in pain medicine is obligatory. However, \"supply side prudence\" is of little value if \"demand side accessibility\" is lacking. Revisions to health insurance plans advocated by the in-coming administration seek to create uniformity in basic health care services based upon re-assessment of the clinical effectiveness (versus merely cost) of treatments, including those that are \"high tech.\" These plans attempt to allow every patient a more complete ability to deliberatively work with physicians to access those services and resources that maximize health functioning and goals. But even given these revisions, authentic pain care must take into account the interactive contexts of the painient individual. The biopsychosocial model of chronic pain management may have significant practical and ethical worth in this regard. A system of pain treatment operating from a biopsychosocial perspective necessitates integrative multi-disciplinarity. We propose a tiered, multi-disciplinary paradigm based upon the differing needs of each specific patient. But establishing such a system does not guarantee access, and distribution of these services and resources requires economic support to ensure that capabilities are more broadly available (i.e., supplied), and afforded as needed and wanted (i.e., demanded). Toward this end, we posit the need to focus upon, and more fully integrate 1) education, 2) multi-disciplinary care (including re-vivification of MPCs), 3) policies that allow financial subsidies that afford patients the latitude to access and utilize such expanded resources appropriately to meet identified medical needs, and 4) medico-legal initiatives and statutes that protect and enable patients and physicians. The proposed changes comport with a number of ethical systems in that they support the basic deontic structure of the profession and allow for a richer, more finely grained articulation of clinical and ethical responsibilities within the scope of particular general, specialty, and sub-specialty practices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19057625/"}

Here we evaluated the current state of education, clinical skills and postgraduate educational preferences on ANS disorders of European neurology residents and consultants. A 23-item questionnaire was developed and distributed online amongst European neurology residents and consultants via mailing lists of the European Academy of Neurology. The questions assessed demographics, current training opportunities and learning preferences in ANS disorders. Six multiple-choice questions were used to self-evaluate knowledge of ANS disorders. In all, 285 individuals answered the survey (60% female, mostly 25-34 years of age). All respondents considered clinical autonomic skills necessary for good clinical neurological practice, and 92% would like to increase their ANS knowledge. Female respondents and those who trained in Southern/Eastern/Greater Europe more frequently judged ANS skills important for clinical practice than male respondents (p = 0.012) and respondents from Northern/Western Europe (p = 0.011). Female and younger respondents felt less confident in managing ANS disorders (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Respondents below 45 years of age (p < 0.001) and those with lower confidence in managing ANS disorders (p = 0.004) were more likely to recommend that ANS education is embedded in the residency curriculum.

As well, the role of sex and gonadal hormones in altering the risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) was only beginning to be elucidated. Preliminary investigations suggested that estrogen-containing therapies typically given for the management of disruptive menopausal symptoms could reduce AD risk, attenuate disease-associated cognitive deficits, and modulate brain substrates known to be dysregulated by the condition, such as the cholingeric system. The findings from our seminal paper demonstrating cognitive benefits and cholinergic impacts with exogenous estrogen treatment in a rodent model of surgical hormone depletion provided initial support for use of estrogen-containing therapies as a treatment for age-related brain disorders. We then went on to demonstrate neuroprotective actions of estrogen in several other in vivo and in vitro models of neurological challenge, including stroke and AD. Further, our findings of the chemical structure requirements for estrogen's neuroprotective effects identified a novel approach for optimizing future estrogen-containing hormone therapy options. These early efforts laid the groundwork for later, large-scale clinical investigations into the potential of estrogen-based menopausal hormone therapies for the prevention of a variety of age-related disorders. Although findings of these studies were equivocal, the neuroprotective actions of estrogen, and specifically 17β-estradiol, identified by early investigations, remain well-documented. Future development of interventions that optimize cognitive aging are crucial and, with proper understanding of the factors that influence the realization of beneficial impacts, estrogen-containing treatments may still be among these. Ovarian steroid deprivation results in a reversible learning impairment and compromised cholinergic function in female Sprague-Dawley rats: We hypothesized that estradiol (E2) serves as a neurotrophomodulatory substance for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons thought to be involved in learning and memory. Learning/memory was assessed using the two-way active avoidance paradigm and the Morris water task. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were either ovariectomized (OVX) or OVX for 3 weeks, followed by s.c. implantation of a Silastic pellet containing 17-βE2 (E2 pellet), resulting in a replacement of E2 to physiological levels. Ovary-intact (INTACT) animals served as our positive control. Active avoidance behavior and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were assessed at 5 and 28 weeks postovariectomy while performance on the Morris water task and high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) were measured only at the 5-week time point. At the 5-week time point, E2 replacement caused a significant elevation in the level of active avoidance performance relative to OVX animals. At the 28-week time point, OVX animals demonstrated a significantly lower number of avoidances relative to controls (61%) whereas E2-pellet animals not only demonstrated superior performance relative to OVX animals but also showed an accelerated rate of learning. Morris water task performance, on the other hand, was not significantly affected by estrogenic milieu despite a trend towards better performance in the E2-pellet group. Neurochemical analyses revealed that 5 weeks of ovariectomy was sufficient to reduce HACU in both the frontal cortex and hippocampus by 24 and 34%, respectively, while E2 replacement was successful in elevating HACU relative to OVX animals in both regions. ChAT activity was decreased in the hippocampus but not the frontal cortex of 5-week OVX animals. E2 replacement resulted in a reversal of this effect. At the 28-week time period, an unexpected decrease in ChAT activity was observed across all treatment groups. Interestingly, E2-pellet animals demonstrated the least severe decline in ChAT. This phenomenon was most evident in the frontal cortex where ChAT decreased by 61 and 56% in INTACT and OVX animals, respectively, whereas the decline in E2-pellet animals was only 16% over the same time period, suggesting a previously unreported cytoprotective effect of E2. Taken together, these findings demonstrate important effects of estrogens on cholinergic neurons and support the potential use of estrogen therapy in treatment of dementias in postmenopausal women. © 1994.

His career developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when-following the unregulated practice of frontal lobotomies-strong criticism arose in the medical community and in the general public against psychosurgery. Geoffrey Knight's clinical research focused on identifying new, selective targets to limit the side effects of psychosurgery while improving the outcome of patients affected by mental disorders. Following the example of William Beecher Scoville, he initially developed restricted orbital undercutting as a less invasive alternative to standard frontal lobotomy. He then developed stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy, with the use of an original stereotactic device. Knight stressed the importance of the anatomy and neurophysiology of the structures targeted in subcaudate tractotomy, with particular regard to the fibers connecting the anterior cingulate region, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hypothalamus. Of interest, the role of these white matter connections has been recently recognized in deep brain stimulation for major depression and anorexia nervosa. This is perhaps the most enduring legacy of Knight to the field of psychosurgery. He refined frontal leucotomies by selecting a restricted target at the center of a network that plays a crucial role in controlling mood disorders. He then developed a safe, minimally invasive stereotactic operation to reach this target. His work, well ahead of his time, still represents a valid reference on which to build future clinical experience in the modern era of neuromodulation for psychiatric diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27315024/"}

Their assessment needs to include a screening mental status evaluation and reviewing a recent definitive test of hearing in all children with defective speech. Neurologists' responsibility is to make sure that there is no likely underlying problem like epilepsy, neurologic, or genetic condition that requires specific medical intervention or genetic counseling. They need to discuss with the parents how deeply to test for neurologic, neuropsychologic, or genetic underlying causes in children with \"idiopathic\" developmental problem. There is no routine work-up, thus neurologists need to be aware of and to protect children from many almost certainly uninformative, expensive tests like EEGs, brain imaging, metabolic tests, and genetic micro-array unless there is a specific indication, or testing is being performed with parents' consent for research and paid for by research, not clinical, funds. Child neurologists-in-training need to have observed psychologic/neuropsychologic testing so that they have at least a superficial understanding of the content, indications, and limitations of major tests. I do not recommend that child neurologists administer standardized tests or questionnaires, but they need to know enough about them to be able to judge their appropriateness and review recommendations with parents. Neurologists need to protect children from unnecessary testing, ineffective and in some cases potentially dangerous exploitative treatments. They must be aware of what legitimate therapies are likely to be offered, that early appropriate education is most effective long-term because it influences brain development and is superior to symptomatic pharmacotherapy.

The realization in the US of the problem of mental health care, as a consequence of the results of medical evaluation for military service during the war, let the US Government to act creating among other things the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH). Coincident with that, new drug treatments for these disorders were introduced. War science also created an important number of tools and instruments, such as the radioisotopes, that played a significant role in the development of our story. The scientific context was marked by the development of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and the introduction in the early 80's of the DNA recombinant technologies. The concepts of chemical neurotransmission in the brain and of receptors for drugs and transmitters, although proposed before the war, where not generally accepted. Neurotransmitters were identified and the mechanisms of biosynthesis, storage, release and termination of action by mechanisms such as reuptake, elucidated. Furthermore, the synapse was seen with the electron microscope and more important for our account, neurons and their processes visualized in the brain first by fluorescence histochemistry, then using radioisotopes and autoradiography, and later by immunohistochemistry (IHC), originating the Chemical Neuroanatomy. The concept of chemical neurotransmission evolved from the amines, expanded to excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, then to neuropeptides and finally to gases and other \"atypical\" neurotransmitters. In addition, coexpression of more than one transmitter in a neuron, changed the initial ideas of neurotransmission. The concept of receptors for these and other messengers underwent a significant evolution from an abstract chemical concept to their physical reality as gene products. Important steps were the introduction in the 70's of radioligand binding techniques and the cloning of receptor genes in the 80's. Receptors were first visualized using radioligands and autoradiography, and analyzed with the newly developed computer-assisted image analysis systems. Using Positron Emission Tomography transmitters and receptors were visualized in living human brain. The cloning of receptor genes allowed the use of in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry to visualize with the light and electron microscopes the receptor mRNAs and proteins. The results showed the wide heterogeneity of receptors and the diversity of mode of signal transmission, synaptic and extra-synaptic, again radically modifying the early views of neurotransmission. During the entire period the interplay between basic science and Psychopharmacology and Psychiatry generated different transmitter or receptor-based theories of brain drug action. These concepts and technologies also changed the way new drugs were discovered and developed.

With help of experts in veterinary neurology from the European College of Veterinary Neurology (ECVN) and the European Society of Veterinary Neurology (ESVN) a survey of veterinary neurologic learning objectives using a modified Delphi method was conducted. The first phase comprised the development of a draft job description and learning objectives by a working group established by the ECVN. In the second phase, a quantitative questionnaire (multiple choice, Likert scale and free text) covering 140 learning objectives and subdivided into 8 categories was sent to 341 ESVN and ECVN members and a return rate of 62% (n = 213/341) was achieved. Of these 140 learning objectives ECVN Diplomates and ESVN members considered 42 (30%) objectives as not necessary for standard clinical veterinary neurology training, 94 (67%) were graded to be learned at a beginner level and 4 (3%) at an advanced level. The following objectives were interpreted as the most important day one skills: interpret laboratory tests, perform a neurological examination and establish a neuroanatomical localization. In this survey the three most important diseases of the central nervous system included epilepsy, intervertebral disc disease and inflammatory diseases. The three most important diseases of the peripheral nervous system included polyradiculoneuritis, myasthenia gravis and toxic neuropathies. The results of this study should help to reform the veterinary curriculum regarding neurology and may reduce the phenomenon of \"Neurophobia\".", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25582136/"}

We asked the neurological residents whether they found cognitive impairment or psychological disturbances in their patients and to indicate the extent of those abnormalities. Fifteen percent of patients showed cognitive impairment, but as many as one-third showed psychological problems warranting further work-up. Recognition of such by residents as well as specification of psychiatric diagnoses and important psychosocial factors in the final reports was poor. Psychological problems are common in neurologic in-patients. They are insufficiently recognized by residents and usually not taken into consideration in patient-care.

Animals and men were believed to have a material soul whose functions throughout the nervous system were accessible to research. In 1659 inductive methods were introduced in clinical medicine by Thomas Willis, the founder of English epidemiology and biochemistry. The Vertuosi,who later founded the Royal Society, performed chemical experiments in teams, and Willis, head of their laboratory, gained experience in teamwork. In 1658 J.J. Wepfer published his method of dye injection in cerebral vessels at autopsy, and Christopher Wren had already experimented with intravenous injections. William Petty had performed dissections at Leiden, training with Francis Sylvius's brain and comparative anatomy. Petty came to Oxford in 1650, began to study chemistry with Willis, and instructed him in Sylvius's methods of cerebral and comparative anatomy. Willis continued this work with a team of highly qualified colleagues, Wren included, and published the first monograph on brain anatomy, Cerebri anatome, in 1664. This Latin book, illustrated by Wren, came out in four editions in the first year, and was reprinted up to 1720. It contained a definition of reflex action, the recognition of the general functions of cortex, white matter, and brain tracts, a complete description of the autonomic nervous system, Willis's new term \"Neurologia,\" and his promise to follow up with his \"Psychologia.\" He presented the latter in 1672 as De anima brutorum, a book on the material soul of animals and man as the carrier of all functions of the nervous system. There was a physiological part, a textbook of neurophysiology, and a pathological part, a compendium of neurological and psychiatric syndromes, with early descriptions of myasthenia, restless legs, narcolepsy, dissociative and bipolar disease, and general paralysis of the insane. In 1667 he published a book on convulsive diseases, in which he described the blood-brain barrier, epileptic and hysterical brain disorders, and Parkinson's disease. Thus Willis recognized and presented the key themes of the future specialty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19892111/"}

Basic trial information on design, disease, intervention, analysis, and treatment success was extracted. Strengths and weaknesses of the N-of-1 trials were assessed with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension for N-of-1 trials (CENT) 2015 criteria checklist and the Jadad score as measures of quality and reporting. We retrieved 40 reports of N-of-1 trials in neurologic disorders (19 individual N-of-1 trials, 21 series of N-of-1 trials). Most N-of-1 trials were performed in neuromuscular and neurodegenerative/movement disorders. Unlike the majority of trials that studied the main symptom(s) of a chronic stable condition, 9 N-of-1 trials studied a stable chronic symptom of a progressive or acute neurologic disorder. Besides pharmacologic interventions, electric stimulation protocols and nutritional products were studied. A mean total CENT score of 20.88 (SD 9.10, range 0-43) and mean total Jadad score of 2.90 (SD 2.15, range 0-5) were found as methodologic measures of quality and reporting across all N-of-1 trials. N-of-1 trials have been reported in numerous neurologic disorders, not only in chronic stable disorders, but also in progressive or acute disorders with a stable symptom. This indicates the emerging therapeutic area of N-of-1 trials in neurology. Methodologic quality and reporting of N-of-1 trials were found to be suboptimal and can easily be improved in future trials by appropriately describing the methods of blinding and randomization and following CENT guidelines. Because most N-of-1 trials remain unreported in medical literature, this systematic review probably represents only the tip of the iceberg of conducted N-of-1 trials in neurologic disorders.

{"id": "40519098", "title": "The Application of Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening in Neurology and Immunology.", "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a stringent biological filter situated between the circulatory system and the brain's tissue, shielding the brain by preventing the entry of detrimental neurotoxic substances into the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, the BBB also restricts the entry of most therapeutic drugs, resulting in only a few medications currently available for the clinical treatment of neurological diseases. Consequently, it is imperative to discover a secure and potent technique to temporarily disrupt the BBB for the purpose of directed medication administration. The therapeutic approach of ultrasound-induced BBB opening combined with drug delivery offers advantages such as non-invasiveness, precise targeting, and deep tissue penetration. It overcomes the limitations of traditional therapies blocked by the BBB and shows significant potential for treating neurological disorders. This review includes an overview of the physical characteristics and transport mechanisms of the BBB, followed by an introduction to the mechanisms of ultrasound-mediated BBB opening. Additionally, it summarizes the neural and immune regulation following BBB opening by ultrasound, with a focus on its features and clinical applications in immunotherapy. These extensive insights aim to provide promising strategies for the clinical application of ultrasound-mediated BBB opening for targeted and personalized drug delivery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40519098/"}
{"id": "23906487", "title": "Ethics in prion disease.", "text": "This paper is intended to discuss some of the scientific and ethical issues that are created by increased research efforts towards earlier diagnosis, as well as to treatment of, human prion diseases (and related dementias), including the resulting consequences for individuals, their families, and society. Most patients with prion disease currently are diagnosed when they are about 2/3 of the way through their disease course (Geschwind et al., 2010a; Paterson et al., 2012b), when the disease has progressed so far that even treatments that stop the disease process would probably have little benefit. Although there are currently no treatments available for prion diseases, we and others have realized that we must diagnose patients earlier and with greater accuracy so that future treatments have hope of success. As approximately 15% of prion diseases have a autosomal dominant genetic etiology, this further adds to the complexity of ethical issues, particularly regarding when to conduct genetic testing, release of genetic results, and when or if to implement experimental therapies. Human prion diseases are both infectious and transmissible; great care is required to balance the needs of the family and individual with both public health needs and strained hospital budgets. It is essential to proactively examine and address the ethical issues involved, as well as to define and in turn provide best standards of care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23906487/"}

The place of the anticoagulants in the management of cervical artery dissections remains uncertain, while the benefit of the blood pressure control in the secondary prevention of deep and lobar intracerebral hemorrhages is critical. The development of cardiac MRI, prolonged cardiac monitoring and transcranial doppler seems to improve the diagnosis of cardio-embolic sources of stroke. A specialized urgent-access single seizure clinic represents a model which reduces wait-times and improves patient access after a first fit. Co-locating a psychiatrist within outpatient epilepsy center leads to a reduction in psychiatric symptoms and people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. When neurologists around the world assess identical case scenarios for the diagnosis of epilepsy, concordance is between moderate and poor, showing that epilepsy diagnosis remains difficult. More than one third of elderly with new-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology exhibit temporal lobe atrophy on brain imaging. There is no major progress in the therapeutic approach of Parkinson's disease but the discovery of new genetic markers such as glucocerebrosidase mutations may greatly change our knowledge of the disease process and may induce new therapeutic strategies in the future. The natural history of the disease is also better understood from the prodromal phase to the post-mortem analysis of the brain and the classification of the processes based on abnormal protein deposits. The respective value of biomarkers (amyloid imaging versus CSF biomarkers) for in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been detailed. Therapeutic expectations mainly rely on anti-Aβ immunization trials performed in preclinical (and no longer prodromal) stages of AD, with the aim of slowing the evolution of neuronal loss. Besides a lot of communications on dementia genetics or physiopathogeny, fascinating and promising results were presented on deep brain stimulation for depression resistant to medical treatment. Ibudilast, administered with riluzole, is safe and tolerable in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), improves ALS function and delays progression. Patients with painful small fiber neuropathy have a high rate of mutations in the SCN9A gene, coding for Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium-channels. Peripheral nerve lymphoma (NL) is a multifocal painful neuropathy that causes endoneurial inflammatory demyelination: primary NL is less severe than secondary NL, which occurs after remission, suggesting that nerve may be considered a \"safe lymphoma haven\". Biotin in progressive forms of MS and daclizumab in relapsing-remitting forms appear to be promising treatments. In case of failure of current first-line and/or second-line therapeutics, alemtuzumab may be an interesting alternative treatment.

Neurological emergencies account for between 2.6% and 14% of medical emergencies. Stroke represents a third of all neurological emergencies, while the diagnoses of acute cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy and cephalea constitute 50% of all neurological care in the emergency department. On the basis of quality of care criteria and professional competence, the best care for patients with a neurological emergency is provided by a specialist in neurology.

In General Psychopathology, Jaspers criticised early 20th century psychiatrists, including those who thought psychiatry was only neurology (Wernicke) or only abnormal psychology (Freud), or who did not see the limitations of the medical model in psychiatry (Kraepelin). Jaspers proposed that some psychiatric disorders follow the medical model (Group I), while others are variations of normality (Group III), or comprise schizophrenia and severe mood disorders (Group II). In the early 21st century, the players' names have changed but the game remains the same. The US NIMH is reprising both Wernicke's brain mythology and Kraepelin's marketing promises. The neo-Kraepelinian revolution started at Washington University, became pre-eminent through the DSM-III developed by Spitzer, but reached a dead end with the DSM-5. McHugh, who described four perspectives in psychiatry, is the leading contemporary representative of the Jaspersian diagnostic approach. Other neo-Jaspersians are: Berrios, Wiggins and Schwartz, Ghaemi, Stanghellini, Parnas and Sass. Can psychiatry learn from its mistakes? The current psychiatric language, organised at its three levels, symptoms, syndromes, and disorders, was developed in the 19th century but is obsolete for the 21st century. Scientific advances in Jaspers' Group III disorders require collaborating with researchers in the social and psychological sciences.

A survey tool successfully used in other schools was adapted to assess perceived level of difficulty, knowledge and interest in various medical sub-specialties including, neurology, cardiology, psychiatry, geriatrics, endocrinology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology and pediatrics. Questions asked included: \"What is your current level of interest in the following medical specialties?\"; \"What is your current level of knowledge in the given medical specialties?\"; \"Do you think the subject is easy or difficult?\" and \"Why do you think neurology is difficult?\" Students were required to answer using a Likert scale and results were tabulated into mean scores and standard errors. The response rate was 65% (167/255). Neurology was identified as the subject which students found most difficult (score 3.89 +/- 0.068) and had least knowledge of (2.32 +/- 0.075).

In her book \"A Ray of Darkness\", she describes in profound analytic detail her seizure experiences, especially the isolated auras that had preceded her first convulsion by many years. Their ultimate strangeness echoed a long-standing fascination by the indescribable, which is a recurrent theme in her literary work. Another aspect of her poetry, a focus on the experience of the moment that cannot be retained is likewise reminiscent of the volatility of her aura experiences. Of three texts that are presently being published posthumously, one (\"The Nightingale Silenced\") is a fragmentary continuation of her epileptic experience. She considered that she still had a lot to describe, contributing the inside of the \"outside inside story\" of epilepsy, clues on which neurology could work to obtain a deeper understanding. To have a focal motor seizure feels like being invaded by an alien force. An urge to run and heautoscopy are other recorded symptoms. Evans documents the experience of a long-lasting, predominantly nonconvulsive status epilepticus merging into aura continua where her earlier aura experiences appear transformed into a quasipsychotic state. But even in the account of \"this appalling, this hellish condition\", she is careful to maintain her high literary standards.

Although his ideas are little referenced today, having been overshadowed by his more eminent Queen Square colleague John Hughlings Jackson, his work on aphasia and paralysis was highly regarded by contemporaries. This paper traces Bastian's lasting but largely unattributed contribution to the development of standardized clinical assessment of language disorders. From 1867 onwards, Bastian trained generations of medical students in neurology. In his 1875 book On Paralysis there is evidence in his case descriptions that Bastian had already implemented a detailed set of procedures for examining aphasic patients. In 1886, Bastian published a 'Schema for the Examination of Aphasic and Amnesic Persons'. Bastian insisted on the utility of this battery for diagnosis, classification and lesion localization; he argued that its consistent use would allow the development of a patient corpus and the comparison of cases from other hospitals. In 1898 his Treatise on Aphasia included a list of 34 questions that were to be used to examine all patients to provide detailed and systematic evidence of spared and impaired abilities in all receptive and expressive modalities. Bastian's contribution to the development of standardized clinical aphasia assessment is reassessed through detailed analysis of his publications and those of his contemporaries as well as new material from archives and casebooks. This evidence demonstrates that his approach to diagnosis of language and other cognitive impairments has propagated through the decades. His legacy can be seen in the approach to standardized aphasia testing developed in the latter 20th century through to today.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23803303/"}

This review, based on current evidence, outlines an international expert consensus set of recommendations to guide clinical electrodiagnostic autonomic testing. Grading and localization of autonomic deficits incorporates scores from sympathetic cardiovascular adrenergic, parasympathetic cardiovagal, and sudomotor testing, as no single test alone is sufficient to diagnose the degree or distribution of autonomic failure. The composite autonomic severity score (CASS) is a useful score of autonomic failure that is normalized for age and gender.

Unfortunately, neurologists are rarely involved in such cases despite having the expertise to help to inform these decisions in court. In this Perspective, we advocate for the development of 'forensic neurology', a subspecialty of neurology focused on using neurological clinical and scientific expertise to address legal questions for the criminal justice system. We review literature suggesting that the incidence of criminal behaviour is higher in people with certain neurological disorders than the general public and that undiagnosed neurological abnormalities are common in people who commit crimes. We discuss the need for forensic neurologists in criminal cases to provide an opinion on what neurological diagnoses are present, the resulting symptoms and ultimately whether the symptoms affect legal determinations such as criminal responsibility or competency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38228905/"}

Most neurologic conditions have a prolonged prodromal phase-even if they tend to manifest with an acute syndrome such as stroke-and can lead to a relentless, often deleterious course creating a major burden on patients, caregivers, and society. This unique nature of neurologic diseases signifies the strong need for equally effective primary and secondary prevention strategies and focus on brain health before brain diseases ensue. The field of preventive neurology applies both universal and selective primary prevention strategies to promote brain health both at the public and personal levels. The preventive neurology approach aims to identify and target high-risk individuals and protect them from reaching a critical point where overt clinical symptoms are present and disease progression is irreversible. Universal and selective prevention training, along with dovetailed clinical and public health research, are 3 essential pillars of preventive neurology. The burgeoning field of preventive neurology aims to assess neurologic care needs in a society, promote the participation of neurologists in restructuring of the health care policies to promote brain health, and identify medium- and high-risk individuals to prevent or delay future neurologic events.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34315783/"}

Current studies on neurological WMR point to the complexity of clinical anamnestic characteristics of the target group, which makes it difficult to define severe restrictions of work ability (SRWA) as a prerequisite for access to the neurological WMR. In addition, the heterogeneous functional disabilities, multiple comorbidities and the different types of rehabilitation services (follow-up, medical treatment) significantly influence SRWA identification.

The literature was reviewed, and selections are included to highlight some of the major issues. Personal recollections are deliberately emphasized since they may reflect the phenomenon of personal discovery familiar to others and the now widespread professional awareness of TD. TD is indeed well recognized by psychiatrists and neurologists, and most general practitioners are also aware that the syndrome exists. Physicians were once unfamiliar with the concept of a drug reaction that was so long delayed as is possible with TD, nor did they know that a drug side effect could present in this manner. The historical delay in initial recognition of TD, and the reason for such delay, remain of interest. The lack of a perfect therapy and the uncertainty regarding the precise pathophysiologic basis of TD remain as challenges. Most psychiatrists, and many neurologists, probably have vivid memories of specific patients with TD. This author, a neurologist, was blessed to work with George Crane and other investigators in the early days of TD and was witness to some of the original uncertainty regarding what seemed to be a new phenomenon.

The Emperor, Dom Pedro II was the second and last Emperor of Brazil, reigning for 49 years and remembered for defending the nation's integrity, the end of slavery, support for education and culture, diplomacy and relations with international personalities. He married Dona Teresa Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1822-1889) by proxy in 1843, the fourth and last Empress consort of Brazil. This paper reports the exchange of letters between these personalities of the XIX century. Although they lived far from each other and worked in areas so different, they discussed the health of the Empress in letters. Dom Pedro II made contact with Brown-Séquard hoping that ' … your knowledge shall help heal my wife of nervous disease … . ' According to Dom Pedro the Empress suffered ' … for a long time with more or less long interruptions of horrible neuralgic pains in the legs, head and the scalp.

A survey of specialty practices in Rhode Island.", "text": "Severe, symptomatic carotid artery disease is most often diagnosed by conventional cerebral angiography. Noninvasive tests are commonly used to identify candidates for angiography and endarterectomy. The purpose of this study, a mail and telephone survey of academic and community neurologists, neurosurgeons, and vascular surgeons in Rhode Island in 1994, was to determine which noninvasive tests physicians used to evaluate these patients and how the test results were used to select patients for angiography. One hundred (86%) of a possible 116 responses were collected. Seventy-six percent of physicians chose carotid duplex ultrasound as the first diagnostic test, a percentage significantly higher than that for any other test (p < 0.0001). Fourteen percent chose angiography without a prior screening test; 3% chose magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) prior to angiography, 6% chose carotid duplex ultrasound plus MRA prior to angiography, and 1% chose MRA without angiography. The specific noninvasive test results required for angiography referral were surprisingly variable, both within and across the three physician specialties. Vascular surgeons and neurosurgeons were more likely to choose angiography without prior screening tests than were neurologists. In conclusion, the majority of specialty physicians in the state of Rhode Island chose carotid ultrasound as the screening test of choice for the evaluation of a potential endarterectomy candidate. Few responding physicians chose MRA in combination with carotid duplex ultrasound prior to angiography, or MRA prior to angiography or MRA alone. Awareness of the actual practice patterns of specialists may lead to programs of education for physicians to improve practice and patient outcome through more refined use of diagnostic tests prior to angiography or endarterectomy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8704296/"}

The curriculum was designed utilizing Kern's six-step framework. A ten-module, interactive, primarily vignette-based e-learning curriculum was developed focusing on the neurocognitive exam and neurocognitive disorders. The curriculum was piloted in two psychiatry residencies in Brooklyn, NY (n = 80 residents). The curriculum was evaluated using a survey adapted from the General Practitioner Attitudes and Confidence Scale for Dementia (GPACS-D) and a 24-item neuropsychiatry examination prior to the intervention and 1-month post-intervention. Qualitative feedback was acquired through four open-ended items in the post-curriculum survey, which underwent a thematic analysis. Seventy-eight of eighty residents completed the full curriculum. Three of nine attitude items demonstrated significant differences, with residents feeling less frustrated managing dementia (pre-mean = 2.32, post = 2.68, t(2,59) = 2.00, p = 0.004), less frustrated due to not knowing how to effectively treat dementia (pre-mean = 2.05, post = 2.95, t(2,59) = 6.27, p = 0.000), and demonstrating less interest in pursuing further training in neuropsychiatry (pre-mean = 1.95, post = 2.18, t(2,59) = 1.70, p = 0.047), though still overall showing interest. There was no change in confidence ratings. There was a small but significant improvement in total number of knowledge items answered correctly.

The two-dimensional appearance of Cubist figures and objects is created through juxtaposition of angles. The authors posit that the constrained perspectives found in Cubism may also be found in the clinical classification of brain disorders. Neurological disorders are often separated from psychiatric disorders as if they stemmed from different organ systems. Maintaining two isolated clinical disciplines fractionalizes the brain in the same way that Pablo Picasso fractionalized figures and objects in his Cubist art. This Neural Cubism perpetuates a clinical divide that does not reflect the scope and depth of neuroscience. All brain disorders are complex and multidimensional, with aberrant circuitry and resultant psychopharmacology manifesting as altered behavior, affect, mood, or cognition. Trainees should receive a multidimensional education based on modern neuroscience, not a partial education based on clinical precedent.

Throughout his career, Duménil published annotated observations of neurological pathologies. One year before Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875), he reported a case of \"progressive muscular paralysis of the tongue, soft palate, and lips\". He added five other cases of progressive muscular atrophy in 1867, together with histological examinations which showed atrophy in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. Charcot, who described amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, did not fail to pay homage to Duménil for his contribution. In 1862, Duménil added clinical observations of progressive locomotor ataxia, one of the first to do so. This included anatomopathological examinations, thus significantly completing the clinical picture presented by Duchenne in 1858. He confirmed the damage to the roots and posterior tracts of the spinal cord. Finally, by providing multiple observations of the syndrome described by Octave Landry (1826-1865) in 1859, he contributed to the clinical picture of \"acute ascending paralysis\" which has come down to us as Guillain-Barré syndrome, with no mention of the perspicacious physicians of the previous century who had already perfectly recognised this disease. Finally, Augusta Dejerine-Klumpke (1859-1927) paid a warm tribute to Duménil in her 1889 thesis, calling him one of the pioneers in understanding \"the individuality and autonomy of the peripheral nervous system.\" He was indeed a pioneer, although he has been often overlooked.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34565621/"}

Overall, 917 physicians participated in the survey. Significant proportions of respondents, especially among GPs and neurologists, considered that palliative sedation and withdrawing life-sustaining treatments (WLST) were euthanasia. Multivariate analysis showed that the physicians who had special medical training in palliative care, and those who distinguish palliative sedation and WLST from euthanasia were more likely to oppose legalisation of euthanasia.

The co-author of the paper, Bosko Barac, witnessed their growth from 1966, collaborating in their organization from 1974 with the first Secretary General Gerald Grinschgl; elected for his successor after his unexpected death in 1985, he was leading the Kuratorium (Scientific Board) as Secretary General for 23 years, collaborating in this period with his Austrian partner and friend Helmut Lechner. In 2007, Barac handed over this responsible function to the co-author Vida Demarin. Starting when neuropsychiatry was a unique discipline, the INPC followed the processes of emancipation of neurology and psychiatry and their evolution to independent disciplines with new subspecialties. These respectable conferences greatly surpassed the significance of the two disciplines, neurology and psychiatry, granting collaboration of borderland medical and non-medical disciplines, connecting experts from the region, European countries and the world. Inaugurated in 'cold-war' times, in their first phase they enabled to make professional and human contacts between scientists from the two divided 'blocs' thanks to the 'non-aligned' position of the then Yugoslavia, fostering the ideas of mutual understanding and collaboration. On the other hand, the scientific development of the meetings took in the center of their study fields connecting the two disciplines, giving a quite unique quality to these meetings. For many years, the meetings cherished specific neurologic and psychiatric topics, at the same time planning increasing important topics of the 'borderland areas' in their programs. For the important achievements, they earned the title of the Pula School of Science and Humanism, promoting interdisciplinary scientific collaboration important for humanistic goals of medicine. Medicine, as science and practice, although founded on biological grounds, is primarily a human activity serving to individual man and the whole human race. Modern neurology and psychiatry are no longer restricted to diagnosing and curing brain and nerves or psychiatric disorders, and are nowadays important as a science of human mind and discipline caring about the human brain, the complex organ of each individual man, collective human consciousness and our mental life.

Our unique study design allowed direct comparison of diagnostic yield of both trajectories and provided insight into the economic implications of implementing WES in this diagnostic trajectory. We showed that WES identified significantly more conclusive diagnoses (29.3%) than the standard care pathway (7.3%) without incurring higher costs. Exploratory analysis of WES as a first-tier diagnostic test indicates that WES may even be cost-saving, depending on the extent of other tests being omitted.

Neuropsychiatrists, however, are increasingly recognised as essential members given many psychiatric considerations that may arise in patients undergoing DBS. Patient selection, assessment of competence to consent and treatment of postoperative psychiatric disease are just a few areas where neuropsychiatric input is invaluable. Partly driven by this close team working and partly based on the early history of DBS for psychiatric disorders, there is increasing interest in re-exploring the potential of neurosurgery to treat patients with psychiatric disease, such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although the clinical experience and evidence with DBS in this group of patients are steadily increasing, many questions remain unanswered. Yet, the characteristics of optimal surgical candidates, the best choice of DBS target, the most effective stimulating parameters and the extent of postoperative improvement are not clear for most psychiatric conditions.

MRI, MR spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted MRI have contributed to more accurate diagnosis, prognostication and better treatment planning. Neurosurgical treatment has been advanced by the use of functional MRI, and intraoperative image-guided stereotactic techniques and electrophysiologic monitoring. The use of 3-D conformal and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and radiosensitizing agents has made radiation therapy safer and more effective. Conventional chemotherapy, administered either alone or combined with radiation therapy has improved survival and quality of life of children with brain tumors. These improved outcomes have also occurred, due, in part, to their treatment on collaborative national and international studies. Recent promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have resulted from advances in understanding molecular brain tumor biology. Important new approaches include the refinement of drug-delivery strategies, the evaluation of biologic markers to stratify patients for optimal treatment and to exploit these molecular differences using \"targeted\" therapeutic strategies.

Yet differing clinical schedules of students and faculty as well as structured, controlled environments of intensive care units are not conducive to bringing multiple interprofessional learners to the bedside. We developed a 2.5-hour interprofessional education (IPE) activity based around neurology intensive care unit patients that was implemented using team-based learning (TBL) methodologies, including individual/team readiness assessments (iRAT/tRAT) and application activities comprising interprofessional student-led care conferences in which authentic patients and their unique, deidentified clinical parameters were discussed. Students represented medicine, nursing, chaplain, physician assistant, social work, respiratory therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, and law programs. Two hundred ninety-three students participated online during the first year. Mean tRAT scores were 14.9 points higher than iRAT scores (39.5 vs. 24.6 of 44 possible). There was strong agreement from students that the session met educational objectives (all >4.0 on a 5-point Likert scale). Individualized feedback was provided to learners using a rubric; 276 students shared personal reflections of knowledge learned through interactions with other health professional students/faculty. IPE activities that use authentic patient chart data as the basis for student application exercises are useful learning tools since students must teach and learn from each other, interpret data, and propose care plans based upon their collaborations. This enables students to experience acute care IPCP in a low-stakes environment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39507322/"}

In neuroscience, a host of applications was proposed ranging from neurotoxicology, neurometabolism, determination of the proteome of the individual brain areas in health and disease, to name a few. Only recently, the limitations of the method have been shown, hampering the rapid spreading of the technology, which in principle consists of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with in-gel protein digestion of protein spots and identification by mass-spectrometrical approaches or microsequencing. The identification, including quantification using specific software, of brain protein classes, like enzymes, cytoskeleton proteins, heat shock proteins/chaperones, proteins of the transcription and translation machinery, synaptosomal proteins, antioxidant proteins, is a clear domain of proteomics. Furthermore, the concomitant detection of several hundred proteins on a gel allows the demonstration of an expressional pattern, rather generated by a reliable, protein-chemical method than by immunoreactivity, proposed by protein-arrays. An additional advantage is that hitherto unknown proteins, so far only proposed from their nucleic acid structure, designated as hypothetical proteins, can be identified as brain proteins. As to shortcomings and disadvantages of the method we would point to the major problem, the failure to separate hydrophobic proteins. There is so far no way to analyse the vast majority of these proteins in gels. Several other analytical problems need to be overcome, but once the latter problem can be solved, there is nothing to stop the method for a large scale analysis of membrane proteins in neuroscience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12758110/"}

He was a prolific medical writer, a brilliant researcher and a skilled artist. Argyll Robertson (AR) (1837-1909) was the first surgeon in Scotland to practise entirely in the field of ophthalmology. In 1869 Robertson published the records of cases, which showed that disease of the spinal cord is sometimes associated with loss of the light reflex of the pupil but retention of its movement in accommodation. Harry Moss Traquair (1875-1954) was one of the founders of neuro-ophthalmology, being concentrated on bitemporal hemianopia, the course of the geniculo-calcarine visual pathway, pituitary tumours, optic nerve diseases (including acute retrobulbar neuritis), tobacco amblyopia and traumatic lesions of the optic tract.

The term hypnosis was introduced in the 1840s by a Scottish surgeon James Braid (1795-1860), who believed the subject to be in a particular state of sleep--a trance. In the late 19th century, a French neurologist Jean Martin Charcot (1825-1893) thought hypnotism to be a special physiological state, and his contemporary Hyppotite-Marie Bernheim (1840-1919) believed it to be a psychological state of heightened suggestibility. Sigmund Freud, who studied with Charcot, used hypnosis early in his career to help patients recover repressed memories. He noted that patients would relive traumatic events while under hypnosis, a process know as abreaction. Freud later replaced hypnosis with the technique of free associations. Today, hypnosis is used as a form of therapy (hypnotherapy), a method of investigation to recover lost memories, and research tool. According to Caplan & Sadock, F.A. Mesmer is generally thought of as the fons et origo of modern psychotherapy; and from the early techniques of mesmerism, it is said, have evolved the more elaborate and sophisticated therapeutic measures of the analyst and his colleagues. Although Mesmer was certainly dealing with individuals suffering from a variety of neurotic disorders, and though the clinical successes he achieved were the result of psychological processes that his procedures induced in his patients, Mesmer's theoretical formulations, his understanding of the nature of the treatment he developed, and his specific procedures were all totally different from those of the 20th century analyst.

We aimed to explore the possibility that a low degree of headache interest among neurology department chairs and residency program directors (PDs) underlies this mismatch. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of chairs and PDs associated with ACGME neurology residency programs. Data sources included the ACGME program list, faculty profiles on institutional webpages, Doximity profiles, the American Headache Society (AHS) membership directory, and the roster of United Council for Neurologic Specialties (UCNS) headache diplomates. A headache interest was deemed to be present with the presence of a declared headache or concussion interest, completion of a headache fellowship, active AHS membership, or UCNS certification. Our review included 137 residency programs comprising 127 department chairs, 132 PDs, and 5 faculty who were both chairs and PDs. Of all faculty, 62 (23.5%) were women. Headache expertise was declared by 10 (7.6%) chairs and 13 (9.5%) PDs. Headache fellowship training was pursued by 1 (0.8%) chair and 5 (3.6%) PDs, and among all faculty was the 10th most common subspecialty fellowship pursued. Three (2.3%) chairs and 7 (5.1%) PDs were AHS members. Seven (5.3%) chairs and 10 (7.3%) PDs were UCNS headache certified. An overall headache interest was present in 29 (11.0%) faculty, including 14 (10.6%) chairs and 15 (10.9%) PDs. A graduate degree aside from an MD (eg, PhD, MPH) was more likely to be achieved in faculty without a headache interest (29.4%) than faculty with a headache interest (6.9%, P = .0076). Residency programs where either the chair or PD had a headache interest were just as likely to feature a UCNS headache fellowship program than programs without chair or PD headache interest (25.0 vs 23.0%, P = .83). Current neurology department chairs and residency PDs have low rates of headache interest, which may influence the emphasis of headache education in neurology training.

It confirms the discrepancy between drug prescription in general practice and the data from therapeutic drug trials.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1412142/"}

{"id": "28237005", "title": "Pediatric Epilepsy: Neurology, Functional Imaging, and Neurosurgery.", "text": "In this chapter we provide a comprehensive review of the current role that functional imaging can have in the care of the pediatric epilepsy patient from the perspective of the epilepsy neurologist and the epilepsy neurosurgeon. In the neurology section, the diagnosis and classification of epilepsy adapted by the International League Against Epilepsy as well as the etiology and incidence of the disease is presented. The neuroimaging section describes how advanced nuclear medicine imaging methods can be synergized to provide a maximum opportunity to localize an epileptogenic focus. This section described the value of FDG-PET and regional cerebral blood flow SPECT in the identification of an epileptogenic focus. The imaging section also emphasizes the importance on developing a dedicated epilepsy management team, comprised of an epilepsy imaging specialist, epilepsy neurologist and epilepsy neurosurgeon, to provide the maximum benefit to each child with epilepsy. An emphasis is placed on preparation for ictal SPECT injection procedures, including the critical role of an automated injector well as the use of state-of-the-art dedicated nuclear medicine imaging and analysis protocols to correctly localize the epileptogenic focus location. In the final section, surgical options, approaches and expected outcomes for the different classes of epilepsy is presented.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28237005/"}
