Gliomas, including glioblastoma (GBM), are particularly difficult to treat, and high-grade gliomas have poor outcomes. Treatment of brain tumors involves a unique set of scientific and clinical challenges, which are often not present in the treatment of systemic malignancies. With respect to scientific challenges, the anatomy and physiology of brain tumors (including the blood-brain barrier, blood-tumor barrier, and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier) prevent adequate drug delivery into the central nervous system. The unique nature of the immune system in the central nervous system as well as the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors such as GBM also create therapeutic roadblocks in the treatment of brain tumors. Tumor heterogeneity, particularly in GBM, has classically been believed to contribute to multitherapy resistance; however, recent data suggest that this may not be the case. Clinical challenges include neurologic and medical comorbidities of patients with brain tumor, as well as potential toxicity of tumor-directed treatment. Clinical trials investigating new treatment paradigms are needed, but several roadblocks exist to good and promising clinical trial availability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33610863/"}

In the evaluation of a patient with cerebellar dysfunction, recognizing the pattern of ocular motor and / or vestibular impairment is often a key step to the correct diagnosis. The cerebellum is very important in processing a wide range of different eye movements, including angular vestibulo-ocular reflexes, otolith-ocular reflexes, fixation and gaze holding, smooth pursuit eye movements, saccadic eye movements, optokinetic response, ocular alignment, and vergence. Quantitative eye movement recording is now widely available in specialized clinics and medical practices, especially for testing the vestibulo-ocular reflexes. We describe the approach for assessing specific eye movements linked to cerebellar function, discuss appropriate eye movement laboratory tests, and summarize recent related research findings. In addition, for each laboratory test, we discuss its advantages, disadvantages, indications, and interpretations. Furthermore, we provide differential diagnoses for specific ocular motor and vestibular abnormalities such as slow saccades or impaired vestibulo-ocular reflexes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29903449/"}

The diseases encompassed in the neuro-oncology field and our understanding of them have increased rapidly during the past 30 years. In part, progress has been driven by technological achievements in neuroimaging, in particular, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. These advances have allowed unprecedented opportunities to view the anatomy and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS) and, to an extent, portions of the peripheral nervous system that could be affected by cancer or its treatment. Clear gains have occurred in diagnostic accuracy, neurosurgical safety, ease of tumor resection, and safer and more accurate radiotherapy. After carmustine chemotherapy was introduced in the late 1960s, neurosurgeons and a new breed of physician, the neuro-oncologist, investigated the clinical benefits of an increasing number of anticancer agents against gliomas, medulloblastomas, and metastatic tumors in the CNS. In parallel, another sector of neuro-oncology developed that was more closely allied with neurology.

The ability to visualize intracranial and orbital anatomy has been completely transformed. Imaging the visual axis has become faster, easier, and more precise allowing earlier diagnosis and management of a multitude of neuro-ophthalmic conditions. As we look to the future of neuroimaging, there is momentum to improve techniques enabling the assessment of microstructural architecture, metabolic and functional changes, and genetic biomarkers of disease.

The objective of this study is to analyze referral patterns to neuro-ophthalmologists, characterize rates of misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses in patients ultimately referred, and delineate outcomes after neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Retrospective chart review of 300 new patients seen over 45 randomly chosen days between June 2011 and June 2015 in one tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology clinic. Demographics, distance traveled, time between onset and neuro-ophthalmology consultation (NOC), time between appointment request and NOC, number and types of providers seen before referral, unnecessary tests before referral, referral diagnoses, final diagnoses, and impact of the NOC on outcome were collected. Patients traveled a median of 36.5 miles (interquartile range [IQR]: 20-85). Median time from symptom onset was 210 days (IQR: 70-1,100). Median time from referral to NOC was 34 days (IQR: 7-86), with peaks at one week (urgent requests) and 13 weeks (routine requests). Median number of previous providers seen was 2 (IQR: 2-4; range:0-10), and 102 patients (34%) had seen multiple providers within the same specialty before referral. Patients were most commonly referred for NOC by ophthalmologists (41% of referrals). Eighty-one percent (242/300) of referrals to neuro-ophthalmology were appropriate referrals. Of the 300 patients referred, 247 (82%) were complex or very complex; 119 (40%) were misdiagnosed; 147 (49%) were at least partially misdiagnosed; and 22 (7%) had unknown diagnoses. Women were more likely to be at least partially misdiagnosed-108 of 188 (57%) vs 39 of 112 (35%) of men (P < 0.001). Mismanagement or delay in care occurred in 85 (28%), unnecessary tests in 56 (19%), unnecessary consultations in 64 (22%), and imaging misinterpretation in 16 (5%). Neuro-ophthalmologists played a major role in directing treatment, such as preserving vision, preventing life-threatening complications, or avoiding harmful treatment in 62 (21%) patients.

A multitude of molecular profiling studies in recent years has unveiled a number of genetic abnormalities unique to pediatric brain tumors. It has now become clear that brain tumors that arise in children have distinct pathogenesis and biology, compared with their adult counterparts, even for those with indistinguishable histopathology. Some of the molecular features are so specific to a particular type of tumors, such as the presence of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene for pilocytic astrocytomas or SMARCB1 mutations for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, that they could practically serve as a diagnostic marker on their own. Expression profiling has resolved the existence of 4 molecular subgroups in medulloblastomas, which positively translated into improved prognostication for the patients. The currently available molecular markers, however, do not cover all tumors even within a single tumor entity. The molecular pathogenesis of a large number of pediatric brain tumors is still unaccounted for, and the hierarchy of tumors is likely to be more complex and intricate than currently acknowledged. One of the main tasks of future molecular analyses in pediatric neuro-oncology, including the ongoing genome sequencing efforts, is to elucidate the biological basis of those orphan tumors.

At least 1 NANOS member was contacted for each non-US nation in the NANOS membership roster. If there were multiple NANOS members from 1 country, multiple were contacted. If responses were received from more than 1 person from a single country, the first response received was used as the source data. The survey (in English) was emailed to 47 NANOS members from 31 countries. Twenty responses were received representing members from 15 nations. In all 15 nations, at least half of the neuro-ophthalmologists were trained as ophthalmologists. In 60% of nations, at least half of the neuro-ophthalmologists were trained internally, whereas in 33% of countries, at least half were trained in the United States. The number of physicians who practiced a significant amount of neuro-ophthalmology ranged from low (0.08/million, India) to high (3.10/million, Israel). Countries having the highest percentage of neuro-ophthalmologists exclusively practicing neuro-ophthalmology also were those with better patient access to neuro-ophthalmic care. Requirement of approval to see a neuro-ophthalmologist or for imaging studies requested by neuro-ophthalmologists was not typical. In most nations, academic neuro-ophthalmologists were paid a straight salary. In no nation were neuro-ophthalmologists paid more than another ophthalmic subspecialty. Individual national health care system designs and compensation models have had a profound influence on the rewards and challenges that face neuro-ophthalmologists. There seems to have been a connection between recognition of the discipline, financial rewards of neuro-ophthalmic practice, conditions that permit full-time neuro-ophthalmic practice, and patient access to care. A higher percentage of gross national product for health care did not seem to insure an adequate supply of neuro-ophthalmologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29286948/"}

The primary goal of this study is to define the specificity of neuro-ophthalmology within the realm of visual health. The secondary goal is to review clinical care pathways by studying the organization of management, in terms of accessibility to care and personalization of the care pathway. A field study was carried out from February to June 2015, within the ophthalmology service of the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Medical Center in Paris. A 30-minute interview with the patient before or after his or her neuro-ophthalmology consultation was performed, so as to describe the clinical care pathway. The medical records of interviewed patients were also analyzed. Seventeen care pathways (10 women and 7 men) were reviewed. The mean age at appearance of visual involvement was 44.5 years (±8.4 years). If we exclude 3 patients over 66 years and retired, 35.71% were active, 35.71% were disabled, and 28.57% were on sick leave. Ten patients (58.82%) met the criteria for admission to long-term care. The first step had been carried out by local private practitioners. The first physician seen was the general medicine physician (59%), then the private ophthalmologist on an emergency basis (17%). On average, patients went through 8 steps during their care pathway (from 6 to 10 steps) and 14 medical departments were involved. The study showed collaboration with the other services of the University Hospital Department of Vision and Disabilities (notably with the Fondation Rothschild, the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital and the Fondation Sainte-Marie). In addition to rehabilitation services, health care professionals participating in the outpatient care of the patients included an orthoptist (11.7%), a psychologist (11.7%), and an optician specializing in low vision for visual aids. And finally, patient support groups, AFM-Téléthon (myasthenia) and the ARIBa Association (visual disability) were solicited by 2 patients for their involvement. A disturbance in activities of daily living leading to disabilities with psychological repercussions was noted by a number of patients. The most frequent complaints involve mobility (29.41%) and reading (23.52%). In total, 77% of patients state that their well-being has been affected and they are disturbed by the progression of their disease. The review of the clinical care pathway of patients affected by neuro-ophthalmological conditions shows that these pathologies are, on the one hand, often poorly understood, and on the other hand complex, leading to an often significant number of steps for the patient. This also emphasizes the necessity of a care network, specialized and structured to improve the efficiency of this management. Finally, these results demonstrate the existence of a very frequent disability, which may affect all aspects of the patients' lives, highlighting the importance of rehabilitation services and individuals participating in the follow-up of these patients beyond their acute care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28623040/"}

Development of neuroimaging led neurosurgeons to achieve tumorectomy according to the oncological limits provided by preoperative or intraoperative structural and metabolic imaging. However, this principle is not coherent, neither with the infiltrative nature of DLGGs nor with the limited resolution of current neuroimaging. Indeed, despite technical advances, MRI still underestimates the actual spatial extent of gliomas, since tumoral cells are present several millimeters to centimeters beyond the area of signal abnormalities. Furthermore, cortical and subcortical structures may be still crucial for brain functions despite their invasion by this diffuse tumoral disease. Finally, the lack of reliability of functional MRI has also been demonstrated. Therefore, to talk about \"maximal safe resection\" based upon neuroimaging is a non-sense, because oncological MRI does not show the tumor and functional MRI does not show critical neural pathways. This review proposes an original concept in neuro-oncological surgery, i.e. to resect DLGG to the boundaries of brain functions, thanks to intraoperative electrical mapping performed in awake patients. This paradigmatic shift from image-guided resection to functional mapping-guided resection, based upon an accurate study of brain connectomics and neuroplasticity in each patient throughout tumor removal has permitted to solve the classical dilemma, by increasing both survival and quality of life in DLGG patients. With this in mind, brain surgeons should also be neuroscientists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25907410/"}

The top 100 neuro-oncology citation classics consisted of 43 clinical studies (17 retrospective, 10 prospective, 16 randomized trials), 43 laboratory investigations, 8 reviews/meta-analyses, and 6 guidelines/consensus statements. Articles were classified into 4 themes: 13 pertained to tumor classification, 37 to tumor pathogenesis/clinical presentation, 6 to imaging, 44 to therapy (15 chemotherapy, 10 radiotherapy, 5 surgery, 14 new agents). Gliomas were the most common tumor type examined, with 70 articles. There was a significant increase in the number of citation classics in the late 1990s, which was paralleled by an increase in studies examining tumor pathogenesis, chemotherapy, and new agents along with laboratory and randomized studies. The majority of citation classics in neuro-oncology are related to gliomas and pertain to tumor pathogenesis and treatment. The rise in citation classics in recent years investigating tumor biology, new treatment agents, and chemotherapeutics may reflect increasing scientific interest in nonsurgical treatments for CNS tumors and the need for fundamental investigations into disease processes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28531344/"}

Even more difficult is to envisage the prospects of Yugoslav neuroscience in the light of European integration. Several problems serve to illustrate the present situation concerning Yugoslav neuroscience. First, the weakness of the self-organization of science in Yugoslavia during the past 20 years is still the most important denominator in the current trend of neuroscience. Second, different Yugoslav republics have significantly different systems of science funding and evaluation, which reflect very plainly different levels of democratic (and socioeconomic) changes that were attained during 1990. Third, due to the different numbers of trained scientists, facilities and equipment, funds and levels of international scientific cooperation there are major differences between republics in the tempo of progress towards real achievements in science. Finally, the present explosive development of neuroscience and the proclamation of the 'Decade of the Brain' will hopefully stimulate Yugoslav neuroscientists to seek better programmes of neuroscience research and to improve the extent and quality of international cooperation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1713716/"}

Adult neurointensive care has existed as a speciality in its own right for over 20 years; however, it is only recently that large prospective studies have demonstrated the benefit of this model of care. The 'Neuro-intensive Care Nursery' model originated at the University of California San Francisco in 2008, and since then a growing number of units worldwide have adopted this approach. As well as providing consistent coordinated care for infants from a multidisciplinary team, it provides opportunities for specialist education and training in neonatal neurology, neuromonitoring, neuroimaging and nursing.

The CNS is protected by a formidable blood brain barrier (BBB) which limits surgical, therapeutic and diagnostic interventions. The hostile environment created by reactive astrocytes in the CNS along with the limited regeneration capacity of the PNS makes functional recovery after tissue damage difficult and inefficient. Nanomaterials have the unique ability to interface with neural tissue in the nano-scale and are capable of influencing the function of a single neuron. The ability of nanoparticles to transcend the BBB through surface modifications has been exploited in various neuro-imaging techniques and for targeted drug delivery. The tunable topography of nanofibers provides accurate spatio-temporal guidance to regenerating axons. This review is an attempt to comprehend the progress in understanding the obstacles posed by the complex physiology of the nervous system and the innovations in design and fabrication of advanced nanomaterials drawing inspiration from natural phenomenon. We also discuss the development of nanomaterials for use in Neuro-diagnostics, Neuro-therapy and the fabrication of advanced nano-devices for use in opto-electronic and ultrasensitive electrophysiological applications. The energy efficient and parallel computing ability of the human brain has inspired the design of advanced nanotechnology based computational systems.

Désiré Bourneville had triggered Charcot's interest in hysteria during his stay as an <i>interne</i> in his department, while Charles Richet's 1875 article on somnambulism was the trigger for Charcot to develop hypnotism. Charcot's collaborators Paul Richer, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, Paul Sollier, Joseph Babinski, Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet subsequently became most famous in hysteria. In 1908, a \"quarrel of hysteria\" opposed several of Charcot's pupils, from which Babinski, who had developed the concept of \"pithiatism\", was considered victorious against Charcot's first successor Fulgence Raymond. There was a surge of interest in hysteria associated with war psycho-neuroses in 1914-1918, and Babinski's pupil Clovis Vincent developed a treatment called <i>torpillage</i> (torpedoing) against war hysteria, associating painful galvanic current discharges with \"persuasion\". After World War I, the neurological and psychiatric interest in hysteria again faded away, before a renewed interest at the turn of the last century. Contrary to a common view, the modernity of several of Charcot's concepts in hysteria is remarkable, still today, mainly for: (1) his traumatic theory, which encompassed psychological and certain sexual factors several years before Freud; (2) his personal evolution towards the role of emotional factors, which opened the way to Janet and Freud; (3) his claim of specific differences vs. similarities in mental states such as hypnotism, hysteria, and simulation, which has recently been confirmed by functional imaging; and (4) his \"dynamic lesion\" theory, which now correlates well with recently established neurophysiological mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32500757/"}

In 1836, he was elected to the Chair of Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, and remained there until his death in 1842, at 68 years of age. During his career, Bell was a prolific medical author, a brilliant medical researcher and a skilled artist. In 1811, he discovered the distinct functions of the motor and sensory nerves, findings that were initially published in a pamphlet entitled 'Ideas of a New Anatomy of the Brain'. In 1821, Bell described the long thoracic nerve, which supplies the serratus anterior muscle, and which now bears his name. In the same paper he showed that lesions of the seventh cranial nerve produce facial paralysis (now termed Bell's palsy). He also demonstrated that the fifth cranial nerve is of sensory importance to the face and controls the muscles of mastication, whereas the seventh cranial nerve principally controls the muscles of facial expression.

The modern neuroscience intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) is grounded in close collaboration between neurointensivists and neurosurgeons in the management of patients with such conditions as ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematomas, and traumatic brain injury. Neuro-ICUs are also capable of specialized monitoring such as serial neurological examinations by trained neuro-ICU nurses; invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygenation, and cerebral hemodynamics; cerebral microdialysis; and noninvasive monitoring, including the use of pupillometry, ultrasound monitoring of optic nerve sheath diameters, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, and continuous electroencephalography. Neuro-ICUs are also capable of specialized neuroprotective management of medical complications, including sodium disorders, renal failure, respiratory failure, and hypertension. These units depend on an interdisciplinary team including speech and language pathologists, occupational and physical therapists, and social workers and case managers, who work to implement early mobilization and successful transition to rehabilitation centers. There are numerous models of neuro-ICUs ranging from \"open\" units in which patients are cared for in an ICU by an admitting attending, generally without involvement of an intensivist, to \"semi-open\" units in which intensivists act as consultants, to \"closed\" units in which the neurointensivist is the admitting attending.

Each expert provided an answer and then edited a ChatGPT-4-generated response, timing both tasks. In addition, 5 LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude 2, Bing, Bard) generated responses. Anonymized and randomized responses from Expert + AI, human experts, and LLMs were evaluated by the remaining 12 experts. The main outcome was the mean score for quality and empathy, rated on a 1-5 scale. Significant differences existed between response types for both quality and empathy ( P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001).

The European Paediatric Neurology Society first designed and published the European PN training programme in the European Paediatric Neurology Syllabus in 2002. This was important in gaining recognition for the sub-specialty from the European Academy of Paediatrics and the European Academy of Neurology and in 2003 PN was recognized as a sub-specialty of paediatrics and neurology by the Board of the European Union of Medical Specialties. In 2004, the EPNS founded the Committee of National Advisors (CNA) that comprised representatives from national Paediatric Neurology societies, in order to further enhance Europe wide standards in training and practice., The EPNS Training Advisory Board (TAB) offers nation specific advice/support to PN societies on developing training and care systems. In 2019, the 2nd revision of the Paediatric Neurology Syllabus was approved by the EPNS Board and CNA. We aim to give an overview of the training of Paediatric Neurology (PN) specialists (i.e. Paediatric Neurologists), the relevant professional bodies and the current practice of Paediatric Neurology in Europe, as defined geographically by the World Health Organization. A structured online data collection form was completed by CNA representatives from European countries. The data included training routes and structure of training, epidemiological data, nature of professional societies, organization of Paediatric Neurology care, research, academic life and recognition of the specialty. Data was collected from 43 European countries of which 38 have a national PN Society. In 10 (6 European Union (EU) and 4 non-EU countries) PN is recognized as a core specialty. In 26 countries PN is recognized as a sub-specialty of Paediatrics, Neurology or both (15 EU-11 non-EU). PN is not recognized as a core or sub-specialty in 7 countries (4 EU and 3 non-EU). In 35 countries paediatric neurologists begin their training from Paediatrics, but in 19 countries PN training from Neurology is also possible or the preferred route.

This review describes the use of LHS models in neurology and the use of Improvement Science to advance position system changes and improve care. LHSs are broadly understandable, widely supported, and have a developing yet proven track record. However, there are distinct challenges at multiple levels in successful implementation, as well as nuances related to variability in practice patterns and institutions. This review outlines these hurdles and approaches to addressing them. There are examples of effective work currently being conducted in this emerging field, with an emphasis on two subspecialties that have been the primary early adopters of these models and methodology within neurology: stroke and epilepsy. As LHS models take shape in neurology subspecialties, there will be an ongoing need for collaboration and iterative change to support continuous improvement in systems of care and improve outcomes for patients with neurologic disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40064479/"}

Six decades later, the hot bath test and various other heating reactions (HR) began to be used diagnostically. They were essentially discontinued after 1983, being replaced by more specific and safer tests and procedures. Over 80% of MS patients develop a panoply of neurological signs during hyperthermia, 60% of which are \"new\" to that patient. The literature contains a number of unexplained paradoxical responses of MS patients during induced hyperthermia. These challenge the current hypothesis that, in MS, hyperthermia induces a heat-linked neuro-blockade of partially demyelinated axons. Some MS patients developed signs before temperature elevations occurred; others showed clearing of signs while temperatures were elevated or were ascending. Several MS patients improved for about 3 hours after being tested, a rebound phenomenon known as \"overshoot.\" Conversely, other MS patients developed persistent neurological deficits after hyperthermia. The etiology of HR may be multifactorial. This includes heat itself, effects of serum calcium, blockade of ion channels, circulatory changes, heat shock proteins, and unidentified humoral substances. Research techniques are suggested to continue investigations into the enigma of HR, hopefully to widen knowledge of demyelination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7751837/"}

Dr. Bielschowsky was one of the founders of neuro-ophthalmology. This review, with biographical notes, is presented in his honor. Dr. Bielschowsky and the author had similar disruptive experiences, of historic interest, during the Hitler regime in Nazi Germany. Professor Bielschowsky's legacy begins with his contributions to ocular physiology. For instance, his after-image test establishes the presence of retinal correspondence, important for stereoscopic vision. Alfred Bielschowsky taught how an ocular examination is critical for neuro-ophthalmologic diagnosis, localization, prognostication, and treatment. Much of our knowledge is linked with his name. Examples include \"Bielschowsky's Phenomenon\", explaining dissociated vertical movements, and \"Bielschowsky's Doll's Head Phenomenon\" (Doll's Eyes), describing proprioceptive reflexes important for localizing intracranial lesions. Dr. Bielschowsky emphasized many pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of oculomotor anomalies. For example, he cautioned against mistaking the compensatory head position in congenital fourth cranial nerve paresis for neck muscle disease. Dr. Bielschowsky's emphasis on the clinical examination remains critical despite today's advanced diagnostic equipment. His legacy is the application of physiology to patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9736210/"}

This paper will unearth information on the pioneers of clinical neurology in SA. Taken together, these sources reveal several important milestones in the long history of the field. The department of Neurology at the Hospital San Roque de Buenos Aires was created in 1885 and headed by José María Ramos Mejía, who then took over as Professor of Neurology at the University of Buenos Aires School of Medicine in 1887. The first institute of neurology in Latin America, the Instituto Neurológico de Montevideo, was founded in 1926 under Américo Ricaldoni's direction.

{"id": "39369698", "title": "Neurology of Aging: Adapting Neurology Provision for an Aging Population.", "text": "Over the past few decades, advances in the neurology of aging have been considerable and have led to a better understanding of the science of age-related neurological disorders. Likewise, it changed the perception of classical neurology practice, research, and the way of looking at age-related conditions. Neurological disorders are the most frequent cause of major disability in the elderly and account for almost half of the incapacitation occurring beyond age 65 and more than 90% of serious dependency. However, a number of neurological changes occur also in the absence of a specific disease, making the assessment and management of neurological complaints and findings a specific expertise. Maximizing success in clinical care of the elderly requires expertise in geriatric neurology, which includes an understanding of current research regarding aging and age-related neurological dysfunctions, and the ability to work with other geriatric healthcare providers. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases mainly offer symptomatic relief without slowing progression, the landscape is evolving. Biomarkers of pathology and neuroimaging have continued to develop, with a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment. These advances have not only helped to improve our knowledge of disease pathophysiology but also disease stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring, and possible therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage. Neurological disorders are a leading cause of major disability and dependency in the elderly, underscoring the need for expertise in geriatric neurology for effective clinical care of this population. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases primarily provide symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, advancements in biomarkers and neuroimaging are significantly evolving. These advancements enhance our understanding of disease pathophysiology and stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring and potential therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage. As knowledge about age-associated conditions is steadily rising and geriatric medicine gains further recognition, this article argues for a new focus on the role of neurologists in geriatric medicine, emphasizing the importance of integrating current research and collaborative care approaches in the management of elderly patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39369698/"}

Ethics issues in contemporary neuroscience as they apply separately to genetics and neuroimaging have been a growing focus for research but, to date, there has not yet been a rigorous exploration of the ethical dimensions of the territory in which they overlap. Here we propose that the ethics challenges associated with the combination of these methods call for an expanded \"neuro-space\" in which societal and ethical values are closely and explicitly integrated with the new science. We build specifically on the model delivered by Roffman et al. [Roffman JL, Weiss AP, Goff DC, Rauch SL, Weinberger DR (2006) Neuroimaging-genetic paradigms: a new approach to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Harv Rev Psychiatry 14:78-91] for neuroimaging, and develop the argument that the ethics issues parallel the heightened discriminative and cumulative power of imaging genetics. In the new combined space, features of discriminative power concern better differentiation of disease, sometimes by ethnicity, and incidental findings. Clinical utility, prediction and intervention, and stigma and labeling reflect a common ground between discriminative and cumulative power. Privacy, autonomy, response sensitivity and attitudes, resource allocation for research and for health care, and commercialization, are features of cumulative power. Parallel to the clinical features highlighted in the Roffman et al. map, the combined space yields additional neuroethics features. These are characterized by new knowledge and new implications for health care, justice, and policy. We conclude by examining these features in the context of public health at the interface of emerging new neurotechnologies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19409220/"}

Comparative effectiveness research aims to elucidate the relative value (including clinical benefit, clinical harms, and/or costs) of alternative efficacious management approaches to a neurological disorder, generally through direct comparisons, and may include comparisons of methodologies for implementation. Congress has recently appropriated resources and established an institute to prioritize funding for such research. Neurologists and neuroscientists should understand the scope and objectives of comparative effectiveness and implementation research, their range of methodological approaches (formal literature syntheses, randomized trials, observational studies, modeling), and existing research resources (centers for literature synthesis, registries, practice networks) relevant to research for neurological conditions, to close the well-documented evidence-to-practice gap.

His views were revived by 18th-century animists and vitalists who were able to accept body-mind interactions, unlike the followers of Leibniz (e.g. Haller) who stuck to his psychophysical parallelism without possible interaction. This was also the creed of John Hughlings Jackson, whose influence on the development of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology in the first decades of the 20th century was second to none. Neuropsychiatry, a Germanic specialty, was able to germinate in 1845 in Griesinger's 'Pathology and therapy of mental diseases', after Gall, Mesmer, Johannes Müller and many others had reformed and expanded the concept of mind-body interaction. In the second half of the 19th century, in the German-speaking countries progress in both neurology and psychiatry was usually achieved by neuro-psychiatrists. Neuropsychology (Lashley, 1913) was a product of both Jacksonian and Germanic neuropsychiatric ideas. During the 20th century neurology was separated from psychiatry, but new trends and their names such as 'psychobiology' and 'biological psychiatry', although quite old, are suggestive of a new kind of neuropsychiatry.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8539504/"}

Anecdotal evidence suggests that countries with regulated systems of neuropathology training and an active professional organization are more likely to have an adequate supply of diagnostic specialists and a vibrant research community. The different training systems reflect the style of medical services delivery in the respective countries. In general, the existence of formal neuropathology training systems occurs only in countries with relatively high levels of per capita health expenditures, reflecting the development of medical specialization overall.

Both plaintiff and defendant teams hire expert witnesses who are frequently active investigators in relevant fields to bolster their positions. These legal proceedings can influence investigators and hamper research. Interactions with researchers can lead to personal financial or career gain that may bias research findings or impugn other investigators. Even researchers who have not been retained by either side of a legal dispute may be forced to respond to subpoenas for research data causing a substantial loss of research time for investigators and financial burdens on universities.

A response rate of 74% (98 of 132) was achieved. A dedicated neuroscience intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) existed in 64%. Fifty-six percent of residency programs offer a dedicated rotation in the neuro-ICU, lasting 4 weeks on average. Where available, the neuro-ICU rotation was required in the vast majority (91%) of programs.

Additional advances are also likely to be made in the methods of functional electrostimulation and tissue engineering. Neurourology is predominantly influenced by our dynamic-functional understanding and the functionally oriented planning and implementation of treatment. The initial treatment options in many areas of neurourology are conservative, but, when possible, not irreversible. If these are ineffective or lead to late complications (e.g. by congenital paraplegia), there are a series of organ sparing or organ manipulating operations which can restore organ function. These make it possible to save kidney function from continuing damage, and, in many cases, to restore continence. The permanent indwelling catheter should remain excluded from the treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. With adequate treatment, patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction can be protected from severe complications and reintegrated into their normal social environment. After the acute phase of rehabilitation, urology is the most commonly required specialist area for paraplegic patients. In the past, urological problems have contributed most to the short lifespan of patients with an accident related spinal cord injury.

Clinicians can use a variety of reasoning, such as model (pattern), exhaustive, probabilistic, deterministic (categorical), and hypothetical-deductive reasoning mechanisms. The neurologist must be aware of what kind of reasoning is being used at a given time as well as the errors that can occur. Most of these errors are found in the probabilistic setting and can be grouped into three categories: representativeness errors, availability or adjustment and anchoring biases. Most of them occur due to an inadequate intuitive judgement by the physician to handle the probabilities. There are other sources of error, related with the diagnostic process or with the environmental circumstances in which they develop. The most important ones as well as their theoretical and practical implications are described. In the evidence based medicine era, it is important for the clinical neurologists to be aware of this terminology and concepts for an adequate practice of neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15372335/"}

Patients are often admitted unnecessarily for neurology review, leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Alternative models, such as the Neurology Same Day Emergency Care service (Neuro-SDEC) at University College London Hospital provide a pathway that can prevent admissions and streamline patient care. Headache is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in acute neurology.This study compared the impact of Neuro-SDEC on the care for patients presenting with headache against the standard pathway.A prospective audit was undertaken from November - December 2023 to evaluate all appropriate patients seen by the Neuro-SDEC service or admitted to the ward. For Neuro-SDEC patients, each case was reviewed to see whether an admission, lumbar puncture or neurology outpatient referral was avoided. For admitted patients, length of inpatient stay, time to neurology review and discharge diagnosis was recorded.Fifty-one patients were seen by Neuro-SDEC, twenty-five of whom would have been admitted to hospital on the standard pathway. Thirty general neurology outpatient clinic referrals were prevented and 5 patients avoided a lumbar puncture. In 45% of cases, the working diagnosis changed after the patient was seen by the Neuro-SDEC team. There were seven admitted patients not seen by the service with a combined length of stay of 17 bed days. The average wait time for inpatient neurology review was 42 hours. 3 admitted patients underwent a lumbar puncture. 2 patients were referred on to neuro-SDEC to enable an earlier discharge from hospital. Migraine was the most common final diagnosis in both groups.This study highlights that Neuro-SDEC is effective at reducing hospital admissions, as well as unnecessary tests and referrals to generalneurology outpatients. For admitted patients, the service enabled earlier discharge from hospital and reduced length of stay.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39740860/"}

The first European Training Requirements in Neurology (ETRN) were published in 2005 and first updated in 2016. This paper reports the most recent revisions of the ETRN. Members of the EAN board performed an in depth revision of the ETNR 2016-version, which was reviewed by members of the European Board and Section of Neurology of the UEMS, the Education and Scientific Panels, the Resident and Research Fellow Section and the Board of the EAN, as well as the presidents of the 47 European National Societies. The new (2022) ETRN suggest a 5-year training subdivided in three phases: a first phase (2 years) of general neurology training, a second phase (2 years) of training in neurophysiology/neurological subspecialties and a third phase (1 year) to expand clinical training (e.g., in other neurodisciplines) or for research (path for clinical neuroscientist). The necessary theoretical and clinical competences as well as learning objectives in diagnostic tests have been updated, are newly organized in four levels and include 19 neurological subspecialties. Finally, the new ETRN require, in addition to a programme director, a team of clinician-educators who regularly review the resident's progress. The 2022 update of the ETRN reflects emerging requirements for the practice of neurology and contributes to the international standardization of training necessary for the increasing needs of residents and specialists across Europe.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37294693/"}

We sought to develop a unique PNCC program using the concept of Community of Practice (CoP). This is a process improvement project in an academic Children's Hospital. Using CoP framework (domain, community, practice), we created a domain of PNCC with a stated vision and formal organizational structure, a core community of intensivists and neurologists interested in PNCC, and a standardized practice approach by establishing core competencies for PNCC and implementing practice guidelines. We evaluated the program through the Four-Frame Model of Organizational Theory and Behavior (structural, human resource, political, symbolic) and by the Neurocritical Care Society's (NCS's) standards for a Level I Neurocritical Care Unit (Neuro-ICU). Structural frame included opening a pediatric Neuro-ICU, identifying PNCC leaders across specialties, and developing a multidisciplinary care delivery model. Human resource frame included forming physician and nurse groups with a primary role in PNCC and ongoing education through workshops, lecture series, and certification. Politically, program implementation was tailored to each department gaining institution-wide support for program initiatives. Symbolically, the PNCC program highlighted the vision to advance knowledge and best practices. Our program met 232 of 252 (92%) proposed NCS standards. The CoP as the foundation for program development has enabled us to achieve the majority of standards proposed by NCS for a Level I Neuro-ICU. The generalizability of these frameworks may facilitate the development of a PNCC program for other institutions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36029730/"}

{"id": "24491971", "title": "Tournay's description of anisocoria on lateral gaze: reaction, myth, or phenomenon?", "text": "The year 1917 witnessed the opening of a great debate in neuro-ophthalmology, with Tournay's description of a phenomenon thought to be universal: anisocoria in lateral gaze, due to mydriasis of the abducting pupil and a minor miosis of the fellow one. Through many publications, this phenomenon was soon assessed and confirmed to be physiologic, while the cause of the pupil reaction in lateral gaze was extensively discussed. Cases of abolition and reversal of the phenomenon were also reported in specific clinical situations, such as neurosyphilis, and its study became part of the neuro-ophthalmologic examination. Publications on the phenomenon declined after 1934, with only one publication appearing between 1934 and 1974 (1957). In 1974, the demise of the Tournay phenomenon was secured after 2 pupillographic studies showed it to be rare and marginal. This story is reviewed. Hypotheses are proposed in order to help unfold the controversy; anisocoria in lateral gaze should not be regarded as a myth, nor does it--or only rarely--correspond to a pupil reaction, or noumenon: it can usually be accounted for by a specific optical distortion (apparent without real anisocoria) and hence fits the Kantian definition of a phenomenon. An understanding of Tournay phenomenon is therefore of current relevance to the examination of the pupils to avoid misinterpretation of observed changes in the pupil.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24491971/"}

Presence of pathogenic/ likely-pathogenic variants, novel genetic variants, and novel phenotype associations were noted. Clinical phenotypes included: neuromuscular (n = 14), extrapyramidal (n = 8), ataxia (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), spastic paraplegia (n = 5), stroke (n = 4), progressive myoclonic epilepsy (n = 1) and epilepsy with developmental delay (n = 1). Fifty-eight variants were identified in 43 genes in 34 patients, that included 15 (25.9%) reported variants. Genetic diagnosis could be established in 14 (30.43%) subjects. Six probands (13%) harboured previously unreported variants in a clinically relevant gene. Nine probands harboured unreported variants in two or more different genes associated with the clinical phenotype. In three probands we noted novel associations between the phenotype and genetic variation. In all patients, genetic diagnosis impacted treatment and prognostication. We present data of NGS in adults with suspected neuro-genetic disorders from India and this is the first report of its kind.

The Script Concordance Test (SCT), based on script theory from cognitive psychology, uses authentic clinical scenarios to compare a trainee's judgment skills with those of experts. The SCT has been validated in several medical disciplines, but has not been investigated in neurology. We developed an Internet-based neurology SCT (NSCT) comprising 24 clinical scenarios with three to four questions each. The scenarios were designed to reflect the uncertainty of real-life clinical encounters in adult neurology. The questions explored aspects of the scenario in which several responses might be acceptable; trainees were asked to judge which response they considered to be best. Forty-one PGY1-PGY5 neurology residents and eight medical students from three North American neurology programs (McGill, Calgary, and Mayo Clinic) completed the NSCT. The responses of trainees to each question were compared with the aggregate responses of an expert panel of 16 attending neurologists. The NSCT demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.79). Neurology residents scored higher than medical students and lower than attending neurologists, supporting the test's construct validity. Furthermore, NSCT scores discriminated between senior (PGY3-5) and junior residents (PGY1-2). Our NSCT is a practical and reliable instrument, and our findings support its construct validity for assessing judgment in neurology trainees.

Differences between real CPP and target CPP (named generically optimal CPP) has been linked to global outcome in adult traumatic brain injury (TBI). Different vascular reactivity indices can be utilized in the determination. The goal of this study is to evaluate CPPopt parameters, derived from three intracranial pressure (ICP)-derived cerebrovascular reactivity indices, and determine which one is superior for 6- to 12-month outcome prediction. Using the prospectively collected data from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) study, the following indices of cerebrovascular reactivity were derived: pressure reactivity index (PRx; correlation between ICP and mean arterial pressure [MAP]), pulse amplitude index (PAx; correlation between pulse amplitude of ICP [AMP] and MAP), and RAC (correlation between AMP and CPP). CPPopt was derived using each index. Univariate logistic regression models were created to assess the association between CPPopt with global dichotomized outcome at 6 to 12 months, as assessed by Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended. Models were compared via area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and Delong's Test. A total of 204 patients had available data. CPPopt derived from PRx, PAx, and RAC performed variably in their association with outcomes. PRx- and RAC-based CPPopt performed similarly, with RAC parameters trending towards highest AUC values. PAx-based CPPopt parameters failed to reach significant associations with dichotomized outcomes at 6 to 12 months.

{"id": "8807424", "title": "Child neurology: past, present, and future.", "text": "The emergence of child neurology as an independent discipline was enhanced by pediatricians developing an organ system approach to the study of illnesses of children and indirectly by their interest in normal psychomotor development, a function of maturation of the nervous system. Technological innovations, advances in neuroimaging, and the development of therapeutic agents directly benefited patients with neurologic disorders and enhanced the role of the neurologist. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology was founded in 1934. It formally recognized child neurology as a special area of expertise in 1959 when Sidney Carter was appointed as a director and the clinical examination was changed to include an hour devoted specifically to child neurology. In 1969, special certificates in child neurology were issued. Thirty candidates, or more, have successfully passed the examination each year since then. As of Spring 1995, there had been 1007 certificates issued to child neurologists. In 1991 and 1992, alternative pathways to training in child neurology were developed. These substituted a year of internal medicine or a year of basic neuroscience research for 1 year of pediatrics. Relatively few child neurologists have chosen these alternative pathways. The performance of child neurologists, on Board examinations has generally been comparable to that of adult neurologists with the latter holding a slight edge. In 1990, a study of first-time takers of the certification examination was begun. In child neurology, 54% of the cohort passed both parts I and II on their first attempts, and as of July 1995, 81% of the original cohort was certified. In adult neurology, the comparable rates are 56% and 84%. Accreditation of child neurology training programs began in 1987. As of November 1995, there were 75 accredited child neurology training programs, which offered slightly over 200 total positions. Changes in health care delivery are currently taking place and have placed greater emphasis on primary care physicians. Proposals have been put forth that, if enacted, will reduce the current number of medical students and also reduce the total number of residents being trained. Reductions as great as 40% of current resident number have been proposed. Child neurology will need to reassess our current work force and training needs and re-evaluate our role in the training of primary care physicians. There appears to be a paradox. Explosions of information in both the basic and clinical neurosciences have directly benefited our patients, but yet our continued growth as a subspecialty is being challenged.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8807424/"}

OPTCARE Neuro is a multicentre trial evaluating the effectiveness of short-term integrated palliative care (SIPC) for progressive long-term neurological conditions. Here, we present survey results describing the current levels of collaboration between neurology and palliative care services and exploring the views of professionals towards the new SIPC service. Neurology and palliative care teams from six UK trial sites (London, Nottingham, Liverpool, Cardiff, Brighton and Chertsey) were approached via email to complete an online survey. The survey was launched in July 2015 and consisted of multiple choice or open comment questions with responses collected using online forms. 33 neurology and 26 palliative care professionals responded. Collaborations between the two specialties were reported as being 'good/excellent' by 36% of neurology and by 58% of palliative care professionals. However, nearly half (45%) of neurology compared with only 12% of palliative care professionals rated current levels as being 'poor/none'. Both professional groups felt that the new SIPC service would influence future collaborations for the better. However, they identified a number of barriers for the new SIPC service such as resources and clinician awareness. Our results demonstrate the opportunity to increase collaboration between neurology and palliative care services for people with progressive neurological conditions, and the acceptability of SIPC as a model to support this.

Ninety-five respondents (60%) from all the participating countries completed the survey. Sixty-one reported frequent-attendance (≥ 1 per month), 23 reported infrequent-attendance (< 1 per month), and 11 never participated. The most frequently reported attendance-barriers were the subspecialist's workload (64%), the timing of the teleconference (38%), and Internet connectivity problems (29%). Subspecialist's workload was more frequently reported as a barrier compared with other barriers, in both the frequent- and infrequent-attendance groups (p < 0.05), with the exception of the timing of the meeting in the infrequent-attendance group. More than 80% of attendees found the frequency and duration of the teleconference were sufficient. Utilizing Spanish as the primary language was reported to enhance the recommendations by 93% of the attendees. Moreover, 84% reported that the recommendations (almost) always fit the local circumstances. Furthermore, 99% of attendees found the teleconference provided a continuing medical education opportunity. Finally, 96% of attendees (almost) always found that the provided recommendations helped to improve the outcomes/quality of life of the patients.

Therefore, updating residency training programmes is crucial for the future of neurology. Several countries are currently discussing and/or modifying the structure of their neurology residency training programme. A detailed and up-to-date overview of the available European residency training programmes will aid this process. A questionnaire addressing numerous aspects of residency training programmes in neurology was distributed among 38 national representatives of the Resident and Research Fellow Section of the European Academy of Neurology. We obtained data from 32 European countries (response rate 84%). The median (range) duration of the residency training programmes was 60 (12-72) months. In the majority of countries, rotations to other medical disciplines were mandatory, mostly psychiatry (69%), internal medicine (66%) and neurosurgery (59%). However, the choice of medical fields and the duration of rotations varied substantially between countries. In 50% of countries, there were formal regulations regarding training in evidence-based medicine, teaching skills and/or leadership qualities. In many countries (75%), residents had to take an examination. We found substantial variation among European countries in the duration of residency training programmes, and especially in the choice of obligatory rotations to external medical disciplines. Despite a presumably similar spectrum of patients, neurology residency training programmes across Europe are not harmonized. The structure of the programme should be determined by its relevance for neurologists today and in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32248603/"}

We implemented a set of curricular interventions aimed at Resident Education through Adult Learning in Neurology (REAL Neurology), in a large, academic neurology residency program. Interventions included didactic reform, increasing resident-as-teacher activities, and enhancing residents' interaction. The primary outcome was the change in mean Residency In-service Training Examination (RITE) percentile between the preintervention and postintervention cohorts, adjusting for US Medical Licensing Examination step 1 and 2 score. Other analysis included evaluating the effect of the duration of intervention exposure on outcome and evaluating the intervention effect on the proportion of advanced performers. A total of 134 RITE score reports were evaluated (87 preintervention and 47 postintervention). The mean RITE score percentile postintervention was 11.7 points higher than preintervention (adjusted, longitudinal analysis: fit linear mixed model, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Postgraduate year 3 learners who had 1 and 2 years of exposure scored 13.4 and 18.9 points higher than those with no exposure at all, respectively (analysis of covariance, <i>p</i> = 0.04). The adjusted odds of better performance with REAL Neurology was 5.77 (ordinal logistic regression, 95% confidence interval 2.37-14.07, <i>p</i> < 0.05). This study evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of an ALT-based curricular program in neurology education.

This approach offers an opportunity to illuminate changes occurring at both the population and patient levels toward the realization of personalized medicine. This review is intended to provide research-driven clinicians with an overview of protein biomarkers of disease and injury for clinical use and to highlight methodology and potential pitfalls. We examine the neuroproteomic biomarker field and discuss the hallmarks and the challenges of clinically relevant biomarker discovery relating to central nervous system pathology. We discuss the issues in the maturation of potential biomarkers from discovery to Food and Drug Administration approval and review several platforms for protein biomarker discovery, including protein microarray and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. We describe the application of microfluidic technologies to the evolution of a robust clinical test. Finally, we highlight several biomarkers currently in use for cancer, ischemia, and injury in the central nervous system. Future efforts using these technologies will result in the maturation of existing and the identification of de novo biomarkers that could guide clinical decision making and advance diagnostic and therapeutic options for the treatment of neurological disease and injury.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21866062/"}

After praising Aran's \"beautiful description\", G.B. Duchenne de Boulogne subsequently persisted in claiming paternity, untiringly referring to a memoir on \"muscular atrophy with fatty transformation\" said to have been submitted to the Académie des Sciences in 1849. There is no trace of this memoir, and while it is true that the \"localized electrisation\" technique was applied by Duchenne to all the patients in Aran's memoir, and that he was the sole author of two of his observations, it is Aran who must be credited with the clinical description, the synthetic presentation and the appellation of \"progressive muscular atrophy\". Initially, this term covered a number of disparate facts which were later identified and put in their proper nosological place, even though this dismemberment left standing what Charcot called \"Duchenne-Aran disease\" before the Aran-Duchenne denomination prevailed.

This should lead to the development of improved teaching techniques. Previous work has shown that even those students who retain accessible knowledge of preclinical subjects, such as neuro-anatomy, find it difficult to use this in a clinical context. This study is preliminary to looking at correlations between student perception of what they like about a clinical topic and the ability to integrate clinical knowledge with pre-existing knowledge structures. The evaluation was carried out on 36 fifth year students who were taught clinical neurology in small groups concurrently with another topic, clinical decision making (CDM), by the same teacher. Neurology consistently rated at over 80% for enjoyment, interest and perceived clinical relevance. This contrasted with low ratings of less than 25% on all these parameters for CDM. An analysis of teaching methods showed that in neurology, contrasting with CDM, procedural rules were supplied for the application of preclinical knowledge at the bedside, students had an opportunity for active participation and problem solving in class, as well as frequent patient interaction. All these factors are important for student acceptance of a course, but further studies are needed to look at the interplay of preclinical knowledge and the acquisition of clinical expertise.

{"id": "6376716", "title": "The discovery of neuronopathy and neuropathy as a cause of progressive paralysis in childhood. The historical origins of modern differential diagnosis in neuromuscular disease.", "text": "The concept of the differential diagnosis has a central place in all clinical medicine. In neurology and paediatrics, evolution of thought concerning the differential diagnosis of the child presenting with symptoms of neuromuscular disease was far in advance of similar diagnostic approaches to problems of infectious, infective and neoplastic disease; and as such forms a significant historical model for the development of modern clinical approaches to the sick or disabled child. The account presented in this paper provides a detailed historical review of the development of thought relating to the causes of neuromuscular disease. Nosological developments concerning diseases of the motor unit can be conveniently classified into three periods: (a) a \"state of the art\" period to 1850; (b) 1850-1890 - a period of parallel and interdependent advances in both normal neuro-anatomy and neurophysiology, and diseases recognized as variations from such norms. In this era Duchenne was the first to write about the differential diagnosis of the progressive muscular paralysis in childhood; and Gowers was the first to write specifically on the hereditary transmission of this group of diseases; (c) in 1891 was described the first case of childhood neuronopathy recognized as such, and with this development was ushered in the modern era of clinical differential diagnosis of childhood neuromuscular disease. The \"splitters\" have won the great debate concerning the clinical approach to neurological diseases. The continual further refining of an exact diagnosis is the only way in which a realistic prognosis can be forecast, correct genetic counseling can be offered, and (if the condition is treatable) optimal therapy can be introduced.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6376716/"}

Differences between neurology and psychiatry, between molecular- and social engineering as exemplified by standards and continuing education for psychiatrists in the Netherlands].", "text": "Changes and growing uncertainty about the professional identity of Dutch psychiatrists can already be recognized in the early years following World War II. This is illustrated by a quotation from H.C. Rümke taken from his speech in 1954 entitled \"A Flourishing Psychiatry in Danger.\" Thus the stage was set for the central theme of this article concerning the mental health care system typical for the Netherlands and the development of multidisciplinary teams. In anticipation of the present situation, some future prognoses are also mentioned from K.P. Kisker's \"A Prognosis of Therapeutic Practice in Psychiatry\" (German: \"Prognose der psychiatrischen Therapeutik\") of 1973 in the opening section as background to the question: from today's point of view and in the face of scientific developments threatening the field, how does the need for identity and continuity in psychiatry relate to social, sociopolitical, and cultural factors? The first part of the discussion describes the development from combined neurological specialization to the separate fields of psychiatry and neurology. The second describes present day professional training in psychiatry. The conclusion highlights the efforts of the Dutch Psychiatry Association to use a so-called psychiatrist's profile (1996) to establish a consensus on long-term general acceptance in the comprehensive and multifaceted Dutch psychiatric care system. On the one hand, efforts are being made to maintain the unity of psychiatry, both as a professional field and as a special discipline. On the other hand, it is assumed that, at the end of their professional training, psychiatrists have an almost Protheus-like ability to develop and change in order to be successful in a wide variety of scientific subspecialties, professional roles, and institutional functions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10989805/"}

Those problems, yet not fully solved, have been in part overcome by the intradepartmental efforts; that is, to run all the electrophysiology works by us, to have the neuropath lab of our own and to read all the neuro-images in our own conferences. It is certainly ideal and efficient, if the persons specialized to the fields teach residents how to run and read. In my experience, however, I had no chance of performing a needle EMG when a resident. In contrast, our approach to let all the residents expose to necessary procedures, of course under the supervision, may have a great impact on the resident's learning experience. It is my recommendation, if I can, that in-training examination be done 2-3 years prior to the neurology board, the subspecialty training course needs to be more comprehensive, covering the entire basic and clinical subjects in one full week or so, and our Neurology Association eases the passing rate of neurology board exam (currently between 30-60%), when the association figures out the number of neurologists necessary in Japan for next 10-20 years. The tough exam has certainly served a role of producing well-qualified neurologists, which we are proud of. However, our young trainees in neurology require something else, that is, to touch and feel the patients, electrodes, specimens and neuro-images by themselves. Then, one will be able to perform the role of a fully practice-oriented neurologist, wherever he has to work.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12784687/"}

The practical experience of autopsy procedure promotes further knowledge and understandings of macroscopical findings of central nervous system.

In 1948, an attempt was made to establish a second neurological society in the USA. The American Academy of Neurology was formed around a group of young neurologists who represented the country's Midwest and other regions. The American Academy of Neurology is now the larger of the two organizations, even though the American Academy of Neurology began as a small and politically vulnerable organization, arising in the shadow of the powerful and established American Neurological Association. How did the 75-year-old association react when a second, seemingly redundant, neurological association attempted to organize? This question has not been the focus of historical work, and the purpose of this study was to address this. To do so, the author studied the primary source materials in the American Academy of Neurology Historical Collection and the papers of Dr Henry Alsop Riley, an American neurologist, who was influential in both the American Neurological Association and American Academy of Neurology. On its formation, the American Academy of Neurology did not enter a vacuum. Indeed, the long-existing American Neurological Association actively resisted the new organization. There was reluctance to accept the new idea on a conceptual level, a formal attempt to hijack the new organization and discussions about punitive actions against its founder, while at the same time an attempt to bring him into the American Neurological Association leadership. Although the American Neurological Association attempted to frame itself as the patrician 'upper chamber' of American neurology, the American Academy of Neurology leadership was ultimately savvier at political manoeuvring and use of government agencies and funding organizations. The struggle of the American Academy of Neurology with the American Neurological Association was in many ways one manifestation of a larger societal struggle in a post-bellum (post-World War II) America with a changing demographic. The struggle involved the rise of democratic medical populism in the country's Midwest versus establishment medicine (mainly situated in the Northeast), and perhaps, the rise of the middle class versus the aristocrats.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23288329/"}

Rapid scientific advances have led to disease-modifying or even curative treatments. However, delays and gaps in diagnosis, inequitable delivery, and the need for long-term surveillance pose unresolved challenges. The goal of the Child Neurology Society Research Committee was to evaluate and provide guidance on the obstacles, opportunities, and uncertainties in gene-targeted therapies for pediatric neurological disease. The Child Neurology Society Research Committee engaged in collaborative, iterative literature review and committee deliberations to prepare this consensus statement. We identified important challenges for gene-targeted therapies that require resource investments, infrastructure development, and strategic planning. Barriers include inequities in diagnosis and delivery of therapies, high costs, and a need for long-term surveillance of efficacy and safety, including systematic tracking of unanticipated effects. Key uncertainties regarding technical aspects and usage of gene-targeted therapies should be addressed, and characterization of new natural histories of diseases will be needed. Counterbalanced with these obstacles and uncertainties is the tremendous potential being demonstrated in treatments and clinical trials of gene-targeted therapies. Given that gene-targeted therapies for neurological diseases are in their earliest phase, the pediatric neurology community can play a vital role in their guidance and implementation. This role includes facilitating development of infrastructure and guidelines; ensuring efficient, equitable, and ethical implementation of treatments; and advocating for affordable and broad access for all children.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34628144/"}

Although physicians, patients, and ethicists endorse candid disclosure of harmful medical errors to patients, many physicians express uncertainty about how to approach these conversations. A growing body of research indicates physicians often fail to meet patient expectations for timely and open disclosure. Patients desire information about the error, an apology, and a plan for preventing recurrence of the error. To meet these expectations, physicians should participate in event investigations and plan thoroughly for each disclosure conversation, preferably with a disclosure coach. Physicians should also anticipate and attend to the ongoing medical and emotional needs of the patient. A cultural change towards greater transparency following medical errors is in motion. Substantial progress is still required, but neurologists can further this movement by promoting policies and environments conducive to open reporting, respectful disclosure to patients, and support for the healthcare workers involved.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24182370/"}

Rooted in the disciplines of the neurosciences and laboratory medicine, neuropathology evolved into an independent discipline with the founding of the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists in 1960, and the recognition as a specialty by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada in 1965, fostering the development of several successful training programs. Nonetheless, a paucity of data remains concerning the background of training, scopes of practice, and career paths. We conducted a survey of all physicians in Canada who have either practiced neuropathology or undergone relevant training. In 2009, 53 physicians were engaged in the practice of neuropathology, either exclusively or a substantial proportion of their time. Most work in tertiary hospitals, but a few service non-academic medical centers. Three routes of training were identified: direct from medical school (often with relevant research training), indirect from another clinical neuroscience specialty, and following or in conjunction with certification in one of the other pathology specialties. Practice profiles differ slightly, and some of the neuropathologists entering from pathology have mixed anatomical pathology/neuropathology responsibilities. Many of those with prior exposure in the neurosciences are more productive with regard to research and publications. Existing multiple options for neuropathology training have facilitated recruitment and allowed development of a mosaic of specialists able to fulfill the diversity of needs in Canadian medical and scientific communities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20437930/"}

A nationwide web-based survey was sent to the French medical community (students, residents, and graduated physicians) to collect sociodemographic and professional data, status, experience, and acquaintance in Neurology as well as qualitative hierarchical evocation question to assess the SR of French Neurologists. Overall, 367 people participated in the survey, including 112 medical students, 170 residents, and 85 graduated physicians. Only 14.3% of students listed neurology among their top 5 specialty choices, and 63.8% disagreed with the statement \"I could have chosen (or I will choose) neurology after the validation of my 6th year of medical studies.\" Qualitative analysis revealed that the most frequently occurring words used to describe neurologists were \"stroke\", \"complicated\", \"no treatment,\" \"clinical\", and \"brain\" and five themes corresponded to SRs of neurologist: his/her personal and professional traits (36.4% of the corpus), his/her daily practice (18.1%), the negative aspects of the neurological practice (15.3%), and the neurological pathology and daily skills (30.2%). The perception of neurologists by other physicians is nuanced.

Drawing from larger calibrated item banks, we developed short measures (8-9 items each) of 13 different QOL domains across physical, mental, and social health and evaluated their validity and reliability. Three samples were utilized during short form development: general population (Internet-based, n = 2,113); clinical panel (Internet-based, n = 553); and clinical outpatient (clinic-based, n = 581). All short forms are expressed as T scores with a mean of 50 and SD of 10. Internal consistency (Cronbach α) of the 13 short forms ranged from 0.85 to 0.97. Correlations between short form and full-length item bank scores ranged from 0.88 to 0.99 (0.82-0.96 after removing common items from banks). Online respondents were asked whether they had any of 19 different chronic health conditions, and whether or not those reported conditions interfered with ability to function normally. All short forms, across physical, mental, and social health, were able to separate people who reported no health condition from those who reported 1-2 or 3 or more. In addition, scores on all 13 domains were worse for people who acknowledged being limited by the health conditions they reported, compared to those who reported conditions but were not limited by them. These 13 brief measures of self-reported QOL are reliable and show preliminary evidence of concurrent validity inasmuch as they differentiate people based upon number of reported health conditions and whether those reported conditions impede normal function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22573626/"}

Our initial objective is to create the said curriculum in coordination with game official experts and staff at the NFL to increase levels of understanding of neuro-ophthalmology principles. We reviewed the prior published literature on applicable neuro-ophthalmic principles in professional sports. Major neuro-ophthalmic principles reviewed include both the efferent (e.g., saccadic and pursuit eye movements and vestibulo-ocular reflex) and afferent (visual field, dynamic visual acuity during body movement, and selective attention deficits). A 6-question survey pertaining to levels of understanding, future applicability, relevance, satisfaction, and interest in additional training was then given to 26 individuals before and after a lecture given by Dr. Andrew Lee in Plano, TX. The primary outcome measure was the creation of the curriculum followed by real-world testing for face and content validity and ending with a self-rated assessment. Twenty-one individuals completed the prelecture and postlecture survey out of 26 individuals who attended. Prelecture means for the level of understanding of oculomotor terms and the likelihood of using said terms were 3.4 and 3.2, respectively. Postlecture means were 8.9 and 8.8, respectively. The lecture was rated 9.2 of 10 for relevance to coaching and teaching officials, and individuals rated their interest in further content as 9.4 of 10. This study found that NFL game officials are interested in learning more about the science behind play-calling in terms of neuro-ophthalmology principles and practices.

Equally important is how it translated to the bedside and how the clinical examination differentiated itself. This paper reviews primary sources pertaining to acute neurologic conditions described mostly in the 19th and 20th century. A review of monographs, treatises, textbooks, and peer-reviewed articles was conducted. The evolution of clinical signs and syndromes associated with dynamic intracranial pathologies was predicated on the idea that animal studies informed clinicians, who then linked clinical signs to these observations. A dominant theme is that innovative technologies could trace acute processes through all their various stages, affording a complete picture of the disease process. Just as clinical descriptors of central nervous system processes evolved, the presentation of acute neuromuscular respiratory failure became better defined. Once practices incorporated these acute clinical signs, textbooks cemented their \"gold standard\" status with relative impunity. The practise of acute neurology and neurocritical care must find out what, historically, others were seeking but could not find. Patterns of clinical presentation in acute neurology are sufficiently recognizable to guide practise decisions. Although, the currently well-documented clinical syndromes of acute neurologic conditions (at presentation and during deterioration) have been taught for generations, practitioners have noted that they lack consistency and predictability. History also taught us that part of this improved knowledge came with designated units-a clear example of how protean systems (not always innovative neurologists or neuroscientists or technologies) shaped the history of neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38403947/"}

A voluntary online survey comprising 24 questions concerning the different training facilities was designed and electronically conducted with the members of the European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy. Seventy-one physicians with an average experience of 11.8 (±8.7) years completed the survey.

Overall, animal-based training was rated as the most suitable environment to practice coil embolization (20 (±6)), flow diverter placement (13 (±7)), and stroke intervention (13.5 (±9)). In-vitro training before using a new device in patients was supported by most participants (35; 49.3%). Additionally, preference for certain training models was related to the years of experience.

AI applications have begun to transition from a promising future to clinical reality in neurology. As the clinical management of neurology is often concerned with discrete, often unpredictable, and highly consequential events linked to multimodal data streams over long timescales, forthcoming advances in AI have great potential to transform care for patients. However, critical ethical questions have been raised with implementation of the first AI applications in clinical practice. Clearly, AI will have far-reaching potential to promote, but also to endanger, ethical clinical practice. This article employs an anticipatory ethics approach to scrutinize how researchers in neurology can methodically identify ethical ramifications of design choices early in the research and development process, with a goal of preempting unintended consequences that may violate principles of ethical clinical care. First, we discuss the use of a systematic framework for researchers to identify ethical ramifications of various study design and algorithm choices. Second, using epilepsy as a paradigmatic example, anticipatory clinical scenarios that illustrate unintended ethical consequences are discussed, and failure points in each scenario evaluated. Third, we provide practical recommendations for understanding and addressing ethical ramifications early in methods development stages.

In 1928, an introductory letter from Sachs went out to the international community and, in 1929, a planning meeting was held and the general principles of the Congress were established. Several earlier attempted congresses had been thwarted by World War I and European tensions would also influence the organization of the Berne Congress. Gordon Holmes (1876-1965) wrote: 'It would be certainly wiser to have the meeting in Scandinavia, Holland or Switzerland, as the only difficulty may be to get the French and Germans to mix.' Interest in the congress was immense and subsequent international congresses (London, Copenhagen, Paris, Lisbon and Brussels) became a central event in world neurology. In summary, the Berne Congress brought together individuals from several continents, thereby facilitating the exchange of ideas across entire schools. More broadly, the congress reflected a growing trend toward specialization in neurology and medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20488888/"}

These challenges reflect not only the growing public health effect of dementia in an aging global population, but also more specific ethical complexities including early loss of patients' capacity to make decisions regarding their own care, the stigma often associated with a dementia diagnosis, the difficulty of balancing concern for patients' welfare with respect for patients' remaining independence, and the effect on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of family caregivers. Caring for patients with dementia requires respecting patient autonomy while acknowledging progressively diminishing decisional capacity and continuing to provide care in accordance with other core ethical principles (beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence). Whereas these ethical principles remain unchanged, neurologists must reconsider how to apply them given changes across multiple domains including our understanding of disease, clinical and legal tools for addressing manifestations of illness, our expanding awareness of the crucial role of family caregivers in providing care and maintaining patient quality of life, and societal conceptions of dementia and individuals' personal expectations for aging. This revision to the American Academy of Neurology's 1996 position statement summarizes ethical considerations that often arise in caring for patients with dementia; although it addresses how such considerations influence patient management, it is not a clinical practice guideline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34524968/"}

Prior STAIR (Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable) conferences identified both failures of clinical trial design and failures in preclinical assessment in developing putative ischemic stroke treatments. At STAIR XI, participants in workshop no. 1 Top Priorities for Neuroprotection sought to redefine the neuroprotection paradigm and given the paucity of evidence underlying preclinical assessment, offer consensus-based recommendations. STAIR proposes the term brain cytoprotection or cerebroprotection to replace the term neuroprotection when the intention of an investigation is to demonstrate that a new, candidate treatment benefits the entire brain. Although \"time is still brain,\" tissue imaging techniques have been developed to identify patients with both predicted core injury and penumbral, salvageable brain tissue, regardless of time after stroke symptom onset. STAIR XI workshop participants called this imaging approach a tissue window to select patients for recanalization. Elements of the neurovascular unit show differential vulnerability evolving over differing time scales in different brain regions. STAIR proposes the term target window to suggest therapies that target the different elements of the neurovascular unit at different times. Based on contemporary principles of rigor and transparency, the workshop updated, revised, and enhanced the STAIR preclinical recommendations for developing new treatments in 2 phases: an exploratory qualification phase and a definitive validation phase. For new, putative treatments, investigators should carefully characterize the mechanism of action, the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, demonstrate target engagement, and confirm penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Before clinical trials, testing of candidate molecules in stroke models could proceed in a comprehensive manner using animals of both sexes and to include significant variables such as age and comorbid conditions. Comprehensive preclinical assessment might include multicenter, collaborative testing, for example, network trials. In the absence of a proven cerebroprotective agent to use as a gold standard, however, it remains speculative whether such comprehensive preclinical assessment can effectively predict clinical outcome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34289707/"}

Despite being common and disabling, it is seldom volunteered as a symptom by patients or even their caregivers. Yet apathy undoubtedly has an important impact on caregiver stress, functional disability and quality of life. A detailed clinical assessment can distinguish apathy from depression and allow clinicians to make practical suggestions to reduce the impact of symptoms on individual patients and their families. Pharmacological approaches to treatment include cholinesterase inhibitors, dopamine agonists and stimulants. CASE 1A 66-year-old man with progressive supranuclear palsy returned to clinic for review. His wife was upset and finding it difficult to cope. She described him as 'completely lazy', as he just sat in his chair all day watching television, even though he could still do things for himself. She felt that he could not be bothered to speak to her anymore because he was 'obsessed with TV'. He did not seem to engage with the visits to the grandchildren that she arranged. He said that he felt fine apart from the problems with his walking.The neurologist was confident that the patient was not depressed, and that the wife's concerns reflected the apathy that is often very pronounced in progressive supranuclear palsy. By explaining to the man's wife that these problems were due to his disease, their relationship improved and she felt more able to cope with caring for him. CASE 2A 75-year-old man attended clinic with his wife. She had worried about him for over a year, as he had become increasingly withdrawn. He used to enjoy going to the local pub but now stayed at home all day. He seemed less concerned about his personal appearance, about which he used to be meticulous. More recently, she had noticed that he had become forgetful. On examination, he had a mild episodic memory deficit but no impairments in other domains.He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment but the presence of apathy suggested a high risk of him developing Alzheimer's disease. He did not improve with a trial of antidepressant treatment but had useful input from an occupational therapist.

This methodology, which relies on quantum physics and substance magnetic properties, is now being routinely used in the clinics and medical research. With the advent of measuring functional brain activity with MRI (functional MRI), this methodology has reached a larger section of the neuroscience community (e.g. psychologists, neurobiologists). In the past, the use of MRI as a biomarker or as an assay to probe tissue pathophysiological condition was limited. However, with the new applications of MRI: molecular imaging, contrast-enhanced imaging and diffusion imaging, MRI is turning into a powerful tool for in vivo characterization of tissue pathophysiology. This review focuses on the diffusion MRI. Although it only measures the averaged Brownian translational motion of water molecules, using different analysis schemes, one can extract a wide range of quantitative indices that represent tissue morphology and compartmentalization. Statistical and visualization routines help to relate these indices to biologically relevant measures such as cell density, water content and size distribution. The aim of this review is to shed light on the potential of this methodology to be used in biological research. To that end, this review is intended for the non-MRI specialists who wish to pursue biological research with this methodology.

Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842) was a Scottish anatomist, physiologist, neurologist and surgeon who enjoyed a distinguished career in London and Edinburgh during the first half of the nineteenth century. He was a prolific medical writer, a brilliant researcher and a skilled artist. Argyll Robertson (AR) (1837-1909) was the first surgeon in Scotland to practise entirely in the field of ophthalmology. In 1869 Robertson published the records of cases, which showed that disease of the spinal cord is sometimes associated with loss of the light reflex of the pupil but retention of its movement in accommodation. Harry Moss Traquair (1875-1954) was one of the founders of neuro-ophthalmology, being concentrated on bitemporal hemianopia, the course of the geniculo-calcarine visual pathway, pituitary tumours, optic nerve diseases (including acute retrobulbar neuritis), tobacco amblyopia and traumatic lesions of the optic tract.

Important scientific writings related to stimulation and function of the central area were studied, beginning with the first electrolytic battery description. Volta's description of the electrolytic battery provided a reliable tool for mapping cortical function. However, 70 years elapsed before Fritsch and Hitzig convincingly demonstrated an excitable cortex and challenged Flourens' theories of cerebral function. The localization of sensory and motor cortical representations was hampered by difficulties in interpreting responses to stimulation in animals and in relating animal data to the human brain. Nevertheless, by the beginning of the 20th century, the evidence for a separate sensory and motor gyrus within the central area was overwhelming. Pioneering surgeons such as Keen, Krause, Foerster, Frazier, and Cushing demonstrated the motor and sensory areas in human subjects during the course of surgery. The interpretation of central area function has evolved from the 19th century view that diffuse areas of the cortex and the limbic system serve motor and sensory functions to the theories of Grünbaum, Sherrington, Campbell, and others at the beginning of the 20th century, who suggested segregated functional regions defined by sulcal and architectonic anatomic features. Subsequently, Penfield and Rasmussen supported the idea of a sensorimotor area in which central area function is not strictly separated by the central sulcus. Modern research using microelectrode recordings and functional imaging indicates localized primary sensory and motor functions defined by architectonic anatomic features.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12015849/"}

A total of 44 program directors responded (55%), representing programs that train 78 categorical and 94 total resident positions, approximately 70% of those filled in the match. Respondents identified multiple areas where child neurology residents need more training, including genetics and neuromuscular disease. A substantial majority (73%) believed child neurology and neurodevelopmental disability residents need less than 12 adult neurology training months; however, most (75%) also believed adult hospital service and man-power needs (55%) and finances (34%) would pose barriers to reducing adult neurology. Most (70%) believed reductions in adult neurology training should be program flexible.

This paradox has resulted in increasingly long wait times to see some specialists, some specialties becoming less attractive to potential trainees, and a dearth of new trainees entering these fields. Evolving models of health care delivery hold the promise of increasing patient access to most providers and may diminish costs and improve outcomes for most patients/conditions. However, patients who need care in understaffed fields may, in the future, be unable to quickly access a specialist with the requisite expertise. Impeding the sickest and most complex patients from seeing physicians with appropriate expertise may lead to increased costs and deleterious outcomes-consequences contrary to the goals of health care reform. To ensure appropriate access for these patients requires 2 conditions: 1. Compensation models that do not discourage trainees from pursuing nonprocedural specialties, and 2. A care delivery model that expediently identifies and routes these patients to the appropriate specialist.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28492444/"}

An observational study of 40 students.", "text": "Elective programs for medical students in the last year of their university training are poorly evaluated. The goal of this study was to determine the gain in theoretical and practical skills in a group of students during their elective in neurology. Students were trained by either conventional teaching methods or applying improved problem-based teaching. A test of 78 multiple choice questions regarding both, theoretical and practical aspects of clinical neurology, was presented to 21 students (9 female, 12 male). This group of students (group A) was trained according to the conventional teaching method. A subsequent group of students (intervention group B; n = 19; 9 female; 10 male) was educated using a modified teaching method that consisted of more problem-based learning, gathering experience with neurosonological and neurophysiological principles and in intense bedside teaching. The test was performed at the beginning and end of their elective period. The percentage increase in the tests was taken as the primary endpoint. In addition, all students were asked about their degree of satisfaction with the elective in general. Students of both groups did not differ with regard to age, gender, number of semesters, score of last examination and score of the test at the beginning of the elective. However, students who participated in the problem-based teaching group (group B) performed significantly better in the test at the end of the elective (increase 16.3% +/- 15.5) than those who were trained according to the conventional teaching program (percentage increase 6.3% +/- 9.4; p = 0.017). Students of both groups were highly satisfied with the elective in general. More problem-based teaching including practical exercises and intense bed-side teaching significantly improved students' performance. Thus, adaptation of teaching covering these aspects should be encouraged and might improve the neurological knowledge and skills of the students.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14673580/"}

With the development of clinical EEG, the definition of electroclinical complexes became an essential tool to define epileptic syndromes, particularly focal epileptic syndromes. Modern advances in diagnostic technology, particularly in neuroimaging and molecular biology, now permit better definitions of epileptic syndromes. At the same time detailed studies showed that there does not necessarily exist a one-to-one relationship between epileptic seizures or electroclinical complexes and epileptic syndromes. These developments call for the reintroduction of an epileptic seizure classification based exclusively on clinical semiology, similar to the seizure classifications which were used by neurologists before the introduction of the modern diagnostic methods. This classification of epileptic seizures should always be complemented by an epileptic syndrome classification based on all the available clinical information (clinical history, neurological exam, ictal semiology, EEG, anatomical and functional neuroimaging, etc.). Such an approach is more consistent with mainstream clinical neurology and would avoid the current confusion between the classification of epileptic seizures (which in the International Seizure Classification is actually a classification of electroclinical complexes) and the classification of epileptic syndromes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10100955/"}

Initially, the members of the Association mostly wished to have a training programme under the combined supervision of University Departments of Paediatrics and Neurology. However, under the influence of the Royal College of Physicians & Surgeons of Canada, and its Committee on Neurology, the training of child neurologists was organized in a manner analogous to that of neurologists for adults, though with an initial one or two years of paediatrics instead of medicine. By 1975, four years within a recognized neurological training programme could lead to the Certification Examination in Neurology, as modified for paediatric neurology. In 1981, the CACN also joined the Canadian Congress of Neurological Sciences. It has played an increasing part in child care and also in a academic studies. However, evidence will be presented to show that the present number of paediatric neurologists in Canada is insufficient. The number of trainees also appears inadequate, and increased funding for training positions is needed. Close cooperation between paediatric neurologists, rehabilitation experts, developmental paediatricians and related subspecialists is required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9827237/"}

Now and in the near future, the growth of neurologic critical care and the expansion of neurology intensive care units may require even more inpatient responsibilities in neurology residency programs. Contrary to these trends in training, most community neurology practice is still focused on outpatients, and surveys of neurologists have consistently indicated a need for more outpatient exposure in neurology training.

Successful practitioners of translational neural engineering from academics, clinical medicine and industry were invited to share a diversity of perspectives and experiences on the translational process. The forum was targeted towards traditional academic researchers who may be interested in the expanded funding opportunities available for translational research that emphasizes product commercialization and clinical implementation. The seminar was funded by the NIH with support from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. We report here a summary of the speaker viewpoints with particular focus on extracting successful strategies for engaging in or conducting translational neural engineering research. Daryl Kipke, PhD, (Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan) and Molly Shoichet, PhD, (Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Toronto) gave details of their extensive experience with product commercialization while holding primary appointments in academic departments. They both encouraged strong clinical input at very early stages of research. Neurosurgeon Fady Charbel, MD, (Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Illinois at Chicago) discussed his role in product commercialization as a clinician. Todd Kuiken, MD, PhD, (Director of the Neural Engineering for Artificial Limbs at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, affiliated with Northwestern University) also a clinician, described a model of translational engineering that emphasized the development of clinically relevant technology, without a strong commercialization imperative. The clinicians emphasized the importance of communicating effectively with engineers. Representing commercial neural engineering was Doug Sheffield, PhD, (Director of New Technology at Vertis Neuroscience, Inc.) who strongly encouraged open industrial-academic partnerships as an efficient path forward in the translational process. Joe Pancrazio, PhD, a Program Director at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, emphasized that NIH funding for translational research was aimed at breaking down scientific barriers to clinic entrance. Vivian Weil, PhD, (Director of Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at the Illinois Institute of Technology) a specialist on ethics in science and engineering, spoke of the usefulness of developing a code of ethics for addressing ethical aspects of translation from the bench to clinical implementation and of translation across disciplines in multi-disciplinary projects. Finally, the patient perspective was represented by Mr Jesse Sullivan.

Moreover, the latest selected event and the actual selection criteria are continuously displayed on a standard oscilloscope. Off line, the wave form and clock time of events as well as an instantaneous frequency plot can be displayed on the oscilloscope. The final selection of events is done with a combination of a second algorithm, which essentially is a wave form comparator, and a manual check. The device is controlled either by hardware, with knobs on the front panel, or by software through a data bus connected to a microcomputer. Clock times and wave forms of the events, which are stored in the microprocessor memory, may also be presented on the data bus for later off-line analysis and coordination with other related signals collected during the experiment, e.g. transducer and electromyography records, whether these were stored on analog or digital tape or computer disc.

The use of inexpensive multimedia computers offers new possibilities for mixing video images, analog voltages, and computer data, storing these combined signals to videotape, and extracting quantitative data for analysis. In this paper, we summarize methods for mixing images from multiple video cameras and a Macintosh computer display to facilitate manipulation of data generated during our neurophysiological and behavioral research. These technologies enhance accuracy, speed, and flexibility during experiments, and facilitate selecting and extracting quantitative data from the videotape for further analysis. Three applications are presented: (A) we used an analog video mixer to synchronize neurophysiological recordings with ongoing behaviors of freely moving rats; (B) we used a chroma keyed digital overlay to generate positional data for the rat's face during drinking behavior; and (C) we combined a computer model of a rat's head and whiskers with videos of exploratory behaviors to better track and quantify movements in three dimensions. Although the applications described here are specific to our neuroethological work, these methods will be useful to anyone wishing to combine the signals from multiple video sources into a single image or to extract series of positional or movement data from video frames without frame grabbing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10964581/"}

However, little is known on how neurology and specialist palliative care services interact. This study aimed to map the current level of connections and integration between these services. The mapping exercise was conducted in eight centres with neurology and palliative care services in the United Kingdom. The data were provided by the respective neurology and specialist palliative care teams. Questions focused on: i) catchment and population served; ii) service provision and staffing; iii) integration and relationships. Centres varied in size of catchment areas (39-5,840 square miles) and population served (142,000-3,500,000). Neurology and specialist palliative care were often not co-terminus. Service provisions for neurology and specialist palliative care were also varied. For example, neurology services varied in the number and type of provided clinics and palliative care services in the settings they work in. Integration was most developed in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), e.g., joint meetings were often held, followed by Parkinsonism (made up of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple-System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), with integration being more developed for MSA and PSP) and least in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), e.g., most sites had no formal links. The number of neurology patients per annum receiving specialist palliative care reflected these differences in integration (range: 9-88 MND, 3-25 Parkinsonism, and 0-5 MS). This mapping exercise showed heterogeneity in service provision and integration between neurology and specialist palliative care services, which varied not only between sites but also between diseases. This highlights the need and opportunities for improved models of integration, which should be rigorously tested for effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27165157/"}

After World War II, activities of Neurology were restored and the Japanese Society of Neurology (JSN) independent from the Societies of Internal Medicine and Psychiatry was established in 1960 after overcoming many difficulties. In 1975, neurology was approved by law as one of the specialized fields of medicine. After that, neurology and JSN developed dramatically, both in research and medical practices. As of 2018, JSN had 9,000 members and more than 5,500 board-certified neurology specialists. JSN successfully hosted the World Congress of Neurology twice in 1981 and 2017. In 2002, JSN accepted the offer to join the Japanese Board of Medical Specialties as one of the subspecialties of Internal Medicine. In 2018 JSN enacted a new policy to upgrade the neurology specialist from a subspecialty of Internal Medicine to an independent major medical field.

The proposed core NE items were then subject to a modified web-based Delphi process using the online software \"SurveyMonkey\". A total of 30 panelists from different backgrounds (tutors or learners, neurologists or non-neurologists, community hospitals or medical centers, and different academic positions) participated in the modified Delphi process. Each panelist was asked to agree or disagree on the inclusion of each item using a 9-point Likert scale and was encouraged to provide feedback. We also compared viewpoints between different groups of panelists using the Mann-Whitney U test. Eighty-three items were used for the first round of the Delphi process. Of them, 18 without consensus of being a core NE item for the neurology clerks in the first round and another 14 items suggested by the panelists were further discussed in the second round. Finally, 75 items with different grades were included in the recommended NE items for neurology clerks.

The participants evaluated teaching methods and examination formats and were asked about their preferences. The survey was based on a questionnaire distributed to 22 German medical schools and 1245 participating students. Interactive teaching methods, especially courses in practical examinations, clinical internships and bedside teaching were highly rated among the students. In contrast, multiple choice tests, as one of the most widespread examination methods, were poorly rated compared to practical and oral examinations. For most of the students it was not decisive, in which semester teaching of neurology took place, while the majority asked for additional and more intensive neurological education.

During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, issues of women's health and feminism became increasingly a medical and political priority. Early neurologists, and specifically Charcot, have been criticized for retarding the advancement of women, but the issue has never been studied in detail. Review of original documents from the Bibliothèque Charcot, archives of the Sorrel-Dejerine and Leguay families, and materials from the Académie de Médecine, Paris. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that Charcot, although highly authoritarian and patronizing toward patients and colleagues in general, fostered the concepts of advancing women in the medical profession and eliminating former gender biases in neurologic disorders. The first woman extern in Paris, Blanche Edwards, worked directly under Charcot, and he later became her thesis advisor. When women lobbied for entrance rights to the intern competition, Charcot was one of the few professors to sign the original petition of support. Charcot worked extensively with hysteria and female patients, although he energetically rejected the idea that the disorder was restricted to women. He categorically deplored ovariectomy as a treatment for women with hysteria. His most important scientific contribution in the study of hysteria was his identification of the disorder in men. Although overtly apolitical throughout his life and certainly not a feminist in the modern definition of the term, Charcot worked to incorporate women professionally into neurology, advanced areas of women's health through his long-term commitment to work in a largely women's hospital (the Salpêtrière), and dispelled the prejudice that hysteria was a woman's malady.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10331699/"}

While our capability to obtain such measurements from patients has grown markedly with multimodal monitoring in many neurologic or neurosurgical intensive care units (ICUs), our ability to transform the raw data into actionable information is limited. One reason is that the proprietary nature of medical devices and software often prevents neuro-ICUs from capturing and centrally storing high-density data. Also, ICU alarm systems are often unreliable because the data that are captured are riddled with artifacts. Informatics is the process of acquiring, processing, and interpreting these complex arrays of data. The development of next-generation informatics tools allows for detection of complex physiologic events and brings about the possibility of decision support tools to improve neurocritical care. Although many different approaches to informatics are discussed and considered, here we focus on the Bayesian probabilistic paradigm. It quantifies the uncertainty inherent in neurocritical care instead of ignoring it, and formalizes the natural clinical thought process of updating prior beliefs using incoming patient data. We review this and other opportunities, as well as challenges, for the development and refinement of informatics tools in neurocritical care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23884510/"}

These conflicts can be best mitigated if physicians maintain their orientation as patient advocates but practice cost-conscious clinical behaviors that consider the cost-effectiveness of tests and treatments and do not squander society's finite resources by ordering medical tests and treatments of zero or marginal utility. Health system planners should resolve their conflicting objectives of quality and cost control by rigorously defining and measuring quality through physician leadership and by implementing cost-control measures that enhance the quality of medical care.

A modified Delphi technique was used to establish consensus perceptions of importance of 73 neurology OPAs among neurology educators and trainees at 3 neurology residency programs. A content validity score (CVS) was derived for each neurology OPA, with scores ≥4.0 determined in advance to indicate sufficient content validity. The mean CVS for all OPAs was 4.4 (range 3.5-5.0). Fifty-seven (78%) OPAs had a CVS ≥4.0, leaving 16 (22%) below the pre-established threshold for content validity. Trainees assigned a higher importance to individual OPAs (mean CVS 4.6) compared to faculty (mean 4.4, p = 0.016), but the effect size was small (η(2) = 0.10). There was no demonstrated effect of length of education experience on perceived importance of neurology OPAs (p = 0.23). Two sample resident assessment formats were developed, one using neurology OPAs alone and another using a combination of neurology OPAs and the Neurology Milestones.

We propose an integrative framework to explain neuro-cardiac interactions in health and disease, with a focus on clinical applications and emerging therapies. The neuro-cardiac axis comprises hierarchical neural networks, from the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to subcortical and cortical brain regions. This structure underlies a range of clinical syndromes. Acute brain injuries can induce cardiac dysfunction via autonomic dysregulation, as seen in neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM), while cardiac disease contributes to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and cognitive decline. Cardioception-the brain's processing of cardiac signals-is increasingly recognized as a key mediator of autonomic control and emotional experience. Clinical trials highlight the value of targeted interventions, including extended cardiac monitoring to detect occult atrial fibrillation, improved risk stratification for managing patent foramen ovale, and intensive vascular risk control for cerebrovascular protection. Growing awareness of neuro-cardiac pathways is reshaping clinical care. Understanding how brain insults provoke cardiac dysfunction via disrupted autonomic outflow is critical, particularly in NSM. Meanwhile, cardioception is gaining relevance as a therapeutic target in the regulation of emotions and the autonomic nervous system. Conversely, cardiac pathology promotes stroke, CSVD, and cognitive impairment not only through embolism but also through altered perfusion and autonomic imbalance. Comprehensive management of modifiable vascular risks confers dual protection for the heart and brain. Interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly vital for managing disorders along the heart-brain continuum. Translating insights from neurocardiac mechanisms into precision therapies marks a new frontier. Advances in neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and neuromodulation offer opportunities for personalized care. The ongoing development of cross-specialty training and integrated research platforms will be essential for translating scientific progress into improved outcomes in neurocardiac disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40810888/"}

The negative impacts of IFs, such as 'patient' anxiety, present neurologists with management dilemmas, largely due to the limited knowledge base surrounding the medical significance of these IFs. In particular, the lack of evidence-based clinical trials investigating the efficacy of treatments for subclinical IFs makes management protocols challenging. The objective was to determine the impact IFs may have on neurologists' workloads and healthcare budgets and to examine neurologists' concerns regarding the clinical management of these 'patients'. Qualitative research based on constructivist grounded theory. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews of purposively sampled neurologists, coded, and concurrent comparative analysis performed. A substantive theory of the 'IF impacts' was developed after concept saturation. Neurologists managed the escalating workload caused by an increased number of referrals of 'patients' with IFs found during neuroimaging; however it was unclear whether this was sustainable in the future. Neurologists experienced IF management dilemmas and spent more time with 'patients' affected by anxiety. The lack of information provided to those undergoing neuroimaging by the referring clinician regarding the possibility of discovering IFs was highlighted. The impact of IFs upon the neurologist, 'patient' and the health institution appeared considerable. Further research determining the natural history of subclinical IFs and the efficacy of intervention will help to alleviate these issues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25723558/"}

To prepare this document the criteria of patients' associations has been considered, including the Declaration of Madrid which has been subscribed by thirty of these associations. In spite of its relevant development in the previous decades, the current situation of Neurology in Spain is far from the ideal. To reach the recommendable menber of 3 or 4 neurologists per 100,000 inhabitants it is necessary to duplicate the present number of neurologists which has been estimated around 2/100,000; this situation is especially urgent in some Autonomous Communities. The most important problems in neurological assistance are: inadequate follow-up of the chronic outpatients, low numbers of neurological beds and of duties of Neurology, as well as of neurological case of patients with urgent neurological disorders. It is also necessary to increase the number of professors of Neurology to adequately cover pregraduate teaching; again there are important differences in teaching positions among Autonomous Communities. Neurology residence should be prolonged from 4 to 5 years. Finally, it is necessary to support the appearance of superespecialised units and to promote a coordinated research with other close specialities including basic neuroscience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11742621/"}

A major contributor to the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is the tendency to overread normal EEGs as abnormal. In fact, the wrong diagnosis of seizures is sometimes based solely on the \"abnormal\" EEG. Reasons for the common overinterpretation of normal EEGs are mostly related to the lack of standards or mandatory training in EEG, and the erroneous assumption that all neurologists are trained to read EEGs. The most common overread pattern consists of benign, nonspecific, sharply contoured temporal transients. In particular, there is a common misconception that \"phase reversals\" are indicative of abnormality.

To assess neurologists' characteristics, geographic distribution, practice arrangements, professional activities, practice volume, procedures performed, sources of revenue, involvement with managed care and capitation, and other selected topics. The AAN Member Census survey was sent to US neurologists in the fall of 1996 (response rate = 89%), and the Practice Profile survey was sent to a random sample of 1,986 US neurologists in the summer of 1997 (response rate = 55%) who had completed a Member Census survey. The results of the Practice Profile survey were compared with those of two prior surveys conducted in 1991 to 1992 and 1993 to 1994. The mean age of US neurologists is 48 years, 18% are women, 93% are US citizens, and 24% are international medical graduates. The proportion of neurologists in solo practices, group practices, and medical schools/universities has not changed. The weekly hours worked has remained stable (58 hours), but the time spent in administrative activities has increased (p < 0.001). The average number of patient visits per week to neurologists appears to have increased (p < 0.001), as has the proportion of neurologists performing procedures (p < 0.05). The majority of neurologists have contracts with managed care organizations (82%), and a minority (32%) have capitated payment arrangements. Medicare continues to be the largest source of clinical revenue. Nearly 50% of all respondents have experience in developing clinical practice guidelines or critical pathways, and >20% of respondents employed physician extenders to assist in their practices. Neurologists are spending more time in administrative activities, are performing or interpreting more procedures, and are seeing more patients.

In Europe, notwithstanding a number of commendable initiatives, neither a specific neuro-oncology training curriculum nor a consensus on the ideal training tools have been set. In this context, the Youngster Committee of the Italian Association for Neuro-Oncology (AINO) has run a nationwide survey to take a snapshot of the current situation of neuro-oncology education in Italy. Between July and November 2023, we distributed through AINO a 34-question survey addressed to all Italian care providers dealing with neuro-oncology, irrespective of specialty and level of experience, as per AINO mission. The questionnaire was disseminated using an open link. We analyzed and stratified answers according to epidemiological characteristics of the respondents, i.e. age, gender, role, years of experience, type and case load of their work Institutions, geographical region. We collected 254 valid questionnaires. The majority of respondents were under 40 years old (62.6%); neurosurgeons formed the largest specialty group (48%). Residency was a key step for neuro-oncology education according to 33% of participants; notably, younger respondents gave a significantly more positive assessment of residency programs compared to older ones (72% vs. 56%, p = 0.0193). PhD programs in Italy are focused only on research, according to 30% of respondents. Regarding the tools for continuing medical education in neuro-oncology, a striking contrast between the ideal ones, which should be the frequent participation in dedicated courses (59% responses), and the actual one, which is scientific literature (55%), was recorded. Mentorship programs are rare and inconsistent and should be strengthened. More than 90% of participants declared multidisciplinary collaboration as fundamental. Multispecialty societies like AINO have a key role in strengthening education in neuro-oncology through the organization of structured post-graduate programs. The results of this survey, by describing the status of the neuro-oncology training paths in Italy, can lay the foundation for initiatives aimed at harmonizing neuro-oncology education in Italy and Europe.

The personal experiences of the author are obviously only reflected over these 40 years so that the glorious antecedents in the period up to 1933, the era in which our predecessors were the world leaders in neurology, is not sufficiently covered. This dominance was lost by the anti-Semitism during the era of National Socialism and the sequelae of World War II. As a result of the war, German neurologists became effectively isolated and their participation in international congresses was forbidden so that a gradual reestablishment of alignment only became possible after 1960. In this brief description no attempt at completeness has been made and only subjectivity and brevity have been considered. An attempt is made to retrospectively convey what essentially happened. An exact dating of advances over the period was sometimes difficult. The readership will have the opportunity to share the surprise of the author on how meagre the neurological knowledge and diagnostic methods were 50 years ago, how rapidly the subsequent development happened, how rapidly things became obvious which 20 years ago nobody was aware of and despite the progress how pleased we were to find ourselves at the most recent state of error and probably still find ourselves nowadays. In particular, how powerless and untested the therapeutic efforts were at that time. The progress can only be measured by a comparison between then, 50 years ago and the present. A projection of the future based on these experiences is not attempted but it seems to be certain that many conceptions, diagnostic advances and therapy options are still undiscovered and that further exciting times can be expected.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24253482/"}

In doing so, neurologists increasingly adopt a holistic perspective that targets the social determinants of health, integrates advanced data analytics, and fosters cross-sector collaborations-ensuring that prevention and early intervention are central to their efforts. Innovative applications, such as predictive analytics for identifying high-risk populations, digital twin technologies for simulating patient outcomes, and AI-enhanced diagnostic tools, illustrate the transition in neurology from reactive care to proactive, data-driven interventions. Examples of transformative practices include leveraging wearable health technologies, telemedicine, and mobile clinics to improve early detection and management of neurological conditions, particularly in underserved populations. These emerging methodologies expand access to care while offering nuanced insights into disease progression and community-specific risk factors. The manuscript emphasizes health disparities and ethical considerations in designing inclusive, data-driven interventions. By harnessing emerging technologies within frameworks that prioritize equity, neurologists can reduce the burden of neurological diseases, improve health outcomes, and establish a sustainable, patient-centered model of care benefiting both individuals and entire communities. This integration of technology, interdisciplinary expertise, and community engagement fosters a future where brain health is preventive, accessible, and equitable.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40118111/"}

Demographic transition, especially in large Asian populations, has resulted in a significant increase in the elderly population, bringing to the fore neurologic illnesses such as strokes, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. CNS infections such as retroviral diseases, tuberculosis, and malaria still account for high mortality and morbidity. Traumatic brain injury due to traffic accidents takes a high toll of life. Epilepsy continues to be a major health concern with large segments of the developing world's population receiving no treatment. A significant mismatch between the provision of specialized neurologic services and the requirement for them exists, especially in rural areas. Also, health insurance is not available for the majority, with patients having bear the costs themselves, thus limiting the procurement of available healthcare facilities. Neurologic training centers are few and the availability of laboratory facilities and equipment is largely limited to the metropolitan areas. Cultural practices, superstitious beliefs, ignorance, and social stigma may also impede the delivery of neurologic care. Optimizing available human resources, integrating primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare tiers and making medical treatment more affordable will improve the neurologic care in the developing world.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24365446/"}

Serotonin syndrome's main feature is neuro-muscular hyperexcitability, which in many cases is mild but in some cases can become life-threatening. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome remains challenging since it can only be made on clinical grounds. Three diagnostic criteria systems, Sternbach, Radomski and Hunter classifications, are available. Here we test the validity of four assumptions that have become widely accepted: (1) The Hunter classification performs clinically better than the Sternbach and Radomski criteria; (2) in contrast to neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the onset of serotonin syndrome is usually rapid; (3) hyperthermia is a hallmark of severe serotonin syndrome; and (4) serotonin syndrome can readily be distinguished from neuroleptic malignant syndrome on clinical grounds and on the basis of medication history. Systematic review and meta-analysis of all cases of serotonin syndrome and toxicity published between 2004 and 2014, using PubMed and Web of Science. Two of the four assumptions (1 and 2) are based on only one published study each and have not been independently validated. There is little agreement between current criteria systems for the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. Although frequently thought to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of the serotonin syndrome, the Hunter criteria did not perform better than the Sternbach and Radomski criteria. Not all cases seem to be of rapid onset and only relatively few cases may present with hyperthermia. The 0 differential diagnosis between serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome is not always clear-cut. Our findings challenge four commonly made assumptions about serotonin syndrome. We propose our meta-analysis of cases (MAC) method as a new way to systematically pool and interpret anecdotal but important clinical information concerning uncommon or emergent phenomena that cannot be captured in any other way but through case reports.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27406219/"}

Spain is in a middle position in country biomedical publication ranking in Europe, although the Spanish expenditure from GNP granted to research is lower than the mean situation among EU countries. Investigation in neurosciences stands out in biomedical research in Spain, however the bibliometric indexes analyzed and the study performed of the database of the FIS are not favorable for Spanish Neurology. This study shows that, for the 1994-2000 period, the neurologists only performed 32.1% of the projects funded in clinical research, 6% in neurosciences; 66.7% in epidemiology; and 4.3% in management-public health. The expenditure for biomedical research should be increased in Spain. Furthermore, clinical research and neurological clinical management research should be intensified.

With respect to autonomy, discussion emphasizes legal dimensions of the doctrine of informed consent and the obligations of medical professionals to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their patients. The discussion of beneficence focuses on issues relating to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the care of patients and on the conduct of research involving human subjects. The section on justice considers how law aims to define protectable rights and interests of individuals and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving disputes. Applications of legal principles and doctrines are illustrated primarily through the examples afforded by judicial decisions.

This illustration is by way of a sampling of the many key figures who contributed to the rise of not just neurology, psychiatry or anthropology but of all three disciplines. That is, a selective review is undertaken of paragons whose careers bridged medicine, neuropsychiatry, and anthropology. A sampling from among the dozens who have made major contributions to spanning these disciplines illuminates the significant extent of their co-mingled intellectual ancestry. This series is akin to a data table of necessarily concise biographical vignettes - past scholars with some or full medical training who also advanced both anthropology and neuropsychiatry as these disciplines grew into intellectual maturity. Each is, in a sense, a data point that bolsters the overarching thesis that the intellectual history of these disciplines have shared ancestry. Thus, even this preliminary and topical survey of a few past \"exemplars\" underscores the importance of this unique intellectual siblingship. Moreover, there is now a profusion of living scholars who add fulsomely to what might be deemed this 'trilateral marriage' of anthropology, psychiatry, and neurology.

These trends would come from theoretical transition in pedagogics, bringing out the tremendous progress in the instructional designs, which effectively facilitated the information and communication technology (ICT). On the contrary, Neurology, as a pedagogic, is more characteristic both in the quality and the quantity of knowledge, rather than skill or performance. It has resulted in occurring many discrepancies among the educational parts of Neurology, that may be one of reasons for medical students or postgraduate trainees, having been growing up in full of ICT, had some against images of difficulty in learning this subject. So it might be more necessary for us that we should hurry to create the authentic context in the educational design of Neurology, then construct the stepwise off-the-job training system honestly along with it, on which we should aim to increase familiarity of learning neurological diseases or skills for these younger people, the future neurologists.

{"id": "26723231", "title": "Neuropharmacology beyond reductionism - A likely prospect.", "text": "Neuropharmacology had several major past successes, but the last few decades did not witness any leap forward in the drug treatment of brain disorders. Moreover, current drugs used in neurology and psychiatry alleviate the symptoms, while hardly curing any cause of disease, basically because the etiology of most neuro-psychic syndromes is but poorly known. This review argues that this largely derives from the unbalanced prevalence in neuroscience of the analytic reductionist approach, focused on the cellular and molecular level, while the understanding of integrated brain activities remains flimsier. The decline of drug discovery output in the last decades, quite obvious in neuropharmacology, coincided with the advent of the single target-focused search of potent ligands selective for a well-defined protein, deemed critical in a given pathology. However, all the widespread neuro-psychic troubles are multi-mechanistic and polygenic, their complex etiology making unsuited the single-target drug discovery. An evolving approach, based on systems biology considers that a disease expresses a disturbance of the network of interactions underlying organismic functions, rather than alteration of single molecular components. Accordingly, systems pharmacology seeks to restore a disturbed network via multi-targeted drugs. This review notices that neuropharmacology in fact relies on drugs which are multi-target, this feature having occurred just because those drugs were selected by phenotypic screening in vivo, or emerged from serendipitous clinical observations. The novel systems pharmacology aims, however, to devise ab initio multi-target drugs that will appropriately act on multiple molecular entities. Though this is a task much more complex than the single-target strategy, major informatics resources and computational tools for the systemic approach of drug discovery are already set forth and their rapid progress forecasts promising outcomes for neuropharmacology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26723231/"}

For instance, the care of neurologic injury in congenital heart disease emphasizes the incorporation of medical education across the lifespan. Additionally, neonates requiring NICU admission and care are more likely to require future PICU care and be served by neurocritical care providers. Furthermore, neonates with neurologic injury or at risk for neurologic injury are not exclusively admitted to neonatal units. Education across the age-spectrum inclusive of fetal and neonatal neurology is valuable for trainees in understanding underlying disease processes, management, and sequelae and promotes the growth of the field of pediatric neurocritical care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39572267/"}

Despite its origins as a teaching tool for neurological diseases, simulation-based medical education has been historically abandoned by neurocritical care educators. In contrast, other critical care educators have embraced the technique and built an impressive foundation of literature supporting its use. Slowly, neurocritical care educators have started experimenting with simulation-based medical education and sharing their results. In this review, we will investigate the historical origins of simulation in the neurosciences, the conceptual framework supporting the technique, current applications, and future directions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361865/"}

However, in 1953, ironically, he became embroiled in a controversial event regarding the German neuroscientist and Nazi collaborator Julius Hallervorden. Wartenberg attempted to convince the Dutch delegation to attend the International Neurological Congress in Lisbon from which they had withdrawn in response to Hallervorden's inclusion as a speaker. In addition, he rallied neuroscientists worldwide to help convince the Dutch, largely ignoring and burying their concerns about Hallervorden's ethical transgressions. In numerous letters, Wartenberg wanted to both ignore and exonerate Hallervorden of ethical violations in collecting 700 brains from patients murdered in the Nazi euthanasia program. Wartenberg's unexpected defense of Hallervorden, despite not knowing him professionally, purportedly was to reintegrate German neuroscience to the international community and to create Western \"unity\" against communism. However, Wartenberg's efforts and the lack of international censure against Hallervorden prevented proper attention to the victims' brains that remained in Hallervorden's collection for decades and the use of these brains in scientific publications. Those who stood against Hallervorden have been vindicated by history, but work remains to uncover all brain specimens in German collections. Wartenberg's misguided and shortsighted involvement in this affair serves as a lesson for future generations of neurologists in the consequences of ignoring ethical concerns for expediency and politics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705629/"}

Headache fellows obtain procedural competence, but reliance on fellowship-trained neurologists cannot match the population eligible for treatments. The inclusion of educational modules and mechanisms for credentialing trainees pursuing procedural competence in residency curricula at individual programs is not known. A web-based survey of US neurology residency PDs was designed by the American Headache Society (AHS) procedural special interest section in collaboration with AHS and American Academy of Neurology's Headache and Facial Pain section leadership. The survey addressed exposure, training, and credentialing in: (1) onabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA) injections, (2) extracranial peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), and (3) trigger point injections (TPIs). Fifty-five PDs (42.6%) completed the survey. Compared to noncompleters, survey completers were more likely to feature headache fellowships at their institutions (38.2% vs 10.8%, P=0.0002). High exposure (onabotA=90.9%, PNBs=80.0%, TPIs=70.9%) usually featured hands-on patient instruction (66.2%) and lectures (55.7%). Supervised performance rates were high (onabotA=65.5%, PNBs=60.0%, TPIs=52.7%), usually in continuity clinic (60.0%) or headache elective (50.9%). Headache specialists (69.1%) or general neurology (32.7%) faculty most commonly trained residents. Formal credentialing was uncommon (16.4-18.2%), mostly by documenting supervised procedures (25.5%). Only 27.3% of programs permitted trainees to perform procedures independently. Most PDs felt procedural exposure (80.0-90.9%) and competence (50.9-56.4%) by all trainees was important.

The team provides neurobehavioural evaluations and sponsors monthly Neurobehaviour Rounds, an interdisciplinary patient conference that is the main formal teaching vehicle for the programme. After the model had been in place for 1 year, eight of nine neurology residents had Residency In-Service Training Examination scores in behavioural neurology that exceeded their overall average scores. This suggests that encouraging neurology residents to see patients through the eyes of different specialists may have contributed to improvement in their performance on a test of interdisciplinary knowledge.

We describe how translational research on EVs might unfold bidirectionally, proceeding from basic to clinical studies but also in the opposite direction, with biomarker findings in the clinic leading to novel hypotheses that can be tested in the laboratory. We demonstrate the potential value of EVs across all stages of the therapeutic development pipeline, from identifying therapeutic targets to the use of EVs as reporters in model systems and biomarkers in clinical research. Finally, we discuss how the cargo and physicochemical properties of naturally occurring and custom-engineered EVs can be leveraged as novel treatments and vehicles for drug delivery, potentially revolutionizing neurotherapeutics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40181198/"}

{"id": "39236270", "title": "Common Critiques and Recommendations for Studies in Neurology Using Machine Learning Methods.", "text": "Machine learning (ML) methods are becoming more prevalent in the neurology literature as alternatives to traditional statistical methods to address challenges in the analysis of modern data sets. Despite the increase in the popularity of ML methods in neurology studies, some authors do not fully address all items recommended in reporting guidelines. The authors of this Research Methods article are members of the <i>Neurology</i>® editorial board and have reviewed many studies using ML methods. In their review reports, several critiques often appear, which could be avoided if guidance were available. In this article, we detail common critiques found in ML research studies and make recommendations for how to avoid them. The first critique involves misalignment of the study goals and the analysis conducted. The second critique focuses on ML terminology being appropriately used. Critiques 3-6 are related to the study design: justifying sample sizes and the suitability of the data set for the study goals, describing the ML analysis pipeline sufficiently, quantifying the amount of missing data and providing information about missing data handling, and including uncertainty estimates for key metrics. The seventh critique focuses on fairly describing both strengths and limitations of the ML study, including the analysis methodology and results. We provide examples in neurology for each critique and guidance on how to avoid the critique. Overall, we recommend that authors use ML-specific checklists developed by research consortia for designing and reporting studies using ML. We also recommend that authors involve both a statistician and an ML expert in work that uses ML. Although our list of critiques is not exhaustive, our recommendations should help improve the quality and rigor of ML studies. ML has great potential to revolutionize neurology, but investigators need to conduct and report the results in a way that allows readers to fully evaluate the benefits and limitations of ML approaches.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39236270/"}

In order to secure the high standard of neurological patient care it is essential to evaluate the working conditions and the specialty training in neurology. This nationwide survey was conducted throughout Germany with the aim to address problems and to give suggestions for improvements in neurological training curricula. The survey was online from February to May 2017 and 953 neurologists undergoing further training participated. More than half of the young neurologists were satisfied with their medical training. One of the main problems that complicates clinical training is the workload. In addition, organizational obstacles within the clinic, such as poor structure of education or a lack of mentors, lead to dissatisfaction among participants. The size or type of the department, as well as the prevailing service system, exert only a minor influence on the quality of specialist training, although there were differences especially in the self-assessment of the participants in connection with the type of department (university hospital versus public or private hospital). Specialist training in neurology can be improved by simple arrangements, e. g., the introduction of a binding rotation scheme, internal mentoring and structured feedback. In addition, it will be necessary to relieve medical staff of administrative duties in order to create time for training and the learning of competencies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29872878/"}

Recommendations were supported by structured rationales, integrating evidence from one or more sources: systematic review, related evidence (evidence not from the systematic review), principles of care, and inference from evidence. Thirty recommendations were developed: 17 on starting DMTs, including recommendations on who should start them; 10 on switching DMTs if breakthrough disease develops; and 3 on stopping DMTs. Recommendations encompassed patient engagement strategies and individualization of treatment, including adherence monitoring and disease comorbidity assessment. The panel also discussed DMT risks, including counseling about progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy risk in people with MS using natalizumab, fingolimod, rituximab, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarate; and made suggestions for future research to evaluate relative merits of early treatment with higher potency DMTs vs standard stepped-care protocols, DMT comparative effectiveness, optimal switching strategies, long-term effects of DMT use, definitions of highly active MS, and effects of treatment on patient-specified priority outcomes. This guideline reflects the complexity of decision-making for starting, switching, or stopping MS DMTs.

Although headache are among the most prevalent and most burdensome neurologic conditions, headache medicine is often considered underrepresented in neurology departments. Additionally, prior studies have shown that many neurology residency directors feel that training programs do not include an adequate amount of exposure to headache clinics or headache-related didactics. One important aspect of didactic education in neurology departments is adult neurology grand rounds. Previous publications have evaluated neither the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in academic neurology departments nor the residency program directors' views on appropriate amount of headache-related grand rounds. Our study has attempted to quantify this information to elucidate opportunities to improve practice educational gaps. In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed adult neurology residency directors (from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME] listing of academic adult neurology residency programs) between October 2018 and September 2019. In addition, we used two methods to obtain the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in neurology: (1) emailing residency directors a questionnaire asking for a list of prior grand rounds topics and (2) an online search for each academic neurology program. First, for our grand rounds analysis, headache medicine consisted of 3.7% of the lectures in 2017-2018 and 6.3% of the lectures in 2018-2019 (average of each institution; 17 institutions and 411 total lectures in 2017-2018, 21 institutions and 463 total lectures in 2018-2019). The most common number of lectures on headache medicine for each grand rounds series was zero (for 7 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 7 of 21 in 2018-2019), followed closely by one lecture (for 6 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 6 of 21 in 2018-2019). Second, for our survey, the response rate was 19.3% (29/150). No residency director thought their institution had too many grand rounds dedicated to headache medicine, and 62.1% (18/29) thought they had an adequate amount of headache grand rounds. Within the survey responders, 75.9% (22/29) of adult neurology residency programs have a board-certified headache specialist at their institution. Although most adult neurology residency directors believe that headache is adequately represented in adult neurology grand rounds, headache medicine makes up 4%-6% of all neurology grand rounds. Compared with other neurology subspecialties and the other core ACGME milestones, headache makes up the fewest grand rounds lectures that were assessed in this study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33990947/"}

As the pendulum swings from the excesses of fee-for-service medicine (under which system the physician was paid more for doing more), to the equally egregious excesses of managed care (according to which the physician is paid more for doing less), it is the patient--especially the vulnerable patient with a debilitating neurological disease--who stands to lose the most. A survey of the historical roots of this transformation highlights the ethical dilemmas under the course of the pendulum. The ethical principles that should guide both the profession and the business of medicine are explored in search of a common ground on which both physicians and managers can work in concert for the benefit of the patients as well as the society whom both serve. The perils that beset that search must be recognized and avoided if the commons are to be preserved. This is especially true for neurology, where care must be patient, not profit, oriented; must have quality, not cost, as its primary aim; and must not be rationed until there is a floor of universal coverage, with participation by all in allocation decisions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9311071/"}

Two independent reviewers critically assessed the methodological quality of the psychometric properties of the included studies using the COSMIN guidelines. Fifteen studies with instrumented spasticity assessments met all inclusion criteria. Parameters that integrated electrophysiological signals with joint movement characteristics were best able to quantify spasticity. There were conflicting results regarding biomechanical-based parameters that quantify the resistance to passive stretch. Few methods have been assessed for all psychometric properties. In particular, further information on absolute reliability and responsiveness for more muscles is needed. Further research is required to determine the correct parameters for quantifying spasticity based on integration of signals, which especially focuses on distinguishing the neural from non-neural contributions to increased joint torque.

A PBRN in otology/neurotology, established upon a sustainable research infrastructure, addresses the challenges of performing community-based research through enhanced support for data collection and facilitated research regulatory adherence. A strategic alignment of a PBRN with an established research infrastructure allows for successful implementation of a variety of study methodologies and a framework for successful competition for research funding in hearing and balance disorders. Our goal is to develop a centralized, high-quality research infrastructure that supports a dynamic research alliance between regional centers for research excellence, community physicians, allied health professionals, and patients. We describe herein current plans and progress toward the goal of developing a network of academic- and community-based research sites to facilitate the conduct of clinical research in hearing and balance disorders. We have formed a PBRN that we call the CHEER Network: Creating Healthcare Excellence through Education and Research. Creating healthcare excellence through education and research was proposed in response to a request for applications from the National Institute for Deafness and other Communication Disorders to further develop clinical research in otolaryngology, specifically focusing on disorders in hearing and balance. Our expectation is that a network organized and focused around regional research alliances between academic institutions and community practitioners will have broad appeal to community-based health care professionals and patients, resulting in enhanced communications, interoperability, and success in the conduct of high-quality multicenter clinical research in hearing and balance disorders.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20101159/"}

{"id": "30237302", "title": "The ASNR-ACR-RSNA Common Data Elements Project: What Will It Do for the House of Neuroradiology?", "text": "The American Society of Neuroradiology has teamed up with the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America to create a catalog of neuroradiology common data elements that addresses specific clinical use cases. Fundamentally, a common data element is a question, concept, measurement, or feature with a set of controlled responses. This could be a measurement, subjective assessment, or ordinal value. Common data elements can be both machine- and human-generated. Rather than redesigning neuroradiology reporting, the goal is to establish the minimum number of \"essential\" concepts that should be in a report to address a clinical question. As medicine shifts toward value-based service compensation methodologies, there will be an even greater need to benchmark quality care and allow peer-to-peer comparisons in all specialties. Many government programs are now focusing on these measures, the most recent being the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and the Medicare Access Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. Standardized or structured reporting is advocated as one method of assessing radiology report quality, and common data elements are a means for expressing these concepts. Incorporating common data elements into clinical practice fosters a number of very useful downstream processes including establishing benchmarks for quality-assurance programs, ensuring more accurate billing, improving communication to providers and patients, participating in public health initiatives, creating comparative effectiveness research, and providing classifiers for machine learning. Generalized adoption of the recommended common data elements in clinical practice will provide the means to collect and compare imaging report data from multiple institutions locally, regionally, and even nationally, to establish quality benchmarks.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30237302/"}

These guidelines represent the work of MS experts, patients, and guideline experts and are based on their review of randomized controlled trials and observational evidence that addresses a set of prespecified questions related to starting, switching, and potentially discontinuing DMTs. Many of the recommendations address decision-making regarding the use of DMTs and incorporate the perspective of patients. Modified Delphi methods were used to establish consensus recommendations that were assigned a level of clinical obligation (actions a clinician must [A], should [B], or may [C] do). Most guideline recommendations are level B. Few reached level A, and several achieved only level C, primarily because of lack of evidence. The guidelines eschew formal treatment algorithms and do not address financial considerations and a variety of other controversies. We identify remaining uncertainties, the most important of which is the choice of available DMTs for the average newly diagnosed patient. We reiterate a number of research needs identified in the guidelines that could affect the use of DMTs, including improved definition of breakthrough disease requiring change in therapy, development of better and universally accepted definitions of both benign and aggressive MS, more and longer-duration comparative effectiveness trials, discovery and validation of biomarkers of disease activity and response to therapy, and development of treatment strategies focused on neuroprotection, remyelination, and neural repair.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29685920/"}

An electronic survey was sent to all US American Academy of Neurology member adult and child neurology residents graduating in June 2017. The response rate was 23.4% (n = 159). Of the 143 residents who provided information about student loans, 57% reported having debt (median $180,000). Ninety percent of respondents reported plans to pursue a fellowship after residency; 57% intended to stay at their home institution for additional training. Among respondents from adult neurology programs, 87% preferred to begin the fellowship application process after the first 6 months of the third postgraduate year. Almost half (46%) of adult neurology program residents felt they did not have enough outpatient exposure prior to making fellowship decisions compared to 14% of child neurology trainees. Although reported readiness to perform specific tasks (coding and office management) increased since 2007 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), only 36% of all respondents reported receiving business management training during residency. Trainees completing residency report considerable educational debt. A large majority of residents feel the fellowship application process occurs too early. Despite improvements over recent years, the majority of residents continue to feel ill-prepared for specific practice management tasks. These results suggest a need to better understand the effect of educational debt on career choices, an examination of the timing of the fellowship application process, and the incorporation of additional business management training during residency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30518554/"}

It could be argued that France saw the birth of clinical neurology as a separate discipline since Jean Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière Hospital obtained a chair of diseases of the nervous system in 1892, a first in the history of the academic world. The chapter shows, however, that the work of Charcot was preceded by a long evolution in medical thinking, which culminated with the introduction of experimental medicine developed by Claude Bernard and François Magendie, and by the study of aphasia by Paul Broca and its localization of language in a specific area of the brain. Many of the great neurologists of France like Duchenne de Boulogne, Gilles de la Tourette, Joseph Babinski and Pierre Marie gravitated around Charcot while others like Charles-Edward Brown-Sequard and Jules Dejerine developed their talents independently. The history of Sainte-Anne Hospital further illustrates this independence. It also shows the relation between neurology and psychiatry with Henri Ey, Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker, who collaborated with Henri Laborit in the clinical development of chlorpromazine. Sainte Anne also saw the birth of modern neuropsychology with Henry Hécaen. Jean Talairach and his group developed human stereotaxic neurosurgery and a 3-dimensional brain atlas that is used around the world. The chapter also mentions institutions (the CNRS and INSERM) that have contributed to developments partially independently from medical schools. It concludes with a presentation of schools located outside of Paris that have played a significant role in the development of neurology.

This paper reviews the indications, strength of evidence, and safety of TPE in children with neurological conditions. The rarity of these immune conditions in children, alongside an often incomplete understanding of their pathobiology, has limited the development of a robust scientific rationale for TPE therapy and the feasibility of conducting larger controlled trials. TPE continues to be used, but is a costly therapy with common adverse effects. Uncertainty remains over how to compare the different TPE methods, the optimal dosage of therapy, and monitoring and integration of TPE with other immunotherapies. Further studies are also required to define the indications and benefits of TPE and assess evolving technologies such as immunoadsorption. Studies investigating therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) are small and mainly uncontrolled. They provide evidence for the efficacy of TPE in childhood neuro-inflammatory conditions. TPE is generally well tolerated provided key adverse effects are anticipated and avoided. Systematic dosing and objective assessment of treatment effect should be priorities for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29856068/"}

Moreover, he conducted important studies on the immunopathology of the nervous system, on the serodiagnosis of neurosyphilis and on the regeneration of the nervous system. He studied pathological anatomy under Camillo Golgi and clinical neurology under Casimiro Mondino and completed his clinical preparation in Florence with Eugenio Tanzi, and in Munich at the Institute directed by Emil Kraepelin. Ottorino Rossi taught at the Universities of Siena, Sassari and Pavia; in the last town he was made Dean of the University and managed to have the buildings of the new San Matteo Polyclinic completed.

Vesalius in anatomy, and Harvey in physiology, were important figures who gave the Hippocratic and Galenic traditions new impulses. In this period of change in medical thought, Nicolaas Tulp (1593-1674) wrote his 'Observationes Medicae' (Tulp, 1641). A controversy existed in The Netherlands, concerning the circulation, with many doctors still adhering to the Galenic tradition. The following analysis discusses some of the neurologic cases from Tulp's book, seen in the light of modern medical thought.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11619042/"}

The proposed method is configured as follows: first, wavelet transforms are applied to extract the feature vectors for identification of motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) and principal component analyses are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and linearly combine them. Subsequently, the GMM universal background model is trained by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to purify the training data and reduce its size. Finally, a purified and reduced GMM-supervector is used to train the support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated for three different motor imagery datasets in terms of accuracy, kappa, mutual information, and computation time, and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results from the study indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with a small amount of training data compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in motor imagery EEG classification.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28991172/"}

First, we characterized quantitatively the regeneration of myelinated fibers at different levels of an acrylic semipermeable tube, from two to 27 weeks postoperatively. From the fifth week, myelinated fiber counts at mid-tube level were equal to the value of an intact nerve, but at the distal part the number of fibers exceeded both mid-tube level and unsectioned nerve values. At the proximal part of the tube an important fiber disorganization was observed. Second, we have compared acrylic semipermeable and totally impermeable silicone tubes at four and 27 weeks postoperatively. In terms of the number of myelinated fibers and the surface of the endoneurium at the mid-tube level, the most effective tube was the impermeable one.

Although the conclusions drawn from these different datasets sometimes appear to conflict, many of the differences are due to the use of different terms to mean the same thing and, more problematic, the use of similar terms to mean different things. Semantic issues are pervasive in the field and complicate communication among groups using different methods to study similar issues. Achieving clarity of communication among different investigative groups is essential for each to make full use of the findings of others, and an important step in this direction is to identify areas of semantic confusion. In this way investigators can be encouraged to use terms whose meaning and underlying assumptions are unambiguous because they are commonly accepted. Although this issue is of obvious importance to the large and very rapidly growing number of researchers working on multisensory processes, it is perhaps even more important to the non-cognoscenti. Those who wish to benefit from the scholarship in this field but are unfamiliar with the issues identified here are most likely to be confused by semantic inconsistencies. The current discussion attempts to document some of the more problematic of these, begin a discussion about the nature of the confusion and suggest some possible solutions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20584174/"}

He studied with Désiré Bourneville, Charcot's second interne, and was considered by Léon Daudet as the cleverest collaborator of Charcot, along with Joseph Babinski. Charcot assigned him the task of summarizing the theories on memory, which led to two major books, in 1892 and 1900, that anticipated several contemporary concepts by several decades. In 1905-1906, the novelist Marcel Proust spent 6 weeks with Sollier in his sanatorium at Boulogne-Billancourt, and it is now obvious that several of Proust's ideas on involuntary memories which appear inside In Search of Lost Time (published 8 years later) had been inspired by Sollier's theories on the 'surge of reminiscences'. Sollier also designed the framework which led to the intellectual quotient (IQ) and made interesting studies on hysteria and behavioral issues in neurological diseases, activities that may make him the first modern clinical neuro psychologist. Sollier was also the first to correlate clinical findings with neurophysiological concepts, which makes him a precursor of our current approach to neurology and psychiatry.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20938150/"}

More importantly, his biographers and those who wrote about their firsthand experiences with Charcot have brought to life his authority and his penetrating eye. Charcot held his students, his patients, and all those in close contact with him under a despotic rule. His shyness and emotions hid behind a cold and impenetrable mask. Much has been written about Charcot's life at the Salpêtrière. He transformed the old hospice into an institute of neurology considered internationally as a model, and its fame attracted visitors and patients from around the world. He formed a school at the Salpêtrière composed of his many students. These young men gathered each Tuesday evening in the luxurious reception halls of his mansion on Boulevard Saint-Germain. There they mixed with writers, artists, and politicians who were firmly republican and anticlerical. There is only information on Charcot's early years other than the major dates of his career and a few legends. Arriving at the Salpêtrière in 1862, he created the foundations of neurology over the next decade by applying the anatomoclinical method. Built on the traditions of the French anamatopathological method, his system was adapted by Charcot to incorporate the new advances in microscopy and cellular pathology. Later in his career, he also directed a scientific effort towards psychophysiologic explorations of hysteria and hypnosis, some inciting severe criticism. This judgement has been revised and in its place there remains the boldness of an innovative mind. His neurological achievement remains undisputed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8221186/"}

The care for neurological patients is fairly equally organized even if neurology has evolved from different sources, from psychiatry in Denmark and Finland, internal medicine in Sweden and electrotherapy in Norway. Evidence of diagnostic activity and treatment of neurological diseases can be found in Scandinavia for more than 5000 years. The oldest are trepanned skulls. Written documentation exists from the Viking era, describing treatment of seizures and possibly also the effect of ergotamine. The methods were in concordance with medical practice in the rest of Europe. Scandinavian neurobiologists have produced important contributions to neuroscience during the last 300 or 400 years. Their names can be recognized as eponyms and Nobel prize laureates. Examples are Niels Stensen (Nicolaus Stenoni), the Bartholin family and Knud Krabbe of Denmark, Ragnar Granit of Finland, Bjørn Sigurdsson (the concept of slow virus infections) of Iceland, Asbjørn Følling and Sigvald Refsum of Norway and Gunnar Wohlfart, Eric Kugelberg, Lisa Welander and Arvid Carlsson of Sweden. In addition, well known neurological diseases were described in Scandinavia long before those neuroscientists that today have their names attached to them: Otto Christian Stengel, Norway (1826: Batten-Spielmayer-Vogt's disease), Johan Christian Lund, Norway (1860: Huntington's chorea) and Ernst Alexander Homén, Finland (1889: Wilson's disease).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19892144/"}

We collected data on demographics, first and all \"identifiers\" of problem residents, and year of training in which the problem was found.

Ninety-five program directors completed surveys (75% response rate). Almost all neurology programs have problem residents (81%). Age, sex, marital status, being a US native, or attending a US medical school had no effect on problem status. Being a parent carried a lower likelihood of problems (32%). Most commonly the problem is acted on during the first year of training. Faculty members without defined educational roles were the most frequent first identifiers. Program directors were the most common remediators. The most common remediation techniques were increasing supervision and assigning a faculty mentor. Graduate medical education office and psychiatric or psychological counseling services were most often used. Eleven percent of problem residents required a program for impaired physicians and 14% required a leave of absence. Sixteen percent were dismissed from their programs. The prevalence of problem residents in neurology is similar to other disciplines, and various resources are available to remediate them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21670442/"}

We sought to determine the current status of child neurology training in Canada as well future directions for training. A web-based survey was sent to program directors (PD's) of active pediatric neurology training programs. General questions about the programs were asked, as well as about success at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) exam, breakdown of rotations, views on CanMEDS roles and questions on the future of pediatric neurology. 9/9 PD's completed the survey. 96.5% of all trainees successfully passed their RCPSC exam from 2001-2006. Breakdowns of the number and type of rotations for each year of training were provided. All CanMEDS roles were deemed to be important by PD's and programs have developed unique strategies to teach and assess these roles.92.6% of trainees chose to go into academic practice, with the most popular subspecialty being epilepsy. All PD's favour joint training sessions particularly for neurogenetics and neuromuscular disease. Overall, PD's suggest recruitment for future child neurologists at the medical student level but are divided as to whether we are currently training too few or too many child neurologists. This survey provides a view of the current state of pediatric neurology training in Canada and suggestions for further development of post-graduate training. In particular, attention should be given to joint educational programs as well as urgently assessing the manpower needs of child neurologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22666903/"}

A 22-question survey was sent electronically to 150 ACGME adult neurology program directors. We collected data regarding the presence of a neuroimaging curriculum, frequency of review sessions and testing, resource availability, and program director confidence in neuroimaging skills of graduating residents. We collected average scores on the neuroimaging section of the Resident In-service Training Examination of graduating residents for the past 3 years, which we attempted to correlate with resource availability. One-third of neurology residency programs do not have a neuroimaging curriculum, and half of training programs do not require a neuroimaging rotation. On average, trainees spend 1 hour per week reviewing imaging with radiologists. Program directors believed trainees receive insufficient neuroimaging training, with a median satisfaction rating on a Likert scale (0-100) of 35 (interquartile range 27-47). Few programs take advantage of online training resources. Opportunities exist to improve neuroimaging education in neurology resident education. This can be done by closer adherence to the American Academy of Neurology neuroimaging curriculum guidelines, especially by expanding access to online resources and additional emphasis on imaging review with neurology subspecialists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30665912/"}

New academic programs will likely be established to fill this need, often starting with a single neurologist. Establishing a neurology service with one founding faculty member can be accomplished by developing the program in phases and creating a support network that optimizes faculty strengths and interests. Such an approach allows for the gradual expansion of services and staffing in a manageable way to ultimately provide a full-service program.

In particular, the patterns of clinical history in use ignore the individuality of the patient and his existential dimension. The objective evaluation must be targeted and at the same time must take into account the patient's symbolic expectations.

In Italy, as elsewhere in Europe, the concepts of humoral pathology were abandoned in the 18th century, when neurology was influenced by novel trends. Neurology acquired the status of clinical discipline (as \"clinic of mental diseases\") after national reunification (declared in 1861 but completed much later). At the end of the 19th and first decades of the 20th century, eminent Italian \"neuropsychiatrists\" (including, among many others, Ugo Cerletti, who introduced electroconvulsive shock therapy in 1938) stimulated novel knowledge and approaches, \"centers of excellence\" flourished, and \"Neurological Institutes\" were founded. In the first half of the 20th century, the history of Italian neurology was dominated by World Wars I and II (which stimulated studies on the wounded) and the fascist regime in-between the Wars (when the flow of information was instead very limited). Italy became a republic in 1946, and modern neurology and its distinction from psychiatry were finally promoted.

To inform updating of the curriculum for residents of the European College of Veterinary Neurology (ECVN) job analysis was used. Defining job competencies of diploma holders in veterinary neurology can be used as references for curriculum design of resident training. With the support of the diplomates of the ECVN and the members of the European Society of Veterinary Neurology (ESVN) a mixed-method research, including a qualitative search of objectives and quantitative ranking with 149 Likert scale questions and 48 free text questions in 9 categories in a survey was conducted. In addition, opinions of different groups were subjected to statistical analysis and the result compared. A return rate of 62% (n = 213/341) was achieved. Of the competencies identified by the Delphi process, 75% objectives were expected to attain expert level; 24% attain advanced level; 1% entry level. In addition, the exercise described the 11 highly ranked competencies, the 3 most frequently seen diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems and the most frequently used immunosuppressive, antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic drugs. The outcomes of this \"Delphi job analysis\" provide a powerful tool to align the curriculum for ECVN resident training and can be adapted to the required job competencies, based on expectations. The expectation is that for majority of these competencies diplomates should attain an expert level. Besides knowledge and clinical skills, residents and diplomates are expected to demonstrate high standards in teaching and communication. The results of this study will help to create a European curriculum for postgraduate education in veterinary neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25622644/"}

{"id": "33612543", "title": "Alzheimer-Associated Neuronal Thread Protein: Research Course and Prospects for the Future.", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. With aging societies, the prevalence of AD is increasing dramatically worldwide. The onset of AD is often not identified, and currently no available treatments are capable of stopping the disease process and its effect on cognitive decline. Thus, well-validated biomarkers of the preclinical stages of AD are needed. Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) is a member of the neuronal thread protein family and has a molecular weight of approximately 41 kD. AD7c-NTP has been identified as a biomarker for its specifically elevated levels in putative brain domains, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the urine of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Since the urine test is non-invasive, easy to perform, and patients accept it more easily than other methods, the urinary AD7c-NTP concentration has been recommended as a practical diagnostic tool for diagnosing AD and MCI. AD7c-NTP has undergone nearly 25 years of research course from its initial discovery to pathological verification, multi-center clinical evaluation, improvement of detection methods, epidemiological investigation, and combined application with other biomarkers. However, as a fluid biomarker, AD7c-NTP can be detected in urine instead of the traditional biomarker sources-CSF or blood, which has made the use of AD7c-NTP as a biomarker controversial. In this article, we review the research course of AD7c-NTP and suggest directions for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33612543/"}

A grading scale which is convenient, continuous and economical was attempted for the first time for global and region-specific assessment of facial nerve palsy. Hospital-based observational study. Medical college hospital. Ten normal subjects and 51 patients with facial paralysis. Patients with facial nerve palsy were graded according to the revised version of House-Brackmann grading system (HBGS-2) and a newly proposed grading system. The results of the present study were compared with the HBGS-2. Data were analyzed using SPSS-17 (IBM Corporation, New York) for descriptive statistics, normality test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Mann-Whitney U test. The mean time spent on recording measurements was 288 seconds. For the new method and HBGS-2, the modes were graded 3 and 4, corresponding to incomplete facial paralysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were found significant. In Mann-Whitney U test, probability value indicated that grades of new scale were similar to grades of HBGS-2. The proposed simple, objective and mathematical (SOM) method of grading facial nerve palsy is convenient and provides global and regional continuous percentage that can monitor the progress and classify the patients with facial paralysis into six-point grades based on severity. This system was having substantial compatibility with HBGS-2 grading. For further validity, multi-center study with a larger sample of patients would be required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31663991/"}

We present the African neurologic service and scientific productivity indices and suggest a development plan. We conducted PubMed and EMBASE searches for articles about neurologic services in Africa. To assess scientific productivity, we determined the number of publications of African origin in journals with high impact. The neurologist-population ratio in African countries varies from 1 per 162,885 persons to none in 11 countries, compared with 1 per 29,200 persons in the United States. There are few African publications in high-impact international journals of neurology. Africa faces a heavy burden of communicable diseases and increasing noncommunicable diseases, with few workers, poor equipment, and little research effort to bear it. There is a need for African neuroscientists to discover areas of research unique to the continent in order to advance the frontiers of knowledge for all neurologists. International collaboration and support are required to improve the number of workers, resources, and research productivity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18071032/"}

This study aimed to enhance learning of these skills and to encourage reflective practice around communication skills. A group of 12 neurology residents participated in a series of six case-based communication skills workshops. Each workshop focused on a particular clinical scenario, including breaking bad news, discussing do-not-resuscitate orders, communicating with \"difficult\" patients, disclosing medical errors, obtaining informed consent for neurologic tests and procedures, and discussing life-and-death decisions with families of critically ill patients. Residents also kept reflective portfolios in which real examples of these interactions were recorded. The program was well accepted, and residents rated the workshops as effective and relevant to their practice. Analysis of residents' portfolios revealed three themes relevant to patient-physician communication: 1) communication is more successful when adequate time is allowed, 2) the ability to empathize with patients and their families is essential to successful interactions, and 3) the development of specific approaches to challenging scenarios can facilitate effective interactions. The portfolios also demonstrated that residents would engage in reflective practice. Targeting of communication skills training around specific clinical scenarios using neurologic cases was well accepted and was deemed relevant to practice. The use of portfolios may promote lifelong learning in this area.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18040006/"}

Gall's organology, with its emphasis on cranial bumps, soon fell into disrepute, but in the decades that followed Bouillaud, Aubertin, and Broca advanced the concept by turning to clinical cases of speech loss, and in 1870 Fritsch and Hitzig demonstrated its validity, studying motor functions with animals. The theory of cortical localization of function served as a guiding factor in changing the practice of neurology, and clinicians encountered new material supportive of the doctrine. Surgical neurology, anatomy, and physiology also supported the new way of thinking, contributing to a better understanding of the functional organization of the cerebral cortex and to clinical neurology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19892113/"}

The completeness of the number of patients registered in the database was evaluated in the study period from January 2009 through December 2014 by comparing cases reported to the DNOR with the Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish Pathology Registry. The data validity of important clinical variables was evaluated by a random sample of 100 patients from the DNOR using the medical records as reference. A total of 2241 patients were registered in the DNOR by December 2014 with an overall patient completeness of 92 %, which increased during the study period (from 78 % in 2009 to 96 % in 2014). Medical records were available for all patients in the validity analyses. Most variables showed a high agreement proportion (56-100 %), with a fair to good chance-corrected agreement (k = 0.43-1.0).

However, the scale and complexity of these data make them difficult to interpret and require the use of sophisticated bioinformatics applied to extensive datasets, including whole exome and genome sequences. Detailed analysis of genetic data has shown that accurate phenotype information is essential for correct interpretation of genetic variants and might necessitate re-evaluation of the patient in some cases. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates bioinformatics, clinical evaluation, and human genetics can help to address these challenges. However, despite numerous studies that show the efficacy of next-generation sequencing in establishing molecular diagnoses, pathogenic mutations are generally identified in fewer than half of all patients with genetic neurological disorders, exposing considerable gaps in the understanding of the human genome and providing opportunities to focus research on improving the usefulness of genomics in clinical practice.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), monitoring step count and sleep is feasible, valid, and offers a holistic glimpse of patient functioning and worsening. However, data generated from wearables are typically unavailable at the point of care. We describe the design, development, and evaluation of a proof-of-concept tool that delivers patient-generated wearables data in accessible, interpretable, and actionable formats to an outpatient Neurology clinic. Through a process of human-centered design, stakeholders were engaged to create a technological solution to access and display wearables data via a launch from the electronic health record (EHR). Designs were informed by patient-centered observational research and clinician interviews to ensure user alignment and validity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations (Health ITUES framework) as well as live observations of use assessed functionality, ease of use, and clinical integration. During development, 25 clinicians and four engineers across eight clinical settings provided feedback. The proof-of-concept wearable selected was Fitbit, which was connected via a custom solution to the EHR dashboard (BRIDGE). In the final validation, clinician satisfaction was high: mean scores > 4/5 for all performance and ease of use components. Live visualizations during clinical encounters highlighted a range of potential uses: detecting progression by step count, setting motivating and realistic activity goals despite limitations, referring to rehabilitation after activity drops, and measuring effects of interventions on sleep quality. Integrating wearables data into a clinical workflow for neurology is feasible and highlights novel areas to support shared decision-making and data-driven, personalized care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40491260/"}

Relevant, peer-reviewed research articles, systematic reviews, and abstracts were identified (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE searched from inception to November 2016). Studies were rated using the therapeutic classification scheme. Prior published Cochrane reviews were also used. Twenty Cochrane reviews and an additional 73 full-text articles were selected for data extraction through an updated systematic review (completed November 2016). For people with RRMS, many DMTs are superior to placebo (annualized relapses rates [ARRs], new disease activity [new MRI T2 lesion burden], and in-study disease progression) (see summary and full text publications). For people with RRMS who experienced a relapse on interferon-β (IFN-β) or glatiramer acetate, alemtuzumab is more effective than IFN-β-1a 44 μg subcutaneous 3 times per week in reducing the ARR. For people with primary progressive MS, ocrelizumab is probably more effective than placebo (in-study disease progression). DMTs for MS have varying adverse effects. In people with CIS, glatiramer acetate and IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3 times per week are more effective than placebo in decreasing risk of conversion to MS. Cladribine, immunoglobulins, IFN-β-1a 30 μg intramuscular weekly, IFN-β-1b subcutaneous alternate day, and teriflunomide are probably more effective than placebo in decreasing risk of conversion to MS.

How did he get from the head of the department to the founding of the Psychiatry and Neurology Clinic? He dreamed up every corner of the Department, which was the most impressive and patient-friendly clinic of its time even in European terms. The building was not only used for the recovery of patients, but also for the continuous medical training of doctors. His books and publications stand out from his work. Analyzing his school-creating activities, we can see that his students became famous psychiatrists. From the descriptions left by his contemporaries, it is clear that he was characterized by goodness and love. He could rejoice at the recovery of one of his patients as if he himself had been the lucky one.

Here, we present an FPGA-based spike-sorting platform that can increase the speed of offline spike sorting by at least 25 times, effectively reducing the time required to sort data from long experiments from several hours to just a few minutes. We attempted to preserve the flexibility of software by implementing several different algorithms in the design, and by providing user control over parameters such as spike detection thresholds.

A questionnaire on medical teaching was given to 457 medical students and junior doctors in Ireland. Perceived difficulties with neurology compared with seven other medical specialties were analysed. Other aspects of teaching were assessed including why neurology is perceived as difficult and ways teaching could be improved. Neurology was perceived as the most difficult of the eight medical specialties assessed. Participants felt they learned most at bedside tutorials with surprisingly few learning online. Neurology was perceived as difficult because of insufficient exposure to the subject, lack of teaching, and perceived complexity. Neurology teaching could be improved by increasing the number of bedside tutorials and by greater exposure to neurological patients for the students in clinical training. Medical students and doctors find neurology difficult. The teaching of neurology is reported as moderate to poor. The reasons for this are wide ranging but an emphasis on increased numbers of tutorials and greater integration of pre-clinical neurology to clinical years would improve teaching.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17880566/"}

In spite of a correct positioning of the tube, no growing central nervous processes were observed within the tube after 3 to 6 weeks when it was left empty. However, when the lumen of the tube was previously filled with a pre-degenerated sciatic nerve, unmyelinated and myelinated fibers were observed growing in the peripheral graft. Since the content of the tube can be modified, it appears that this model can be used to test the capability of cellular or acellular microenvironments to promote the 'in vivo' regeneration of the mammalian central nervous system fibers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3427421/"}

This review attempts to elaborate on the multiple barriers to delivering neurocritical care in these settings and the possible solutions to overcome such barriers. Epidemiology of neurocritical illness appears to have changed over time in low and middle-income countries. In addition to neuro-infection, noncommunicable neurological illnesses like stroke, traumatic brain injury, and traumatic spinal cord injury pose a significant neurocritical burden in resource-limited settings. Many barriers that exist hinder effective delivery of neurocritical care in resource-challenged environments. Very little information exists about the neurocritical care capacity. Research and publications are few. Intensive care unit beds and trained personnel are significantly lacking. Awareness about the risk factors of preventable conditions, including stroke, is lacking. Prehospital care and trauma systems are poorly developed. There should be attempts to leverage neurocritical care in these settings with focus on promoting research, local training, capacity building, preventive measures like vaccination, raising awareness, and developing prehospital care. Considering the disease burden and potentials to improve outcome, attempts should be made to develop neurocritical care in resource-challenged environments. http://links.lww.com/COCC/A11.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26828423/"}

{"id": "33618043", "title": "Foundations of Neuro-Oncology: A Multidisciplinary Approach.", "text": "Neuro-oncology is a branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis and treatment of primary and secondary tumors of the nervous system as well as the neurologic complications of cancer and cancer treatments. In practice, neuro-oncologists require an intimate knowledge of the neurologic presentation and management of central nervous system tumors, including gliomas, meningiomas, primary central nervous system lymphoma, metastases to the nervous system, and others. The mainstays of treatment for most nervous system tumors include surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and medical treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy. Interdisciplinary collaboration is thus critical to neuro-oncology. The prognosis for many central nervous system tumors, including gliomas and brain metastases, is often poor despite the advent of novel medical therapies. Efforts to develop more effective therapies are ongoing, and patient enrollment in clinical trials assessing the efficacy of new treatments is crucial to improve outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33618043/"}

Charcot strongly relied on, and openly credited, Mitchell's important contributions on the fragility of bones in locomotor ataxia when he postulated his own historic concepts on neuropathic arthropathies (Charcot joints). Mitchell likewise referred to Charcot in his texts and manuscripts, although his comments were not always complementary. Most notably, Mitchell publicly criticized Charcot for wrongfully claiming precedence over Americans (i.e., Mitchell himself) in the development of isolation therapy. The two men shared many specific neurologic interests, especially the effects of trauma and disorders affecting women, including hysteria. In the development of clinical neurology as a new scientific field, Charcot and Mitchell were both strong empiricists who distrusted theory but believed that clinical medicine, and specifically neurology, required continued infusion of new data from the laboratory sciences. Both men were exemplary teachers, Mitchell primarily a preceptor and supervisor of doctors outside the university system and Charcot the first European professor of clinical neurology and head of the celebrated School of the Salpêtrière.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9109917/"}

We review the status of neurologic education research as it pertains to the groups of interest. We identify opportunities and impediments for education research. The introduction of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, the Accreditation Council of Continuing Medical Education requirement to link continuing medical education to improved physician behavior and patient care, and the American Board of Medical Specialties/American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology-mandated maintenance of certification program represent research opportunities. Challenges include numerous methodologic issues such as definition of the theoretical framework of the study, adequate sample size ascertainment, and securing research funding. State-of-the-art education research will require multidisciplinary research teams and innovative funding strategies. The central goal of all concerned should be defining educational efforts that improve patient outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18332346/"}
{"id": "12752405", "title": "Quality of neurology residency programmes: an Italian survey.", "text": "In recent years there has been a growing interest in medical and particularly neurological education and how this should be related to the needs for patient care. To evaluate neurological training in Italy, we conducted a survey of the residency programmes aimed at different aspects of training. The survey was conducted in the 38 neurological Italian teaching hospitals and 27 of these answered. Six of the 27 centres organized all of the scheduled teaching courses. The quality of courses was considered 'not sufficient' in 11 schools and 'good' in 12. Seminars were regularly performed in 18 centres but in 60% of these the number was <1 per week. Questionnaires to evaluate the quality of teaching were lacking in all centres. Regarding the procedures performed by each resident there was a large variation between the different schools. A regular rotation of each resident in the neurophysiology services was performed in 14 schools. Ward and out patient activity varied widely and details are given. We conclude that there is marked heterogeneity in training programmes between different centres. Some important activities such as seminars and rotation in neurophysiology are performed poorly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12752405/"}
