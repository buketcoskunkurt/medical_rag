However, in 2003 the decision was taken to publish ESH/ESC specific guidelines3 based on the fact that, because the WHO/ISH Guidelines address countries widely varying in the extent of their health care and availability of economic resource, they contain diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations that may be not totally appropriate for European countries. In Europe care provisions may often allow a more in-depth diagnostic assessment of cardiovascular risk and organ damage of hypertensive individuals as well as a wider choice of antihypertensive treatment. The 2003 ESH/ESC Guidelines3 were well received by the clinical world and have been the most widely quoted paper in the medical literature in the last two years.4 However, since 2003 considerable additional evidence on important issues related to diagnostic and treatment approaches to hypertension has become available and therefore updating of the previous guidelines has been found advisable. In preparing the new guidelines the Committee established by the ESH and ESC has agreed to adhere to the principles informing the 2003 Guidelines, namely 1) to try to offer the best available and most balanced recommendation to all health care providers involved in the management of hypertension, 2) to address this aim again by an extensive and critical review of the data accompanied by a series of boxes where specific recommendations are given, as well as by a concise set of practice recommendations to be published soon thereafter as already done in 2003; …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehm236", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990908213", "source": "openalex"}

Preconditioning the Myocardium: From Cellular Physiology to Clinical Cardiology. Physiol Rev 83: 1113-1151, 2003; 10.1152/physrev.00009.2003.—The phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning, in which a period of sublethal ischemia can profoundly protect the cell from infarction during a subsequent ischemic insult, has been responsible for an enormous amount of research over the last 15 years. Ischemic preconditioning is associated with two forms of protection: a classical form lasting ∼2 h after the preconditioning ischemia followed a day later by a second window of protection lasting ∼3 days. Both types of preconditioning share similarities in that the preconditioning ischemia provokes the release of several autacoids that trigger protection by occupying cell surface receptors. Receptor occupancy activates complex signaling cascades which during the lethal ischemia converge on one or more end-effectors to mediate the protection. The end-effectors so far have eluded identification, although a number have been proposed. A range of different pharmacological agents that activate the signaling cascades at the various levels can mimic ischemic preconditioning leading to the hope that specific therapeutic agents can be designed to exploit the profound protection seen with ischemic preconditioning. This review examines, in detail, the complex mechanisms associated with both forms of preconditioning as well as discusses the possibility to exploit this phenomenon in the clinical setting. As our understanding of the mechanisms associated with preconditioning are unravelled, we believe we can look forward to the development of new therapeutic agents with novel mechanisms of action that can supplement current treatment options for patients threatened with acute myocardial infarction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00009.2003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2047876380", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2995889897", "title": "European Society of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Disease Statistics 2019", "text": "Abstract Aims The 2019 report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas provides a contemporary analysis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics across 56 member countries, with particular emphasis on international inequalities in disease burden and healthcare delivery together with estimates of progress towards meeting 2025 World Health Organization (WHO) non-communicable disease targets. Methods and results In this report, contemporary CVD statistics are presented for member countries of the ESC. The statistics are drawn from the ESC Atlas which is a repository of CVD data from a variety of sources including the WHO, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and the World Bank. The Atlas also includes novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery obtained by annual survey of the national societies of ESC member countries. Across ESC member countries, the prevalence of obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) and diabetes has increased two- to three-fold during the last 30 years making the WHO 2025 target to halt rises in these risk factors unlikely to be achieved. More encouraging have been variable declines in hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption but on current trends only the reduction in smoking from 28% to 21% during the last 20 years appears sufficient for the WHO target to be achieved. The median age-standardized prevalence of major risk factors was higher in middle-income compared with high-income ESC member countries for hypertension {23.8% [interquartile range (IQR) 22.5–23.1%] vs. 15.7% (IQR 14.5–21.1%)}, diabetes [7.7% (IQR 7.1–10.1%) vs. 5.6% (IQR 4.8–7.0%)], and among males smoking [43.8% (IQR 37.4–48.0%) vs. 26.0% (IQR 20.9–31.7%)] although among females smoking was less common in middle-income countries [8.7% (IQR 3.0–10.8) vs. 16.7% (IQR 13.9–19.7%)]. There were associated inequalities in disease burden with disability-adjusted life years per 100 000 people due to CVD over three times as high in middle-income [7160 (IQR 5655–8115)] compared with high-income [2235 (IQR 1896–3602)] countries. Cardiovascular disease mortality was also higher in middle-income countries where it accounted for a greater proportion of potential years of life lost compared with high-income countries in both females (43% vs. 28%) and males (39% vs. 28%). Despite the inequalities in disease burden across ESC member countries, survey data from the National Cardiac Societies of the ESC showed that middle-income member countries remain severely under-resourced compared with high-income countries in terms of cardiological person-power and technological infrastructure. Under-resourcing in middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, device implantation and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion A seemingly inexorable rise in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes currently provides the greatest challenge to achieving further reductions in CVD burden across ESC member countries. Additional challenges are provided by inequalities in disease burden that now require intensification of policy initiatives in order to reduce population risk and prioritize cardiovascular healthcare delivery, particularly in the middle-income countries of the ESC where need is greatest.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz859", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2995889897", "source": "openalex"}

Methods Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health and results Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are ~30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab892", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4206703572", "source": "openalex"}

DHF is also referred to as heart failure with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFNEF) to indicate that HFNEF could be a precursor of heart failure with reduced LVEF. Because of improved cardiac imaging and because of widespread clinical use of plasma levels of natriuretic peptides, diagnostic criteria for HFNEF needed to be updated. The diagnosis of HFNEF requires the following conditions to be satisfied: (i) signs or symptoms of heart failure; (ii) normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function; (iii) evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. Normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function implies both an LVEF > 50% and an LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) <97 mL/m2. Diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction can be obtained invasively (LV end-diastolic pressure >16 mmHg or mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >12 mmHg) or non-invasively by tissue Doppler (TD) (E/E′ > 15). If TD yields an E/E′ ratio suggestive of diastolic LV dysfunction (15 > E/E′ > 8), additional non-invasive investigations are required for diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. These can consist of blood flow Doppler of mitral valve or pulmonary veins, echo measures of LV mass index or left atrial volume index, electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation, or plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. If plasma levels of natriuretic peptides are elevated, diagnostic evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction also requires additional non-invasive investigations such as TD, blood flow Doppler of mitral valve or pulmonary veins, echo measures of LV mass index or left atrial volume index, or electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation. A similar strategy with focus on a high negative predictive value of successive investigations is proposed for the exclusion of HFNEF in patients with breathlessness and no signs of congestion. The updated strategies for the diagnosis and exclusion of HFNEF are useful not only for individual patient management but also for patient recruitment in future clinical trials exploring therapies for HFNEF.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehm037", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127039247", "source": "openalex"}

A major aim of this 2017 data presentation has been to compare high-income and middle-income ESC member countries to identify inequalities in disease burden, outcomes, and service provision. The Atlas utilizes a variety of data sources, including the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and the World Bank to document risk factors, prevalence, and mortality of cardiovascular disease and national economic indicators. It also includes novel ESC-sponsored survey data of health infrastructure and cardiovascular service provision provided by the national societies of the ESC member countries. Data presentation is descriptive with no attempt to attach statistical significance to differences observed in stratified analyses. Important differences were identified between the high-income and middle-income member countries of the ESC with regard to CVD risk factors, disease incidence, and mortality. For both women and men, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was lower in high-income countries (18% and 27%) compared with middle-income countries (24% and 30%). Smoking prevalence in men (not women) was also lower (26% vs. 41%) and together these inequalities are likely to have contributed to the higher CVD mortality in middle-income countries. Declines in CVD mortality have seen cancer becoming a more common cause of death in a number of high-income member countries, but in middle-income countries declines in CVD mortality have been less consistent where CVD remains the leading cause of death. Inequalities in CVD mortality are emphasized by the smaller contribution they make to potential years of life lost in high-income countries compared with middle-income countries both for women (13% vs. 23%) and men (20% vs. 27%). The downward mortality trends for CVD may, however, be threatened by the emerging obesity epidemic that is seeing rates of diabetes increasing across all the ESC member countries. Survey data from the National Cardiac Societies showed that rates of cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass surgery, as well as the number of specialist centres required to deliver them, were greatest in the high-income member countries of the ESC. The Atlas confirmed that these ESC member countries, where the facilities for the contemporary treatment of coronary disease were best developed, were often those in which declines in coronary mortality have been most pronounced. Economic resources were not the only driver for delivery of equitable cardiovascular health care, as some middle-income ESC member countries reported rates for interventional procedures and device implantations that matched or exceeded the rates in wealthier member countries. In documenting national CVD statistics, the Atlas provides valuable insights into the inequalities in risk factors, health care delivery, and outcomes of CVD across the ESC member countries. The availability of these data will underpin the ESC's ambitious mission 'to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease' not only in its member countries but also in nation states around the world.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx628", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768555410", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2114328455", "title": "Environmental Cardiology", "text": "Environmental factors are considered key determinants of cardiovascular disease. Although lifestyle choices such as smoking, diet, and exercise are viewed as major environmental influences, the contribution of pollutants and environmental chemicals is less clear. Accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to pollutants and chemicals could elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease. Many epidemiological studies report that exposure to fine particles present in ambient air is associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality. Statistically significant relationships between particulate air pollution and ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure have been reported. Animal studies show that exposure to ambient air particles increases peripheral thrombosis and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Exposures to arsenic, lead, cadmium, pollutant gases, solvents, and pesticides have also been linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Mechanistically, these effects have been attributed to changes in the synthesis or reactivity of nitric oxide that may be caused by environmental oxidants or increased endogenous production of reactive oxygen species. Additional studies are urgently needed to: identify the contribution of individual pollutants to specific aspects of cardiovascular disease; establish causality; elucidate the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms; estimate the relative susceptibility of diseased and healthy individuals and that of specific population groups; and determine whether pollutant exposure are risk correlates, that is, whether they influence major risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol, or diabetes, or whether they contribute to the absolute risk of heart disease. Collectively, these investigations could contribute to the emergent field of environmental cardiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.res.0000243586.99701.cf", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114328455", "source": "openalex"}

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Principles The 2013 European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) guidelines continue to adhere to some fundamental principles that inspired the 2003 and 2007 guidelines, namely to base recommendations on properly conducted studies identified from an extensive review of the literature; to consider, as the highest priority, data from randomized, controlled trials and their meta-analyses, but not to disregard the results of observational and other studies of appropriate scientific calibre; and to grade the level of scientific evidence and the strength of recommendations in order to more effectively alert physicians on recommendations that are based on the opinions of the experts rather than on evidence (Tables 1 and 2). When appropriately recognized, this can avoid guidelines being perceived as prescriptive and favour the performance of studies wherein opinion prevails and evidence is lacking.TABLE 1: Classes of recommendationsTABLE 2: Levels of evidenceThis shortened version of the ESH/ESC guidelines is for the practicing physician who often requires simplified information. However, whenever the physicians would like to know the source of the data upon which the recommendations are based, they are encouraged to consult the extensive version of the ESH/ESC guidelines wherein adequate references are given. These guidelines, however, do not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient. 1.2 New aspects Because of new evidence on several diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of hypertension, the present guidelines differ from the 2007 ones in several points: Re-emphasis on integration of blood pressure (BP), cardiovascular risk factors, asymptomatic organ damage and clinical complications for total cardiovascular risk assessment. Update of the prognostic significance of out-of-office BP (both ambulatory and home BP), white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension. Initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment only in patients with SBP or DBP values at least 140 or 90 mmHg, independent of level of total cardiovascular risk. Unified target SBP (<140 mmHg) in both higher and lower cardiovascular risk patients. Revised recommendations on treatment of hypertension in young people and in the elderly. Liberal approach to initial monotherapy, without any all-ranking purpose scheme. Revised therapeutic algorithm for achieving target BP. Revised attention to resistant hypertension. 2. DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS The continuous relationship between BP and cardiovascular and renal events make the distinction between normotension and hypertension difficult. In practice, however, cut-off BP values are universally used to facilitate the decision about treatment (Table 3).TABLE 3: Definitions and classification of office blood pressure levels (mmHg)In order to help prognosis, total cardiovascular risk should be stratified in different categories (low, moderate, high and very high risk referred to the 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality), based on BP category, cardiovascular risk factors, asymptomatic organ damage and presence of diabetes, and symptomatic cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease (CKD), as summarized in Fig. 1.FIGURE 1: Stratification of total cardiovascular risk in categories of low, moderate, high and very high risk according to SBP and DBP and presence of risk factors (RFs), asymptomatic organ damage (OD), diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage or symptomatic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals with a high normal office but a raised out-of-office BP (masked hypertension) have a cardiovascular risk in the hypertension range. Individuals with a high office BP but normal out-of-office BP (white-coat hypertension), particularly if there is no diabetes, OD, CVD or CKD, have lower risk than sustained hypertension for the same office BP. BP, blood pressure; CV, cardiovascular; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; HT, hypertension; SBP, systolic blood pressure.3. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION The initial evaluation of a patient with hypertension should confirm the diagnosis of hypertension; detect causes of secondary hypertension; and assess cardiovascular risk, organ damage and concomitant clinical conditions. This calls for BP measurement, medical history including family history, physical examination, laboratory investigation and further diagnostic tests. Some of the investigations are needed in all patients; others only in specific patient groups. 3.1 Blood pressure measurement 3.1.1 Office and out-of-office blood pressure Although conventional office BP measurement currently remains the ‘gold standard’ for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertension, it is generally accepted that out-of-office BP provides important adjunct information. At present, BP can no longer be estimated using a mercury manometer in many – although not all – European countries. Auscultatory or oscillometric semiautomatic sphygmomanometers are used instead, but these devices should be validated according to standardized protocols and their accuracy checked periodically. Table 4 gives instructions for correct office BP measurements, and Table 5 provides clinical indications for out-of-office BP measurement, namely measurements at home or over the 24 h.TABLE 4: Office blood pressure measurementTABLE 5: Clinical indications for out-of-office blood pressure measurement for diagnostic purposesOffice BP is usually higher than ambulatory and home BP and the difference increases as office BP increases. Cut-off values for the definition of hypertension by home and ambulatory BP are reported in Table 6.TABLE 6: Definitions of hypertension by office and out-of-office blood pressure levels3.1.2 White-coat and masked hypertension The term ‘white-coat’ or ‘isolated office’ hypertension refers to a condition in which BP is elevated in the office at repeated visits and normal out of the office either on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or on home blood pressure monitoring. Conversely, BP may be normal in the office and abnormally high out of the medical environment, which is termed ‘masked’ or ‘isolated ambulatory’ hypertension. Cut-off values to be used are those in Table 6. 3.1.3 Central blood pressure Owing to the variable superposition of incoming and reflected pressure waves along the arterial tree, aortic BP (central BP) may be different from brachial BP. Central BP can be estimated indirectly by various methods. The current guidelines consider that, despite the growing interest in these methods, more investigation is needed before recommending the routine measurement of central BP for clinical use. 3.2 Medical history The information to be obtained at the time of the first diagnosis of hypertension is indicated in Table 7.TABLE 7: Personal and family medical history3.3 Physical examination Physical examination aims to establish or verify the diagnosis of hypertension, establish current BP, screen for secondary causes of hypertension and refine global cardiovascular risk. Procedures for BP measurement are indicated in Tables 4 and 5. Other information to be obtained by physical examination is in Table 8.TABLE 8: Physical examination for secondary hypertension, organ damage and obesity3.4 Laboratory investigations Laboratory investigations are directed at providing evidence for additional risk factors, searching for secondary hypertension and looking for organ damage. Investigations should proceed from the most simple to the more complicated ones, as summarized in Table 9.TABLE 9: Laboratory investigations3.5 Searching for asymptomatic organ damage Owing to the importance of asymptomatic organ damage as an intermediate stage in the continuum of cardiovascular disease, and as a determinant of overall cardiovascular disease, signs of organ involvement should be sought carefully by appropriate techniques as indicated below.Figure3.6 Searching for secondary forms of hypertension A specific, potentially reversible cause of BP elevation can be identified in a relatively small number of adult patients with hypertension. However if basal work-up leads to the suspicion of a secondary form of hypertension, the patient should be referred to a specialized centre where specific diagnostic procedures may be performed. 4. TREATMENT APPROACH 4.1 Recommendations of previous guidelines revised The 2007 ESH/ESC Guidelines, like many other scientific guidelines, recommended the use of antihypertensive drugs in patients with Grade 1 hypertension even in the absence of other risk factors or organ damage after nonpharmacological treatment had proved unsuccessful. This recommendation also specifically included the elderly hypertensive patient. The 2007 Guidelines also suggested drug treatment of patients with diabetes, previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CKD even when their BP was in the high normal range (130–139/85–89 mmHg). Furthermore, a lower BP target was recommended for these high or very high risk patients (<130/80 mmHg) than in patients at low–moderate risk (<140/90 mmHg). These recommendations were reappraised in a 2009 ESH Task Force document on the basis of an extensive critical review of the evidence. The following now summarizes the conclusions for the current guidelines: attention should be directed to the Class of recommendation and the Level of evidence, in order to distinguish what is considered compelling and what simply prudent. Figure 2 also summarizes recommendations and suggestions for treatment initiation and BP targets in the context of total risk stratification of hypertensive individuals.FIGURE 2: Initiation of lifestyle changes and antihypertensive drug treatment. Targets of treatment are also indicated. Colours are as in Fig. 1. See 4.3 and 6.5 for evidence that, in patients with diabetes, the optimal DBP target is between 80 and 85 mmHg. In the high normal blood pressure (BP) range, drug treatment should be considered in the presence of a raised out-of-office BP (masked hypertension). See 4.2 and 6.3 for lack of evidence in favour of drug treatment in young individuals with isolated systolic hypertension.

TREATMENT STRATEGIES 5.1 Lifestyle changes Appropriate lifestyle changes are the cornerstone for the prevention of hypertension. They are also important for its treatment, although they should never delay the initiation of drug therapy in patients at high level of risk. In addition to the BP-lowering effect, lifestyle changes contribute to the control of other cardiovascular risk factors and clinical conditions. The lifestyle measures that have been shown to be capable of reducing BP and therefore recommended are as follows: salt restriction to 5–6 g/day; moderation of alcohol consumption to no more than 20–30 g of ethanol per day in men and 10–20 g/day in women; high consumption of vegetables and fruits and low-fat dairy products; reduction of weight to a BMI of 25 kg/m2 and waist circumference to less than 102 cm in men and less than 88 cm in women; at least 30 min of moderate dynamic exercise on 5 to 7 days per week. 5.2 Pharmacological therapy 5.2.1 Choice of antihypertensive drugs The current guidelines reconfirm that all major classes of antihypertensive agents are suitable for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment either in monotherapy or in some combinations, and that no all-purpose ranking of drugs for general antihypertensive usage is evidence based. All classes have their advantages but also contraindications, and may be preferentially used or avoided in specific conditions. Contraindications and preferred indications are listed in Tables 10 and 11.TABLE 10: Compelling and possible contraindications to the use of antihypertensive drugsTABLE 11: Drugs to be preferred in specific conditions5.2.2 Monotherapy and combination therapy The current guidelines share the 2007 Guidelines’ opinion that monotherapy can reduce BP to target only in a limited number of patients and that most patients require the combination of at least two drugs, and they reconfirm that initiation with a drug combination can be considered in patients at high cardiovascular risk or with markedly high BP. The algorithm of Fig. 3, however, is a modification of the 2007 one, to emphasize that adding drugs to drugs should be done with attention to results and any compound overtly ineffective or minimally effective should be replaced, rather than retained in an automatic step-up multiple-drug approach. Combinations to be preferred or avoided are illustrated in Fig. 4.FIGURE 3: Monotherapy vs. drug combination strategies to achieve target blood pressure (BP). CV, cardiovascular.FIGURE 4: Possible combinations of classes of antihypertensive drugs. Green continuous lines: preferred combinations; green dashed line: useful combination (with some limitations); black dashed lines: possible but less well tested combinations; red continuous line: not recommended combination. Although verapamil and diltiazem are sometimes used with a β-blocker to improve ventricular rate control in permanent atrial fibrillation, only dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should normally be combined with β-blockers.

TREATMENT OF ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORSFigure8. FOLLOW-UP 8.1 Follow-up visits After initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, it is important to see the patient at 2-week to 4-week intervals to evaluate the effects on BP and to assess possible side-effects. Some medications will have an effect within days or weeks but a continued delayed response may occur during the first 2 months. Once the target is reached, a visit interval of a few months is reasonable. 8.2 Elevated blood pressure at control visits Patients and physicians have a tendency to interpret an uncontrolled BP at a given visit as due to occasional factors and thus to downplay its clinical significance. Due attention should be given to poor adherence or irregular consumption of drugs (sometimes because of adverse effects), to the white-coat effect and to substances or drugs opposing the antihypertensive effect of treatment. 8.3 Can antihypertensive medication be stopped? In some patients, in whom treatment is accompanied by an effective BP control for an extended period, it may be possible to reduce the number and dosage of drugs. This may be particularly the case if BP control is accompanied by healthy lifestyle changes. Reduction of medications should be made gradually and the patient should frequently be checked because of the risk of reappearance of hypertension. 9. IMPROVEMENT OF BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL IN HYPERTENSION Despite overwhelming evidence that hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor and that BP-lowering substantially reduce the risk, there is evidence that all over the world a noticeable proportion of hypertensive individuals are unaware of this condition or, if aware, do not undergo treatment; target BP values are seldom achieved; failure to achieve BP control is associated with persistence of an elevated cardiovascular risk; and the rate of awareness of hypertension and BP control is improving slowly or not at all. As a consequence, high BP remains a leading cause of death and cardiovascular morbidity in Europe, as elsewhere in the world. Overall, three main causes of the low rate of BP control in real life have been identified: physician inertia; patient low adherence to treatment; and deficiencies of healthcare systems in their approach to chronic diseases.

Another factor affecting quantification is the limited spatial resolution. While considerable effort has gone into development of routine correction techniques for the former factors, less attention has been paid to the latter. Spatial resolution-related effects, referred to as 'partial volume effects' (PVEs), depend not only on the characteristics of the imaging system but also on the object and activity distribution. Spatial and/or temporal variations in PVE can often be confounding factors. Partial volume correction (PVC) could in theory be achieved by some kind of inverse filtering technique, reversing the effect of the system PSF. However, these methods are limited, and usually lead to noise-amplification or image artefacts. Some form of regularization is therefore needed, and this can be achieved using information from co-registered anatomical images, such as CT or MRI.

To define the current role of EMB in the management of cardiovascular disease, a multidisciplinary group of experts in cardiomyopathies and cardiovascular pathology was convened by the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). The present Writing Group was charged with reviewing the published literature on the role of EMB in cardiovascular diseases, summarizing this information, and making useful recommendations for clinical practice with classifications of recommendations and levels of evidence. The Writing Group identified 14 clinical scenarios in which the incremental diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value of EMB could be estimated and compared with the procedural risks.

Cardiovascular diseases result in substantial disability and loss of productivity and contribute in large part, to the escalating costs of health care, especially in the presence of an ageing population. Papers published by the World Health Organization of the United Nations (WHO) and others have previously reported trends in cardiovascular mortality over time. These reports showed large international between-country differences both in the levels and in the trends in mortality from cardiovascular diseases, especially from ischaemic heart disease. More recent analysis of mortality data points to a substantial increase in cardiovascular diseases in countries of Central and Eastern Europe concomitant with recent nutritional, economical and political changes. Although most European countries perform analysis of mortality at the sub-national (regional) level, international analysis using sub-national data have been made only for selected diseases, for example cancer mortality by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon. The advantage of this type of analysis is that spatial variability in mortality patterns can be shown across borders. This may help in identifying factors responsible for this variation. The importance of population control of cardiovascular diseases was highlighted by the European Union in article 129 of the Treaty on European Union, which contains specific provisions on public health and focuses on the ‘prevention of disease, in particular the major health scourges’. The Council Resolution recognized the need for monitoring and surveillance of cardiovascular diseases within the general framework of health monitoring. Accordingly, the Board of the European Society of Cardiology upon recommendation from the Committee for Scientific and Clinical Initiatives, set up a Task Force to study the latest available data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in order to assess the burden of these diseases in Europe. This report reviews total cardiovascular, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular and all causes mortality in European countries for the years 1990–1992. Regional mortality rates are presented for the years 1990–1991. Finally, the country mortality trends for the period 1970 to 1992 are analysed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a015434", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991815254", "source": "openalex"}

The ESC recommendations for guidelines production can be found on the ESC website†. In brief, the ESC appoints experts in the field to carry out a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and to assess the risk–benefit ratio of the therapies recommended for management and/or prevention of a given condition. The strength of evidence for or against particular procedures or treatments is weighed according to predefined scales for grading recommendations and levels of evidence, as outlined below. Once the document has been finalized and approved by all the experts involved in the Task Force, it is submitted to outside specialists for review. If necessary, the document is revised once more to be finally approved by the Committee for Practice Guidelines and selected members of the Board of the ESC. The ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) supervises and coordinates the preparation of new Guidelines and Expert Consensus Documents produced by Task Forces, expert groups, or consensus panels. The chosen experts in these writing panels are asked to provide disclosure statements of all relationships they may have, which might be perceived as real or potential conflicts of interest.

The Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting (IMPROVE HF) prospectively tested a multidimensional practice-specific performance improvement intervention on the use of guideline-recommended therapies for HF in outpatient cardiology practices. Methods and Results— Performance data were collected in a random sample of HF patients from 167 US outpatient cardiology practices at baseline, longitudinally after intervention at 12 and 24 months, and in single-point-in-time patient cohorts at 6 and 18 months. Participants included 34 810 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%) and chronic HF or previous myocardial infarction. To quantify guideline adherence, 7 quality measures were assessed. Interventions included clinical decision support tools, structured improvement strategies, and chart audits with feedback. The performance improvement intervention resulted in significant improvements in 5 of 7 quality measures at the 24-month assessment compared with baseline: β-blocker (92.2% versus 86.0%, +6.2%), aldosterone antagonist (60.3% versus 34.5%, +25.1%), cardiac resynchronization therapy (66.3% versus 37.2%, +29.9%), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (77.5% versus 50.1%, +27.4%), and HF education (72.1% versus 59.5%, +12.6%) (each P &lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant improvements in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use or anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Sensitivity analyses at the patient level and limited to patients with both baseline and 24-month quality measure data yielded similar results. Improvements in the single-point-in-time cohorts were smaller, and there were no concurrent control practices. Conclusions— The Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting, a defined and scalable practice-specific performance improvement intervention, was associated with substantial improvements in the use of guideline-recommended therapies in eligible patients with HF in outpatient cardiology practices.

Cumulative X-ray doses to the lenses of interventional cardiologists and associated staff can be high. The International Commission on Radiological Protection recently noted considerable uncertainty concerning radiation risk to the lens. This study evaluated risk of radiation cataract after occupational exposure in interventional cardiology personnel. Comprehensive dilated slit-lamp examinations were performed in interventional cardiologists, associated workers and controls. Radiation exposures were estimated using experimental data from catheterization laboratories and answers to detailed questionnaires. A total of 116 exposed and 93 similarly aged nonexposed individuals were examined. The relative risk of posterior subcapsular opacities in interventional cardiologists compared to unexposed controls was 3.2 (38% compared to 12%; P < 0.005). A total of 21% of nurses and technicians had radiation-associated posterior lens changes typically associated with ionizing radiation exposure. Cumulative median values of lens doses were estimated at 6.0 Sv for cardiologists and 1.5 Sv for associated medical personnel. A significantly elevated incidence of radiation-associated lens changes in interventional cardiology workers indicates there is an urgent need to educate these professionals in radiation protection to reduce the likelihood of cataract.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1667/rr2207.1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2169635460", "source": "openalex"}

Surgical ablation of AF, using either standard or minimally invasive techniques, is also performed in many major hospitals throughout the world. In 2007, an initial Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical AF Ablation was developed as a joint effort of the Heart Rhythm Society, the European Heart Rhythm Association, and the European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society.1 The 2007 document was also developed in collaboration with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American College of Cardiology. Since the publication of the 2007 document, there has been much learned about AF ablation, and the indications for these procedures have changed. Therefore the purpose of this 2012 Consensus Statement is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the field of catheter and surgical ablation of AF and to report the findings of a Task Force, convened by the Heart Rhythm Society, the European Heart Rhythm Association, and the European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society and charged with defining the indications, techniques, and outcomes of this procedure. Included within this document are recommendations pertinent to the design of clinical trials in the field of AF ablation, including definitions relevant to this topic. This statement summarizes the opinion of the Task Force members based on an extensive literature review as well as their own experience.

We recommend a new stepwise diagnostic process, the ‘HFA–PEFF diagnostic algorithm’. Step 1 (P=Pre-test assessment) is typically performed in the ambulatory setting and includes assessment for HF symptoms and signs, typical clinical demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elderly, atrial fibrillation), and diagnostic laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. In the absence of overt non-cardiac causes of breathlessness, HFpEF can be suspected if there is a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, no significant heart valve disease or cardiac ischaemia, and at least one typical risk factor. Elevated natriuretic peptides support, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFpEF. The second step (E: Echocardiography and Natriuretic Peptide Score) requires comprehensive echocardiography and is typically performed by a cardiologist. Measures include mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e′), left ventricular (LV) filling pressure estimated using E/e′, left atrial volume index, LV mass index, LV relative wall thickness, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, LV global longitudinal systolic strain, and serum natriuretic peptide levels. Major (2 points) and Minor (1 point) criteria were defined from these measures. A score ≥5 points implies definite HFpEF; ≤1 point makes HFpEF unlikely. An intermediate score (2–4 points) implies diagnostic uncertainty, in which case Step 3 (F1: Functional testing) is recommended with echocardiographic or invasive haemodynamic exercise stress tests. Step 4 (F2: Final aetiology) is recommended to establish a possible specific cause of HFpEF or alternative explanations. Further research is needed for a better classification of HFpEF.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz641", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2971111962", "source": "openalex"}

Guidelines are no substitutes but are complements for textbooks and cover the ESC Core Curriculum topics. Guidelines and recommendations should help the physicians to make decisions in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible physician(s). A large number of Guidelines have been issued in recent years by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) as well as by other societies and organizations. Because of the impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/guidelines-surveys/esc-guidelines/about/Pages/rules-writing.aspx). ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated. Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for diagnosis, management, and/or prevention of a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) policy.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2101613925", "title": "Cardiovascular diseases in women: a statement from the policy conference of the European Society of Cardiology", "text": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality both in men and women. In Europe, about 55% of all females' deaths are caused by CVD, especially coronary heart disease and stroke. Unfortunately, however, the risk of heart disease in women is underestimated because of the perception that women are ‘protected’ against ischaemic heart disease. What is not fully understood is that women during the fertile age have a lower risk of cardiac events, but this protection fades after menopause thus leaving women with untreated risk factors vulnerable to develop myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, clinical manifestations of ischaemic heart disease in women may be different from those commonly observed in males and this factor may account for under-recognition of the disease. The European Society of Cardiology has recently initiated an extensive ‘Women at heart’ program to coordinate research and educational initiatives on CVD in women. A Policy Conference on CVD in Women was one of the first steps in the development of this program. The objective of the conference was to collect the opinion of experts in the field coming from the European Society of Cardiology member countries to: (1) summarize the state-of-the-art from an European perspective; (2) to identify the scientific gaps on CVD in women; and (3) to delineate the strategies for changing the misperception of CVD in women, improving risk stratification, diagnosis, and therapy from a gender perspective and increasing women representation in clinical trials. The Policy Conference has provided the opportunity to review and comment on the current status of knowledge on CVD in women and to prioritize the actions needed to advance this area of knowledge in cardiology. In the preparation of this document we intend to provide the medical community and the stakeholders of this field with an overview of the more critical aspects that have emerged during the discussion.

Practicing cardiologists and sport physicians are required to identify high-risk individuals harbouring these cardiac diseases in a timely fashion in the setting of preparticipation screening or medical consultation and provide appropriate advice regarding the participation in competitive sport activities and/or regular exercise programmes. Many asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) patients with cardiomyopathies aspire to participate in leisure-time and amateur sport activities to take advantage of the multiple benefits of a physically active lifestyle. In 2005, The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published recommendations for participation in competitive sport in athletes with cardiomyopathies and myo-pericarditis. One decade on, these recommendations are partly obsolete given the evolving knowledge of the diagnosis, management and treatment of cardiomyopathies and myo-pericarditis. The present document, therefore, aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the most updated recommendations for practicing cardiologists and sport physicians managing athletes with cardiomyopathies and myo-pericarditis and provides pragmatic advice for safe participation in competitive sport at professional and amateur level, as well as in a variety of recreational physical activities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy730", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2903720062", "source": "openalex"}

Lack of interpretability in predictive models can undermine trust in those models, especially in health care, in which so many decisions are— literally—life and death issues. There has been a recent explosion of research in the field of explainable machine learning aimed at addressing these concerns. The promise of explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical decision-support tools or novel research papers to have critical understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of explainable machine learning as they apply to cardiology. Key concepts reviewed include interpretability vs explainability and global vs local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence plots. We discuss several limitations with explainability techniques, focusing on the how the nature of explanations as approximations may omit important information about how black-box models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use black- box models with explanations rather than interpretable models.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2021.09.004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3201437744", "source": "openalex"}

Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) and CKMB mass concentrations were measured by eight assays. Reference limits were determined by nonparametric statistical analysis.Two cTnI assays demonstrated at least a 1.2- to 2.5-fold higher 99th percentile for males vs females, with the mean concentrations significantly higher for males (P <0.05). Two cTnI assays also demonstrated a 1.1- to 2.8-fold higher 99th percentile for blacks vs Caucasians, with the mean concentrations significantly higher for blacks (P = 0.05). There was a 13-fold variance between the lowest measured 99th percentile (0.06 microg/L) and the highest (0.8 microg/L).

Additional tools to further stratify the risk of patients at an individual level are biomarkers. A surrogate endpoint is a biomarker that is intended as a substitute for a clinical endpoint. In order to be considered as a surrogate endpoint of cardiovascular events, a biomarker should satisfy several criteria, such as proof of concept, prospective validation, incremental value, clinical utility, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, methodological consensus, and reference values. We scrutinized the role of peripheral (i.e. not related to coronary circulation) noninvasive vascular biomarkers for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Most of the biomarkers examined fit within the concept of early vascular aging. Biomarkers that fulfill most of the criteria and, therefore, are close to being considered a clinical surrogate endpoint are carotid ultrasonography, ankle-brachial index and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity; biomarkers that fulfill some, but not all of the criteria are brachial ankle pulse wave velocity, central haemodynamics/wave reflections and C-reactive protein; biomarkers that do no not at present fulfill essential criteria are flow-mediated dilation, endothelial peripheral arterial tonometry, oxidized LDL and dysfunctional HDL.

Any ageism in clinical medicine and policy is simply a reflection of the presence of ageist attitudes in wider society, where the youth receives a higher priority over age. Ageism in medicine needs to be addressed to preserve or recapture this trust within an aging population. A wide ranging approach is necessary if equity in the provision of health care services is to be ensured which includes improvement of clinical guidelines and more specific monitoring of health care. Educational efforts to raise awareness that age stereotyping and ageist attitudes are unethical should be initiated. Research initiatives, which cover large numbers of older people, should be developed and older people should be empowered to influence choices and standards of treatments. Finally, legislation may be required to eradicate ageism in society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.319.7221.1353", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984981086", "source": "openalex"}

However, most 12-lead ECG classification studies are trained, tested, or developed in single, small, or relatively homogeneous datasets. In addition, most algorithms focus on identifying small numbers of cardiac arrhythmias that do not represent the complexity and difficulty of ECG interpretation. This work addresses these issues by providing a standard, multi-institutional database and a novel scoring metric through a public competition: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. Approach : A total of 66 361 12-lead ECG recordings were sourced from six hospital systems from four countries across three continents; 43 101 recordings were posted publicly with a focus on 27 diagnoses. For the first time in a public competition, we required teams to publish open-source code for both training and testing their algorithms, ensuring full scientific reproducibility. Main results : A total of 217 teams submitted 1395 algorithms during the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches for identifying cardiac abnormalities from both academia and industry. As with previous Challenges, high-performing algorithms exhibited significant drops ( <?CDATA $\\lessapprox$?> <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mo>≲</mml:mo> </mml:math> 10%) in performance on the hidden test data. Significance : Data from diverse institutions allowed us to assess algorithmic generalizability. A novel evaluation metric considered different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, capturing the outcomes and risks of different diagnoses. Requiring both trained models and code for training models improved the generalizability of submissions, setting a new bar in reproducibility for public data science competitions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abc960", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3098699929", "source": "openalex"}

Variables common to the three modules include demographics, risk factors, medication, and discharge and follow-up data. Modules about a procedure contain variables on the lesion, the device, and medication during the procedure. The ACS module includes presenting symptoms, reperfusion and acute treatments, and procedures in hospital and at follow-up.The data standards were discussed and adopted at a conference involving EU member states in Cork, Ireland, in May 2004.

Fear of infection, national lockdowns and altered healthcare priorities have the potential to impact utilisation of healthcare resources for non-communicable diseases. To survey health professionals' views of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate and timing of admission of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) administered an internet-based questionnaire to cardiologists and cardiovascular nurses across 6 continents. 3101 responses were received from 141 countries across 6 continents. 88.3% responded that their country was in \"total lockdown\" and 7.1% in partial lockdown. 78.8% responded that the number of patients presenting with STEMI was reduced since the coronavirus outbreak and 65.2% indicated that the reduction in STEMI presentations was >40%. Approximately 60% of all respondents reported that STEMI patients presented later than usual and 58.5% that >40% of STEMI patients admitted to hospital presented beyond the optimal window for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis. Independent predictors of the reported higher rate of delayed STEMI presentation were a country in total lockdown, >100 COVID-19 cases admitted locally, and the complete restructuring of the local cardiology service. The survey indicates that the impact of COVID-19 on STEMI presentations is likely to be substantial, with both lower presentations and a higher rate of delayed presentations occurring.

This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euv015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1929108078", "source": "openalex"}

The latest advances in smartphones and mHealth have been used in the creation of thousands of medical apps related to cardiology, which can help to reduce these mortality rates.The aim of this paper is to study the literature on mobile systems and applications currently available, as well as the existing apps related to cardiology from the leading app stores and to then classify the results to see what is available and what is missing, focusing particularly on commercial apps.Two reviews have been developed. One is a literature review of mobile systems and applications, retrieved from several databases and systems such as Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Knowledge. The other is a review of mobile apps in the leading app stores, Google play for Android and Apple's App Store for iOS.Search queries up to May 2013 located 406 papers and 710 apps related to cardiology and heart disease. The most researched section in the literature associated with cardiology is related to mobile heart (and vital signs) monitoring systems and the methods involved in the classification of heart signs in order to detect abnormal functions. Other systems with a significant number of papers are mobile cardiac rehabilitation systems, blood pressure measurement, and systems for the detection of heart failure. The majority of apps for cardiology are heart monitors and medical calculators. Other categories with a high number of apps are those for ECG education and interpretation, cardiology news and journals, blood pressure tracking, heart rate monitoring using an external device, and CPR instruction. There are very few guides on cardiac rehabilitation and apps for the management of the cardiac condition, and there were no apps that assist people who have undergone a heart transplant.The distribution of work in the field of cardiology apps is considerably disproportionate.

Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is a unique imaging modality able to provide high-resolution real-time visualization of cardiac structures, continuous monitoring of catheter location within the heart, and early recognition of procedural complications, such as pericardial effusion or thrombus formation. Additional benefits are excellent patient tolerance, reduction of fluoroscopy time, and lack of need for general anesthesia or a second operator. For these reasons, ICE has largely replaced transesophageal echocardiography as ideal imaging modality for guiding certain procedures, such as atrial septal defect closure and catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias, and has an emerging role in others, including mitral valvuloplasty, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and left atrial appendage closure. In electrophysiology procedures, ICE allows integration of real-time images with electroanatomic maps; it has a role in assessment of arrhythmogenic substrate, and it is particularly useful for mapping structures that are not visualized by fluoroscopy, such as the interatrial or interventricular septum, papillary muscles, and intracavitary muscular ridges. Most recently, a three-dimensional (3D) volumetric ICE system has also been developed, with potential for greater anatomic information and a promising role in structural interventions. In this state-of-the-art review, we provide guidance on how to conduct a comprehensive ICE survey and summarize the main applications of ICE in a variety of structural and electrophysiology procedures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.117.031343", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2890938642", "source": "openalex"}

IMPROVE HF is a prospective cohort study designed to characterize current management of patients with chronic HF and ejection fraction ≤35% in a national registry of 167 US outpatient cardiology practices. Methods and Results— Baseline patient characteristics and data on care of 15381 patients with diagnosed HF or prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction were collected by chart abstraction. To quantify use of therapies, 7 individual metrics (use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, β-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, anticoagulation, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and HF education) and composite metrics were assessed. Care metrics include only patients documented to be eligible and without contraindications or intolerance. Among practices, 69% were nonteaching. Patients were 71% male, with a median age of 70 years, and a median ejection fraction of 25%. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (80%) and β-blocker (86%) was relatively high in eligible patients in the outpatient cardiology setting; other metrics, such as aldosterone antagonist (36%), device therapy (implantable cardioverter defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator, 51%; cardiac resynchronization therapy, 39%), and education (61%), showed lower rates of use. A median 27% of patients received all HF therapies for which they were potentially eligible on the basis of chart documentation. Use of guideline-recommended therapies by practices varied widely.

Univariable and multivariable (with covariates that included risk factors, symptoms, and comorbidities) logistic regression models were used to estimate significant CAD, defined as > or = 70% stenosis, and in-hospital mortality. Within stable angina and ACS cohorts, 7% of patients were black, 2% were Hispanic, 0.3% were Native American, 1% were Asian, and 90% were white, respectively. In stable angina, the risk-adjusted OR for significant CAD was 0.34 for women compared with men (P<0.0001), with black women having the lowest risk-adjusted odds (P<0.0001) compared with other females. Among ACS patients, the risk-adjusted OR of significant CAD was 0.47 for women compared with men (P<0.0001); similarly, black women had the lowest risk-adjusted odds (P<0.0001) compared with other females. Higher in-hospital mortality was reported for white women presenting with stable angina (P<0.00001). White women had a 1.34-fold (95% CI 1.21 to 1.48) higher risk-adjusted odds ratio for mortality than white men with stable angina (P<0.0001), with higher rates noted for white women who were older or had significant CAD (both P<0.0001). Lower utilization of elective coronary revascularization, aspirin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (all P<0.0001) may have contributed to higher in-hospital mortality for white women. In ACS, higher in-hospital mortality was reported for Hispanic (P=0.015) and white (P<0.0001) women; however, neither white (P=0.51) or Hispanic (P=0.13) women had higher in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality.The likelihood for significant CAD at coronary angiography and for in-hospital mortality varied significantly by ethnicity and gender.

The present position paper aims to update the practical recommendations on the core components and goals of cardiac rehabilitation intervention in different cardiovascular conditions, in order to assist the whole cardiac rehabilitation staff in the design and development of the programmes, and to support healthcare providers, insurers, policy makers and patients in the recognition of the positive nature of cardiac rehabilitation. Starting from the previous position paper published in 2010, this updated document maintains a disease-oriented approach, presenting both well-established and more controversial aspects. Particularly for implementation of the exercise programme, advances in different training modalities were added and new challenging populations were considered.

This stimulated us to present our single-centre experience with 3D printing models in cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology.Between the years 2006 and 2013, we fabricated 3D printing models using preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging data in paediatric and adult cardiac surgery, as well as interventional cardiology. We present the 8 most representative cases.The models were very helpful for perioperative planning and orientation, as well as simulation of procedures due to the exact and life-like illustration of the cardiovascular anatomy.The fabrication of 3D printing models is feasible for perioperative planning and simulation in a variety of complex cases in paediatric and adult cardiac surgery, as well as in interventional cardiology.

The hospital has improved its facilities since 1989, when it had two old-fashioned theatres, to include four rooms with more advanced and safer equipment. Intensive radiation protection training was also implemented since 1989. Initially, some individual dose values in the range of 100–300 mSv month−1, which risked exceeding some regulatory dose limits, were measured over the lead apron. Several doses in the range of 5–11 mSv month−1 were recorded under the apron (mean = 10.2 mSv year−1). During the last 5 years of the study, after the implementation of the radiation protection actions and a programme of patient-dose optimization, the mean dose under the apron was reduced to 1.2 mSv year−1. Current mean occupational doses recorded under the lead apron are 14% of those recorded during 1989–1992 and those recorded over the apron are 14-fold less than those recorded during 1989–1992.

It should be regarded as a necessary facility in a centre specializing in the care of adults with CHD. Also, those using CMR to investigate acquired heart disease should be able to recognize and evaluate previously unsuspected CHD such as septal defects, anomalously connected pulmonary veins, or double-chambered right ventricle. To realize its full potential and to avoid pitfalls, however, CMR of CHD requires training and experience. Appropriate pathophysiological understanding is needed to evaluate cardiovascular function after surgery for tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, and after Fontan operations.

The objective of this study was to assess the power of the 2003 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and 2011 ACC Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) SCD risk stratification algorithms to distinguish high risk patients who might be eligible for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) from low risk individuals. <h3>Methods and results</h3> We studied 1606 consecutively evaluated HCM patients in an observational, retrospective cohort study. Five risk factors (RF) for SCD were assessed: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, severe left ventricular hypertrophy, family history of SCD, unexplained syncope and abnormal blood pressure response to exercise. During a follow-up period of 11 712 patient years (median 6.6 years), SCD/appropriate ICD shock occurred in 20 (3%) of 660 patients without RF (annual rate 0.45%), 31 (4.8%) of 636 patients with 1 RF (annual rate 0.65%), 27 (10.8%) of 249 patients with 2 RF (annual rate 1.3%), 7 (13.7%) of 51 patients with 3 RF (annual rate 1.9%) and 4 (40%) of 10 patients with ≥4 RF (annual rate 5.0%). The risk of SCD increased with multiple RF (2 RF: HR 2.87, p≤0.001; 3 RF: HR 4.32, p=0.001; ≥4 RF: HR 11.37, p&lt;0.0001), but not with a single RF (HR 1.43 p=0.21). The area under time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (representing the probability of correctly identifying a patient at risk of SCD on the basis of RF profile) was 0.63 at 1 year and 0.64 at 5 years for the 2003 ACC/ESC algorithm and 0.61 at 1 year and 0.63 at 5 years for the 2011 ACCF/AHA algorithm. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The risk of SCD increases with the aggregation of RF. The 2003 ACC/ESC and 2011 ACCF/AHA guidelines distinguish high from low risk individuals with limited power.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303271", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156505087", "source": "openalex"}

Implications of the new guideline's threshold and model have not been addressed in non-US populations or compared with previous guidelines.To determine population-wide implications of the ACC/AHA, the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines using a cohort of Dutch individuals aged 55 years or older.We included 4854 Rotterdam Study participants recruited in 1997-2001. We calculated 10-year risks for \"hard\" ASCVD events (including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) (ACC/AHA), hard CHD events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, CHD mortality) (ATP-III), and atherosclerotic CVD mortality (ESC).Events were assessed until January 1, 2012. Per guideline, we calculated proportions of individuals for whom statins would be recommended and determined calibration and discrimination of risk models.The mean age was 65.5 (SD, 5.2) years. Statins would be recommended for 96.4% (95% CI, 95.4%-97.1%; n = 1825) of men and 65.8% (95% CI, 63.8%-67.7%; n = 1523) of women by the ACC/AHA, 52.0% (95% CI, 49.8%-54.3%; n = 985) of men and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.5%-37.5%; n = 821) of women by the ATP-III, and 66.1% (95% CI, 64.0%-68.3%; n = 1253) of men and 39.1% (95% CI, 37.1%-41.2%; n = 906) of women by ESC guidelines. With the ACC/AHA model, average predicted risk vs observed cumulative incidence of hard ASCVD events was 21.5% (95% CI, 20.9%-22.1%) vs 12.7% (95% CI, 11.1%-14.5%) for men (192 events) and 11.6% (95% CI, 11.2%-12.0%) vs 7.9% (95% CI, 6.7%-9.2%) for women (151 events). Similar overestimation occurred with the ATP-III model (98 events in men and 62 events in women) and ESC model (50 events in men and 37 events in women). The C statistic was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63-0.71) in men and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.64-0.73) in women for hard ASCVD (ACC/AHA), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.72) in men and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.75) in women for hard CHD (ATP-III), and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.70-0.82) in men and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.83) in women for CVD mortality (ESC).In this European population aged 55 years or older, proportions of individuals eligible for statins differed substantially among the guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline would recommend statins for nearly all men and two-thirds of women, proportions exceeding those with the ATP-III or ESC guidelines. All 3 risk models provided poor calibration and moderate to good discrimination. Improving risk predictions and setting appropriate population-wide thresholds are necessary to facilitate better clinical decision making.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2014.2632", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141676927", "source": "openalex"}

There is particular concern regarding occupational dose to the lens of the eye. This document provides recommendations for occupational radiation protection for physicians and other staff in the interventional suite. Simple methods for reducing or minimizing occupational radiation dose include: minimizing fluoroscopy time and the number of acquired images; using available patient dose reduction technologies; using good imaging‐chain geometry; collimating; avoiding high‐scatter areas; using protective shielding; using imaging equipment whose performance is controlled through a quality assurance programme; and wearing personal dosimeters so that you know your dose. Effective use of these methods requires both appropriate education and training in radiation protection for all interventional cardiology personnel, and the availability of appropriate protective tools and equipment. Regular review and investigation of personnel monitoring results, accompanied as appropriate by changes in how procedures are performed and equipment used, will ensure continual improvement in the practice of radiation protection in the interventional suite. These recommendations for occupational radiation protection in interventional cardiology and electrophysiology have been endorsed by the Asian Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, the Latin American Society of Interventional Cardiology, and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.24694", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167342171", "source": "openalex"}

Their usefulness is limited by their cardiotoxicity. Sequential monitoring of cardiac function of patients undergoing chemotherapy allows identification of subclinical cardiotoxicity. In many patients monitoring can thus guide the modification of the chemotherapy to minimize cumulative cardiotoxicity, reducing acute and long-term clinical and subclinical sequelae. Such monitoring also aids in the comparison of cardiotoxicity produced by different drugs and different methods and schedules of drug administration. The considerable variability of monitoring regimens between institutions and in the literature has detracted from its usefulness.

One group (116 students) used the CPS during a fourth-year cardiology elective, while another group (92 students) completed a cardiology elective that did not include use of the CPS. There were no differences between the two groups on a multiple-choice test on cardiology and a skills test on the CPS at the beginning of the clerkship. After the clerkship, the students in the CPS group achieved significantly higher scores on a multiple-choice test, a skills test on the CPS, and a skills test on cardiology patients. Both the students and faculty members expressed very favorable attitudes toward the CPS, but the patients perceived no differences between the two student groups. These data demonstrate that the CPS enhances learning both the knowledge and the skills necessary to perform a bedside cardiovascular evaluation and that the skills obtained from use of the simulator are transferable to use with patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-198709000-00005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2073347428", "source": "openalex"}

Heart failure guidelines stress the importance of patient education on treatment adherence, lifestyle changes, symptom monitoring and adequate response to possible deterioration. Self‐care is related to medical and person‐centred outcomes in patients with heart failure such as better quality of life as well as lower mortality and readmission rates. Although guidelines give general direction for self‐care advice, health care professionals working with patients with heart failure need more specific recommendations. The aim of the management recommendations in this paper is to provide practical advice for health professionals delivering care to patients with heart failure. Recommendations for nutrition, physical activity, medication adherence, psychological status, sleep, leisure and travel, smoking, immunization and preventing infections, symptom monitoring, and symptom management are consistent with information from guidelines, expert consensus documents, recent evidence and expert opinion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3087672497", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2139237256", "title": "Impact of Telemedicine on the Practice of Pediatric Cardiology in Community Hospitals", "text": "Background. Tele-echocardiography has the potential to bring real-time diagnoses to neonatal facilities without in-house pediatric cardiologists. Many neonates in rural areas, smaller cities, and community hospitals do not have immediate access to pediatric sonographers or echocardiogram interpretation by pediatric cardiologists. This can result in suboptimal echocardiogram quality, delay in initiation of medical intervention, unnecessary patient transport, and increased medical expenditures. Telemedicine has been used with increased frequency to improve efficiency of pediatric cardiology care in hospitals that are not served by pediatric cardiologists. Initial reports suggest that telecardiology is accurate, improves patient care, is cost-effective, enhances echocardiogram quality, and prevents unnecessary transports of neonates in locations that are not served by pediatric cardiologists. Objective. We report the largest series to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on delivery of pediatric cardiac care in community hospitals. We hypothesized that live telemedicine guidance and interpretation of neonatal echocardiograms from community hospitals is accurate, improves patient care, enhances sonographer proficiency, allows for more efficient physician time management, increases patient referrals, and does not result in increased utilization of echocardiography. Methods. Using desktop videoconferencing computers, pediatric cardiologists guided and interpreted pediatric echocardiograms from 2 community hospital nurseries 15 miles from a tertiary care center. Studies were transmitted in real-time using the H.320 videoconferencing protocol over 3 integrated services digital network lines (384 kilobits per second). This resulted in a frame rate of 23 to 30 frames per second. Sonographers who primarily scanned adult patients but had received additional training in echocardiography of infants performed the echocardiograms. Additional views were suggested as deemed necessary by the interpreting physician, and interpretations were made during the videoconference. The results of the echocardiogram and recommendations for patient care were communicated to the referring physician over the telemedicine system. Analyses of accuracy, patient treatment, echocardiogram quality, time to diagnosis, pediatric cardiologist practice time management, patient referral patterns, and echocardiography utilization were conducted prospectively. Results. A total of 500 studies in 364 patients were transmitted during a 30-month period. The most common indication for echocardiography was to rule out congenital heart disease (208 of 500 studies). Signs and symptoms that prompted this concern included cyanosis, murmur, tachypnea, genetic syndrome, arrhythmia, abnormal fetal echocardiogram, and maternal diabetes. Other indications included suspected patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; 182 of 500 studies), intracardiac clot or catheter position, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and hemodynamic instability. Cardiac diagnoses included complex congenital heart disease (n = 16), noncritical heart disease (n = 107), and PDA (n = 86). Additional diagnoses included persistent pulmonary hypertension (n = 12), septal hypertrophy (n = 18), right atrial mass/clot/vegetation (n = 11), and decreased cardiac function (n = 6). An umbilical venous catheter was visualized in the left atrium in 9% (45 of 500) of all studies. No significant abnormalities were found in 244 studies. Major diagnoses were confirmed by subsequent review of videotape in all studies. Comparison of final videotape interpretation to initial telemedicine diagnosis resulted in 1 minor diagnostic change (membranous versus inlet ventricular septal defect). Echocardiograms were performed in subsequent visits in 264 patients. The diagnosis was altered in 3 patients. Telemedicine had an immediate impact on patient care in 151 transmissions. The most common interventions were indomethacin treatment for PDA (n = 76), retraction of umbilical venous catheters from the left atrium (n = 45), inotropic or anticongestive therapy (n = 19), anticoagulation (n = 8), and prostaglandin infusion (n = 8). Nineteen patients were transported to our hospital because of the telemedicine diagnosis. Inpatient or outpatient cardiology follow-up was recommended in an additional 131 studies and did not result in any change in the initial management. The most common diagnoses in these patients were ventricular septal defect (n = 56), atrial septal defect (n = 21), septal hypertrophy (n = 9), intracardiac thrombosis (n = 8), and pulmonary valve stenosis (n = 4). We speculate that the immediate availability of an echocardiographic diagnosis likely prevented unnecessary transport in 14 cases. Recommendations for additional views or adjustment of echocardiography machine settings were made in 95% of transmissions. Real-time guidance was especially helpful in suprasternal notch and subcostal sagittal imaging. Depth, color Doppler sector size, and color Doppler scale were frequently adjusted from routine adult settings during the teleconference. The average time from request for echocardiogram to completion of the videoconference was 28 ± 14 minutes. This was significantly shorter than the waiting time (12 ± 16 hours) for the videotape to be delivered by courier. Telemedicine eliminated the need for consultation in 194 cases and allowed the cardiologist to delay the visit until the end of the day in an additional 26 cases. This resulted in average time savings of 4.2 person-hours/wk based on travel and consultation time. Utilization of echocardiography was similar before (35 of 1000 births) and after (33 of 1000 to 43 of 1000) telemedicine installation. The percentage of neonatal echocardiograms that were interpreted by our practice increased from 63% to 81% at 1 hospital and from 0% to 100% at the other hospital. Conclusion. Real-time transmission of neonatal echocardiograms from community hospitals over 3 integrated services digital network lines is accurate and has the potential to improve patient care, enhance echocardiogram quality, aid sonographer education, and have a positive impact on referral patterns and time management without increasing the utilization of echocardiography.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.109.1.e3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139237256", "source": "openalex"}

Ischaemic postconditioning is a simple and safe manoeuvre, but because reperfusion injury is initiated within minutes of reflow, postconditioning must be applied at the onset of reperfusion. The mechanisms of protection by postconditioning include: formation and release of several autacoids and cytokines; maintained acidosis during early reperfusion; activation of protein kinases; preservation of mitochondrial function, most strikingly the attenuation of opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Exogenous recruitment of some of the identified signalling steps can induce cardioprotection when applied at the time of reperfusion in animal experiments, but more recently cardioprotection was also observed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial. Indeed, studies in patients with an acute myocardial infarction showed a reduction of infarct size and improved left ventricular function when they underwent ischaemic postconditioning or pharmacological inhibition of MPTP opening during interventional reperfusion. Further animal studies and large-scale human studies are needed to determine whether patients with different co-morbidities and co-medications respond equally to protection by postconditioning. Also, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms must be improved to develop new therapeutic strategies to be applied at reperfusion with the ultimate aim of limiting the burden of ischaemic heart disease and potentially providing protection for other organs at risk of reperfusion injury, such as brain and kidney.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvq129", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087126389", "source": "openalex"}

This report represents a similar gambit (the 'Sicilian Gambit') on the part of a group of basic and clinical investigators who met in Taormina, Sicily, to consider the classification of antiarrhythmic drugs. Paramount to their considerations were (1) dissatisfaction with the options offered by existing classification systems for inspiring and directing research, development and therapy, (2) the disarray in the field of antiarrhythmic drug development and testing in this post-CAST era, and (3) the desire to provide an operational framework for consideration of antiarrhythmic drugs that will both encourage advancement and have the plasticity to grow as a result of the advances that occur. The multifaceted approach suggested is, like the title of the manuscript, a gambit. It is an opening rather than a compendium, and is intended to challenge thought and investigation rather than to resolve issues. The manuscript incorporates first, a discussion of the shortcomings of the present system for drug classification; second, a review of the molecular targets on which drugs act (including channels and receptors); third, a consideration of the mechanisms responsible for arrhythmias, including the identification of 'vulnerable parameters' that might be most accessible to drug effect; and finally, clinical considerations with respect to antiarrhythmic drugs. Information relating to the various levels of information is correlated across categories (i.e., clinical arrhythmias, cellular mechanisms and molecular targets), and a 'spread sheet' approach to antiarrhythmic action is presented that considers each drug as a unit, with similarities to and dissimilarities from other drugs being highlighted.

Although other cytokines have been shown to enhance angiogenesis in vivo, FGF-2 and VEGF have been most widely studied and may serve as prototype proangiogenic drugs. Currently, several delivery techniques that are clinically applicable are being studied with respect to tissue distribution and retention as well as angiogenic efficacy of FGF-2 and VEGF. Although tissue distribution and retention of FGF-2 after intramyocardial injection compares favorably with other routes of administration, efficacy studies are not yet conclusive. At the same time, different protein- and gene-based formulations are being investigated.

Turner syndrome has been proposed as an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease that manifests as congenital heart disease, aortic dilation and dissection, valvular heart disease, hypertension, thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Risk stratification is unfortunately not straightforward because risk markers derived from the general population inadequately identify the subset of females with Turner syndrome who will suffer events. A high prevalence of endocrine disorders adds to the complexity, exacerbating cardiovascular prognosis. Mounting knowledge about the prevalence and interplay of cardiovascular and endocrine disease in Turner syndrome is paralleled by improved understanding of the genetics of the X-chromosome in both normal health and disease.

In addition, interventional cardiologists have an exposure per head per year two to three times higher than that of radiologists. The most active and experienced interventional cardiologists in high volume cath labs have an annual exposure equivalent to around 5 mSv per head and a professional lifetime attributable to excess cancer risk on the order of magnitude of 1 in 100. Cardiologists are the contemporary radiologists but sometimes imperfectly aware of the radiological dose of the examination they prescribe or practice, which can range from the equivalent of 1-60 mSv around a reference dose average of 10-15 mSv for a percutaneous coronary intervention, a cardiac radiofrequency ablation, a multi-detector coronary angiography, or a myocardial perfusion imaging scintigraphy. A good cardiologist cannot be afraid of life-saving radiation, but must be afraid of radiation unawareness and negligence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-7120-9-35", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145586727", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2073453419", "title": "2015 Guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology and the Taiwan Hypertension Society for the Management of Hypertension", "text": "It has been almost 5 years since the publication of the 2010 hypertension guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC). There is new evidence regarding the management of hypertension, including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials, post-hoc analyses, subgroup analyses, retrospective studies, cohort studies, and registries. More recently, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published joint hypertension guidelines in 2013. The panel members who were appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC) also published the 2014 JNC report. Blood pressure (BP) targets have been changed; in particular, such targets have been loosened in high risk patients. The Executive Board members of TSOC and the Taiwan Hypertension Society (THS) aimed to review updated information about the management of hypertension to publish an updated hypertension guideline in Taiwan. We recognized that hypertension is the most important risk factor for global disease burden. Management of hypertension is especially important in Asia where the prevalence rate grows faster than other parts of the world. In most countries in East Asia, stroke surpassed coronary heart disease (CHD) in causing premature death. A diagnostic algorithm was proposed, emphasizing the importance of home BP monitoring and ambulatory BP monitoring for better detection of night time hypertension, early morning hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and masked hypertension. We disagreed with the ESH/ESH joint hypertension guidelines suggestion to loosen BP targets to <140/90 mmHg for all patients. We strongly disagree with the suggestion by the 2014 JNC report to raise the BP target to <150/90 mmHg for patients between 60-80 years of age. For patients with diabetes, CHD, chronic kidney disease who have proteinuria, and those who are receiving antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention, we propose BP targets of <130/80 mmHg in our guidelines. BP targets are <140/90 mmHg for all other patient groups, except for patients ≥80 years of age in whom a BP target of <150/90 mmHg would be optimal. For the management of hypertension, we proposed a treatment algorithm, starting with life style modification (LSM) including S-ABCDE (Sodium restriction, Alcohol limitation, Body weight reduction, Cigarette smoke cessation, Diet adaptation, and Exercise adoption). We emphasized a low-salt strategy instead of a no-salt strategy, and that excessively aggressive sodium restriction to <2.0 gram/day may be harmful. When drug therapy is considered, a strategy called \"PROCEED\" was suggested (Previous experience, Risk factors, Organ damage, Contraindications or unfavorable conditions, Expert's or doctor's judgment, Expenses or cost, and Delivery and compliance issue). To predict drug effects in lowering BP, we proposed the \"Rule of 10\" and \"Rule of 5\". With a standard dose of any one of the 5 major classes of anti-hypertensive agents, one can anticipate approximately a 10-mmHg decrease in systolic BP (SBP) (Rule of 10) and a 5-mmHg decrease in diastolic BP (DBP) (Rule of 5). When doses of the same drug are doubled, there is only a 2-mmHg incremental decrease in SBP and a 1-mmHg incremental decrease in DBP. Preferably, when 2 drugs with different mechanisms are to be taken together, the decrease in BP is the sum of the decrease of the individual agents (approximately 20 mmHg in SBP and 10 mmHg in DBP). Early combination therapy, especially single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended. When patient's initial treatment cannot get BP to targeted goals, we have proposed an adjustment algorithm, \"AT GOALs\" (Adherence, Timing of administration, Greater doses, Other classes of drugs, Alternative combination or SPC, and LSM + Laboratory tests). Treatment of hypertension in special conditions, including treatment of resistant hypertension, hypertension in women, and perioperative management of hypertension, were also mentioned. The TSOC/THS hypertension guidelines provide the most updated information available in the management of hypertension. The guidelines are not mandatory, and members of the task force fully realize that treatment of hypertension should be individualized to address each patient's circumstances. Ultimately, the decision of the physician decision remains of the utmost importance in hypertension management.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2014.11.005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2073453419", "source": "openalex"}

As such, studying trends in interventional cardiology can be useful in exploring avenues to optimise neuro-interventional techniques. One such cardiology innovation has been the steady conversion of arterial puncture sites from transfemoral access (TFA) to transradial access (TRA), a paradigm shift supported by safety benefits for patients. While neuro-intervention has unique anatomical challenges, the access itself is identical. As such, examining the extensive cardiology literature on the radial approach has the potential to offer valuable lessons for the neuro-interventionalist audience who may be unfamiliar with this body of work. Therefore, we present here a report, particularly for neuro-interventionalists, regarding the best practices for TRA by reviewing the relevant cardiology literature. We focused our review on the data most relevant to our audience, namely that surrounding the access itself. By reviewing the cardiology literature on metrics such as safety profiles, cost and patient satisfaction differences between TFA and TRA, as well as examining the technical nuances of the procedure and post-procedural care, we hope to give physicians treating complex cerebrovascular disease a broader data-driven understanding of TRA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013295", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2758775937", "source": "openalex"}

Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate for differences in trend in use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT use in hierarchical logistic regression models. Participants were a population-based sample of 1 105 356 preguideline patients (2 431 192 patient encounters) and 1 116 472 postguideline patients (2 377 219 patient encounters). Approximately 97% of patients had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).Moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT use before and after publication of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline.Time trend in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT.In the study cohort, the mean (SD) age was 69.6 (12.1) years among 1 105 356 patients (40.2% female) before publication of the guideline and 70.0 (11.9) years among 1 116 472 patients (39.8% female) after publication of the guideline. Although there was a trend toward increasing use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statins overall and in the ASCVD cohort, such a trend was already present before publication of the guideline. No significant difference in trend in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statins was observed in other groups. The use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin therapy was 62.1% (before publication of the guideline) and 66.6% (after publication of the guideline) in the overall cohort, 62.7% (before publication) and 67.0% (after publication) in the ASCVD cohort, 50.6% (before publication) and 52.3% (after publication) in the cohort with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (ie, ≥190 mg/dL), 52.4% (before publication) and 55.2% (after publication) in the diabetes cohort, and 41.9% (before publication) and 46.9% (after publication) in the remaining group with 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. In hierarchical logistic regression models, there was a significant increase in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statins in the overall cohort (4.8%) and in the ASCVD cohort (4.3%) (P < .01 for slope for both). There was no significant change for other risk cohorts. Nonstatin LLT use remained unchanged in the preguideline and postguideline periods in the hierarchical logistic regression models for all of the risk groups.Adoption of the 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management Guideline in cardiology practices was modest.

Design: Cross-sectional assessment of housestaff performance on three valvular abnormality simulations conducted on the cardiology patient simulator, \"Harvey.\" Evaluations were done at the beginning (session I) and end (session II) of the academic year. Setting: Duke University Medical Center internal medicine training program. Subjects: Sixty-three (59%) of 107 eligible internal medicine housestaff (postgraduate years 1 through 3) agreed to participate and completed session I; 60 (95%) completed session II. Measurements: All volunteers were tested on three preprogrammed simulations (mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation). Results: The overall correct response rates for all housestaff were 52% for mitral regurgitation, 37% for mitral stenosis, and 54% for aortic regurgitation. No difference was noted in correct response rates between sessions I and II. For mitral regurgitation, correct assessment of the contour of the holosystolic murmur predicted a correct diagnosis (P = 0.002). For mitral stenosis, identification of an opening snap and proper characterization of the mitral area diastolic murmur predicted a correct diagnosis (P < 0.0001). No individual observations were noted for the aortic regurgitation simulation, whose identification by the housestaff was associated with a correct diagnosis. Conclusions: Housestaff had difficulty establishing a correct diagnosis for simulations of three common valvular heart diseases.

The study enrolled 2,675 patients from 164 hospitals with an average of 2.4 years of follow-up. Patients with preserved EF (EF ≥50% by echocardiography; n=429) were more likely to be older, female, have hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and less likely to have ischemic etiology compared with those with reduced EF (EF <40%; n=985). Unadjusted risk of in-hospital mortality (6.5% vs 3.9%; P=0.03) and post-discharge mortality (22.7% vs 17.8%; P=0.058) was slightly higher in patients with preserved EF, which, however, were not different after multivariable adjustment.

The foundation of preventive cardiology begins with assessing baseline ASCVD risk using global risk scores based on standard office-based measures. Persons at low risk are generally recommended for lifestyle management only and those at highest risk are recommended for both lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy. Additional \"risk enhancing\" factors, including both traditional risk factors and novel biomarkers and inflammatory factors can be used to further assess ASCVD risk, especially in those at borderline or intermediate risk. There are also female-specific risk enhancers, social determinants of health, and considerations for high-risk ethnic groups. Screening for subclinical atherosclerosis, especially with the use of coronary calcium screening, can further inform the treatment decision if uncertain based on the above strategies. Persons with pre-existing ASCVD also have variable risk, affected by the number of major ASCVD events, whether recurrent events have occurred recently, and the presence of other major risk factors or high-risk conditions. Current guidelines define high to very high risk ASCVD accordingly. Accurate ASCVD risk assessment is crucial for the appropriate targeting of preventive therapies to reduce ASCVD risk. Finally, the clinician-patient risk discussion focusing on lifestyle management and the risks and benefits of evidence-based pharmacologic therapies to best lower ASCVD risk is central to this process. This clinical practice statement provides the preventive cardiology specialist with guidance and tools for assessment of ASCVD risk with the goal of appropriately targeting treatment approaches for prevention of ASCVD events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100335", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220696966", "source": "openalex"}

Compared with prior guidelines, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guideline recommends lower blood pressure thresholds for defining hypertension, for initiating antihypertensive medication, and for antihypertensive medication treatment goals. Methods and Results To better understand potential impacts of the 2017 guideline, we studied trends in mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure , prevalence and burden of hypertension, and proportion of controlled hypertension in the US adult population aged ≥20 from 1999 through 2016. We used data from 38 276 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Age‐standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased from 48.4% in 1999–2000 to 45.4% in 2015–2016. However, absolute burden of hypertension consistently increased, from 87.0 million in 1999–2000 to 108.2 million in 2015–2016. The age‐standardized proportion of controlled hypertension among adults receiving antihypertensive pharmacologic treatment increased from 1999–2000 (25.6%) to 2015–2016 (43.5%). There was not consistent improvement in control throughout the full period among non‐Hispanic blacks, individuals aged ≥60, or those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or high cardiovascular disease risk. Conclusions Based on the 2017 guideline, from 1999 to 2016, the age‐standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased and the proportion of control among those treated for hypertension improved. However, the absolute hypertension burden increased. Among those treated, the control rate did not consistently improve in all subgroups.

Hospitalized patients (n = 445) at cardiological or geriatric wards were screened for AF by two handheld ECG devices (MyDiagnostick and AliveCor). The performance of the automated algorithm of each device was evaluated against a full 12-lead or 6-lead ECG recording. All ECGs and monitor tracings were also independently reviewed in a blinded fashion by two electrophysiologists. Time investments by nurses and physicians were tracked and used to estimate cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies. Handheld recordings were not possible in 7 and 21.4% of cardiology and geriatric patients, respectively, because they were not able to hold the devices properly. Even after the exclusion of patients with an implanted device, sensitivity and specificity of the automated algorithms were suboptimal (Cardiology: 81.8 and 94.2%, respectively, for MyDiagnostick; 54.5 and 97.5%, respectively, for AliveCor; Geriatrics: 89.5 and 95.7%, respectively, for MyDiagnostick; 78.9 and 97.9%, respectively, for AliveCor). A scenario based on automated AliveCor evaluation in patients without AF history and without an implanted device proved to be the most cost-effective method, with a provider cost to identify one new AF patient of €193 and €82 at cardiology and geriatrics, respectively. The cost to detect one preventable stroke per year would be €7535 and €1916, respectively (based on average CHA2DS2-VASc of 3.9 ± 2.0 and 5.0 ± 1.5, respectively). Manual interpretation increases sensitivity, but decreases specificity, doubling the cost per detected patient, but remains cheaper than sole 12-lead ECG screening. Using AliveCor or MyDiagnostick handheld recorders requires a structured screening strategy to be effective and cost-effective in a hospital setting. It must exclude patients with implanted devices and known AF, and requires targeted additional 12-lead ECGs to optimize specificity.

Knowledge of the 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease identifies patients in higher-risk groups who are likely to have greater net benefit and lower number needed to treat for both statins and antihypertensive therapy. Current US prevention guidelines for blood pressure and cholesterol management recommend use of the pooled cohort equations to start a process of shared decision-making between clinicians and patients in primary prevention. The pooled cohort equations have been widely validated and are broadly useful for the general US clinical population. But, they may systematically underestimate risk in patients from certain racial/ethnic groups, those with lower socioeconomic status or with chronic inflammatory diseases, and overestimate risk in patients with higher socioeconomic status or who have been closely engaged with preventive healthcare services. If uncertainty remains for patients at borderline or intermediate risk, or if the patient is undecided after a patient-clinician discussion with consideration of risk enhancing factors (eg, family history), additional testing with measurement of coronary artery calcium can be useful to reclassify risk estimates and improve selection of patients for use or avoidance of statin therapy. This special report summarizes the rationale and evidence base for quantitative risk assessment, reviews strengths and limitations of existing risk scores, discusses approaches for refining individual risk estimates for patients, and provides practical advice regarding implementation of risk assessment and decision-making strategies in clinical practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000638", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2900130109", "source": "openalex"}

Behind all of this stands the individual/citizen/patient/customer, who is increasingly familiar with ICT and expects to find it supporting modern healthcare delivery, facilitating more personalized and person-centred care at the right time and in the right place. In theory, technological innovation should bring better inter-professional co-operation, information sharing, decision support, and flexibility to the healthcare system. However, there are important societal and professional constraints that reduce the impact of such innovation, including legal, ethical, and data protection issues. Healthcare professionals may be resistant to such innovation, particularly if the technologies are considered to be ‘solutions seeking a problem’ and where the evidence for the impact on quality of care is seen as less than robust. Indeed, ensuring proper integration of new technologies into the healthcare system is often difficult, requiring process redesign or ‘disruption’.6 Regulatory bodies, reimbursement authorities, and national and international political bodies often find it difficult to react quickly, or consistently, to this rapidly changing area.

Before 1981, most studies on diastolic function were performed in the catheter laboratory using invasive techniques and complex methods. Recently, radionuclide angiograms and Doppler echocardiography have been employed to measure the dynamics of filling in normal individuals and in patients with heart disease. These methods are noninvasive, easy to perform, accurate, and reproducible. It is now clear that diastolic function may be altered globally and regionally, at rest and perhaps during exercise, in many patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, these diastolic abnormalities may even appear before systolic abnormalities are identified in these patients. Thus, diastolic abnormalities may permit assessment of presence of disease early in its evolution. Whether detection and quantitation of diastolic abnormalities will permit grading of disease severity or evaluation of therapeutic efficacy remains an important research question. At the present time, it appears that the decision to employ either radionuclide angiography or Doppler echocardiography for the assessment of diastolic abnormalities will depend on the local expertise to carry out the investigation. Both diagnostic modalities require standardization of accuracy and reproducibility with proper selection of control values from the appropriate populations of normal individuals. It is also important to remember that left ventricular diastolic abnormalities have to be identified after the elimination of the confounding influence of variables such as ejection fraction, heart rate, age, and preload (end-diastolic volume). Automation of the derivation of indexes of diastolic filling should provide an objective assessment of the dynamics of left ventricular filling. Although the value of measurement of diastolic filling in the individual patient remains controversial, we believe that the practice of cardiology is incomplete without consideration of the second half of cardiac function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1988.00380010103010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056887427", "source": "openalex"}

CR programs reduce morbidity and mortality rates in adults with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or cardiac surgery but are significantly underused, with only a minority of eligible patients participating in CR in the United States. New delivery strategies are urgently needed to improve participation. One potential strategy is home-based CR (HBCR). In contrast to center-based CR services, which are provided in a medically supervised facility, HBCR relies on remote coaching with indirect exercise supervision and is provided mostly or entirely outside of the traditional center-based setting. Although HBCR has been successfully deployed in the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, most US healthcare organizations have little to no experience with such programs. The purpose of this scientific statement is to identify the core components, efficacy, strengths, limitations, evidence gaps, and research necessary to guide the future delivery of HBCR in the United States. Previous randomized trials have generated low- to moderate-strength evidence that HBCR and center-based CR can achieve similar improvements in 3- to 12-month clinical outcomes. Although HBCR appears to hold promise in expanding the use of CR to eligible patients, additional research and demonstration projects are needed to clarify, strengthen, and extend the HBCR evidence base for key subgroups, including older adults, women, underrepresented minority groups, and other higher-risk and understudied groups. In the interim, we conclude that HBCR may be a reasonable option for selected clinically stable low- to moderate-risk patients who are eligible for CR but cannot attend a traditional center-based CR program.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000663", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4241245665", "source": "openalex"}

We scrutinized the role of peripheral (i.e. not related to coronary circulation) noninvasive vascular biomarkers for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Most of the biomarkers examined fit within the concept of early vascular aging. Biomarkers that fulfill most of the criteria and, therefore, are close to being considered a clinical surrogate endpoint are carotid ultrasonography, ankle-brachial index and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity; biomarkers that fulfill some, but not all of the criteria are brachial ankle pulse wave velocity, central haemodynamics/wave reflections and C-reactive protein; biomarkers that do no not at present fulfill essential criteria are flow-mediated dilation, endothelial peripheral arterial tonometry, oxidized LDL and dysfunctional HDL.

We collected a cumulative radiological history from a structured questionnaire and access to hospital records in 50 consecutive adult patients (36 males; age, 66.7+/-10.8 years) admitted to the Institute of Clinical Physiology in Pisa. The cumulative effective dose was assessed as an indicator of stochastic risk of cancer. We derived the effective dose for each individual examination from the Medical Imaging Guidelines of the European Commission (2001). On average, each patient underwent a median of 36 examinations (interquartile range, 23-46). The median cumulative effective dose was 60.6 mSv. Three types of procedures were responsible for approximately 86% of the total collective effective dose: (i) arteriography and interventional cardiology (12% of examinations, 48% of average dose per patient); (ii) nuclear medicine (5% of examinations, 21% of average dose per patient); and (iii) CT (4% of examinations, 17% of average dose per patient). The median estimated extra risk of cancer was approximately 1 in 200 exposed subjects. In conclusion, the average contemporary cardiological patient is exposed to a significant cumulative effective dose from diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

There are ample correlates of ischemic preconditioning in the clinical realm. Preconditioning mimetic agents that stimulate the biochemical pathways of ischemic preconditioning and protect the heart without inducing ischemia have been examined in numerous experimental studies. However, despite the effectiveness of ischemic preconditioning and preconditioning mimetics for protecting ischemic myocardium, there are no preconditioning-based therapies that are routinely used in clinical medicine at the current time. Part of the problem is the need to administer therapy prior to the known ischemic event. Other issues are that percutaneous coronary intervention technology has advanced so far (with the development of stents and drug-eluting stents) that ischemic preconditioning or preconditioning mimetics have not been needed in most interventional cases. Recent clinical trials such as AMISTAD I and II (Acute Myocardial Infarction STudy of ADenosine) suggest that some preconditioning mimetics may reduce myocardial infarct size when given along with reperfusion or, as in the IONA trial, have benefit on clinical events when administered chronically in patients with known coronary artery disease. It is possible that some of the benefit described for adenosine in the AMISTAD 1 and 2 trials represents a manifestation of the recently described postconditioning phenomenon. It is probable that postconditioning – in which reperfusion is interrupted with brief coronary occlusions and reperfusion sequences – is more likely than preconditioning to be feasible as a clinical application to patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.01.012", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153834892", "source": "openalex"}

Patients were identified from 4 sources, ie, a monthly log of patient encounters maintained by the consultation service, encounter forms submitted to the billing office, consultation notes maintained in a central file, and a departmental list of echocardiography studies. Patients who required clearance for noncardiac surgical procedures were generally evaluated in the cardiology clinic and not by the consultation service. Patient data were obtained from consultation and echocardiography reports and from hospital computer-based records for discharge summaries for inpatient admissions, emergency department encounter summaries, and laboratory reports. For each patient, consultations were tabulated as separate encounters if they occurred on different days in the emergency department, during separate admissions, or for different clinical concerns during a single admission.A total of 2071 consultations were performed for 1724 patients. The age at the time of consultation was 6.6 +/- 9.3 years (median: 1.2 years; range: 1 day to 60.6 years). A total of 1507 patients (87.4%) had a single consultation; 217 patients (12.6%) had multiple encounters, ranging from 2 to 9, accounting for 564 consultations (27.2%). Clinical concerns included murmurs (18.5%), cardiac function (12.7%), arrhythmias (12.7%), intercurrent illnesses among cardiac patients (11.3%), cyanosis (6.3%), syndromes (5.7%), chest pain (5.2%), syncope/dizziness (4.5%), subacute endocarditis (4.4%), follow-up evaluations of fetal diagnoses (4.3%), Kawasaki disease (3.4%), cor pulmonale (3%), recent cardiac surgery or catheterization (1.6%), cerebrovascular accidents (1.2%), and miscellaneous conditions. Four diagnoses accounted for 91% of murmur evaluations, ie, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, innocent murmurs, and pulmonary branch murmur of infancy. The most common murmur diagnosis in the neonatal intensive care unit was patent ductus arteriosus (68%), in the well-child nursery was ventricular septal defect (64%), and on the medical ward was innocent murmur (62%). The most common basis for evaluation of function was oncologic disease. Among patients evaluated for function, there were 3 new diagnoses of structural congenital heart disease, all involving neonates with aortic arch obstruction. Approximately two-thirds of arrhythmias were supraventricular in origin. The most common arrhythmias requiring treatment were supraventricular tachycardia and atrial flutter/fibrillation, the latter occurring mainly among older patients with structural heart disease. Diagnoses made with fetal echocardiography accounted for 14.3% of newborn consultations and included 83% of patients with cyanotic cardiac disease. Three syndromes accounted for 57% of consultations for this indication, ie, VACTERL association (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, congenital heart disease, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal abnormality, and limb anomalies), trisomy 21, and infant of diabetic mother. Chest pain and syncope/dizziness were frequently evaluated in the emergency department and, in this setting, accounted for 13 and 10% of all evaluations and 19 and 25% of evaluations for new patients, respectively. For patients evaluated for chest pain, the most common basis was musculoskeletal/costochondritic (42%) or idiopathic (22%). There was a cardiac or pericardial basis in 11% of cases; these patients either had known heart disease associated with this complication or systemic symptoms, abnormal cardiac auscultatory findings, and electrocardiographic features of pericarditis. Syncope/dizziness most commonly had a vasovagal (50.5%) or orthostatic (24.7%) basis. There was a cardiac basis in 5.4% of cases; these patients were more likely to have symptoms associated with exercise. Although endocarditis was a frequent clinical concern (91 patients), only 3 cases were identified, involving 2 patients with structural heart disease and 1 neonate with an indwelling intracardiac catheter. Two other patients had central venous lines, intravascular thrombus, and fungemia. Kawasaki disease was the most common acquired condition leading to consultation. Cor pulmonale was most commonly screened among patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, chronic lung disease of prematurity, pneumonitis, reactive airway disease, or cystic fibrosis. Patients with recent cardiac surgery or cardiac catheterization typically had postpericardiotomy syndrome or complications associated with vascular access. Approximately 20% of cases of cerebrovascular accidents had a cardiac basis.Although a variety of conditions were assessed, some were encountered more frequently.

Some old school paediatric cardiologists may still exist, but the new breed of trainees represents a more modern range of junior doctors, and more women are appointed as consultants than in the past. The specialty has begun to branch into specific areas of expertise: some doctors are mainly interventionalists working in the catheter laboratory, but others specialise in imaging (echocardiography, including fetal and magnetic resonance imaging). So if you are one of those doctors who enjoy using their surgical skills but who also enjoy practising medicine, this is an ideal job. For those who do not want to spend a lot of time in the catheter laboratory, there are lots of other interesting and challenging areas. Despite some adverse publicity over the past few years, the specialty remains one of the most rewarding.

Frailty increases cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality both in patients with or without known CV disease. Though the recognition of this additional risk factor has become increasingly clinically relevant in CV diseases, uncertainty remains about operative definitions, screening, assessment, and management of frailty. Since the burdens of frailty components and domains may vary in the various CV diseases and clinical settings, the relevance of specific frailty-related aspects may be different. Understanding these issues may allow general cardiologists a clearer focus on frailty in CV diseases and thereby make more tailored clinical decisions and therapeutic choices in outpatients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a registry of consecutive in- and outpatients with AF presenting to cardiologists in nine participating ESC countries. All patients with an ECG-documented diagnosis of AF confirmed in the year prior to enrolment were eligible. We enroled a total of 3119 patients from February 2012 to March 2013, with full data on clinical subtype available for 3049 patients (40.4% female; mean age 68.8 years). Common comorbidities were hypertension, coronary disease, and heart failure. Lone AF was present in only 3.9% (122 patients). Asymptomatic AF was common, particularly among those with permanent AF. Amiodarone was the most common antiarrhythmic agent used (∼20%), while beta-blockers and digoxin were the most used rate control drugs. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) were used in 80% overall, most often vitamin K antagonists (71.6%), with novel OACs being used in 8.4%. Other antithrombotics (mostly antiplatelet therapy, especially aspirin) were still used in one-third of the patients, and no antithrombotic treatment in only 4.8%. Oral anticoagulants were used in 56.4% of CHA2DS2-VASc = 0, with 26.3% having no antithrombotic therapy. A high HAS-BLED score was not used to exclude OAC use, but there was a trend towards more aspirin use in the presence of a high HAS-BLED score. CONCLUSION: The EURObservational Research Programme Atrial Fibrillation (EORP-AF) Pilot Registry has provided systematic collection of contemporary data regarding the management and treatment of AF by cardiologists in ESC member countries. Oral anticoagulant use has increased, but novel OAC use was still low. Compliance with the treatment guidelines for patients with the lowest and higher stroke risk scores remains suboptimal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/eut373", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2128413398", "source": "openalex"}

Considerable heterogeneity in the access to invasive arrhythmia therapies still exists across the five geographical ESC regions. In 2016, the device implantation rates per million population were 3-6 times higher in the Western region than in the non-European and Eastern ESC member countries. Catheter ablation activity was highest in the Western countries followed by the Northern and Southern areas. In the non-European countries, atrial fibrillation ablation rate was more than tenfold lower than in the European countries. On the other hand, the growth rate over the past ten years was highest in the non-European and Eastern countries. In some Eastern European countries with relative low gross domestic product the procedure rates exceeded the average values. It was encouraging to note that during the past decade the growth in invasive arrhythmia therapies was greatest in the areas historically with relatively low activity. Nevertheless, there is substantial disparity and continued efforts are needed to improve harmonization of cardiac arrhythmia therapies in the ESC area.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/eux258", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2762921444", "source": "openalex"}

A policy statement from the European Society of Cardiology", "text": "Reperfusion therapy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most important component of treatment, as it strongly influences short- and long-term patient outcome. The main objective of healthcare providers should be to achieve at least 75% of reperfusion therapy applied to patients suffering from STEMI in a timely manner, and preferably within the first 3 h after onset of symptoms. Establishing networks of reperfusion at regional and national level, implying close collaboration between all the actors involved in reperfusion therapy, namely hospitals, departments of cardiology, PCI centres, emergency medical systems (EMS), (para)medically staffed ambulances, private cardiologists, primary care physicians, etc., is a key issue. All forms of reperfusion, depending on local facilities, need to be available to patients. Protocols must be written and agreed for the strategy of reperfusion to be applied within a network. Early diagnosis of STEMI is essential and is best achieved by rapid ECG recording and interpretation at first medical contact, wherever this contact takes place (hospital or ambulance). Tele-transmission of ECG for immediate interpretation by experienced cardiologists is an alternative. Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion option if it can be performed by experienced staff within 90 min after first medical contact. Thrombolytic treatment, administered if possible in the pre-hospital setting, is a valid option if PCI cannot be performed in a timely manner, particularly within the first 3 h following onset of symptoms. Thrombolysis is not the end of the reperfusion therapy. Rescue PCI must be performed in the case of thrombolysis failure. Next-day PCI after successful thrombolysis has been proven efficacious. Quality control is important for monitoring the efficacy of networks of reperfusion. All elements that influence time to reperfusion must be taken into account, particularly transfer delays, in-hospital delays, and door-to-balloon or door-to-needle times. The rate of reperfusion achieved must also be taken into consideration. Professional organizations such as the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) have the responsibility to impart this message to the cardiology community, and inform politicians and health authorities about the best possible strategy to achieve reperfusion therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehi673", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135227162", "source": "openalex"}

Primary angioplasty is the reperfusion method recommended by the guidelines, but requires multiple conditions that are not reached at all times. Early pharmacological reperfusion of the culprit coronary artery and early coronary angiography (pharmacoinvasive strategy) can be the solution to the logistical problem that primary angioplasty rises. Several studies have demonstrated pharmacoinvasive strategy as effective and safe as primary angioplasty ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which is postulated as the choice to follow in communities where access to PPCI is limited. The Mexico City Government together with the National Institute of Cardiology have developed a pharmaco-invasive reperfusion treatment program to ensure effective and timely reperfusion in STEMI.

Fourteen studies did not report whether matching on the propensity score balanced baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample. Only 4 studies explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for matched studies to compare baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects. Only 11 (25%) of the 44 studies explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the effect of treatment on the outcomes. Only 2 studies described the matching method used, assessed balance in baseline covariates by appropriate methods, and used appropriate statistical methods to estimate the treatment effect and its significance.

Application of the appropriate use criteria represents the first decision point as to whether an echocardiographic test should be performed. Second, there are cases in which the indication for echocardiography is appropriate or may be appropriate, but the examination is unlikely to yield clinically important information in the short term with the added risk for potential disease transmission. There are two ways to identify these studies:•Determine which studies are \"elective\" and reschedule them, performing all others.•Identify \"nonelective\" (urgent or emergent) indications and to defer all others. In cases considered for deferral, there is no significant risk to patients in terms of morbidity or mortality and no expected benefit in terms of avoiding the use of medical resources (such as emergency department visits or hospitalizations). These tests should be postponed. Next, it is important to determine the clinical benefit of echocardiography for symptomatic patients whose SARS-CoV-2 status is unknown. Knowing the status of a patient allows the appropriate application of PPE and its conservation when not needed, in addition to reducing the exposure risk to echocardiography personnel. TEE carries a heightened risk for spread of the SARS-CoV-2, because it may provoke aerosolization of a large amount of virus because of coughing or gagging that may result during the examination. TEE therefore deserves special consideration in determining when and whether this examination should be performed and under what precautions (described below). A cautious consideration of the benefit of TEE should be weighed against the risk for exposure of health care personnel to aerosolization in a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the use of PPE. TEE should be postponed or canceled if an alternative imaging modality (e.g., off-axis TTE, ultrasound-enhancing agent with TTE) can provide the necessary information. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI have emerged as alternatives to TEE for the exclusion of left atrial appendage thrombus before cardioversion.9Guglielmo M. Baggiano A. Muscogiuri G. Fusini L. Andreini D. Mushtaq S. et al.Multimodality imaging of left atrium in patients with atrial fibrillation.J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr. 2019; 13: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar The use of these tests to avoid an aerosolizing procedure should be balanced against the risk of transporting a patient through the hospital to the computed tomographic or MRI scanner, the need to disinfect the CT or MRI room, and iodinated contrast and radiation for CT and long scan times for MRI. Some institutions have dedicated computed tomographic scanners reserved for patients with COVID-19. Similarly, treadmill and bicycle stress echocardiography in patients with COVID-19 may lead to exposure because of deep breathing and/or coughing during exercise. These tests should generally be deferred or converted to pharmacologic stress echocardiography. Depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, some institutions may face a crisis state with reduced availability of trained staff and/or equipment. In this setting, triage by indication may be necessary, deciding which appropriate and urgent or emergent echocardiographic studies will be performed and which will not, or deciding which will be performed first. This prioritization of indications will need to be done on a case-by-case basis, while accounting for many patient-level factors such as current indication, current clinical status, medical history, and the results of other tests. Involving referring physicians in the triage process is therefore essential. The portability of echocardiography affords a clear advantage in imaging patients without having to move them and risk virus transmission in the clinic or hospital. All forms of echocardiography (including chemical stress tests) can be performed in emergency departments, hospital wards, intensive care units, operating theaters, recovery areas, and structural heart and electrophysiology procedure laboratories, in addition to echocardiography laboratories. Identifying the optimal location for an echocardiographic study requires minimizing the risk for virus transmission but also considering monitoring capabilities and staffing of different locations. For example, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are placed in isolation rooms, and echocardiography performed in the patient's room can prevent transit to other areas of the hospital, risking wider exposure. However, it may not be possible to perform TEE or stress echocardiography in the room, because of staffing or insufficient monitoring equipment. In the outpatient setting, patients should be screened for infection according to local protocols and methods for quarantine. Some institutions have set aside separate rooms and separate machines for patients with suspected or confirmed infection. Cardiac imaging is performed by a wide variety of operators using a wide variety of machines and a wide variety of protocols. Ultrasound-assisted physical examination (UAPE), point-of-care cardiac ultrasound (POCUS), critical care echocardiography, limited and comprehensive traditional TTE, TEE, and stress echocardiography all can play a role in caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. UAPE and POCUS examinations performed by the clinicians who are already caring for these patients at bedside present an attractive option to screen for important cardiovascular findings, elucidate cardiac contributions to symptoms or signs, triage patients in need of full-feature echocardiographic services, and even, perhaps, identify early ventricular dysfunction during COVID-19 infection, all without exposing others and using additional resources. Depending on the capabilities of the machines used, images obtained by UAPE, POCUS, and critical care echocardiography practitioners can often be saved to allow remote interpretive assistance from more experienced echocardiographers. Archiving these images for review should help focus future imaging studies and provide comparisons of cardiac structure and function over time. In some cases, review of these images by a consulting cardiovascular specialist may obviate the need for echocardiography (and therefore reduce staff exposure), as pertinent clinical questions will be answered (e.g., etiology of hypotension). In other cases, they will indicate the need for more advanced imaging (e.g., wall motion and quantitative valvular assessment). Therefore, these images should be saved and archived whenever possible. Some devices use a camera that allows a sonographer or another imaging expert to remotely guide probe placement. Along the same lines, echocardiographic studies performed on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be as focused as necessary to obtain diagnostic views but should also be comprehensive enough to avoid the need to return for additional images. Each study should be tailored to the indication and planned in advance, after review of images from past examinations and other imaging modalities. Complete examinations may be necessary in some circumstances. Plans for ultrasound-enhancing agent (UEA) use should be made in advance to prevent a sonographer's having to wait for the agent to be delivered or having to use more PPE to exit the patient's room to obtain the agent. Although the safety of UEAs specifically in patients with COVID-19 has not yet been determined, they have been used and proved safe in patients in intensive care units. The use of UEAs may therefore be considered in such cases as long as the benefits in terms of diagnostic yield and scan time are favorable. Regardless of the type of study (UAPE, POCUS, critical care echocardiography, or comprehensive echocardiography), prolonged scanning can expose these clinicians to added risk. An additional consideration when performing limited TTE is the limitations that may be posed by layers of protective equipment on image quality. Therefore, these studies should not be performed by a sonography student or any other novice or inexperienced practitioner, to minimize scanning time while obtaining images of the highest possible quality. Finally, the results of the examination should be rapidly reviewed and key findings recorded immediately on the patient's record and communicated to the primary care team to allow hemodynamic management to be optimized. The group therefore recommends the following:•Echocardiographic examinations should be planned ahead, on the basis of indications, clinical information, laboratory data, and other imaging findings, to allow a focused sequence of images that help with management decisions.•The use of UEAs should be considered before an examination to avoid the need to prolong scan time while awaiting preparation of the agent.•Scan times should be minimized by excluding students or novice practitioners from performing imaging.•The imaging team should ensure rapid review and reporting of key findings in the patient's record and communicating them with the primary care team. Imaging should be performed according to local standards for the prevention of virus spread. Meticulous and frequent hand washing is crucial. At some institutions, the level of PPE required may depend on the risk level of the patient with regard to COVID-19 (minimal risk when COVID-19 is not suspected, moderate risk when it is suspected, and high risk when it is confirmed). At some institutions, suspected and confirmed cases are treated similarly. The types of PPE can be divided into levels or categories (see Table 1):•Standard care involves hand washing or hand sanitization and use of gloves. The use of a surgical face mask in this setting may also be considered.•Droplet precautions include gown, gloves, head cover, face mask, and eye shield.•Airborne precautions add special masks (e.g., N-95 or N-99 respirator masks, powered air-purifying respirator systems) and shoe covers.Table 1Precaution types and PPEHand washingGloves/double glovesIsolation gownSurgical maskN-95 or N-99 maskFace shieldPAPR systemSurgical capShoe coverStandardXXXSpecial dropletXXXX∗Surgical mask may be used for droplet precautions to conserve N-95 or N-99 respirators.X∗Surgical mask may be used for droplet precautions to conserve N-95 or N-99 respirators.XXXXAirborne†Patient location may determine level of protection (e.g., airborne precautions used for all patients in the intensive care unit setting).XXXXXXXXPAPR, Powered air -purifying respirator.This is a general guide based on current practice and recommendations at the present time and is subject to change and modification to fit local procedures and practice patterns.∗ Surgical mask may be used for droplet precautions to conserve N-95 or N-99 respirators.† Patient location may determine level of protection (e.g., airborne precautions used for all patients in the intensive care unit setting).

This is a general guide based on current practice and recommendations at the present time and is subject to change and modification to fit local procedures and practice patterns. The local application of each component of PPE can vary according to the level or type of risk for TTE and stress echocardiography, but airborne precautions are required during TEE for suspected and confirmed cases, because of the increased risk for aerosolization. Surgical face masks for patients are recommended for those who are symptomatic and undergoing surface echocardiographic examinations, provided institutional resources allow this strategy for source control.10Centers for Disease Control and PreventionStrategies for optimizing the supply of facemasks.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.htmlDate accessed: March 20, 2020Google Scholar It is important to reiterate that the type of PPE to be used in specific cases will depend on local institutional policy and resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides updated guidelines for PPE use for health care workers.4Centers for Disease Control and PreventionInterim infection prevention and control recommendations for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare settings.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.htmlDate: 2020Date accessed: March 19, 2020Google Scholar The suggested approach to performing echocardiographic procedures and level of PPE is provided in Figure 1. Equipment care is critical in the prevention of transmission. Some institutions cover probes and machine consoles with disposable plastic and forgo the use of electrocardiographic stickers. It is important to note that the benefit of using protective covers must be balanced against the potential for suboptimal images and prolongation of scan time. Some institutions set aside certain machines or probes for use on patients with suspected or confirmed infection. Although SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to most standard viricidal disinfectant solutions, care must be taken when cleaning. Local standards vary, but echocardiographic machines and probes should be thoroughly cleaned, ideally in the patient's room and again in the hallway. Smaller, laptop-sized portable machines are more easily cleaned, but use of these machines should be balanced against potential trade-offs in image quality and functionality. Please consult vendors' disinfecting guidelines, available on their websites, as procedures vary and could affect the functionality of machines. Transesophageal echocardiographic probes should undergo cleaning in the room (including the handle and cord) and then be transferred in a closed container to be immediately disinfected according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The exact steps to be followed for disinfection of the TEE probe and equipment will depend on local institutional protocols that usually are guided by infectious disease experts and resource availability. The American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine has specific guidelines for disinfection of ultrasound equipment.11American Institute for Ultrasound in MedicineGuidelines for cleaning and preparing external- and internal-use ultrasound transducers between patients & safe handling and use of ultrasound coupling gel.https://www.aium.org/officialStatements/57Date accessed: March 20, 2020Google Scholar The performance and interpretation of echocardiographic studies, especially those in suspected or confirmed COVD-19 cases, should be limited to essential personnel. For TEE, practices may vary, but there should be at most one person to handle the probe and another to operate the machine controls, along with another to administer sedation. Medical education remains important, and echocardiographic practitioners play a crucial role in teaching essential components of cardiovascular medicine, as well as scanning and interpretation skills, to a wide variety of learners. Medical and sonography students, residents, fellows, and practicing physicians gain knowledge and experience through rotations on echocardiography services, through observing the performance of studies, hands-on scanning, and reading with experts. In the current environment, however, elective rotations should be suspended, and restrictions should be placed on trainees who are not essential to clinical care. At many institutions, advanced trainees (e.g., fellows) provide crucial off-hours scanning and interpretation but must follow all applicable procedures to reduce infection transmission. Training and education can be moved \"online.\" The ASE and others provide multiple educational offerings, including webinars and lectures. A variety of simulators are available to teach scanning skills without involving patients. In addition to limiting the number of echocardiography practitioners involved in scanning, consideration should be given to limiting the exposure of staff members who may be particularly susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19. Staff members who are >60 years of age, have chronic conditions, are immunocompromised, or are pregnant may wish to avoid contact with patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, depending on local procedures. The risk for transmission also is present in reading rooms. Keyboards, monitors, mice, chairs, phones, desktops, and doorknobs should be frequently cleaned and ventilation provided wherever possible. At some institutions, the echocardiography laboratory reading room is a place where many clinical services congregate to review images. In the current environment, it may be advisable to ask these services to review images remotely while speaking with the echocardiographer-consultant by phone, or review images together in a webinar. The provision of echocardiographic services remains crucial in this difficult time of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Working together, we can continue to provide high-quality care while minimizing risk to ourselves, our patients, and the public at large. Carefully considering whom to image, where to image, and how to image has the potential to reduce the risk for transmission.

CARDIA enrolled 5115 African American and white participants aged 18 to 30 years from 4 US field centers (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California). Outcomes were available through August 2015.Using the highest BP measured from the first examination to the examination closest to, but not after, age 40 years, each participant was categorized as having normal BP (untreated systolic BP [SBP] <120 mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] <80 mm Hg; n = 2574); elevated BP (untreated SBP 120-129 mm Hg and DBP <80 mm Hg; n = 445); stage 1 hypertension (untreated SBP 130-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg; n = 1194); or stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥140 mm Hg, DBP ≥90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication; n = 638).CVD events: fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intervention for peripheral artery disease (PAD).The final cohort included 4851 adults (mean age when follow-up for outcomes began, 35.7 years [SD, 3.6]; 2657 women [55%]; 2441 African American [50%]; 206 taking antihypertensive medication [4%]). Over a median follow-up of 18.8 years, 228 incident CVD events occurred (CHD, 109; stroke, 63; heart failure, 48; PAD, 8). CVD incidence rates for normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07-1.75), 2.74 (95% CI, 1.78-4.20), 3.15 (95% CI, 2.47-4.02), and 8.04 (95% CI, 6.45-10.03) per 1000 person-years, respectively.

Although the physical examination can alert the clinician to the presence of significant regurgitation, diagnostic methods are often needed to assess the severity of valvular regurgitation and remodeling of the cardiac chambers in response to the volume overload state. Echocardiography with Doppler has recently emerged as the method of choice for the noninvasive detection and evaluation of the severity and etiology of valvular regurgitation. This article offers a critical review of echocardiographic and Doppler techniques used in the evaluation of valvular regurgitation in the adult patient, and provides recommendations for the assessment of severity of valvular regurgitation based on the scientific literature and a consensus of a panel of experts. Issues of medical management and timing of surgical intervention will not be addressed in this article, as these have been recently published[1]. Valvular regurgitation or incompetence results from various etiologies including valvular degeneration, calcification, fibrosis or infection, alteration of the valvular support apparatus or dilatation of the valve annulus. These conditions cause poor apposition of the valvular leaflets or cusps, and may lead to prolapse, flail, restricted leaflet motion or valvular perforation. With the advent of Doppler techniques that are sensitive to detection of regurgitation, trivial and physiologic valvular regurgitation, even in a structurally normal valve, is now well recognized and is noted to occur frequently in right-sided valves. The following sections describe general considerations of the role of echocardiographic and Doppler techniques in the evaluation of regurgitant lesions. ### Role of Two-dimensional echocardiography Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography allows an evaluation of the valvular structure as well as the impact of the volume overload on the cardiac chambers. Calcifications, tethering, flail motion or vegetations can be readily assessed, which can give indirect clues as to the severity of regurgitation.

A detailed questionnaire about cardiac interventions performed during 1994 was mailed to all members of the European Society of Cardiology. Incomplete or absent data from eight national members precluded their inclusion in the final analysis. Thus, this report summarizes the cardiac interventions performed during 1994 in 29 of 37 members of the European Society of Cardiology, representing a total population of approximately 490 million inhabitants.A total of 922,687 coronary angiograms were reported during 1994, representing an increase of 22% compared with 1993 and of 35% compared with 1992. The mean incidence of coronary angiograms was 1881/10(6) inhabitants, ranging from 4417/10(6) inhabitants in Germany to 35/10(6) inhabitants in Romania, Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy with 50% of the European population performed 73% of all cardiac interventions.During 1994, a total of 224,722 coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures were reported in Europe, an increase of 22% compared with 1993 and of 52% compared with 1992. Adjusted per capita, the mean incidence of coronary angioplasty was 458/10(6) inhabitants, ranging from 1091/10(6) inhabitants in Germany to 6/10(6) inhabitants in Romania. On average, the ratio PTCA per coronary angiogram was 0.24, ranging from 0.37 in the Netherlands to 0.06 in Cyprus. Ad hoc PTCA accounted for 22% of all PTCA cases. The majority (81%) of PTCAs were restricted to a single vessel. Major complications were reported in 2% of patients undergoing PTCA, including death (0.3%), myocardial infarction (1.0%) and need for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (0.7%).Coronary stents were utilized in 21,599 coronary interventions during 1994, an increase of 235% compared with 1993 and thus representing the fastest growth in interventional cardiology. The number of European countries employing stents during coronary angioplasty grew from 14 during 1993 to 24 during 1994. Elective use (38%) became the most frequent indication for coronary stenting during 1994, replacing bail-out stenting as the primary indication during 1993.Other new interventional therapeutic devices were employed in 8827 cases. Only the Rotablator was used more frequently during 1994 as compared with 1993. All other new therapeutic devices showed a decline. Coronary ultrasound was utilized in 3032 interventions and coronary angioscopy in 304 cases during 1994. NON-CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: Valvuloplasty remained the most frequent non-coronary intervention in Europe during 1994 with a total of 2622 mitral. 609 pulmonary and 506 aortic valvuloplasties.The number of facilities per 10(6) inhabitants performing invasive cardiac procedures in Europe during 1994 ranged from 7.7 in Iceland to 0.2 in Romania (European mean 2.9). The number of trained operators per 10(6) inhabitants ranged from 24 in Germany to 0.4 in Romania (European mean 10). During 1994, a mean of 701 coronary angiograms and 170 PTCAs were performed per catheterization facility in Europe (range: 1052 coronary angiograms and 293 PTCAs per facility in Norway to 218 coronary angiograms and 37 PTCAs per facility in Romania).The number of both coronary angiograms and coronary angioplasties continues to grow at an annual rate of approximately 20% in Europe. There is a wide range in the amount of revascularization procedures performed between western and eastern European countries. However, countries with the lowest numbers of coronary angiograms and coronary angioplasties, e.g. Romania, also show the fastest annual growth. About one quarter of all patients undergoing coronary angiography are subsequently revascularized by coronary angioplasty.

Each individual wore eight thermoluminescent dosemeters next to the eyes, wrists, fingers and legs during each procedure. Radiation protection shields used in each procedure were recorded.The highest doses per procedure were recorded for interventionists at the left wrist (average 485 μSv, maximum 5239 μSv) and left finger (average 324 μSv, maximum 2877 μSv), whereas lower doses were recorded for the legs (average 124 μSv, maximum 1959 μSv) and the eyes (average 64 μSv, maximum 1129 μSv). Doses to the assisting nurses during the intervention were considerably lower; the highest doses were recorded at the wrists (average 26 μSv, maximum 41 μSv) and legs (average 18 μSv, maximum 22 μSv), whereas doses to the eyes were minimal (average 4 μSv, maximum 16 μSv). Occupational doses normalised to kerma area product (KAP) ranged from 11.9 to 117.3 μSv/1000 cGy cm² and KAP was poorly correlated to the interventionists' extremity doses.Calculation of the dose burden for interventionists considering the actual number of procedures performed annually revealed that dose limits for the extremities and the lenses of the eyes were not exceeded.

Moreover, EVs of different sources may be useful biomarkers of cardiovascular disease identities. However, the methods used for the detection and isolation of EVs have several limitations and vary widely between studies, leading to uncertainties regarding the exact population of EVs studied and how to interpret the data. The number of publications in the exosome and MV field has been increasing exponentially in recent years and, therefore, in this ESC Working Group Position Paper, the overall objective is to provide a set of recommendations for the analysis and translational application of EVs focussing on the diagnosis and therapy of the ischaemic heart. This should help to ensure that the data from emerging studies are robust and repeatable, and optimize the pathway towards the diagnostic and therapeutic use of EVs in clinical studies for patient benefit.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvx211", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2765644674", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we support the view that the practical value of genetic analysis is different in the various inherited conditions and that it is strongly influenced by the amount of information available in each disease about genotype-phenotype correlations. In some diseases, clinical management of patients is profoundly affected by the type of the underlying genetic defect; therefore, in these conditions, there is a high priority to introduce genetic analysis into clinical practice. In the absence of genotype-phenotype correlations, genetic testing still can be very useful when there is a clinical advantage in establishing presymptomatic diagnosis or when screening of family members may point to reproductive counseling. Finally, there is a high priority for introducing genetic testing for those genetic diseases in which a limited number of genes allow a high yield of successfully genotyped patients. We have developed a \"score\" to compare the value of genetic testing in arrhythmogenic diseases and to convey our view that the clinical role of genetic analysis is different in the various inherited cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Healthcare authorities should become responsive to the advancement of knowledge in this field and should help facilitate access to genotyping for families affected by those conditions in which genetic analysis provides useful information for clinical management.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.105.563205", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167277251", "source": "openalex"}

Part I: primary prevention", "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodelling of the atria due to AF itself, to changes associated with ageing, and to deterioration of underlying heart disease. Current management aims at preventing the recurrence of AF and its consequences (secondary prevention) and includes risk assessment and prevention of stroke, ventricular rate control, and rhythm control therapies including antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter or surgical ablation. The concept of primary prevention of AF with interventions targeting the development of substrate and modifying risk factors for AF has emerged as a result of recent experiments that suggested novel targets for mechanism-based therapies. Upstream therapy refers to the use of non-antiarrhythmic drugs that modify the atrial substrate- or target-specific mechanisms of AF to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of the arrhythmia. Such agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly corticosteroids. Animal experiments have compellingly demonstrated the protective effect of these agents against electrical and structural atrial remodelling in association with AF. The key targets of upstream therapy are structural changes in the atria, such as fibrosis, hypertrophy, inflammation, and oxidative stress, but direct and indirect effects on atrial ion channels, gap junctions, and calcium handling are also applied. Although there have been no formal randomized controlled studies (RCTs) in the primary prevention setting, retrospective analyses and reports from the studies in which AF was a pre-specified secondary endpoint have shown a sustained reduction in new-onset AF with ACEIs and ARBs in patients with significant underlying heart disease (e.g. left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy), and in the incidence of AF after cardiac surgery in patients treated with statins. In the secondary prevention setting, the results with upstream therapies are significantly less encouraging. Although the results of hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses in selected patient categories have been positive, larger prospective RCTs have yielded controversial, mostly negative, results. Notably, the controversy exists on whether upstream therapy may impact mortality and major non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with AF. This has been addressed in retrospective analyses and large prospective RCTs, but the results remain inconclusive pending further reports. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the role of upstream therapies in primary (Part I) and secondary (Part II) prevention of AF.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/eur002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156207648", "source": "openalex"}

In 2014, the European Society of Cardiology proposed a new risk stratification method based on a risk prediction model (HCM Risk-SCD) that estimates the 5-year risk of SCD. The aim was to externally validate the 2014 European Society of Cardiology recommendations in a geographically diverse cohort of patients recruited from the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Methods: This was an observational, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. Results: The cohort consisted of 3703 patients. Seventy three (2%) patients reached the SCD end point within 5 years of follow-up (5-year incidence, 2.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.9–3.0]). The validation study revealed a calibration slope of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.93–1.12), C-index of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.68–0.72), and D-statistic of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05–1.29). In a complete case analysis (n= 2147; 44 SCD end points at 5 years), patients with a predicted 5-year risk of &lt;4% (n=1524; 71%) had an observed 5-year SCD incidence of 1.4% (95% CI, 0.8–2.2); patients with a predicted risk of ≥6% (n=297; 14%) had an observed SCD incidence of 8.9% (95% CI, 5.96–13.1) at 5 years. For every 13 (297/23) implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantations in patients with an estimated 5-year SCD risk ≥6%, 1 patient can potentially be saved from SCD. Conclusions: This study confirms that the HCM Risk-SCD model provides accurate prognostic information that can be used to target implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in patients at the highest risk of SCD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.117.030437", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2771167593", "source": "openalex"}

The main recommendations of the task force include implementation of a standardized non-clinical assessment of stents and a novel clinical evaluation pathway for market approval. The two-stage clinical evaluation plan includes recommendation for an initial pre-market trial with objective performance criteria (OPC) benchmarking using invasive imaging follow-up leading to conditional CE-mark approval and a subsequent mandatory, large-scale randomized trial with clinical endpoint evaluation leading to unconditional CE-mark.

In the last twenty years, effective lipid-lowering therapies, particularly statins, have become widely available to prevent and reverse the progression of disease. However, there is a significant gap between expected and actual benefits; this may be attributed to poor adherence to statin therapy. Objective: To define the extent, causes (including psychological aspects), consequences and management of non-adherence to statins. Methods: Literature using PubMed and Medline up to and including 30 July 2009. Results: Adherence to statin therapy is suboptimal in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Causes vary, and include patient factors (e.g., comorbidities, financial constraints, psychological issues), practitioner factors (e.g., poor knowledge of adherence, time constraints, poor communication skills and patient–doctor working alliance) and system factors (e.g., medication costs, lack of clinical monitoring, drug side effects). Non-adherence is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased costs of healthcare. A framework, based on a multidisciplinary approach, for addressing non-adherence, including managing the statin-intolerant patient, is presented. Conclusions: Non-adherence to statins is a significant issue for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Increased awareness of the causes and solutions for overcoming non-adherence, including safer prescribing, improvement in physician–patient alliance and reduction in drug costs, will enhance the cost-effectiveness of the use of statins and significantly improve patient care and outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1517/14656560903376186", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2123124749", "source": "openalex"}

Their function is reduced by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and is regained once pathological stimuli are removed. In this European Society for Cardiology Position Paper, we describe endothelial dysfunction as a spectrum of phenotypic states and advocate further studies to determine the role of EC subtypes in cardiovascular disease. We conclude that there is no single ideal method for measurement of endothelial function. Techniques to measure coronary epicardial and micro-vascular function are well established but they are invasive, time-consuming, and expensive. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial arteries provides a non-invasive alternative but is technically challenging and requires extensive training and standardization. We, therefore, propose that a consensus methodology for FMD is universally adopted to minimize technical variation between studies, and that reference FMD values are established for different populations of healthy individuals and patient groups. Newer techniques to measure endothelial function that are relatively easy to perform, such as finger plethysmography and the retinal flicker test, have the potential for increased clinical use provided a consensus is achieved on the measurement protocol used. We recommend further clinical studies to establish reference values for these techniques and to assess their ability to improve cardiovascular risk stratification. We advocate future studies to determine whether integration of endothelial function measurements with patient-specific epigenetic data and other biomarkers can enhance the stratification of patients for differential diagnosis, disease progression, and responses to therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa085", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3015197361", "source": "openalex"}

In most types of cardiac disease, the pathology develops slowly and gradually, often over many years. In contrast, arrhythmias often occur suddenly. In nonlinear systems, sudden changes in qualitative dynamics can, counterintuitively, result from a gradual change in a system parameter-this is known as a bifurcation. Here, we review how nonlinearities in cardiac electrophysiology influence normal and abnormal rhythms and how bifurcations change the dynamics. In particular, we focus on the many recent developments in computational modeling at the cellular level that are focused on intracellular calcium dynamics. We discuss two areas where recent experimental and modeling work has suggested the importance of nonlinearities in calcium dynamics: repolarization alternans and pacemaker cell automaticity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150106", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170296259", "source": "openalex"}

At the congress of the European Society of Cardiology in Amsterdam in 2000, I (PWS) was asked to give the Andreas Gruentzig Lecture. In the week preceding the lecture, we re-angiographied patients 32 and 33 of the initial cohort of patients who had received a rapamycin eluting stent in Sao Paulo and in Rotterdam. Scrutinising the 4–6 month angiographic and ultrasonic results of these patients, I became overwhelmingly convinced that we were the privileged witnesses of a new phenomenon: the almost complete abolition of intra-stent neointimal proliferation. Colleagues, invasive and non-invasive cardiologists, old friends, and financial analysts were surprised by the unusual “excess of enthusiasm” coming from somebody who has built over the years a reputation as a critical assessor, never one to be carried away by the hype of a new wave in interventional cardiology. In the history of this field I have recognised (and “got excited” by, as my American colleagues used to put it) only two revolutionary developments: the introduction of the moveable and steerable guidewire by John Simpson, and the advent of the stent (Palmaz-Schatz, Wallstent). The drug eluting stent is the third such development, and almost one year later I would like to restate the fact that we are entering a new era in interventional cardiology. Why? Because the principle of an eluting stent is sound, and because the three major technical challenges have been mastered—the controlled release of an efficient drug from a stable coating. Drug administration for the prevention of restenosis has been tested in the past—with disappointing results throughout. A proposed explanation for the repeated failure of clinical drug studies has been that agents given systematically cannot reach sufficient concentrations in injured arteries, which has a signficant impact …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heart.87.4.305", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171645153", "source": "openalex"}

Also, these guidelines strongly advocate a clinical practice shift so that the initial decision step now is the identification of ‘truly low risk’ patients, essentially those aged <65 years without any stroke risk factor (both male and female), who do not need any antithrombotic therapy.2 The ESC guidelines also recommend the use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score4 for stroke risk assessment, and define ‘low-risk’ patients as those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0 (males) or score = 1 (females). Subsequent to this initial step of identifying the low-risk patients, effective stroke prevention (which is essentially OAC) can then be offered to AF patients with ≥1 stroke risk factor(s), with treatment decisions made in consultation with patients and incorporating their preferences. In everyday clinical practice, over 80% of all patients with AF have an indication for OAC, and vascular disease co-exists in ∼30% of them.5–7 With an estimated prevalence of AF of 1–2% and ∼20% of these requiring percutaneous cardiovascular interventions over time,8 ∼1–2 million AF patients in Europe who are …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehu298", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162446501", "source": "openalex"}

Despite current therapy, the morbidity and mortality for patients with CHD remains significant. The most important manifestations of CHD arise from acute myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in terms of cardiomyocyte death and its long-term consequences. As such, new therapeutic interventions are required to protect the heart against the detrimental effects of acute IRI and improve clinical outcomes. Although a large number of cardioprotective therapies discovered in pre-clinical studies have been investigated in CHD patients, few have been translated into the clinical setting, and a significant number of these have failed to show any benefit in terms of reduced myocardial infarction and improved clinical outcomes. Because of this, there is currently no effective therapy for protecting the heart against the detrimental effects of acute IRI in patients with CHD. One major factor for this lack of success in translating cardioprotective therapies into the clinical setting can be attributed to problems with the clinical study design. Many of these clinical studies have not taken into consideration the important data provided from previously published pre-clinical and clinical studies. The overall aim of this ESC Working Group Cellular Biology of the Heart Position Paper is to provide recommendations for optimizing the design of clinical cardioprotection studies, which should hopefully result in new and effective therapeutic interventions for the future benefit of CHD patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvt004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148778286", "source": "openalex"}

A position paper from the Cardiac Rehabilitation Section of the European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the European Society of Cardiology", "text": "A large body of empirical research shows that psychosocial risk factors (PSRFs) such as low socio-economic status, social isolation, stress, type-D personality, depression and anxiety increase the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and also contribute to poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prognosis in patients with established CHD. PSRFs may also act as barriers to lifestyle changes and treatment adherence and may moderate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Furthermore, there appears to be a bidirectional interaction between PSRFs and the cardiovascular system. Stress, anxiety and depression affect the cardiovascular system through immune, neuroendocrine and behavioural pathways. In turn, CHD and its associated treatments may lead to distress in patients, including anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, PSRFs can be assessed with single-item screening questions, standardised questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews. Psychotherapy and medication can be considered to alleviate any PSRF-related symptoms and to enhance HRQoL, but the evidence for a definite beneficial effect on cardiac endpoints is inconclusive. A multimodal behavioural intervention, integrating counselling for PSRFs and coping with illness should be included within comprehensive CR. Patients with clinically significant symptoms of distress should be referred for psychological counselling or psychologically focused interventions and/or psychopharmacological treatment. To conclude, the success of CR may critically depend on the interdependence of the body and mind and this interaction needs to be reflected through the assessment and management of PSRFs in line with robust scientific evidence, by trained staff, integrated within the core CR team.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487314543075", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107383633", "source": "openalex"}

It is unclear whether adding uric acid levels to the assessment of cardiovascular risk might contribute to the improved ability to stratify cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of serum uric acid levels in a large cohort of men and women at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Methods Serum uric acid levels were determined in all patients seen for primary/secondary cardiovascular disease prevention at the Cleveland Clinic Section of Preventive Cardiology and Rehabilitation between 1998 and 2004, and all data were entered into the Preventive Cardiology Information System (PreCIS) database. Vital status of the patients was determined through the Social Security Death Index. Death from all causes was summarized across quartiles of uric acid values. Results A total of 3,098 patients (age range 18–87 years) were identified in the database, among whom 43% had cardiovascular disease. There were 156 deaths (5%) during the 14,262 person‐years of followup. For each 1‐mg/dl increase in the serum uric acid level, there was a 39% increase in the risk of death (by Cox regression analysis). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, history of cardiovascular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, levels of cholesterol fractions, and plasma glucose levels, the serum uric acid level continued to predict the risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 [95% confidence interval 1.15–1.38], P &lt; 0.001). This association was present regardless of diuretic use. Concordance index (C statistic) analyses showed that uric acid significantly improved the predictive accuracy of a model that included Framingham Heart Study score factors, metabolic syndrome components, and fibrinogen levels. Conclusion Serum uric acid levels are an independent predictor of death in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

Our study is the first external and independent validation of this new risk prediction model. Methods and Results— The study population consisted of a consecutive cohort of 706 patients with HCM without prior SCD event, from 2 tertiary referral centers. The primary end point was a composite of SCD and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, identical to the HCM Risk-SCD end point. The 5-year SCD risk was calculated using the HCM Risk-SCD formula. Receiver operating characteristic curves and C-statistics were calculated for the 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, and risk stratification methods of the 2003 American College of Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology guidelines and 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines. During follow-up of 7.7±5.3 years, SCD occurred in 42 (5.9%) of 706 patients (ages 49±16 years; 34% women). The C-statistic of the new model was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57–0.82; P =0.008), which performed significantly better than the conventional risk factor models based on the 2003 guidelines (C-statistic of 0.55: 95% CI, 0.47–0.63; P =0.3), and 2011 guidelines (C-statistic of 0.60: 95% CI, 0.50–0.70; P =0.07). Conclusions— The HCM Risk-SCD model improves the risk stratification of patients with HCM for primary prevention of SCD, and calculating an individual risk estimate contributes to the clinical decision-making process.

Particular emphasis was dedicated to coronary heart diseases (CHD), heart rhythm diseases and heart failure because to date the evidence-based clinical knowledge is most advanced in these particular areas. Differences between men and women and over the life span were considered in the recommendations as were influences of cognitive capability and the interactive and synergistic impact of classical somatic risk factors on the affective comorbidity in heart disease patients.A IA recommendation (recommendation grade I and evidence grade A) was given for the need to consider psychosocial risk factors in the estimation of coronary risks as etiological and prognostic risk factors. Furthermore, for the recommendation to routinely integrate psychosocial patient management into the care of heart surgery patients because in these patients, comorbid affective disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder) are highly prevalent and often have a malignant prognosis. A IB recommendation was given for the treatment of psychosocial risk factors aiming to prevent the onset of CHD, particularly if the psychosocial risk factor is harmful in itself (e.g. depression) or constrains the treatment of the somatic risk factors. Patients with acute and chronic CHD should be offered anti-depressive medication if these patients suffer from medium to severe states of depression and in this case medication with selective reuptake inhibitors should be given. In the long-term course of treatment with implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) a subjective health technology assessment is warranted. In particular, the likelihood of affective comorbidities and the onset of psychological crises should be carefully considered.The present state of the art paper presents an update of current empirical evidence in psychocardiology. The paper provides evidence-based recommendations for the integration of psychosocial factors into cardiological practice and highlights areas of high priority. The evidence for estimating the efficiency for psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions has increased substantially since the first release of the policy document but is, however, still weak. There remains an urgent need to establish curricula for physician competence in psychodiagnosis, communication and referral to ensure that current psychocardiac knowledge is translated into the daily routine.Hintergrund: Die rasche Weiterentwicklung der psychokardiologischen Forschung, aber auch die wachsende Verankerung psychosozialer Fragestellungen im klinischen Alltag haben die Klinische Kommission der DGK bewogen, einer Aktualisierung und Weiterentwicklung des 2008 erstmals publizierten Positionspapiers zur Bedeutung psychosozialer Faktoren in der Kardiologie zuzustimmen.Methoden: Der Kreis der Autoren wurde vergrößert, allgemeine Aspekte eingefügt und das Wissen in allen Abschnitten auf den heutigen Stand gebracht. Schwerpunkte der Empfehlungen sind die koronare Herzerkrankung, Herzrhythmusstörungen und die Herzinsuffizienz, da hier der Stand der empirischen Evidenz und des klinisches Wissens zu psychosozialen Fragestellungen am weitesten entwickelt ist. Berücksichtigt wurden bei den Empfehlungen Besonderheiten von Frauen und Männern, Unterschiede bzgl. der Lebensspanne, Einflüsse auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit und die interaktive synergistische Bedeutung klassischer Risikofaktoren bei affektiver Komorbidität.Ergebnisse: Eine I-A-Empfehlung (Empfehlungsgrad I, Evidenzgrad A) wurde vergeben für die Aufforderung, psychosoziale Risikofaktoren bei der Einschätzung des KHK-Risikos zu berücksichtigen, die als unabhängige ätiologische und prognostische Risikofaktoren für das Auftreten der koronaren Herzerkrankung (KHK) und für Komplikationen im Behandlungsverlauf der KHK bedeutsam sind. Ferner für die Empfehlung, Patienten mit Herzoperationen von einem interdisziplinären Team zu betreuten, in dem die Möglichkeit besteht, auf psychosoziale Aspekte einzugehen, da bei diesen Patienten komorbide psychische Störungen wie Depressivität, Angst und posttraumatische Belastungsstörung häufig und prognostisch ungünstig sind. Eine I-B-Empfehlung wurde vergeben für die Behandlung psychosozialer Risikofaktoren mit dem Ziel einer Primärprävention der KHK, wenn das Risikomerkmal an sich Krankheitswert hat (z. B. Depression) oder die Behandlung klassischer Risikofaktoren erschwert ist. Eine antidepressive Pharmakotherapie soll Patienten nach akutem Koronarsyndrom sowie in der Phase der chronischen KHK angeboten werden, die an einer mindestens mittelschweren rezidivierenden depressiven Störung leiden. Dabei sollen vorzugsweise Substanzen aus der Gruppe der selektiven Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) zum Einsatz kommen. Bei der langfristigen ärztlichen Begleitung von ICD-Patienten sollen die psychosozialen Folgen der ICD-Technologie beachtet und insbesondere relevante Affektstörungen sowie Krisen bei ICD-Patienten erkannt und fachgerecht behandelt werden.Schlussfolgerungen: Das Positionspapier formuliert konkrete Anwendungsfelder mit hoher Priorität für die Einbeziehung psychosozialer Faktoren in die kardiologische Praxis, die eine leitlinienkonforme Evidenz aufweisen.

The majority of cardiac events occur in individuals without known coronary artery disease (CAD) and in low- to intermediate-risk subjects. Thus, the development of improved preventive strategies may substantially benefit from the identification, among apparently intermediate-risk subjects, of those who have a high probability for developing future cardiac events. Cardiac computed tomography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) by single photon emission computed tomography may play a role in this setting. In fact, absence of coronary calcium in cardiac computed tomography and inducible ischaemia in MPS are associated with a very low rate of major cardiac events in the next 3–5 years. Based on current evidence, the evaluation of coronary calcium in primary prevention subjects should be considered in patients classified as intermediate-risk based on traditional risk factors, since high calcium scores identify subjects at high-risk who may benefit from aggressive secondary prevention strategies. In addition, calcium scoring should be considered for asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without known CAD to select those in whom further functional testing by MPS or other stress imaging techniques may be considered to identify patients with significant inducible ischaemia. From available data, the use of MPS as first line testing modality for risk stratification is not recommended in any category of primary prevention subjects with the possible exception of first-degree relatives of patients with premature CAD in whom MPS may be considered. However, the Working Group recognizes that neither the use of computed tomography for calcium imaging nor of MPS have been proven to significantly improve clinical outcomes of primary prevention subjects in prospective controlled studies. This information would be crucial to adequately define the role of imaging approaches in cardiovascular preventive strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehq235", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110141547", "source": "openalex"}

Conceptually, comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity or chronic kidney disease, all highly prevalent in HF populations, have shifted from being innocent bystanders to drivers of HF. This applies especially to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a phenotype that accounts for more than 50% of HF patients and for which no effective therapy exists thus far.5,6 In particular, the prevalence of T2DM, thereby its combination with HF is rapidly increasing, mainly due to the obesity epidemic. Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes are addressed by an increasing number of clinical studies in T2DM, mainly as safety endpoints for anti-diabetic agents. Some of those drugs have beneficial CV effects independent of their glucose-lowering action. Consequently, anti-diabetic agents have gained interest for their potential repurposing in HF treatment. In this context, the Translational Research Committee of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) organized a workshop on HF and T2DM, focusing on the pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of this relationship. Here, we summarize the main points raised during this workshop, providing an overview of current evidence and open issues.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy596", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2895924902", "source": "openalex"}

Data from the observational, prospective, HF long-term registry of the European Society of Cardiology were analysed. A total of 14 964 HF patients (age 66 ± 13 years, 67% male; 53% HFrEF, 21% HFmrEF, 26% HFpEF) were enrolled. The prevalence of AF was 27% in HFrEF, 29% in HFmrEF, and 39% in HFpEF. Atrial fibrillation was associated with older age, lower functional capacity, and heightened physical signs of HF. Crude rates of mortality and HF hospitalization were higher in patients with AF compared to SR, in each EF subtype. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratio of AF for HF hospitalizations was: 1.036 (95% CI 0.888–1.208, P = 0.652) in HFrEF, 1.430 (95% CI 1.087–1.882, P = 0.011) in HFmrEF, and 1.487 (95% CI 1.195–1.851, P < 0.001) in HFpEF; and for combined all-cause death or HF hospitalizations: 0.957 (95% CI 0.843–1.087, P = 0.502), 1.302 (95% CI 1.055–1.608, P = 0.014), and 1.365 (95% CI 1.152–1.619, P < 0.001), respectively. In patients with HFrEF, AF was not associated with worse outcomes in those presenting with either an acute or a chronic presentation of HF.

We propose a holistic approach considering the whole spectrum of serious adverse events that patients with acute PE may encounter on the short and long run.

We advocate the use of outcome measures for functional outcome and quality of life to quantify the impact of the PE diagnosis and identify patients with the post-PE syndrome early. Counselling patients on maintaining a healthy lifestyle mitigates the risk of the post-PE syndrome and improves cardiovascular prognosis. Therefore, we consider it important to discuss when and how to resume sporting activities soon after diagnosing PE.

Also discussed is the issue of uncertainties in radiation dose estimates and how to compare the relative risks of studies. <b>Methods:</b> Radiation dose estimates (organ absorbed doses and effective doses) from different literature sources were directly compared. Typical values for administered activity per study were used to compare doses that are to be expected in clinical applications. <b>Results:</b> The effective doses for all agents varied from 2 to 15 mSv per study, with the lowest values being seen for <sup>13</sup>N-NH<sub>3</sub> and <sup>15</sup>O-H<sub>2</sub>O studies and the highest values being seen for <sup>201</sup>Tl-chloride studies. The effective doses for <sup>99m</sup>Tc- and <sup>201</sup>Tl-labeled agents differed by about a factor of 2, a factor that is comparable to the uncertainty in individual values. This uncertainty results from the application of standard anthropomorphic and biokinetic models, presumably representative of the exposed population, to individual patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Considerations such as diagnostic accuracy, ease of use, image quality, and patient comfort and convenience should generally dictate the choice of a radiopharmaceutical, with radiation dose being only a secondary or even tertiary consideration. Counseling of nuclear medicine patients who may be concerned about exposure should include a reasonable estimate of the median dose for the type of examination and administered activity of the radiopharmaceutical; in addition, it should be explained that the theoretic risks of the procedure are orders of magnitude lower than the actual benefits of the examination. Providing numeric estimates of risks from studies to individual patients is inappropriate, given the uncertainties in the dose estimates and the limited predictive power of current dose–risk models in the low-dose (i.e., diagnostic) range.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.108.052241", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134180534", "source": "openalex"}

Women largely share similar cardiovascular risk factors for IHD with men; however, women with suspected or confirmed IHD have less coronary atherosclerosis than men, even though they are older and have more cardiovascular risk factors than men. Coronary endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease have been proposed as important determinants in the aetiology and prognosis of IHD in women, but research is limited on whether sex differences in these mechanisms truly exist. Differences in the epidemiology of IHD between women and men remain largely unexplained, as we are still unable to explain why women are protected towards IHD until older age compared with men.

This paper examines inequalities in cardiovascular healthcare and outcomes in ESC member countries utilizing mortality and risk factor data from the World Health Organization and the Global Burden of Disease study with additional economic data from the World Bank. Cardiovascular healthcare data were collected by questionnaire circulated to the national cardiac societies of ESC member countries. Statistics pertaining to 2022, or latest available year, are presented. New material in this report includes contemporary estimates of the economic burden of CVD and mortality statistics for a range of CVD phenotypes. CVD accounts for 11% of the EU’s total healthcare expenditure. It remains the most common cause of death in ESC member countries with over 3 million deaths per year. Proportionately more deaths from CVD occur in middle-income compared with high-income countries in both females (53% vs. 34%) and males (46% vs. 30%). Between 1990 and 2021, median age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) for CVD decreased by median &amp;gt;50% in high-income ESC member countries but in middle-income countries the median decrease was &amp;lt;12%. These inequalities between middle- and high-income ESC member countries likely reflect heterogeneous exposures to a range of environmental, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors. The 2023 survey suggests that treatment factors may also contribute with middle-income countries reporting lower rates per million of percutaneous coronary intervention (1355 vs. 2330), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (4.0 vs. 153.4) and pacemaker implantation (147.0 vs. 831.9) compared with high-income countries. The ESC Atlas 2023 report shows continuing inequalities in the epidemiology and management of CVD between middle-income and high-income ESC member countries. These inequalities are exemplified by the changes in CVD ASMRs during the last 30 years. In the high-income ESC member countries, ASMRs have been in steep decline during this period but in the middle-income countries declines have been very small. There is now an important need for targeted action to reduce the burden of CVD, particularly in those countries where the burden is greatest.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae466", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4401918027", "source": "openalex"}

Sometimes, its cause is obviously related to an underlying general or cardiac disease, or to a syndrome of inflammatory or infectious acute pericarditis. On other occasions, pericardial effusion is an unexpected finding that requires specific evaluation. In these cases, the main issues are aetiology, the clinical course, and the possibility of evolution to haemodynamic embarrassment. This is especially relevant in cases of large pericardial effusions, in which echocardiographic recordings not infrequently show findings suggestive of subclinical haemodynamic derangement, mainly right atrial or right ventricular wall collapse. These uncertainties have led to a heterogeneous approach to the management of the syndrome of pericardial effusion by different groups of investigators. The main goal of this article is to give a comprehensive review of aetiology, haemodynamic findings, and management of pericardial effusion. In addition, some comments on the management of neoplastic pericardial effusion are also provided. In an asymptomatic patient, a pericardial effusion of less than 10 mm on the echocardiogram may be an incidental finding, especially in elderly women, as shown in the Framingham study.1 In these patients, neither invasive studies nor treatment are required. A follow up echocardiogram is probably warranted to see if the echocardiographic findings are unchanged. Further investigation or treatment of these patients is not necessary if the echo findings are stable. A wide variety of conditions may result in pericardial effusion. All types of acute pericarditis (inflammatory, infectious, immunologic or of physical origin) can be associated with pericardial effusion.2 In addition, pericardial effusion of varying degrees can be seen in other conditions such as neoplasia (with or without direct pericardial involvement), myxoedema, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, aortic or cardiac rupture, trauma, chylopericardium, or in the setting of chronic salt and water retention of many causes, including chronic heart …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heart.86.2.235", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100337258", "source": "openalex"}

The goal of this training system is to augment the training of new cardiology fellows as well as to introduce cardiologists to new devices and procedures. To achieve this goal, both the technical components and the educational content of the ICTS bring new and unique features: a simulated fluoroscope, a physics model of a catheter, a haptic interface, a fluid flow simulation combined with a hemodynamic model and a learning system integrated in a user interface. The simulator is currently able to generate--in real-time--high quality x-ray images from a 3D anatomical model of the thorax, including a beating heart and animated lungs. The heart and lung motion is controlled by the hemodynamic model, which also computes blood pressure and EKG. The blood flow is then calculated according to the blood pressure and blood vessel characteristics. Any vascular tool, such as a catheter, guide wire or angioplasty balloon can be represented and accurately deformed by the flexible tool physics model. The haptics device controls the tool and provides appropriate feedback when contact with a vessel wall is detected. When the catheter is in place, a contrast agent can be injected into the coronary arteries; blood and contrast mixing is computed and a visual representation of the angiogram is displayed by the x-ray renderer. By bringing key advances in the area of medical simulation--with the real-time x-ray renderer for instance--and by integrating in a single system both high quality simulation and learning tools, the ICTS opens new perspectives for computer based training systems.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W24200543", "source": "openalex"}

A scientific roadmap by the Committee of Translational Research of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology", "text": "Abstract Fibrosis is a pivotal player in heart failure development and progression. Measurements of (markers of) fibrosis in tissue and blood may help to diagnose and risk stratify patients with heart failure, and its treatment may be effective in preventing heart failure and its progression. A lack of pathophysiological insights and uniform definitions has hampered the research in fibrosis and heart failure. The Translational Research Committee of the Heart Failure Association discussed several aspects of fibrosis in their workshop. Early insidious perturbations such as subclinical hypertension or inflammation may trigger first fibrotic events, while more dramatic triggers such as myocardial infarction and myocarditis give rise to full blown scar formation and ongoing fibrosis in diseased hearts. Aging itself is also associated with a cardiac phenotype that includes fibrosis. Fibrosis is an extremely heterogeneous phenomenon, as several stages of the fibrotic process exist, each with different fibrosis subtypes and a different composition of various cells and proteins — resulting in a very complex pathophysiology. As a result, detection of fibrosis, e.g. using current cardiac imaging modalities or plasma biomarkers, will detect only specific subforms of fibrosis, but cannot capture all aspects of the complex fibrotic process. Furthermore, several anti‐fibrotic therapies are under investigation, but such therapies generally target aspecific aspects of the fibrotic process and suffer from a lack of precision. This review discusses the mechanisms and the caveats and proposes a roadmap for future research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.1406", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2912308947", "source": "openalex"}

There is particular concern regarding occupational dose to the lens of the eye. This document provides recommendations for occupational radiation protection for physicians and other staff in the interventional suite. Simple methods for reducing or minimizing occupational radiation dose include minimizing fluoroscopy time and the number of acquired images; using available patient dose reduction technologies; using good imaging-chain geometry; collimating; avoiding high-scatter areas; using protective shielding; using imaging equipment whose performance is controlled through a quality assurance program; and wearing personal dosimeters so that you know your dose. Effective use of these methods requires both appropriate education and training in radiation protection for all interventional cardiology personnel, and the availability of appropriate protective tools and equipment. Regular review and investigation of personnel monitoring results, accompanied as appropriate by changes in how procedures are performed and equipment used, will ensure continual improvement in the practice of radiation protection in the interventional suite. These recommendations for occupational radiation protection in interventional cardiology and electrophysiology have been endorsed by the Asian Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, the Latin American Society of Interventional Cardiology, and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.24520", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2106964178", "source": "openalex"}

The expansion of adipose tissue mass, especially of the visceral adipose tissue depot, is observed in the vast majority of individuals carrying the clinical features of the metabolic syndrome, an important (and reversible) risk factor of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. As waist circumference can be used as a crude estimate of visceral fat accumulation, its measurement provides further information on cardiovascular and type 2 diabetes risk, at any given body mass index value. However, an elevated waist circumference might also be the result of an increased 'cardioprotective' subcutaneous adipose tissue mass. We have proposed that the measurement of plasma triglycerides along with waist circumference, the so-called 'hypertriglyceridemic waist' might better quantify visceral obesity and its health hazards than waist circumference alone. \"Hypertriglyceridemic waist\" is thought to represent an altered, dysfunctional, and highly lipolytic adipose tissue that is a major culprit abnormality behind the metabolic syndrome and associated cardiometabolic risk, independently from classical cardiovascular disease risk factors such as age, sex, and plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890802004959", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2048592428", "source": "openalex"}

We systematically searched six scholarly databases (ACM Digital Library, Arxiv, Embase, IEEE Explore, PubMed and Scopus) for studies published in 2015–2020 describing the development or application of NLP methods for clinical text focused on cardiac disease. Studies not published in English, lacking a description of NLP methods, non-cardiac focused and duplicates were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted general study information, clinical details and NLP details and appraised quality using a checklist of quality indicators for NLP studies. We identified 37 studies developing and applying NLP in heart failure, imaging, coronary artery disease, electrophysiology, general cardiology and valvular heart disease. Most studies used NLP to identify patients with a specific diagnosis and extract disease severity using rule-based NLP methods. Some used NLP algorithms to predict clinical outcomes. A major limitation is the inability to aggregate findings across studies due to vastly different NLP methods, evaluation and reporting.

Emergency department physicians require high sensitivity to confidently rule-out AMI, whereas cardiologists aim to minimize false-positive results. Methods: High-sensitivity troponin I and T assays were used to measure troponin concentrations in patients presenting with chest-pain symptoms and being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome at hospitals in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. AMI outcomes were independently adjudicated by at least 2 physicians. The European Society of Cardiology algorithm performance with each assay was assessed by the sensitivity and proportion with AMI ruled out and the positive predictive value and proportion ruled-in. Results: There were 2222 patients with serial high-sensitivity troponin T and high-sensitivity troponin I measurements. The high-sensitivity troponin T algorithm ruled out 1425 (64.1%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.0%–98.8%) and ruled-in 292 (13.1%) with a positive predictive value of 63.4% (95% CI, 57.5%–68.9%). The high-sensitivity troponin I algorithm ruled out 1205 (54.2%) with a sensitivity of 98.8% (95% CI, 96.4%–99.7%)) and ruled-in 310 (14.0%) with a positive predictive value of 68.1% (95% CI, 62.6%–73.2%). Conclusions: The sensitivity of the European Society of Cardiology rapid assessment 0-/1-hour algorithm to rule-out AMI with high-sensitivity troponin may be insufficient for some emergency department physicians to confidently send patients home. These algorithms may prove useful to identify patients requiring expedited management. However, the positive predictive value was modest for both algorithms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.116.022677", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2538671047", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the remarkable clinical developments with the use of new antiplatelet drugs, several fundamental issues remain unresolved. Some of the observed safety/efficacy problems in major clinical trials can be directly attributed to the lack of careful phase II studies where issues such as monitoring, pharmacological profiles, and individual response variations were not considered sufficiently. Nevertheless, none of the available antiplatelet agents meet all the criteria of an ideal antiplatelet agent. Aspirin has been the standard reference agent in cardiovascular disease. However, it is a weak and nonselective antiplatelet compound and is unable to interfere substantially with the thrombogenic activity of a fresh mural thrombus of a stenosed vessel. The newer antiplatelet drug classes such as the ADP receptor blockers (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors produce their therapeutic effects by distinct mechanisms which differ from aspirin. Large clinical trials have documented their efficacy in acute coronary syndromes associated with intracoronary thrombus formation. The future challenge is to evaluate long-term treatment strategies which are equally safe but distinctly more effective than aspirin, e.g. a combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or oral GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000047514", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998452547", "source": "openalex"}

Validity was evaluated by the instrument's capability to discriminate between pre-existing levels of clinical seniority. For reliability, generalisability theory was used. Feasibility was defined by a minimum number of completed observations: 50% of the residents obtaining at least four Mini-CEX's. Satisfaction was evaluated through a one to nine rating scale from the evaluators, and residents' perspectives. The total number of encounters was 253. Regarding validity, Mini-CEX was able to discriminate significantly between residents of different seniority. Reliability analysis indicated that a minimum of ten evaluations are necessary to produce a minimally reliable inference, but more are preferable. Feasibility was poor: 15% of the residents were evaluated four or more times during the study period. High satisfaction ratings from evaluators' and residents' were achieved.Conclusion: Mini-CEX discriminates between pre-existing levels of seniority, requires considerable sampling to achieve sufficient reliability, and was not feasible within the current circumstances, but it was considered a valuable assessment tool as indicated by the evaluators' and residents' satisfaction ratings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01421590701352261", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164310950", "source": "openalex"}

Cardiac as well as extracardiac components play a role for the limited exercise capacity, including an impaired cardiac and peripheral vascular reserve, a limitation in mechanical ventilation and/or gas exchange with reduced pulmonary vascular reserve, skeletal muscle dysfunction and iron deficiency/anaemia. Although most of these components can be differentiated and quantified through gas exchange analysis by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), the information provided by objective measures of exercise performance has not been systematically considered in the recent algorithms/scores for HFpEF diagnosis, by neither European nor US groups. The current clinical consensus statement by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) aims at outlining the role of exercise testing and its pathophysiological, clinical and prognostic insights, addressing the implications of a thorough functional evaluation from the diagnostic algorithm to the pathophysiology and treatment perspectives of HFpEF. Along with these goals, we provide a specific analysis of the evidence that CPET is the standard for assessing, quantifying, and differentiating the origin of dyspnoea and exercise impairment and even more so when combined with echocardiography and/or invasive haemodynamic evaluation. This will lead to improved quality of diagnosis when applying the proposed scores and may also help to implement the progressive characterization of the specific HFpEF phenotypes, a critical step toward the delivery of phenotype‐specific treatments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2601", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4283751566", "source": "openalex"}

Resource-intensive systems of external reinforcement and behavioral cues can support behavior maintenance; an alternative approach is to promote patient internalization and self-regulation of health behaviors. Based in part on organismic internalization theory, selfdetermination theory, and the experience of patients successful at maintaining health behaviors, the health behavior internalization model (HBIM) is proposed to describe motivational factors associated with internalization processes and hypothesizes that integrated internalization may be associated with long-term health behavior maintenance. The HBIM identifies four self-needs (ownership, self-determination, security, and support) and four behavior-related needs (preference, context, competence, and coping) as motivating health behavior internalization. Behavior change strategies promoting integrated internalization are identified from self-determination theory, motivational interviewing, and transtheoretical model interventions.

However, while medical imaging provides increasingly detailed anatomical information, clinicians often have limited access to hemodynamic data that may be crucial to patient risk assessment and treatment planning. Computational simulations can now provide detailed hemodynamic data to augment clinical knowledge in both adult and pediatric applications. There is a particular need for simulation tools in pediatric cardiology, due to the wide variation in anatomy and physiology in congenital heart disease patients, necessitating individualized treatment plans. Despite great strides in medical imaging, enabling extraction of flow information from magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging, simulations offer predictive capabilities that imaging alone cannot provide. Patient specific simulations can be used for in silico testing of new surgical designs, treatment planning, device testing, and patient risk stratification. Furthermore, simulations can be performed at no direct risk to the patient. In this paper, we outline the current state of the art in methods for cardiovascular blood flow simulation and virtual surgery. We then step through pressing challenges in the field, including multiscale modeling, boundary condition selection, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we summarize simulation results of two representative examples from pediatric cardiology: single ventricle physiology, and coronary aneurysms caused by Kawasaki disease.

Most commonly, mutations in the low‐density lipoprotein receptor gene result in high plasma levels of apolipoprotein B‐containing lipoproteins (eg, low‐density lipoprotein and lipoprotein(a)). High plasma levels of lipoproteins increase the risk of cardiovascular events by as much as 20‐fold if left untreated. A 2011 survey of cardiologists performed by the American College of Cardiology ( ACC ) suggests that there is a need for greater awareness of FH among cardiologists with regard to its prevalence and heritability, and of the risk of cardiovascular ( CV ) disease associated with the disorder, such as premature coronary heart disease. Given that many patients with FH may first present to CV specialists at the time of a major coronary event, it is critical that cardiologists have strategies to manage this high‐risk subset of patients. This brief review responds to areas of need identified in the ACC survey and is intended to provide current information about FH and increase awareness about this disorder among cardiologists.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.22223", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1897625543", "source": "openalex"}

It has a well-established role in hepatobiliary and cardiac surgery and is also used in obstetrics and trauma medicine to assess coagulation and identify the causes of post-operative bleeding. It is not routinely used in the diagnosis or treatment of thrombosis although recently it has been shown to predict thrombotic events post-operatively and after percutaneous intervention (PCI). In cardiovascular medicine the importance of the platelet in the pathophysiology of vascular events is increasingly apparent. As a result antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone of the treatment for coronary disease, particularly in the setting of acute coronary syndromes. The increasing utilization of stents, particularly drug-eluting devices, in PCI has also necessitated widespread use of antiplatelet agents to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis. A quick, accurate and reliable test to measure the effect of platelet inhibition by antiplatelet agents on clotting in an individual patient would be of profound clinical value. The results from such a test could provide prognostic information, allow treatment with antiplatelet agents to be tailored to the individual and identify resistance to one or more of these agents. Optimization and tailoring of anti-platelet therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly those undergoing PCI, using such a test may reduce morbidity and mortality from thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. Current methods of assessing platelet activity measure platelet count and function in isolation. Optical aggregation is the most widely used method for assessing platelet function but it is relatively time consuming, measures platelet function in isolation rather than in the context of clot formation and is not a bedside test. By contrast the modified thrombelastograph platelet mapping kit marketed by Haemoscope can be used to assess the effects of antiplatelet agents on ex vivo blood clotting, thus giving a measurement more relevant to in vivo responses. This represents a potentially powerful tool to assess response of individual patients to antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of PCI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09537100600935259", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110278285", "source": "openalex"}

Should it really be considered as a vital decision-making tool in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)? To confirm the importance of this score, we aimed to systematically compare the postinterventional adverse cardiovascular outcomes which were observed in patients who were allotted a low versus a high SYNTAX score. Methods: Randomized controlled trials and observational studies which were published from January 2007 to January 2017 were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases using the searched terms 'SYNTAX score and percutaneous coronary intervention.' Adverse cardiovascular outcomes were considered as the major endpoints. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the statistical parameters, and the main analysis was carried out by the RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Sixteen studies with a total number of 19,751 participants (8589 participants with a low versus 11,162 participants with a high SYNTAX score) were included. Current results showed mortality to be significantly higher with a higher SYNTAX score (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.78–2.46, P = .00001). Cardiac death also significantly favored a low SYNTAX score (RR 2.08, 95% CI 1.66–2.61, P = .00001. Similarly, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiac events, repeated revascularization, and stent thrombosis were significantly higher following a high SYNTAX score (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.45–2.03, P = .00001; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.81–2.26, P = .00001; RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.69–2.28, P = .00001; and RR 3.16, 95% CI 2.17–4.59, P = .00001, respectively). Even when patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were separately analyzed, a low SYNTAX score was still significantly associated with lower adverse outcomes. Conclusions: This analysis is a confirmatory piece of evidence to show that the application of the SYNTAX score in Interventional Cardiology is apparently relevant. The use of this scoring system to grade patients with coronary artery disease and to further guide for revascularization should be encouraged.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000007410", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2735316670", "source": "openalex"}

Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, leftsided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are ∼30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures.Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report.

In the operating room, this requires considerable perceptual, cognitive and psychomotor demands on the operators. The dramatic expansion of TEVAR activity has necessarily prompted a requirement to systematically consider the indications, appropriateness, limitations and delivery of this treatment, which has been adopted by many specialties including cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, radiologists and vascular surgeons.5 Our task has been to generate a multidisciplinary position statement that supports and advises all clinicians utilizing this technological advance.

Methods: Existing, patented, and experimental designs of steerable catheters are classified with respect to their steerability. Subsequently, the classification is used as a tool for defining future requirements and challenges for steerable cardiac catheters. Results: The results of the classification provide two categories of steering at a fundamental level: 1) Force generation in the tip and 2) force transmission to the tip. The former group consists of force generating steering mechanisms as a result of 1) electric, 2) thermal, and 3) magnetic actuation. The latter group comprises force transmitting steering mechanisms as the result of 4) hydraulic chamber actuation or 5) mechanic cable actuation. Each category can be further subdivided into multiple subcategories. Future requirements and challenges are found for steering and positioning capabilities, cardiac applications and safety, and miniaturization potential. Conclusion: A structured classification is presented which identifies the different steering mechanisms in steerable catheters. The classification proves to be a useful tool in determining future requirements and challenges, being invaluable for future application-driven design. Significance: Using the applied classification as a tool for future design will not only provide insight into previously applied steering technology, it will identify new and unexplored options too.

Despite the positive correlations between blood pressure (BP) levels and later CV events since BP levels as low as 100/60 mmHg have been reported in numerous epidemiological studies, the diagnostic criteria of hypertension and BP thresholds and targets of antihypertensive therapy have largely remained at the level of 140/90 mmHg in the past 30 years. The publication of both the SPRINT and STEP trials (comprising > 8,500 Caucasian/African and Chinese participants, respectively) provided evidence to shake this 140/90 mmHg dogma. Another dogma regarding hypertension management is the dependence on office (or clinic) BP measurements. Although standardized office BP measurements have been widely recommended and adopted in large-scale CV outcome trials, the practice of office BP measurements has never been ideal in real-world practice. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) is easy to perform, more likely to be free of environmental and/or emotional stress, feasible to document long-term BP variations, of good reproducibility and reliability, and more correlated with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and CV events, compared to routine office BP measurements. In the 2022 Taiwan Hypertension Guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC) and the Taiwan Hypertension Society (THS), we break these two dogmas by recommending the definition of hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg and a universal BP target of < 130/80 mmHg, based on standardized HBPM obtained according to the 722 protocol. The 722 protocol refers to duplicate BP readings taken per occasion (\"2\"), twice daily (\"2\"), over seven consecutive days (\"7\"). To facilitate implementation of the guidelines, a series of flowcharts encompassing assessment, adjustment, and HBPM-guided hypertension management are provided. Other key messages include that: 1) lifestyle modification, summarized as the mnemonic S-ABCDE, should be applied to people with elevated BP and hypertensive patients to reduce life-time BP burden; 2) all 5 major antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [A], angiotensin receptor blockers [A], β-blockers [B], calcium-channel blockers [C], and thiazide diuretics [D]) are recommended as first-line antihypertensive drugs; 3) initial combination therapy, preferably in a single-pill combination, is recommended for patients with BP ≥ 20/10 mmHg above targets; 4) a target hierarchy (HBPM-HMOD- ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]) should be considered to optimize hypertension management, which indicates reaching the HBPM target first and then keeping HMOD stable or regressed, otherwise ABPM can be arranged to guide treatment adjustment; and 5) renal denervation can be considered as an alternative BP-lowering strategy after careful clinical and imaging evaluation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.6515/acs.202205_38(3).20220321a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4282944211", "source": "openalex"}

Although rest echocardiography has become the most common of the techniques, nuclear cardiology and more recently cardiac computed tomography (CCT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) play important roles in this regard. This review examines the current applications and interactions of noninvasive cardiac imaging approaches for the assessment of patients with suspected CAD. In addition to considering the strengths and weaknesses of each technique, this review attempts to provide a guide to the selection of a test (or tests) that is based on the question being asked and the ability of each test to answer this question. In patients with suspected CAD, the pretest likelihood of disease, a clinical assessment, becomes the most important determinant of the initial test. If the likelihood is very low, no testing is needed. However, if the likelihood is low, recent data suggest that assessment of early atherosclerosis is likely to be the most useful and cost-effective test. In patients who have an intermediate likelihood of CAD, nuclear cardiology with myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) becomes highly valuable; however, coronary CT angiography (CTA), with fast 16-slice or greater scanners, may emerge as the initial test of choice. MPS would then be used if the CTA is inconclusive or if there is a need to assess the functional significance of a stenosis defined by CTA. Coronary CTA, however, is not yet widely available and is limited in patients with dense coronary calcification. In older patients with a high likelihood of CAD, MPS may be the initial test of choice, since a high proportion of these patients have too much coronary calcium to allow accurate assessment of the presence of coronary stenoses. PET/CT or SPECT/CT could emerge as important modalities combining the advantages of each modality. While CMR has great promise as a radiation-free and contrast-free \"one-stop\" shop, it currently lags behind CTA for noninvasive coronary angiography. Nonetheless, CMR clearly has the potential for this application and has already emerged as a highly effective method for assessing ventricular function, myocardial mass, and myocardial viability, and there is increasing use of this approach for clinical rest and stress perfusion measurements. CMR is particularly valuable in distinguishing ischemic from nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While CT and CMR are likely to grow considerably in diagnostic evaluation over the next several years, MPS and PET will continue to be very valuable techniques for this purpose.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160566948", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2023646061", "title": "Preoperative Cardiology Consultation", "text": "Director of Vascular Anesthesia, Department of Anesthesia &amp; Critical Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Associate Professor of Anaesthesia, Harvard Medical School.Received from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.In a 1998 survey of New York metropolitan area anesthesiologists, surgeons, and cardiologists, 1the three specialties were in general agreement that important purposes of a cardiology consultation are to treat an inadequately treated cardiac condition before surgery (e.g. , unstable angina or congestive heart failure [CHF]), to provide data to use in anesthesia management (e.g. , ischemic threshold of tachycardia on stress test or left ventricular ejection fraction), and possibly to diagnose a medical condition before surgery (e.g. , the cause of a new-onset atrial fibrillation). The yield of a cardiology consultation, in terms of new therapy or significant effect on patient management strategy prior to surgery, has, however, been reported to vary widely from 10% to more than 70%. 1–3The reasons why the consultation process often falls short of ideal are probably multifold, but may often originate from vague understanding of the consultation process. The physician initiating the consultation, whether an anesthesiologist or a surgeon, may not make it clear to the cardiologist why the consultation is being sought. In a retrospective review of 202 cardiology consultations at a university hospital, 2it was found that 108 just asked for an “evaluation,” 79 asked for a “clearance,” and 9 did not specifically request anything. Only six posed a specific question. As a result, the consultant often makes broadly inclusive, general remarks about perioperative management of the patient and may recommend preoperative diagnostic work-up that does not influence the patient's outcome but prolongs the hospital stay. 4In this review are presented (1) the indications for cardiology consultations as implied in the American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association (ACC–AHA) guidelines on preoperative cardiac evaluation, 5and (2) suggestions on how the ACC–AHA guidelines may be critically applied to, and improve, the consultation process.The ACC–AHA guidelines on preoperative cardiac evaluation were published initially in 1996 and were also endorsed by the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists and the Society for Vascular Surgery. 6An updated version of the guidelines was published in 2002. 5The guidelines were based on the then-available literature as well as expert opinions from the disciplines of anesthesiology, cardiology, electrophysiology, vascular medicine, vascular surgery, and noninvasive cardiac testing. The guidelines provided an 8-step algorithm for stratifying the patient's risks and triaging to either surgery or cardiac evaluation.The first three steps of the guidelines consider the urgency of the operation and the recency of cardiac evaluation and intervention. If the operation is not emergent and if there has not been recent cardiac evaluation and/or intervention with no significant interim changes, then the remainder of the guidelines are applied. Steps 4 through 7 deal with an assessment of the patient's clinical predictors of cardiac risk, functional status, and the risk of the surgery proposed. Step 8, or noninvasive cardiac testing to further define the patient's risk, is indicated (1) if the patient has a major clinical predictor, (2) if the patient has an intermediate clinical predictor and either has poor functional status or is undergoing a high-risk surgery, or (3) if the patient has poor functional status and is undergoing a high-risk surgery. As defined by the ACC–AHA, major clinical predictors are unstable coronary syndrome, decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), significant arrhythmias, and severe valvular disease. Intermediate clinical predictors are mild angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction (MI) or CHF, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure with serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dl. A high-risk surgery carries a greater than 5% perioperative risk of cardiac events such as MI, CHF, or death and is exemplified by emergent major operations, especially in the elderly, aortic, and other major vascular procedures, peripheral vascular bypass procedures, and anticipated prolonged surgical procedures associated with large fluid shifts and/or blood loss. An intermediate-risk surgery carries 1–5% perioperative risk of cardiac events and is exemplified by carotid endarterectomy, intraperitoneal and intrathoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, head and neck surgery, and prostate surgery. Poor functional status is defined as inability to perform activities of greater than 4 metabolic equivalents (METs), where one MET is the rest-ing metabolic rate or the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest and is 3.5 ml O2· kg−1· min−1. Activities that require less than 4 METS are exemplified by driving, cooking, bowling, walking for exercise at 5 km/h or less, raking leaves, and golfing while riding a cart. 7For the purpose of deciding whether to seek a cardiology consultation, the guidelines may be modified as shown in figure 1. The noncardiologist physician, whether an anesthesiologist or a surgeon, should assess (1) the presence or absence of major or intermediate clinical predictors, (2) the patient's functional status, and (3) the risk of surgery, as well as obtain information about previous cardiac intervention and testing. A satisfactory history and physical examination would usually provide all of these pieces of information. Then an anesthesiologist or a surgeon may apply the algorithm of figure 1to determine whether consultation is indicated. If a cardiologist is vaguely asked to provide an “evaluation,” the consultant is actually being asked to determine whether cardiology consultation is indicated, and if so, to take the necessary diagnostic and therapeutic measures.A pervading theme of the updated ACC–AHA guidelines is that “in general, indications for further cardiac testing and treatments [in the operative setting] are the same as those in the nonoperative setting.”6A patient who did not need an echocardiogram previously does not suddenly need one, because that patient is now facing surgery. In figure 1, there are three primary indications for cardiology consultations. (1) A patient with a major clinical predictor, i.e. , a condition that requires acute cardiac intervention such as unstable coronary syndrome should have preoperative cardiology consultation unless in need of an emergent, life-saving operation. Next, if there has not been corrective cardiac intervention or surgery within 5 yr without significant interim change in symptoms or a favorable cardiac evaluation within 2 yr, a cardiology consultation may be sought to perform any indicated noninvasive testing for stratification of risks; (2) for patients undergoing an intermediate-risk surgery who have both a poor functional capacity and an intermediate clinical predictor; or (3) for patients undergoing a high-risk surgery who have either an intermediate clinical predictor of cardiac risk or a poor functional capacity.It should also be noted that while the ACC–AHA guidelines give examples of surgeries that may be classified as high-risk or intermediate-risk, the definition is according to the actual perioperative risk. Application of the algorithm to different groups of surgeries should be tailored to each institution's risks, whenever possible. For example, the rate of stroke or death is related to the annual surgical volume for carotid surgeries. In a survey of hospitals in Georgia, 8a less than 3% rate of stroke or death after carotid endarterectomy was achieved only in hospitals that performed more than 50 carotid endarterectomies per year. In hospitals where carotid endarterectomy is rarely performed and carries a greater than 5% rate of perioperative cardiac events, it should be considered a high-risk surgery and the algorithm applied accordingly. While institution- and procedure-specific complication rates should ideally be used in application of the algorithm, monitoring such data may rarely be possible to most physicians. 9Use of the ACC–AHA classification of surgical risk would provide an acceptable approach to obtaining cardiac consultations in the absence of such data.Indications for percutaneous coronary intervention or surgery for CAD are ever evolving with new studies of the relative merits of medical and surgical therapies, 10and there is often disagreement even among the experts on what constitutes the optimal therapy. 11Several randomized trials in the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated that surgical therapy may be preferable to medical therapy in patients with stenosis of the left main coronary artery or in patients with three-vessel disease and left ventricular dysfunction, but there appears to be no clear benefit of surgery for other patients with CAD. 12Studies comparing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and medical therapy have shown that angioplasty improves exercise performance and reduces coronary symptoms to a greater extent than standard medical therapy, but may be associated with a slightly increased rate of major cardiac events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and death. 13–15In the second Randomized Intervention Treatment of Angina (RITA-2) trial, the incidence of death or MI was 6.3% in patients treated with PTCA and 3.3% for patients treated with conservative medical care over a median follow-up period of 2.7 yr (P = 0.02). 15Medical therapy, including an aggressive cholesterol-lowering regimen, may be associated with a significantly lower rate of cardiac events compared with PTCA. 16Studies that compared coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with medical therapy were performed before the introduction of an aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy and a new comparison such as with the ongoing COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive druG Evaluation) trial may shed a different light on the relative benefits. 17Depending on the results of studies such as the COURAGE trial, a significant percentage of patients one refers to the cardiology consultant for the major clinical predictor of unstable coronary syndrome may be treated medically, rather than interventionally.Anticoagulants such as low-molecular weight heparin and antiplatelet medications such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors play prominent roles in current medical therapy for unstable angina. 18Therefore, patients whom the cardiology consultant opts to treat medically may not be any less enigmatic than patients who receive interventional therapy before a noncardiac surgery. Just as patients presenting for noncardiac surgery shortly after PTCA have an increased risk of restenosis or bleeding (see section 3), 19patients on medical therapy may have the same problem of increased bleeding with continuance of the anticoagulant or of major cardiac event with discontinuance of anticoagulant regimen in the perioperative period. Whether noncardiac surgery should proceed will depend on the relative urgency of the coronary syndrome and the noncardiac surgical indication, with the understanding of the increased risk involved.For patients with stable angina, development of oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and inclusion of these medications in the treatment of stable angina will necessitate development of guidelines on perioperative management of these medications.The cardiac risk of a patient with known or suspected CAD undergoing major noncardiac surgery can be reduced with perioperative use of a β-adrenergic blocker. Recent studies with perioperative use of β-adrenergic blockade suggest that patients with suspected or known CAD may undergo major noncardiac surgery with relative safety when they are given β-adrenergic blockade perioperatively. 20–22In particular, Poldermans et al. 22studied 112 high-risk patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic or infrainguinal vascular reconstruction who had new reversible wall motion abnormalities during preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography. The patients received bisoprolol or placebo perioperatively. Bisoprolol reduced 30-day mortality from 17 to 3.4% and nonfatal MI from 17 to 0%. It should be noted that the 3.4% mortality of the bisoprolol group compares favorably to the sum of the mortality of routine CABG (3%*) and of noncardiac surgery in survivors of CABG (1.7%23). The benefit of perioperative bisoprolol was durable to at least 2 yr after surgery. 24Thus for those patients who are able to take a β-adrenergic blocker, “prophylactic” coronary revascularization may not convey a survival advantage in the immediate perioperative period, even when preoperative testing indicates the presence of uncorrected CAD. For these patients, preoperative noninvasive or invasive cardiac testing itself, and therefore, preoperative cardiology consultation to perform such testing, may not be indicated. Indications 2 and 3 of figure 1might be altered to read that if amenable, β-adrenergic blockade should be used perioperatively and cardiac consultation is not indicated for preoperative work-up. Any indicated cardiac workup and follow-up may be done postoperatively in a routine manner.The beneficial effect of perioperative β-adrenergic blockade has been demonstrated not only with bisoprolol, 22,24but also with atenolol, 20,21esmolol, 25labetalol, 26oxprenolol, 26and metoprolol 27and may thus be a class effect, rather than being particular to a specific β-adrenergic blocking agent. More important than which agent is used may be how it is used. Raby et al. 25advocated using a β-adrenergic blocking agent to keep the heart rate 20% below each patient's ischemic threshold or the lowest heart rate at which the patient has been demonstrated to experience myocardial ischemia. Such a regimen was shown to be beneficial in a small cohort (N = 26) of patients undergoing vascular surgery. Tailoring the dose of the β-adrenergic blocker to each patient may be logical, but no rationale for choosing a target rate 20% below the ischemic threshold was presented. In many patients, the ischemic threshold is not known. A reasonable rule of thumb may be that the anesthesiologist should use a β-adrenergic blocker perioperatively to achieve a heart rate that is as low as possible without causing inadequate levels of coronary perfusion pressure, and that if the ischemic threshold is known, is below it.Despite the literature evidence on the benefit of perioperative β-adrenergic blockade, it has been greatly underutilized in surgical patients. 28,29Commonly accepted relative contraindications to the use of a β-adrenergic blocker include CHF or poor ventricular function, bronchospastic disease, symptomatic bradycardia or heart block, and allergies to β-adrenergic blockers. 28Studies of perioperative use of β-adrenergic blockers 20,21report how well the drugs are tolerated without detectable side effects. Furthermore, the perioperative period represents a special situation in which tolerance to the drugs can be rapidly assessed, and if necessary, a deleterious effect is promptly reversed. 28Whether perioperative use of an α2adrenergic agonist may confer a similar benefit to perioperative β-adrenergic blockade has been studied. 30–32A meta-analysis of the literature on the efficacy of clonidine demonstrated that while myocardial ischemia might be reduced, the incidence of myocardial infarction or death did not decrease with the medication. 32Literature evidence for the benefit of perioperative use of an α2agonist is not as strong as that for the benefit of β-adrenergic blockade and the amenability of using an α2agonist perioperatively should not be considered to obviate the need for cardiology consultation when indicated (Indications 2 and 3 of fig. 1).If a β-adrenergic blocker or other drug is started in the perioperative period, then the surgical team (the surgeon and the anesthesiologist) should assure a proper postoperative follow-up with either a cardiologist, an internist, or a family physician, so that if indicated, the patient may be continued on the medication on a long-term basis (fig. 2). Data on the benefit of continuing a β-adrenergic blocker or an α2agonist started perioperatively is currently lacking.In the ACC–AHA decision tree, no explicit consideration is given to the presence of a single intermediate clinical predictor of cardiac risk versus the presence of multiple intermediate clinical predictors. But the literature indicates that the perioperative risk of cardiac events increases with the number of risk factors. 33,34In a study of 4,315 patients undergoing elective major noncardiac surgeries, Lee et al. 33found six independent predictors of complications: high-risk surgery, history of CAD, history of CHF, history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative treatment with insulin, and preoperative creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl —mostly the same as the intermediate clinical predictors of the ACC–AHA guidelines. The presence of 0, 1, 2, or more than 3 of these risk factors was associated with 0.4, 0.9, 7, and 11% risks, respectively, of cardiac events. There was also a higher complication rate in patients with poor functional capacity (2.98 vs. 1.03% in those with good functional capacity, P &lt; 0.05). It may be noted that even in the study by Lee et al. , high-risk surgery itself is an independent predictor of risk and poor functional capacity is associated with a poor outcome. The importance of multiple intermediate clinical predictors can be taken into account, by changing Step 6 of the algorithm in figure 1from “Intermediate clinical predictor and poor functional capacity?” to “An intermediate clinical predictor and poor functional capacity” or “Two intermediate clinical predictors?” (fig. 3).In the ACC–AHA guidelines, coronary revascularization may be considered if the result of the invasive and/or noninvasive cardiac testing is positive for significant CAD. Revascularization either by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stenting or by coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) may confer long-term symptom-free survival benefit in certain patients with CAD (see section 1). 12–15However, to triage the patient to undergo coronary revascularization before noncardiac surgery to reduce the perioperative cardiac risk of the latter surgery, three conditions should be satisfied. These conditions are (1) that the combined risk of coronary angiography and coronary revascularization does not exceed the risk of the proposed noncardiac surgery performed without revascularization, (2) that coronary revascularization should significantly lower the cardiac risk of the subsequently performed noncardiac surgery, with the magnitude of risk reduction preferably greater than the risk of coronary angiography and revascularization, and (3) that the recovery time from coronary revascularization should be short enough so that the proposed noncardiac surgery, especially if it is urgent, is not unduly delayed. When these conditions are not met, any indicated revascularization may be performed after the noncardiac surgery.First then, one needs to know the risk of coronary angiography and revascularization, especially relative to the risk of the proposed noncardiac surgery performed without revascularization. Although the risk of coronary angiography and revascularization is expected to vary from one institution to the next, the national mortality rate from CABG in the U.S. was approximately 3% in 1998 *. The mortality was higher if the surgery was accompanied by a valve replacement (7% for CABG and aortic valve replacement and 12% for CABG and mitral valve replacement), if the surgery was emergent (6% for pristine emergent CABG and 13.5% for redo emergent CABG), for redo surgeries (5.4% for elective redo surgeries), for females (3.9 vs. 2.3% for males), and for the elderly (4.1% for those in their 70s and 6.7% for those in their 80s). It should be also noted that for patients with a major clinical predictor of cardiac risk such as unstable angina or evolving MI, the cardiac surgical intervention is likely to be performed emergently or urgently, thus raising the mortality and morbidity of CABG. For PTCA performed electively, the mortality from the procedure in 1996–1998 was 0.5% and another 0.5% had to be taken to urgent CABG, where the mortality may be as high as 8.8% if the time from PTCA to CABG is less than 6 h. 35For PTCA, however, one needs to consider not only the mortality associated with the procedure, but also its immediate success rate, since the procedure often results in inadequate recanalization of the stenotic or occluded coronary artery. The mortality and the immediate success rate of PTCA depend on the severity of the coronary lesion and the urgency with which the procedure is performed. 36For PTCA of coronary arteries with class IV lesions in the setting of an acute MI, the in-hospital mortality is over 3%, emergency CABG rate is over 3%, the rate of nonfatal major complications is nearly 8%, and the immediate success rate of PTCA is only 75%. A large number of these patients may be exposed to a significant risk with no immediate realized benefit when referred to PTCA. Conversely, elective PTCA of coronary arteries with class I lesions may carry a mortality of less than 0.5%, a nonfatal complication rate of 2%, and an immediate success rate of nearly 97%. Preferably one should be aware of the mortality and success rates for either CABG or PTCA under each specific situation at one's own institution or referral center when considering revascularization versus medical optimization and compare them to the risk of proceeding with the proposed noncardiac surgery without coronary revascularization. The latter information may not readily be available and the cardiologist consultant and the surgical team will be left to make the best “educated estimate.” The best estimate should then be compared with studies such as those of Poldermans et al. , 22,24which showed that patients with positive preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography who undergo high-risk surgery can have a relatively low 30-day mortality rate of 3.4% and nonfatal MI rate of 0% with perioperative use of a β-adrenergic blocker in the absence of revascularization.Second, one needs to ascertain that the cardiac risk of the proposed noncardiac surgery will be significantly lowered by prior cardiac intervention, whether by CABG or PTCA. Ideally, the magnitude of reduction in the risk of the noncardiac surgery should be equal to or greater than the risk of cardiac intervention. However, little data are available on the cardiac risk of major noncardiac surgery in patients who have major clinical predictors of cardiac risk or positive noninvasive cardiac tests indicative of the presence of uncorrected CAD and who then undergo the noncardiac surgery without prophylactic coronary revascularization. In one review of 30 patients undergoing urgent or emergent vascular surgeries within 6 weeks of a MI, the cardiac complication rate was 17%. 37Furthermore, no prospective, randomized, controlled trials have assessed the benefit of prophylactic coronary revascularization, either by CABG or PTCA, in lowering the perioperative cardiac risk of subsequent noncardiac surgery. On the other hand, several retrospective reviews indicate that those who survive CABG may have a reduced cardiac risk at the time of a subsequent noncardiac surgery and that this reduced risk may be comparable with that of those with no CAD. 23,38–41In the largest such review, Eagle et al. 23showed from a review of 1,961 patients of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study database that prior surgical revascularization is associated with a lower MI (0.8 vs. 2.7%) and death rate (1.7 vs. 3.3%) in subsequent high-risk noncardiac surgeries, compared with medical therapy alone. Evidence for the benefit of PTCA on subsequent noncardiac surgery is relatively sparse. Allen et al. 42reviewed 148 patients who underwent 193 noncardiac surgeries 4–1,867 days after PTCA and reported only one cardiac death, though four patients died overall. Such data suggests that PTCA may be protective against fatal cardiac events during subsequent noncardiac surgeries.A third prerequisite of prophylactic coronary revascularization is that its benefit should be realized in such a time frame that the proposed noncardiac surgery is not unduly delayed. Posner et al. 43reported that the risk of adverse cardiac outcomes after noncardiac surgery might be reduced by prior PTCA, but only if the interval between PTCA and the noncardiac surgery was greater than 90 days. Furthermore, Kaluza et al. 19noted that if a noncardiac surgery is performed within 40 days of PTCA with a stent, then the risk of stent thrombosis and death in the perioperative period might be prohibitively high (8 deaths [6 from MI and 2 from major bleeding complications] in 40 patients or 20% mortality in their report). A recent case report also describes a patient who had a cardiac arrest after nephrectomy 32 days after PTCA with stenting and required an emergent PTCA to reopen the thrombosed stent. 44Intracoronary stents are increasingly used in PTCA and recent technological advances in stenting and antiplatelet regimens have reduced the 30-day stent occlusion rate to as low as 0.5%. 45Typically, ticlodipine and aspirin are started 3–5 days before PTCA with stenting and continued for 14–30 days, depending on the risk of stent thrombosis. The risk of stent occlusion drops off sharply after the initial 30 days. Major surgery may be associated with activation of the procoagulant system and the risk of stent occlusion may be increased by surgical stresses. What may have been adequate antiplatelet therapy in the nonsurgical period may not prove adequate during the perioperative period. Thus, undergoing a major noncardiac surgery during the early poststenting period poses a significant dilemma in that discontinuation of the antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of stent thrombosis and MI while its continuation, with or without additional anticoagulant regimen such as heparin, increases the risk of major bleeding complications. In summary, the available data suggest that if the proposed noncardiac surgery cannot be delayed for 30 to 40 days after PTCA, then revascularization by PTCA may not be recommended to reduce the cardiac risk.Regarding the early post-CABG period, Reul et al. 46reported 2.7% cardiac death rate (overall mortality 3.9%) in 255 patients having a simultaneous CABG and a peripheral vascular surgery, 2.2% cardiac death rate (overall mortality 3.6%) in 279 patients having a CABG and then a peripheral vascular surgery 5 days to 3 weeks after CABG within the same hospitalization, and 0% cardiac death rate (0.2% overall mortality) in 559 patients who had a CABG and then a peripheral vascular surgery during a subsequent hospitalization (1 month to 10 yr after CABG). In our review of patients undergoing aortic or peripheral vascular bypass surgeries within a month of CABG (N = 36), their 30-day mortality was 19%, much higher than a historical control of a little over 1% in 4,210 other patients undergoing similar operations (P &lt; 0.05). 47These data suggest that if the patient requires a noncardiac surgery that cannot be delayed 30 days or longer and also has indications for coronary revascularization, performing coronary revascularization either by PTCA or CABG may not result in improved short-term survival. The anesthesiologist or the surgeon may ask a cardiology consultant to help determine whether to proceed with urgent noncardiac surgery with β-adrenergic blockade and consider coronary revascularization afterwards. However, such a determination will be based on the best “educated estimate,” rather than literature evidence.The ACC–AHA guidelines were derived from studies in which female patients were grossly underrepresented. 48Review of the Framingham Heart Study data showed that whereas men and women shared many cardiovascular risk factors, the significance of each factor was different between the genders. 49Women maintained a lesser probability of CAD at any level of the major cardiovascular risk factors than men did. Thus, what may constitute a major, intermediate, or minor predictor of perioperative cardiac risk for women may be different than for men. For example, whereas unstable angina is classified as a major clinical predictor and stable angina as an intermediate clinical predictor of cardiac risk in the ACC–AHA guidelines, it should be recognized that chest pain is a less reliable indicator of CAD in women. Nonatherosclerotic causes of chest pain such as mitral valve prolapse and coronary artery spasm are believed to be more prevalent in women than in men. Women are approximately three times as likely to have a negative angiogram compared to men, when referred to angiography for chest pain syndromes. 50–52The chance of an angiographically proven CAD in women with chest pain was less than 7%, if they had less than two risk factors for CAD, but was 55% if more than 2 risk factors were present. 52In applying the ACC–AHA guidelines (or their modification depicted in fig. 1of this review), one may need to require that (for example, at step 6 and 7 of fig. 1) women must have multiple intermediate clinical predictors before one considers cardiac testing with cardiology consultation. In addition, in women, history of chest pain that has not been demonstrated to be from CAD may not need to be considered an intermediate clinical predictor, unless multiple risk factors for CAD coexist.Shacklelford et al. 53performed a retrospective analysis of perioperative cardiac morbidity in 206 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery, of whom 168 were postmenopausal. In the postmenopausal subgroup, the Goldman cardiac risk index and the New York Heart Association functional classification were not useful predictors of perioperative cardiac morbidity. Neither were glucose intolerance, cardiac arrhythmia, and estrogen replacement therapy. Useful predictors of cardiac morbidity in this population were hypertension and a history of CAD, proven by previously documented MI, a history of exertional angina lasting more than 15 min responsive to nitrate therapy, or more than 70% occlusion on coronary angiogram. Note that in the ACC–AHA guidelines, uncontrolled hypertension is listed as a minor clinical predictor of risk. 5If the results of Shackleford et al. are duplicated and confirmed in other studies, the significance of hypertension in predicting perioperative cardiac risk may be greater in women than in men. In-hospital mortality rate following MI is higher in women than in men (17.5%vs. 12.3%), 54especially black women (48% mortality at 48 months), 55and reinfarction rate at 6 months is also higher in women than in men (19%vs. 12%). 55Thus, the significance of an acute MI as a major clinical predictor of perioperative cardiac risk may be even greater in women than in men.The criteria for a positive exercise stress test were developed for men. A positive exercise stress test in women is more likely to be false positive than in men, whereas a negative test in women who are able to exercise adequately is less likely to be a false negative than in men, mostly because of the lower prevalence of CAD among women. 56Additional problems with exercise stress testing that have been noted in women include a higher prevalence of electrocardiogram changes due to hyperventilation or position change and a lesser likelihood of exercising to adequate intensity levels owing to comorbid illnesses or general deconditioning. 57Simple exercise stress test as a preoperative screening test probably does not have a place in the evaluation of women, but should be accompanied by imaging modalities such as stress echocardiography or radionuclide angiography. 48In the ACC–AHA guidelines, a severe valvular disease is considered a major clinical predictor of cardiac risk and should lead to consideration of delay or cancellation of the proposed noncardiac surgery and consideration of cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, and/or possible valve surgery. Several review studies have suggested that in the case of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), they may undergo a noncardiac surgery with relative safety, as long as the perioperative care is provided with careful management of the pathophysiological changes associated with AS. O'Keefe et al. reported on their experience with 48 patients with severe AS (mean valve area 0.6 cm2) who were not candidates for, or refused, aortic valve replacement and who needed a noncardiac surgery. 58There was only one cardiac event with no deaths, for a complication rate of about 2%. This would compare favorably with the 4% mortality rate for aortic valve replacement reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons national database *. In a subsequent report of 19 patients with severe AS (mean valve area &lt; 0.5 cm2), however, the same group reported two perioperative deaths. 59More recently, Raymer and Yang compared 55 patients with significant AS (mean valve area 0.9 cm2) with case-matched controls with similar preoperative risk profiles other than AS undergoing similar surgeries. 60Cardiac complication rates were not significantly different between the groups. Thus patients with severe AS may undergo indicated noncardiac surgery safely, provided that the presence of severe AS is recognized and the patients receive intensive intraoperative and perioperative care with full knowledge of the implications of AS. For the algorithm of figure 1then, severe AS may be deleted from the list of major clinical predictors. Although a preoperative cardiac consultation may not be indicated for correction of AS, there should be an appropriate follow-up of AS postoperatively.Data are lacking regarding patients with severe mitral stenosis or severe valvular regurgitation who undergo noncardiac surgery without prior valve surgery. In case of patients with severe idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, Haering et al. reported that in their review of 77 such patients, there was a relatively high incidence of postoperative CHF (17%), but not of any irreversible cardiac morbidity and mortality. 61Any scheme for preoperative cardiac evaluation of patients should include a branch in the decision tree for cancellation of surgery. The ACC–AHA guidelines provide for possible cancellation of surgery in patients with a major clinical predictor of cardiac risk, but the guidelines are not specific concerning when the estimated operative risk is prohibitively high enough that the surgery should no longer be an option even after additional work-up and/or treatment. Such a prohibitive risk may be based on surgical variables and/or the patient's cardiac problems, and this may be an area where the cardiology consultant may help with triage decisions. Identification of factors that point to an extremely high perioperative risk will be important in rational management of medical resources and in assisting the patients and their family with proper planning and acceptance of outcome. Information regarding this issue is sorely lacking.Indications for cardiology consultation based on the ACC–AHA guidelines on preoperative cardiac evaluation have been presented, along with a critical review of some of the guideline items. Application of the algorithm requires that the physician initiating the consultation, whether an anesthesiologist or a surgeon, determine whether cardiology consultation is indicated, from considerations of presence or absence of clinical predictors, the patient's functional status, and the risk of the proposed surgery. In general, patients who require an emergent surgery should proceed to surgery with or without a preoperative cardiology consultation and may receive the consultant's input in the postoperative period as needed. For nonemergent noncardiac surgery, cardiology consultation may be indicated (1) for patients with a major clinical predictor of cardiac risk such as unstable coronary syndrome or evolving MI, (2) for patients who are undergoing a high-risk surgery, who have either poor functional status or an intermediate clinical predictor of cardiac risk such as stable angina, history of MI or CHF, diabetes mellitus, or chronic renal failure, and (3) for patients who are undergoing an intermediate-risk surgery, who have both poor functional status and an intermediate clinical predictor, or even in the absence of poor functional status, two or more intermediate clinical predictors. For patients with indications 2 or 3, revascularization within 5 yr or favorable cardiac evaluation within 2 yr with no significant interim changes in symptoms obviates the need for cardiology consultation. Also for these patients, β-adrenergic blockade in the perioperative period may lower their cardiac risk sufficiently. Patients who have been started on a β-adrenergic blockade perioperatively should have an appropriate follow-up with a cardiologist, an internist, or a family physician, so that β-adrenergic blockade may be continued on a long-term basis, if indicated. When a cardiology consultation is obtained, the relative risks and benefits of interventional versus medical treatments require investigation. Whenever obtaining cardiology consultation, the physician initiating the consultation should specify the reason for consultation and ask the consultant to delineate the relative risks and benefits of any further diagnostic or therapeutic steps and postoperative follow-up plan.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200303000-00027", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023646061", "source": "openalex"}

The survey was designed to be exploratory. Data were compared across specialties and geography. Results The overall response rate was 8.3%. Of the respondents, 43%, 30% and 27% were family physicians, cardiologists and oncologists, respectively. A strong majority of respondents agreed that genetic testing and PM can have a positive impact on their practice; however, only 51% agreed that there is sufficient evidence to order such tests. A low percentage of respondents felt that they were sufficiently informed and confident practicing in this area, although many reported that genetic tests they have ordered have benefited their patients. Half of the respondents agreed that genetic tests that would be useful in their practice are not readily available. A lack of practice guidelines, limited provider knowledge and lack of evidence-based clinical information were cited as the main barriers to practice.

Differences across specialties were observed for the state of practice, reported benefits and access to testing. Conclusions Canadian physicians recognise the benefits of genetic testing and PM; however, they lack the education, information and support needed to practice effectively in this area. Variability in practice and access to testing across specialties and across Canada was observed. These results support a need for national strategies and resources to facilitate physician knowledge, training and practice in PM.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000110", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2122448741", "source": "openalex"}

We here review data from RCTs with more than 1000 participants with and without a run-in period, which were included in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration. Two major conclusions arise: (i) the majority of RCTs did not have a test dose of a statin in the run-in phase. (ii) A test dose in the run-in phase was not associated with a significantly improved adherence rate within that trial when compared to trials without a test dose. Taken together, the RCTs of statins reviewed here do not suggest a bias towards an artificially higher adherence rate because of a run-in period with a test dose of the statin.

The characteristics and outcome of patients with HF have been described by several epidemiological studies and large scale clinical trials, performed mainly in the United States and Europe. Very little information is available on this issue in Japan. Methods and Results The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) is designed to prospectively study the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of a broad sample of patients hospitalized with HF at teaching hospitals throughout Japan between January 2004 to June 2005 and the outcomes, including death and hospital readmission, will be followed through 2006 (mean follow-up at least 1 year). Participating cardiologists identify patients admitted for worsening of HF symptoms. Demographics, medical history, severity, treatment, and outcome data are collected and entered into a database via secure web browser technology. As of June 2005, baseline data for 2,676 patients with HF have been registered from 164 participating hospitals. Conclusions The JCARE-CARD will provide important insights into the management of patients with HF in routine clinical practice in Japan, thus providing the framework for improved management strategies for these patients.

This is in part due to insufficient patient stratification and lack of individualized therapy planning, resulting in less effective treatments and a significant number of non-responders.State-of-the-art clinical phenotyping was acquired, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biomarker assessment. An individualized, multi-scale model of heart function covering cardiac anatomy, electrophysiology, biomechanics and hemodynamics was estimated using a robust framework. The model was computed on n=46 HF patients, showing for the first time that advanced multi-scale models can be fitted consistently on large cohorts. Novel multi-scale parameters derived from the model of all cases were analyzed and compared against clinical parameters, cardiac imaging, lab tests and survival scores to evaluate the explicative power of the model and its potential for better patient stratification. Model validation was pursued by comparing clinical parameters that were not used in the fitting process against model parameters.This paper illustrates how advanced multi-scale models can complement cardiovascular imaging and how they could be applied in patient care. Based on obtained results, it becomes conceivable that, after thorough validation, such heart failure models could be applied for patient management and therapy planning in the future, as we illustrate in one patient of our cohort who received CRT-D implantation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134869", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1072488465", "source": "openalex"}

Images from fluoroscopy (low, medium and high) and cine modes have been archived in digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), figure of merit (FOM), contrast (CO), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and high contrast spatial resolution (HCSR) have been computed from the images.

Knowledge of the conduction system of the heart was greatly advanced by Tawara's work carried out in Aschoff's laboratory in Marburg at the beginning of this century. In his monograph, The Conduction System of the Mammalian Heart, published in 1906, Tawara indicated that the treelike structure of specific muscle fibers comprising the atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers served as the pathway for atrioventricular conduction of excitation in the mammalian heart. From his own anatomic and histological findings of the conduction system, he assumed precisely that the conduction velocity of excitation in the system, except in the atrioventricular node, would be fast and that contraction as the result of excitation would take place at the various sites of the ventricles almost simultaneously. According to Tawara, a long pathway to each contracting unit and a fast conduction velocity of excitation would be a prerequisite for the effective contraction of the ventricles. Tawara's findings and assumptions provided Einthoven the theoretical basis for interpreting the electrocardiogram, resulting in rapid popularization of electrocardiography. This century has witnessed the rapid progress of cardiology, including cardiac pacing and its related sciences. This progress has its roots in the discovery of the conduction system and the development of electrocardiography that took place almost in the same period at the beginning of this century.

The prevention of CIN is critical if long-term outcomes are to be optimized after percutaneous coronary intervention. The prevalence of CIN in patients receiving contrast varies markedly (from <1% to 50%), depending on the presence of well characterized risk factors, the most important of which are baseline chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus. Other risk factors include advanced age, anemia, left ventricular dysfunction, dehydration, hypotension, renal transplant, low serum albumin, concomitant use of nephrotoxins, and the volume of contrast agent. The pathophysiology of CIN is likely to be multifactorial, including direct cytotoxicity, apoptosis, disturbances in intrarenal hemodynamics, and immune mechanisms. Few strategies have been shown to be effective to prevent CIN beyond hydration, the goal of which is to establish brisk diuresis prior to contrast administration, and to avoid hypotension. New strategies of controlled hydration and diuresis are promising. Studies are mixed on whether prophylactic oral N-acetylcysteine reduces the incidence of CIN, although its use is generally recommended, given its low cost and favorable side effect profile.

A joint EACVI/Brazilian cardiovascular imaging writing group committee has prepared these recommendations to provide a practical guide to echocardiographers involved in the follow-up of heart transplant patients and a framework for standardized and efficient use of cardiovascular imaging after heart transplant. Since the transplanted heart is smaller than the recipient's dilated heart, the former is usually located more medially in the mediastinum and tends to be rotated clockwise. Therefore, standard views with conventional two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography are often difficult to obtain generating a large variability from patient to patient. Therefore, in echocardiography laboratories equipped with three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) scanners and specific expertise with the technique, 3DE may be a suitable alternative to conventional 2D echocardiography to assess the size and the function of cardiac chambers. 3DE measurement of left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) size and function are more accurate and reproducible than conventional 2D calculations. However, clinicians should be aware that cardiac chamber volumes obtained with 3DE cannot be compared with those obtained with 2D echocardiography. To assess cardiac chamber morphology and function during follow-up studies, it is recommended to obtain a comprehensive echocardiographic study at 6 months from the cardiac transplantation as a baseline and make a careful quantitation of cardiac chamber size, RV systolic function, both systolic and diastolic parameters of LV function, and pulmonary artery pressure. Subsequent echocardiographic studies should be interpreted in comparison with the data obtained from the 6-month study. An echocardiographic study, which shows no change from the baseline study, has a high negative predictive value for GR. There is no single systolic or diastolic parameter that can be reliably used to diagnose GR. However, in case several parameters are abnormal, the likelihood of GR increases. When an abnormality is detected, careful revision of images of the present and baseline study (side-by-side) is highly recommended. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a suitable parameter to diagnose subclinical allograft dysfunction, regardless of aetiology, by comparing the changes occurring during serial evaluations. Evaluation of GLS could be used in association with endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) to characterize and monitor an acute GR or global dysfunction episode. RV size and function at baseline should be assessed using several parameters, which do not exclusively evaluate longitudinal function. At follow-up echocardiogram, all these parameters should be compared with the baseline values. 3DE may provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of RV size and function. Moreover, due to the unpredictable shape of the atria in transplanted patients, atrial volume should be measured using the discs' summation algorithm (biplane algorithm for the left atrium) or 3DE. Tricuspid regurgitation should be looked for and properly assessed in all echocardiographic studies. In case of significant changes in severity of tricuspid regurgitation during follow-up, a 2D/3D and colour Doppler assessment of its severity and mechanisms should be performed. Aortic and mitral valves should be evaluated according to current recommendations. Pericardial effusion should be serially evaluated regarding extent, location, and haemodynamic impact. In case of newly detected pericardial effusion, GR should be considered taking into account the overall echocardiographic assessment and patient evaluation. Dobutamine stress echocardiography might be a suitable alternative to routine coronary angiography to assess cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) at centres with adequate experience with the methodology. Coronary flow reserve and/or contrast infusion to assess myocardial perfusion might be combined with stress echocardiography to improve the accuracy of the test. In addition to its role in monitoring cardiac chamber function and in diagnosis the occurrence of GR and/or CAV, in experienced centres, echocardiography might be an alternative to fluoroscopy to guide EMB, particularly in children and young women, since echocardiography avoids repeated X-ray exposure, permits visualization of soft tissues and safer performance of biopsies of different RV regions. Finally, in addition to the indications about when and how to use echocardiography, the document also addresses the role of the other cardiovascular imaging modalities during follow-up of heart transplant patients. In patients with inadequate acoustic window and contraindication to contrast agents, pharmacological SPECT is an alternative imaging modality to detect CAV in heart transplant patients. However, in centres with adequate expertise, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in conjunction with coronary angiography with a baseline study at 4–6 weeks and at 1 year after heart transplant should be performed to exclude donor coronary artery disease, to detect rapidly progressive CAV, and to provide prognostic information. Despite the fact that coronary angiography is the current gold-standard method for the detection of CAV, the use of IVUS should also be considered when there is a discrepancy between non-invasive imaging tests and coronary angiography concerning the presence of CAV. In experienced centres, computerized tomography coronary angiography is a good alternative to coronary angiography to detect CAV. In patients with a persistently high heart rate, scanners that provide high temporal resolution, such as dual-source systems, provide better image quality. Finally, in patients with insufficient acoustic window, cardiac magnetic resonance is an alternative to echocardiography to assess cardiac chamber volumes and function and to exclude acute GR and CAV in a surveillance protocol.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jev139", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2264601516", "source": "openalex"}

Moreover, clinical decision support systems in cardiology have improved significantly over the past decade. The addition of AI to these clinical decision support systems can improve patient outcomes by processing large amounts of data, identifying subtle associations, and providing a timely, evidence-based recommendation to healthcare professionals. Lastly, the application of AI allows for personalized care by utilizing predictive models and generating patient-specific treatment plans. However, there are several challenges associated with the use of AI in healthcare. The application of AI in healthcare comes with significant cost and ethical considerations.

Identifying disparities in research productivity and acknowledgment can highlight barriers to female representation in academic cardiology leadership, as well as in academic promotion. Methods and Results: This bibliometric analysis included all authors of original research articles between 1980 and 2017 from 3 high-impact cardiology journals ( Journal of the American College of Cardiology , Circulation , and European Heart Journal ). We identified 71 345 unique authors of 55 085 primary research articles during our study period. Female authors accounted for 33.1% of all authors; however, they represented only 26.7% of first authors and 19.7% of senior authors. Looking at the most prolific authors within this time period, female authors were not well represented, accounting for only 5% of the top 100 authors. Articles with a female senior author had more female middle authors than articles with a male senior author (mean 1.41 versus 0.97, P &lt;0.001) and were more likely to have a female first author (0.37 versus 0.18, P &lt;0.001). There was an increased representation of female authors as first and senior authors compared with the total number of articles with female authors over time ( P &lt;0.001 for trend); however, female senior authorship rates continued to lag first authorship rates. Conclusions: Using a large database of published manuscripts, we found that female representation in published cardiology research has increased over the past 4 decades. However, women continue to be not well represented as first authors, senior authors, and in the number of publications. When women were senior authors, they published more articles with female first authors and had more female authors.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2105646251", "title": "Radiation exposure in invasive cardiology", "text": "Mean patient dose area products (DAP) in invasive cardiology are high and for specific interventional procedures vary greatly. For this reason patients may face serious radiation injuries and an increased risk of cancer in the future. Such increased risk is due less to inappropriate equipment than to inadequate operational technique and a lack of awareness of the potential for injury by individual cardiac interventionists. This article focuses on the “as low as reasonably achievable” (ALARA) principle in invasive cardiology from the viewpoint of an experienced cardiologist, analysing the ranking and interdependency of those factors which influence patient radiation exposure—adequate length and number of radiographic runs, consistent collimation, adequate instead of best possible image quality, and basic knowledge about less irradiating angulations. Training in techniques to reduce radiation exposure enables patient doses to be achieved that are far below those used in non-invasive coronary imaging such as multislice computed tomography (MSCT). In addition, improved lead shielding is effective in maintaining operator radiation exposure below 1% of typical levels in advanced catheterisation laboratories. Traditional radiological convictions, misinterpreted and misleading since the early times of fluoroscopy guided cardiac interventions, will be disclosed and discussed. As early as 1925, FM Groedel, founder of both the German Cardiac Society and the American College of Cardiology, identified the following factors as playing a role in the adverse effects of x rays: excessively long fluoroscopic examinations, short focus skin distances, insufficient filtering of the x ray beam, and, not least, excessive numbers of radiographs made by insufficiently trained operators and assistants.1 In invasive cardiology, however, up to now these problems have been underappreciated: directives from the International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) point out that “Unfortunately there is growing evidence that many interventionists have a less than ideal understanding of the risks of radiation-induced injuries from …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/hrt.2007.125021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105646251", "source": "openalex"}

Standards for appropriate modeling, risk adjustment, and evaluation (\"scorecarding\") in this setting are not well developed, although such evaluation is being performed by the medical insurance industry and by several states in the United States. Our objectives were to develop and examine clinically meaningful methodology for assessing the operator-specific results for percutaneous coronary revascularization.From a multicenter database of patients treated since January 1, 1990, we used training and validation samples (n = 4860) to develop several models for risk adjustment and applied them to 38 providers performing 25 to 523 procedures in the database. Models were developed using multivariable logistic regression techniques for combinations of the end points of death, myocardial infarction, bypass surgery, and procedural success. Models were evaluated for predictive accuracy by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, for the capacity to discriminate between superior and inferior provider outcomes, and for subjectivity and concordance. Major complications occurred in 3.6% of patients. The area under the ROC curve (with perfect discriminatory accuracy, area = 1.0; with no apparent accuracy, area = 0.5) in the validation sample, and frequency of identification of operators with outcomes outside the 95% CI for the outcome in question for the models were for death, 0.85 and 7.9%; for death, Q-wave infarction, and bypass surgery, 0.77 and 13.2%; for death, all infarction, and bypass surgery, 0.66 and 10.5%; and for procedural success, 0.76 and 23.7%. For the models as a group, identification of outliers was inversely related to provider volume (P = .05). Models evaluating non-Q-wave infarction or requiring measurement of percent diameter stenosis were identified as being most susceptible to provider manipulation.For percutaneous coronary revascularization, modeling to discriminate between provider outcomes is limited by the low incidence of major adverse events, subjectivity or susceptibility to manipulation of more frequently occurring adverse events, the generally modest predictive capacity of the models, and the low volume of individual provider treatments. Modeling will be most useful in the identification of providers with extremely poor outcomes and for discrimination between providers with very large procedural volume. Until improved understanding of the biological and mechanical correlates of major complications allows the development of more predictive models, interpretation of the results of scorecarding, particularly for low-volume providers, should be made with caution.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.93.3.431", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2050724828", "source": "openalex"}

A contribution to the problem from a theoretical point of view.", "text": "BACKGROUND Recent clinical studies have proposed standard deviation of heart rate as a diagnostic tool for the outcome of cardiac infarction. Mathematical analysis of heart rate variability shows that heart rate is influenced by different frequency components derived from different parts of the autonomous nervous system. In the experimental part of this study, we investigated the possibility of calculating a variable describing the parasympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system exclusively. METHODS AND RESULTS In 60 healthy volunteers, heart rate was measured to 1 millisecond during two different conditions: 5 minutes of rest, and 5 minutes of intermittent handgrip dynamometry; the latter is known to increase sympathetic arousal selectively. Heart rate was found to be lower at rest (65.9 +/- 9.7 beats per minute) than during dynamometry (72.8 +/- 10.4 beats per minute, P &lt; .001). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) calculated from the mean absolute differences between successive heart beats showed no significant change (3.01 +/- 1.62 beats per minute at rest versus 2.97 +/- 1.30 beats per minute during dynamometry). In contrast, standard deviation increased from 5.19 +/- 1.98 to 9.22 +/- 3.56 beats per minute (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS It can be concluded from these data as well as from other plots presented in this article that RSA is a measure of the parasympathetic vagal tone, whereas standard deviation is increased by both sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal. Clinical evidence and data from physiological experiments are presented to show that a selective measure of vagal tone like RSA may offer advantages over standard deviation as a prognostic tool in cardiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.90.2.1078", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006917635", "source": "openalex"}

Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive changes, and diminished functional capacity, along with changes in the social environment, result in complexity that makes provision of CVD care to older adults challenging. In this review, we first describe the history of geriatric cardiology, an orientation that acknowledges the unique needs of older adults with CVD. Then, we introduce 5 essential principles for meeting the needs of older adults with CVD: 1) recognize and consider the potential impact of multicomplexity; 2) evaluate and integrate constructs of cognition into decision-making; 3) evaluate and integrate physical function into decision-making; 4) incorporate social environmental factors into management decisions; and 5) elicit patient priorities and health goals and align with care plan. Finally, we review future steps to maximize care provision to this growing population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacadv.2022.100070", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4293795642", "source": "openalex"}

Low osmolar contrast media (LOCM), both ionic and nonionic, have been considered to be safer than the older high osmolar contrast media (HOCM), causing less haemodynamic and symptomatic side effects. Recently, however, nonionic LOCM have been associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events, including coronary occlusion and stroke.The effects of commonly used contrast media on platelets in native blood were investigated using immunolabeling and flow cytometry to detect platelet activation in vitro. A nonionic LOCM (Omnipaque) caused profound platelet degranulation in nearly 80% of platelets compared with 2 to 3% of platelets in the control. Conversely, an ionic HOCM (Urografin) caused only 25% degranulation, whereas an ionic LOCM (Hexabrix) caused no platelet activation and, furthermore, it inhibited the effects of thrombin on platelets. Platelet degranulation, quantified by immunolabeling, was paralleled by release of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 from platelet alpha-granules. Blood from patients anticoagulated with heparin and pretreated with standard-dose aspirin in preparation for PTCA showed the same pattern of contrast media-induced platelet activation as normal subjects.These results suggest that the type of contrast media used during invasive imaging of the vasculature could have a significant effect on platelets. Platelet degranulation within a PTCA-damaged vessel would be increased by a nonionic contrast medium, releasing procoagulant molecules and platelet-derived growth factors into the damaged vessel lumen, which might contribute to acute thrombosis and the initiation of the restenosis process.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.88.5.2035", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980027150", "source": "openalex"}

This reduction will have important implications for interventional cardiology and radiology (IC/IR) personnel. In this work, lens dose received by a staff working in IC is studied in order to determine whether eye lens dose monitoring or/and additional radiological protection measures are required. Eye lens dose exposure was monitored in 10 physicians and 6 nurses. The major IC procedures performed were coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The personnel were provided with two thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs): one calibrated in terms of Hp(3) located close to the left ear of the operator and a whole-body dosemeter calibrated in terms of Hp(10) and Hp(0.07) positioned on the lead apron. The estimated annual eye lens dose for physicians ranged between 8 and 60 mSv, for a workload of 200 procedures y−1. Lower doses were collected for nurses, with estimated annual Hp(3) between 2 and 4 mSv y−1. It was observed that for nurses the Hp(0.07) measurement on the lead apron is a good estimate of eye lens dose. This is not the case for physicians, where the influence of both the position and use of protective devices such as the ceiling shield is very important and produces large differences among doses both at the eyes and on the thorax. For physicians, a good correlation between Hp(3) and dose area product is shown.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/rpd/ncv051", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2333778040", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W160478579", "title": "Behavioral cardiology --has its time finally arrived?", "text": "Traditional cardiology has taken a mechanistic approach to heart disease. But the new discipline of behavioral cardiology takes a broader view, concluding that heart disease is not inevitable, but develops largely from unhealthy lifestyles, such as smoking, overeating and physical inactivity, and from psychosocial stress. Physical inactivity and excessive caloric intake are also responsible for the epidemic of obesity, which is associated with a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes. This increase in the incidence of diabetes may, in turn, reverse the recent decline of cardiovascular deaths in the US. A variety of psychosocial stressors have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease. These include occupational stress, anxiety, social isolation, hostility, anger, and type A behavior. There is clearly some overlap between these stressors, all of which may affect the heart adversely. Both the lifestyle and psychosocial factors can be altered by behavioral treatment, in which the patient and the practitioner work together. Unfortunately, various barriers can impair the successful implementation of behavioral treatment. These barriers include poor compliance by the patient, lack of skill in providing effective interventions by the health care provider, and lack of incentives within the health care system, particularly reimbursement.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W160478579", "source": "openalex"}

While elite athletes are training to ever more rigorous schedules, our middle aged sedentary population, no doubt seeing the writing on the wall, are hurrying to sign up for the fashionable, local fitness centres. When talking about athletes' hearts, we must distinguish between elite athletes, recreational sports men and women, non-athletes who wish to maintain cardiovascular fitness, and athletic patients with known cardiovascular disease. This article is mainly about athletes with serious sporting ambitions at club or higher level, who train most days for more than one hour. I will make it clear when I am referring to other types of athletes. A regular training programme causes favourable changes in skeletal muscle performance (the realm of the sports physiologist) and two clear cut cardiovascular effects—namely, enlargement of the heart and a slow pulse rate at rest. These are the components of a characteristic clinical picture known as the “athlete's heart”.1 Athletes, as a group, tend to be somewhat introspective about their health and will frequently consult doctors complaining of palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, chest pain, and undue dyspnoea. Physical examination may reveal some unusual signs, which will do little to reassure the doctor, already aware of widely publicised high profile cases of sudden death in association with sporting activity. The finding of an apparently abnormal ECG will cause further anxiety. A knowledge of the characteristic features of the athlete's heart is therefore important if the patient is to be advised wisely.2 Regular training causes the heart to enlarge. This is the result of a combination of left ventricular cavity enlargement (dilatation) and increased wall thickness (hypertrophy). The stimuli and processes involved are complex but appear to be akin to the normal growth of the heart in childhood.3 …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heart.86.6.722", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2619213048", "source": "openalex"}

It is classically defined as a relative (≥25%) or absolute (≥0.5 mg/dl; 44 μmol/l) increase in serum creatinine from baseline value. CIN accounts for 10 to 15% of hospital-acquired acute renal failure and may rarely lead to irreversible renal function loss. Following percutaneous coronary intervention, reported incidence of CIN varies between 0 to more than 20%, depending on the prevalence of risk factors and used definition. Nowadays, the diagnosis of CIN relays on serum creatinine monitoring, although it is a late marker of acute kidney injury. Given the expanding number of percutaneous coronary interventions made in outpatient settings and the morbidity and mortality associated with CIN, early detection of CIN is of utmost clinical relevance. Several plasmatic and urinary biomarkers have been studied in that view, with plasmatic cystatine-C and urinary NGAL being the most promising. As no treatment specifically targets CIN once it develops, the main goal for clinicians remains prevention, with hydration status optimisation being the only proven strategy to date. Here, we will review the recent evidence concerning CIN, its incidence, proposed early diagnostic biomarkers, as well as its treatment and prognostic implication.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2012.13608", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063919334", "source": "openalex"}

This study was designed to determine the attitudes of physicians toward preoperative cardiology consultations and to assess the effect of such consultations on perioperative management. A multiple-choice survey regarding the purposes and utility of cardiology consultations was sent to randomly selected New York metropolitan area anesthesiologists, surgeons, and cardiologists. In addition, the charts of 55 consecutive patients aged >50 yr who received preoperative cardiology consultations were examined to determine the stated purpose of the consult, recommendations made, and concordance by surgeons and anesthesiologists with cardiologists' recommendations. Of the 400 surveys sent to each specialty, 192 were returned from anesthesiologists, 113 were returned from surgeons, and 129 were returned from cardiologists. There was substantial disagreement on the importance and purposes of a cardiology consult: intraoperative monitoring, \"clearing the patient for surgery,\" and advising as to the safest type of anesthesia were regarded as important by most cardiologists and surgeons but as unimportant by anesthesiologists (all P < 0.05). Most surgeons (80.2%) felt obligated to follow a cardiologist's recommendations, whereas few anesthesiologists (16.6%) felt so obligated (P < 0.05). The most commonly stated purpose of the 55 cardiology consultations examined was \"preoperative evaluation.\" Only 5 of these (9%) were obtained for patients in whom there was a new finding. Of the cardiology consultations, 40% contained no recommendations other than \"proceed with case,\" \"cleared for surgery,\" or \"continue current medications.\" Recommendations regarding intraoperative monitoring or cardiac medications were largely ignored. Implications: We conclude that there seems to be considerable disagreement among anesthesiologists, cardiologists, and surgeons as to the purposes and utility of cardiology consultations. A review of 55 consecutive cardiology consultations suggests that most of them give little advice that truly affects management.

Each search strategy was coded to indicate what elements were reported and whether the overall search was reproducible. Reporting and reproducibility rates were compared across disciplines and we measured the influence of librarian/search specialist involvement, discipline or endorsement of a reporting guideline on search reproducibility.272 articles from 25 journals were included. Reporting of search elements ranged widely from 91% of articles naming search terms to 33% providing a full search strategy and 22% indicating the date the search was executed. Only 22% of articles provided at least one reproducible search strategy and 13% provided a reproducible strategy for all databases searched in the article.

In the multivariable analysis, only discipline (Pediatrics) was a significant predictor of the inclusion of a reproducible search strategy.Despite recommendations to report full, reproducible search strategies, many articles still do not. In addition, authors often report a single strategy as covering all databases searched, further decreasing reproducibility.

Many types of drugs are used by athletes to enhance performance, to reduce anxiety, to increase muscle mass, to reduce weight or to mask the use of other drugs during testing. However, the abuse of doping substances and methods has been associated with the occurrence of numerous health side-effects. The adverse effects depend on the type of the consumed drug, as well as the amount and duration of intake and the sensitivity of the body, since there is a large inter-individual variability in responses to a drug. Usually the doses used in sports are much higher than those used for therapeutic purposes and the use of several drugs in combination is frequent, leading to higher risk of side-effects. Among biomedical side-effects of doping, the cardiovascular ones are the most deleterious. Myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, thrombosis, arrythmogenesis, heart failure and sudden cardiac death have been noted following drug abuse.

Cardiology fellowship program directors play a critical role in shaping the cardiology workforce. Methods and Results To assess program directors' perceptions about diversity and barriers to enhancing diversity, the authors conducted a survey of 513 fellowship program directors or associate directors from 193 unique adult cardiology fellowship training programs. The response rate was 21% of all individuals (110/513) representing 57% of US general adult cardiology training programs (110/193). While 69% of respondents endorsed the belief that diversity is a driver of excellence in health care, only 26% could quote 1 to 2 references to support this statement. Sixty-three percent of respondents agreed that \"our program is diverse already so diversity does not need to be increased.\" Only 6% of respondents listed diversity as a top 3 priority when creating the cardiovascular fellowship rank list. Conclusions These findings suggest that while program directors generally believe that diversity enhances quality, they are less familiar with the literature that supports that contention and they may not share a unified definition of \"diversity.\" This may result in diversity enhancement having a low priority. The authors propose several strategies to engage fellowship training program directors in efforts to diversify cardiology fellowship training programs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.017196", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3081242031", "source": "openalex"}

Because rare, but devastating skin injuries have occurred, radiation should be monitored and managed as well as drugs or radiographic contrast media. Dose metrics such as the total dose delivered to a reference point (reference point dose) should be used for this purpose. Fluoroscopy time is a poor independent predictor of skin dose in an individual patient. The concept of a “significant dose” is introduced. This is a predetermined action level of the selected dose metric. The numerical value is set based on classes of patient and procedural factors. Exceeding this value triggers processes for clinical justification of radiation usage and patient follow‐up. Slightly exceeding the significant dose threshold during a procedure should be highly unlikely to cause skin injury. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.21141", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149438738", "source": "openalex"}

Cross-sectional studies demonstrate that women are often underrepresented in key leadership roles. We sought to examine the proportion of women in cardiology leadership positions and to compare the findings with the differences prevalent in the overall cardiology faculty. Furthermore, we aspired to compare the proportion of women in leadership positions to the proportion in which they entered the cardiology field. Methods: This is a cross-sectional online study of Cardiology fellowship programs identified by American Medical Association's Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (AMA FREIDA), conducted from March to April 2017. Data of all (n = 512) cardiology fellowship program directors as well as 69% (n = 140) cardiology division chiefs were collected. Results: A lower percentage of women held the role of division chief (5% vs. 95%) and program director (14% vs. 86%). However, when compared to the proportion of women in the 1992 fellowship cohort, women were significantly overrepresented in the role of program directors, with no significant difference in representation at the level of division chief. When compared to the overall cardiology faculty, program directors had significantly more publications and were more likely to have an academic rank of full professor (40% vs. 28%) or associate professor (37% vs. 23%). Male program directors had a significantly higher number of research publications, H-index, and academic rank than their female counterparts; however, such difference was not seen at the level of division chief. Conclusions: Gender difference is present in both program director and division chief roles. However, when compared to the historical cohort, significant overrepresentation of women was seen in the program director position, while proportionate representation was seen in the division chief role.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2018.7135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2907442043", "source": "openalex"}

A patient survey was performed to investigate the radiation doses delivered by the X-ray systems. Finally, methods of technique optimization regarding the new digital system were investigated. Dose rates in all fluoroscopic and cine modes were measured and image quality assessed using a dedicated test tool. 200 patients were investigated, half using the conventional and half using the digital FPF system. Patient data collected were: sex, age, weight, height, dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time (T) and total number of frames (F). Our results are: (1) Digital FPF system: high contrast resolution (HCR) is not affected by fluoroscopic mode, whereas low contrast resolution (LCR) is slightly decreased in the low mode. (2) The digital FPF system has 2.5 times better HCR than the conventional system, with 5 times lower dose in the fluoroscopy mode. (3) Median values of DAP, T and F, respectively, in coronary angiography (CA) are: 27.7 Gycm(2), 4.1 min and 876 for the digital and 39.3 Gycm(2), 5.3 min and 1600 for the conventional system. Median values for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) are: 51.1 Gycm(2), 12.7 min and 1184 for the digital and 44.3 Gycm(2), 7.4 min and 1936 for the conventional system. Digital DAP in CA is reduced by 30%, suggesting that a dose reduction in the FPF system is possible. The results of the study concerning the FPF system lead to the conclusion that the lowest fluoroscopic mode and the lowest frame rate should be used in routine practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr/83257582", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152944904", "source": "openalex"}

Basic Life Support involves cardiovascular emergency treatment mainly in the pre-hospital environment, with emphasis on the early recognition and delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers focused on high-quality thoracic compressions and rapid defibrillation by means of the implementation of public access-to-defibrillation programs. These aspects are of the utmost importance and may make the difference on the patient's outcomes, such as on hospital survival with no permanent neurological damage. Early initiation of the Advanced Cardiology Life Support also plays an essential role by keeping the quality of thoracic compressions; adequate airway management; specific treatment for the different arrest rhythms; defibrillation; and assessment and treatment of the possible causes during all the assistance. More recently, emphasis has been given to post-resuscitation care, with the purpose of reducing mortality by means of early recognition and treatment of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Therapeutic hypothermia has provided significant improvement of neurological damage and should be performed in comatose individuals post-cardiac arrest. For physicians working in the emergency department or intensive care unit, it is extremely important to improve the treatment given to these patients by means of specific training, thus giving them the chance of higher success and of better survival rates.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5935/abc.20130022", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1855002767", "source": "openalex"}

In many countries hospitals are now undergoing accreditation as mandatory or voluntary measures. It is believed but unproven that accreditations positively influence quality of care and patient satisfaction. The present study aims to assess in a defined specialty (cardiology) the relationship between patient satisfaction (as measured by the recommendation rate) and accreditation status. Methods Consecutive patients discharged from 25 cardiology units received a validated patient satisfaction questionnaire. Data from 3,037 patients (response rate &gt; 55%) became available for analysis. Recommendation rate was used as primary endpoint. Different control variables such as staffing level were considered. Results The 15 accredited units did not differ significantly from the 10 non-accredited units regarding main hospital (i.e. staffing levels, no. of beds) and patient (age, gender) characteristics. The primary endpoint \"recommendation rate of a given hospital\" for accredited hospitals (65.6%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 63.4 - 67.8%) and hospitals without accreditation (65.8%, 95% CI 63.1 - 68.5%) was not significantly different. Conclusion Our results support the notion that - at least in the field of cardiology - successful accreditation is not linked with measurable better quality of care as perceived by the patient and reflected by the recommendation rate of a given institution. Hospital accreditation may represent a step towards quality management, but does not seem to improve overall patient satisfaction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-10-120", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009904189", "source": "openalex"}

Cardiology is among many of the specialties that utilize AI with the intention of improving patient care. Generative AI, with the use of its advanced machine learning algorithms, has the potential to diagnose heart disease and recommend management options suitable for the patient. This may lead to improved patient outcomes not only by recommending the best treatment plan but also by increasing physician efficiency. Language models could assist physicians with administrative tasks, allowing them to spend more time on patient care. However, there are several concerns with the use of AI and language models in the field of medicine. These technologies may not be the most up-to-date with the latest research and could provide outdated information, which may lead to an adverse event. Secondly, AI tools can be expensive, leading to increased healthcare costs and reduced accessibility to the general population. There is also concern about the loss of the human touch and empathy as AI becomes more mainstream. Healthcare professionals would need to be adequately trained to utilize these tools. While AI and language models have many beneficial traits, all healthcare providers need to be involved and aware of generative AI so as to assure its optimal use and mitigate any potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation.

Methods and Results We performed a nationwide retrospective trend study using segmented regression analysis of the interrupted time series. The patient data were obtained via the national healthcare insurance database, which collects all the diagnoses nationwide. We compared the data before and after the introduction of the 2009 ESC guideline. Between 2005 and 2011, a total of 5213 patients were hospitalized with IE in the Netherlands. During this period, there was a significant increase in IE from 30.2 new cases per 1 000 000 in 2005 to 62.9 cases per 1 000 000 in 2011 (P &amp;lt; 0.001).

The antiarrhythmic potential of upstream therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, and n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, extends beyond the benefit of treating underlying heart disease to modifying the atrial substrate and intervening in specific mechanisms of AF. The key target is structural remodelling of the atria, particularly inflammation and fibrosis, although there is evidence to suggest the direct involvement at the ion channel level. Positive clinical reports supported by robust experimental data have suggested that upstream therapies can be valuable strategies for primary prevention of AF in selected patients and have resulted in several class IIA recommendations in the new European guidelines on AF. However, these results have not been consistently replicated in the secondary prevention setting, and several recent randomized controlled studies failed to demonstrate any effect of upstream therapies on AF burden or on major cardiovascular outcomes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report from the EuroObservational Research Programme-Atrial Fibrillation (EORP-AF) Pilot General Registry, we describe the associated baseline features of 'high risk' AF patients in relation to guideline-adherent antithrombotic treatment, i.e. whether they were adherent, over-treated, or under-treated based on the 2012 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Secondly, we assessed the predictors of guideline-adherent antithrombotic treatment. Thirdly, we evaluated outcomes for all-cause mortality, TE, bleeding, and the composite endpoint of 'any TE, cardiovascular death or bleeding' in relation to whether they were ESC guideline-adherent treatment. From the EORP-AF cohort, the follow-up dataset of 2634 subjects was used to assess the impact of guideline adherence or non-adherence. Of these, 1602 (60.6%) were guideline adherent, whilst 458 (17.3%) were under-treated, and 574 (21.7%) were over-treated. Non-guideline-adherent treatment can be related to region of Europe as well as associated clinical features, but not age, AF type, symptoms, or echocardiography indices. Over-treatment per se was associated with symptoms, using the EHRA score, as well as other comorbidities. Guideline-adherent antithrombotic management based on the ESC guidelines is associated with significantly better outcomes. Specifically, the endpoint of 'all cause death and any TE' is increased by >60% by undertreatment [hazard ratio (HR) 1.679 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.202-2.347)] or over-treatment [HR 1.622 (95% CI 1.173-2.23)]. For the composite endpoint of 'cardiovascular death, any TE or bleeding', over-treatment increased risk by >70% [HR 1.722 (95% CI 1.200-2.470)]. CONCLUSION: Even in this cohort with high overall rates of oral anticoagulation use, ESC guideline-adherent antithrombotic management is associated with significantly better outcomes, including those related to mortality and TE, as well as the composite endpoint of 'cardiovascular death, any TE or bleeding'.

A multiple-choice survey regarding the purposes and utility of cardiology consultations was sent to randomly selected New York metropolitan area anesthesiologists, surgeons, and cardiologists. In addition, the charts of 55 consecutive patients aged >50 yr who received preoperative cardiology consultations were examined to determine the stated purpose of the consult, recommendations made, and concordance by surgeons and anesthesiologists with cardiologists' recommendations. Of the 400 surveys sent to each specialty, 192 were returned from anesthesiologists, 113 were returned from surgeons, and 129 were returned from cardiologists. There was substantial disagreement on the importance and purposes of a cardiology consult: intraoperative monitoring, \"clearing the patient for surgery,\" and advising as to the safest type of anesthesia were regarded as important by most cardiologists and surgeons but as unimportant by anesthesiologists (all P < 0.05). Most surgeons (80.2%) felt obligated to follow a cardiologist's recommendations, whereas few anesthesiologists (16.6%) felt so obligated (P < 0.05). The most commonly stated purpose of the 55 cardiology consultations examined was \"preoperative evaluation.\" Only 5 of these (9%) were obtained for patients in whom there was a new finding. Of the cardiology consultations, 40% contained no recommendations other than \"proceed with case,\" \"cleared for surgery,\" or \"continue current medications.\" Recommendations regarding intraoperative monitoring or cardiac medications were largely ignored. Implications: We conclude that there seems to be considerable disagreement among anesthesiologists, cardiologists, and surgeons as to the purposes and utility of cardiology consultations. A review of 55 consecutive cardiology consultations suggests that most of them give little advice that truly affects management.

Anatomical models were created in ancient times, and in the 1960s the Norwegian toy manufacturer Laerdal pioneered simulation to practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation and critical event drills.2 Early models were crude, but they were widely adopted. The HARVEY cardiovascular simulator was one of the first manikins developed which was computer driven and provided replication of anatomy with palpable pulses and auscultatable areas. This allowed medical students to experience some of the findings from clinical examination for the first time in a standardized setting.3 More recently, with advances in technology, there has been a rapid expansion in simulating other aspects of healthcare, with increasing sophistication. Modern computing power allows the recreation of complex anatomical and physiological systems programmed to respond to inputs from the user. There have also been advances in manikins and devices to physically replicate the steps of performing complex procedures. Fidelity is the degree of accuracy with which a simulation replicates a clinical scenario. This is defined in terms of the realism of the environment in which the simulation takes place, the equipment used and the psychological engagement of the learner. It is not necessarily synonymous with the technology of the simulator.4–6. Indeed, evidence suggests that the indiscriminate use of high-technology simulators alone is unlikely to be more effective than other methods.7,8 The ability to use realistic clinical environments (or practice in situ ), using equipment which closely replicates the look, feel and feedback of clinical situations will facilitate the immersion of the learner into the simulation, but it is …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehu527", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2151390404", "source": "openalex"}

Most patients are now expected to live to adulthood, leading to a significant increase in the population of adults with congenital heart disease.1–3 These young people need to be supported as they make the transition into adulthood; they must be encouraged to take responsibility for their own health and to make informed decisions regarding careers and lifestyle. Transition is a generic process that applies to all children and adolescents with chronic disease, including those with cardiac, diabetes, renal, rheumatological and respiratory conditions. The transition of care from child to adult healthcare systems must be seen as a continuous process, not a single event. It may be defined as “a purposeful, planned process that addresses the medical, psychosocial and educational/vocational needs of adolescents and young adults with chronic physical and medical conditions as they move from child-centred to adult-orientated health care systems”.4 The transition period is not completed on entrance to adult care and is only successfully achieved when the patient is empowered to take responsibility for their own health and lifestyle, often when they are in their mid-20s. In some patients, this period may never end and in each patient this process is age and development dependent. Congenital heart disease affects patients’ lives in a number of ways and addressing the issues of education, employment and sports as well as relationships, healthcare, reproduction and lifestyle at an early stage will optimise patients’ quality of life.

There is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of these two drug classes. ICS suppress the chronic inflammation of asthma and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and this is achieved at low doses in most patients. LABA act on different aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma. In addition to their bronchodilator action, LABA also inhibit mast cell mediator release, plasma exudation and may reduce sensory nerve activation. Thus these two classes of drug address complementary aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma that neither drug class is able to achieve alone. There are several positive interactions between LABA and ICS. Corticosteroids increase the expression of β<sub>2</sub>-receptors by increasing gene transcription. Experimentally this protects against the loss of β<sub>2</sub>-receptors in response to long-term exposure to β<sub>2</sub>-agonists. While this is unlikely to be important in bronchodilator responses to β<sub>2</sub>-agonists, in view of the large β-receptor reserve, it is probably important in preventing loss of β-agonist effects on the nonbronchodilator actions of LABA discussed earlier. β<sub>2</sub>-Agonists may potentiate the molecular mechanism of corticosteroid actions, with increased nuclear localization of glucocorticoid receptors and additive or sometimes synergistic suppression of inflammatory mediator release. Thus LABA and ICS may optimize each others beneficial actions in the airways, but the low systemic effects of these drugs do not result in any increase in adverse effects. Long-acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonists corticosteroid inhaler therapy is therefore a logical advance and results in effective control of asthma in the majority of patients without significant adverse effects.

Using univariable and multivariable absolute risk regression, we modelled the impact of individual risk factors on the discordance between observed and predicted 10-year ASCVD risk. Overestimation was observed in all race/ethnic groups in MESA and was highest among Chinese (252% for women and 314% for men) and lowest in White women (72%) and Hispanic men (67%). Higher age, Chinese race/ethnicity (when compared with White), systolic blood pressure (treated and untreated), diabetes, alcohol use, exercise, lipid-lowering medication, and aspirin use were all associated with more risk overestimation, whereas family history was associated with less risk overestimation in a multivariable model (all P < 0.05).The AHA-ACC-ASCVD risk score overestimates ASCVD risk among men, women, and all four race/ethnic groups evaluated in a modern American primary prevention cohort.

Despite the advances made, AF remains a challenge for the clinician, and it is uncertain whether these theoretical advances have resulted in a significant improvement in the way the vast majority of patients are managed in general practice. Several reasons may account for this situation. One possible reason is incomplete knowledge of the complex mechanism of this common arrhythmia. Another possible reason is the heterogeneous clinical presentation of the arrhythmia. Still, the numerous publications and clinical trials devoted to AF have dealt with this arrhythmia as if it were a single entity. Furthermore, the abundant terminology used to characterize various subsets of AF and the absence of consistency in the definitions have added to the difficulty in communication.1 Consequently, it has become difficult to compare the results of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies because different classifications have been used, and the difficulty in characterizing the patient population has not allowed easy or appropriate comparison.

All these aspects would ultimately aid delivery of care and improve patient (and caregiver) engagement and empowerment. Given the need to address the multidisciplinary approach to holistic or integrated care of patients with heart disease and stroke, the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke convened a Task Force, with the remit to propose a consensus on Integrated care management for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease. The present position paper summarizes the available evidence and proposes consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and simple practical approaches to assist in everyday clinical practice.

The intention of the present position stand of the European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation is to encourage individuals to participate in regular physical activity and derive the benefits of physical exercise while minimizing the risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Therefore, the aim is to establish the most practical method of cardiovascular evaluation in middle-age/senior individuals, who are contemplating exercise or who are already engaged in nonprofessional competitive or recreational leisure sporting activity. These recommendations rely on existing scientific evidence, and in the absence of such, on expert consensus. The methodology of how middle-aged and older individuals should be evaluated appropriately before engaging in regular physical activity is both complex and controversial. On practical grounds the consensus panel recommend that such evaluation should vary according to the individual's cardiac risk profile and the intended level of physical activity. Self assessment of the habitual physical activity level and of the risk factors, are recommended for screening of large populations. Individuals deemed to be at risk require further evaluation by a qualified physician. In senior/adult individuals with an increased risk for coronary events, maximal exercise testing (and possibly further evaluations) is advocated.

Although cardiac MR imaging has gained wider adoption for routine clinical applications, PET images remain the reference in many applications for which objective analysis of metabolic and physiologic parameters is needed. In particular, in cardiovascular diseases-more specifically, coronary artery disease-the use of quantitative and measurable parameters in a reproducible way is essential for the management of therapeutic decisions and patient follow-up. Functional MR images and dynamic assessment of myocardial perfusion from transit of intravascular contrast medium can provide useful criteria for identifying areas of decreased myocardial perfusion or for assessing tissue viability from late contrast enhancement of scar tissue. PET images, however, will provide more quantitative data on true tissue perfusion and metabolism. Quantitative myocardial flow can also lead to accurate assessment of coronary flow reserve. The combination of both modalities will therefore provide complementary data that can be expected to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of diagnostic procedures. But the true potential of hybrid PET/MR imaging may reside in applications beyond the domain of coronary artery disease. The combination of both modalities in assessment of other cardiac diseases such as inflammation and of other systemic diseases can also be envisioned. It is also predicted that the 2 modalities combined could help characterize atherosclerotic plaques and differentiate plaques with a high risk of rupture from stable plaques. In the future, the development of new tracers will also open new perspectives in evaluating myocardial remodeling and in assessing the kinetics of stem cell therapy in myocardial infarction. New tracers will also provide new means for evaluating alterations in cardiac innervation, angiogenesis, and even the assessment of reporter gene technologies. The fusion of 2 potentially competing modalities can certainly offer the best of each modality in a single procedure. The impact of such advanced technology in routine clinical practice will still need to be demonstrated. Beyond the expected improvement in patient management and the potential impact on patient outcome, PET/MR imaging will also need to establish its medicoeconomic justification in an era of health-care economic restrictions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.113.129262", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097964601", "source": "openalex"}

Methods and results Sixteen ESC member countries participated in the EAPCI Atlas survey. Interventional data were collected by the National Cardiac Society of each participating country. An annual median of 5131 [interquartile range (IQR) 4013–5801] diagnostic heart procedures per million people were reported, ranging from &amp;lt;2500 in Egypt and Romania to &amp;gt;7000 in Turkey and Germany. Procedure rates showed significant correlation (r = 0.67, P = 0.013) with gross national income (GNI) per capita.

It plays a critical role in the development of cardiovascular risk factors that mediate the evolution of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease. Longitudinal observations of children, adolescents, and young adults enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study show that obesity persists over time and is linked to the clustering of components of metabolic syndrome including hyperinsulinemia/ insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, thereby creating a long‐term burden of cardiovascular risk beginning in childhood. This burden is associated with subclinical and adverse structural and functional changes of the cardiovascular system in youth. Ultimately, these changes can result in morbidity from disease, as exemplified in the Framingham Heart Study. Obesity is governed by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors.

The importance of addressing the issue of iron deficiency in patients with CHF is reflected in the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) heart failure guidelines, which recognize iron deficiency as an important co-morbidity, independent of anaemia. These guidelines recommend that all newly diagnosed heart failure patients are routinely tested for iron deficiency and that IV FCM should be considered as a treatment option in symptomatic patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency (serum ferritin < 100 µg/L, or ferritin 100-299 µg/L and transferrin saturation < 20%).

The objective of the study was to determine whether it is feasible to develop a valid and reliable evaluation approach using medical simulation to assess technical and cognitive skills of physicians performing coronary interventions.Clinical case scenarios were developed by a committee of subject matter experts, who defined key decision nodes, such as stent positioning, and introduced unanticipated complications, such as coronary perforation. Subjects were 115 physicians from 10 U.S. healthcare institutions at three levels of expertise: novice, skilled, or expert. Subjects completed a questionnaire, one practice case and six test cases on a SimSuite simulator (Medical Simulation Corporation, Denver, CO), and an opinion survey. Clinical specialists rated subjects' procedural skills.A technical and cognitive skills evaluation of performance in interventional cardiology procedures using medical simulation yielded results that distinguished between a novice group and skilled or expert groups (P<0.001) and scores correlated moderately with clinical specialist ratings of subjects' procedural skills and with number and complexity of procedures performed in practice during the previous year. Approximately 90% of subjects generally thought that the cases were well simulated and presented situations encountered in practice.This study suggests that an evaluation approach using high-fidelity medical simulation to assess technical and cognitive skills of physicians performing interventional cardiology procedures can be used to identify physicians who are extremely poor performers and not likely to be providing appropriate patient care. We believe that use of a high-fidelity simulator incorporating situations with multiple events, immediate feedback, and high sensory load would complement the results of traditional written examinations of medical knowledge to provide a more comprehensive assessment of physician ability in interventional cardiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/sih.0b013e3181c75f8e", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016124163", "source": "openalex"}

Since first inception, the term type 2 myocardial infarction has always been vague. Although attempts have been made to produce a systematic definition of what constitutes a type 2 myocardial infarction, it has been more often characterised by what it is not rather than what it is. Clinical studies that have used type 2 myocardial infarction as a diagnostic criterion have produced disparate incidence figures. The range of associated clinical conditions differs from study to study. Additionally, there are no agreed or evidence-based treatment strategies for type 2 myocardial infarction. The authors believe that the term type 2 myocardial infarction is confusing and not evidence-based. They consider that there is good reason to stop using this term and consider instead the concept of secondary myocardial injury that relates to the underlying pathophysiology of the primary clinical condition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307122", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1913171291", "source": "openalex"}

We report the baseline characteristics and management of adults enrolled in the registry. A total of 3208 patients were enrolled by 69 centres in 18 countries [HCM (n = 1739); DCM (n = 1260); ARVC (n = 143); and RCM (n = 66)]. Differences between cardiomyopathy subtypes (P < 0.001) were observed for age at diagnosis, history of familial disease, history of sustained ventricular arrhythmia, use of magnetic resonance imaging or genetic testing, and implantation of defibrillators. When compared with probands, relatives had a lower age at diagnosis (P < 0.001), but a similar rate of symptoms and defibrillators. When compared with the Long-Term phase, patients of the Pilot phase (enrolled in more expert centres) had a more frequent rate of familial disease (P < 0.001), were more frequently diagnosed with a rare underlying disease (P < 0.001), and more frequently implanted with a defibrillator (P = 0.023). Comparing four geographical areas, patients from Southern Europe had a familial disease more frequently (P < 0.001), were more frequently diagnosed in the context of a family screening (P < 0.001), and more frequently diagnosed with a rare underlying disease (P < 0.001). By providing contemporary observational data on characteristics and management of patients with cardiomyopathies, the registry provides a platform for the evaluation of guideline implementation.

This situation does not reflect the significant increase in the number of senior researchers and the number of studies carried out in the several fields of activity that constitute our medical specialty. We currently observe the development of our Postgraduate Programs, as well as the opening of new research centers focused on the study of cardiovascular diseases in several universities of the country. On the other hand, in spite of the increased number of international in our area, with the creation of families of journals associated to the periodicals of highest significance, the publication of Brazilian articles of greater impact on the area of cardiology remains limited. Additionally, we have not had the incorporation of new published in Brazil in the field of cardiovascular science, which prevents the access of Brazilian researchers to the scientific dissemination of their work. The Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia, the journal responsible for the disclosure of approximately 20% of national publications indexed in our area of operation, can now publish only 25% of the submitted articles, of which approximately 10% comes from foreign research centers. The selective publication policy of the Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia tends to gradually increase its impact factor, which has varied between 1 and 1.2 in the past five years, according to data released by the Journal of Citation Report of Thompson Reuters. Similarly, the numbers achieved by our publications, of which progressive increase is now reaching the average numbers similar to countries such as the United States, Mexico and South Korea, indicate the same direction. Undoubtedly, the best qualification of published in Brazil meets the interests of the postgraduate programs of our country, which need a journal with the best score at the international level for the dissemination of studies arising from dissertations and doctoral theses. On the other hand, the occurrence of this fact limits the adequate dissemination of studies carried out by many Brazilian researchers, due to the difficulty of having access to other means of publication. Based on these facts, the Brazilian Society of Cardiology (SBC) has decided to increase its activities in the field of scientific publications, by incorporating a new journal into its portfolio. Starting this month, the International Journal of Cardiovascular Sciences (IJCS), a bimonthly publication that was conducted by the Cardiology Society of the State of Rio de Janeiro, has started to be conducted by our society. With this step, SBC aims to broaden the perspective and scope of the Brazilian cardiology science, the impact of which has been recognized by several international and foreign societies, as evidenced by the several studies accepted for presentation at the most important conferences and scientific meetings of our medical specialty. IJCS aims to increase the number of articles published internationally, working as a means of dissemination not only of the Brazilian cardiology science, but also at the integration of Brazilian research with research centers in other countries. The journal is now in its second year of publication, currently going to be indexed by SciELO, a situation that guarantees visibility in other international databases, such as Web of Science and ScienceOpen. While maintaining its periodicity and the incorporation of the same editorial quality of the Brazilian Archives of Cardiology, the new journal should attain indexing in PubMed and also in the Scopus system within one year. The expansion of the publishing activities of SBC and the incorporation of IJCS must be complemented by the creation of a portal for specialized scientific in the area of cardiovascular sciences. This proposal has as its main justification to encourage interaction among published in Brazil in our area, facilitating the publication of editorials, letters and review articles. This promotes the elevation of the impact factors of all involved and should result in the effective creation of a virtuous circle for the Brazilian cardiology science.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5935/abc.20160109", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2465178106", "source": "openalex"}

An additional aim was to highlight areas where more research into the MetS is needed. Participants The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) convened a workshop held 12–14 May 2004 in London, UK. The 21 participants included experts in the fields of diabetes, public health, epidemiology, lipidology, genetics, metabolism, nutrition and cardiology. There were participants from each of the five continents as well as from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Cholesterol Education Program—Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III). The workshop was sponsored by an educational grant from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. Consensus process The consensus statement emerged following detailed discussions at the IDF workshop. After the workshop, a writing group produced a consensus statement which was reviewed and approved by all participants. Conclusions The IDF has produced a new set of criteria for use both epidemiologically and in clinical practice world‐wide with the aim of identifying people with the MetS to clarify the nature of the syndrome and to focus therapeutic strategies to reduce the long‐term risk of cardiovascular disease. Guidance is included on how to compensate for differences in waist circumference and in regional adipose tissue distribution between different populations. The IDF has also produced recommendations for additional criteria that should be included when studying the MetS for research purposes. Finally, the IDF has identified areas where more studies are currently needed; these include research into the aetiology of the syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2006.01858.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130717716", "source": "openalex"}

Two methods for estimating the conversion factors, which differed in the description of the irradiation geometry, were evaluated. The effective doses obtained with the two methods were almost identical. The results showed that irradiation geometry had no significant impact on the CFE, and a single factor was defined for both diagnostic and interventional examinations. In addition, the effect of the new tissue-weighting factor for breast tissue (TWFb) given in ICRP 103 on the effective dose was assessed. The CFE was 3.7±0.2 mSv (Gy cm2)−1 (neonate), 1.9±0.2 mSv (Gy cm2)−1 (1 year), 1.0±0.1 mSv (Gy cm2)−1 (5 years), 0.6±0.1 mSv (Gy cm2)−1 (10 years) and 0.4±0.1 mSv (Gy cm2)−1 (15 years). Applying these CFs to the individual DAP values of each patient yielded mean effective doses of 13.0 mSv (neonate), 8.6 mSv (1 year), 6.4 mSv (5 years), 8.6 mSv (10 years) and 12.7 mSv (15 years). The maximum estimated skin dose (15 patients) did not exceed 60 mGy. With the new ICRP value for TWFb, increases in the CFs in the order of 10–30%, and in the effective dose of 10–20%, were indicated. The results indicated that the effective dose in paediatric interventional cardiology is of much greater concern than the skin dose.

Method This study was conducted in a 300 bed university hospital in Brazil. Clinical pharmacists taking medication histories and reconciling medications prescribed on admission with a list of drugs used prior to admission. Discrepancies were classified as justified (e.g., based on the pharmacotherapeutic guidelines of the hospital studied) or unintentional. Treatments were reviewed within 48 hours following hospitalization. Unintentional discrepancies were further classified according to the categorization of medication error severity. Pharmacists verbally contacted the prescriber to recommend actions to resolve the discrepancies. Results A total of 181 discrepancies were found in 50 patients (86%). Of these discrepancies, 149 (82.3%) were justified changes to the patient's home medication regimen; however, 32 (17.7%) discrepancies found in 24 patients were unintentional. Pharmacists made 31 interventions and 23 (74.2%) were accepted. Among unintentional discrepancies, the most common was a different medication dose on admission (42%). Of the unintentional discrepancies 13 (40.6%) were classified as error without harm, 11 (34.4%) were classified as error without harm but which could affect the patient and require monitoring, 3 (9.4%) as errors could have resulted in harm and 5 (15.6%) were classified as circumstances or events that have the capacity to cause harm.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of e-consultations to test its efficacy and effectiveness in reducing wait times and improving access to specialty care. <h3>METHODS</h3> Primary care clinicians were randomized into a control (9 traditional) or an intervention (17 e-consultation) arm for referrals to cardiologists. Primary care clinicians were recruited from 12 practice sites in a community health center in Connecticut with mainly medically underserved patients. Two end points were analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model where the hazard of either a visit or an e-consultation was linked to study arm, sex, race, and age. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Thirty-six primary care clinicians participated in the study, referring 590 patients.

A lack of diversity among physicians is considered to be a major contributor. The fellowship training program in cardiovascular medicine at The Ohio State University Medical Center had never trained a fellow from a minority group underrepresented in medicine (URM) before 2007. Intervention In 2005, the fellowship made it a priority to recruit and match URM candidates in an effort to address the community's lack of diversity and disparities in cardiovascular care. Methods Program leaders revised the recruitment process, making diversity a high priority. Faculty met with members of diverse residency programs during visits to other institutions, the focus of interview day was changed to highlight mentorship, additional targeted postinterview communications reached out to highly competitive applicants, and a regular mentoring program was constructed to allow meaningful interaction with URM faculty and fellows. Results Since these changes were implemented, the program has successfully matched a URM fellow for 5 consecutive years. Such candidates currently make up 4 of 16 total trainees (25%) in the fellowship in cardiovascular medicine.

The importance of CVD in this population is reflected by recent publications1-3 and a report from a specific task force of the US National Kidney Foundation. The recognition that large scale outcome studies are required has resulted in the initiation of several studies that will report over the next few years. This review is a personal view in which we will cover the background to CVD at different stages in the natural history of progressive renal disease, current treatments, unresolved problems, and ongoing studies To appreciate the problems and management of CVD in progressive renal disease it is necessary to consider the key differences between patients with renal disease and other patient groups. The first is the course of renal disease (fig 1). Patients with progressive renal disease suffer a period of deteriorating renal function, over months to many years (depending on the underlying disease) and leading ultimately to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in a proportion of patients. Most patients with ESRD (around 100 per million population per annum) currently enter renal replacement therapy programmes involving either peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis. Thereafter, approximately one third will be considered for renal transplantation and, over a period of years, the majority of these will proceed to have a successful cadaveric …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heart.86.4.459", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1910033894", "source": "openalex"}

However, current understanding of electrophysiology atrial tachycardias makes this classification obsolete, because it does not correlate with mechanisms. The proposed classification is based on electrophysiologic mechanisms, defined by mapping and entrainment. Radiofrequency ablation of a critical focus or isthmus can afford proof. Focal tachycardias are characterized by radial spread of activation and endocardial activation not covering the whole cycle. Ablation of the focus of origin interrupts the tachycardia. The mechanism of focal firing is difficult to ascertain by clinical methods. Macroreentrant tachycardias are characterized by circular patterns of activation that cover the whole cycle. Fusion can be shown during entrainment on the ECG or by multiple endocardial recordings. Ablation of a critical isthmus interrupts the tachycardia. Macroreentry can occur around normal structures (terminal crest, eustachian ridge) or around atrial lesions. The anatomic bases of these tachycardias must be defined, to guide appropriate treatment. Atrial flutter is a mere description of continuous undulation on the ECG, and only some strictly defined typical flutter patterns correlate with right atrial macroreentry bounded by the tricuspid valve, terminal crest, and caval vein orifices. This classification should be considered open, as some classically described tachycardias, such as reentrant sinus tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and type II atrial flutter, cannot be classified accurately. Furthermore, the possibility of fibrillatory conduction makes the limits with atrial fibrillation still ill defined.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.00852.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035045370", "source": "openalex"}

It aims to elucidate the cardiovascular effects of regular exercise and delineate its benefits and risks, so that safe guidance can be provided to all individuals engaging in sports and/or physical activity in order to attain the maximum potential benefit at the lowest possible risk. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) advocates systematic preparticipation cardiovascular screening in an effort to identify competitive athletes at risk of exercise-related cardiovascular events and sudden cardiac death. However, the implementation of preparticipation screening is hindered because of lack of structured training and as a result lack of sufficient expertise in the field of sports cardiology. In 2008 the European Society of Cardiology published a core curriculum for the general cardiologist, in which sports cardiology was incorporated within the topic 'Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology'. However, the exponential rise in knowledge and the growing demand for expertise in the field of sports cardiology dictates the need to systematically structure the knowledge base of sports cardiology into a detailed curriculum. We envisage that the curriculum would facilitate more uniform training and guideline implementation throughout Europe, and safeguard that evaluation and guidance of competitive athletes or individuals who wish to engage in leisure-time sports activities is performed by physicians with expertise in the field.

The aim of these recommendations is to encourage regular physical activity including sports participation, with reasonable precaution to ensure a high level of safety for all affected individuals. Valvular heart disease is usually an age-related degenerative process, predominantly affecting individuals in their fifth decade and onwards. However, there is an increasing group of younger individuals with valvular defects. The diagnosis of cardiac disorders during routine cardiac examination often raises questions about on-going participation in competitive sport with a high dynamic or static component and the level of permissible physical effort during recreational exercise. Although the natural history of several valvular diseases has been reported in the general population, little is known about the potential influence of chronic intensive physical activity on valve function, left ventricular remodelling pulmonary artery pressure, and risk of arrhythmia.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) is developing a suite of quality indicators (QIs) to evaluate cardiovascular care and support the delivery of evidence-based care. This paper describes the methodology used for their development. Methods and results We propose a four-step process for the development of the ESC QIs. For a specific clinical area with a gap in care delivery, the QI development process includes: (i) the identification of key domains of care by constructing a conceptual framework of care; (ii) the construction of candidate QIs by conducting a systematic review of the literature; (iii) the selection of a final set of QIs by obtaining expert opinions using the modified Delphi method; and (iv) the undertaking of a feasibility assessment by evaluating different ways of defining the QI specifications for the proposed data collection source. For each of the four steps, key methodological areas need to be addressed to inform the implementation process and avoid misinterpretation of the measurement results. Conclusion Detailing the methodology for the ESC QIs construction enables healthcare providers to develop valid and feasible metrics to measure and improve the quality of cardiovascular care. As such, high-quality evidence may be translated into clinical practice and the ‘evidence-practice’ gap closed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjqcco/qcaa069", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3081258804", "source": "openalex"}

Their potential prognostic value after stent implantation and, in particular, for restenosis and long-term clinical outcome has not been studied. We assessed the prognostic value of the modified ACC/AHA criteria for the long-term angiographic and clinical outcome of patients after coronary stenting. Methods and Results-This study includes 2944 consecutive patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease treated with coronary stent placement. Modified ACC/AHA lesion morphology criteria were used to qualitatively assess the angiograms; type A and B1 lesions were categorized as simple, and type B2 and C lesions were designated complex. Primary end points were angiographic restenosis and 1-year event-free survival. Restenosis rate was 33.2% in complex lesions and 24.9% in simple lesions (P<0.001). It was 21. 7% for type A, 26.3% for type B1, 33.7% for type B2, and 32.6% for type C lesions. One-year event-free survival was 75.6% for patients with complex lesions and 81.1% for patients with simple lesions (P<0. 001). It was 85.2% for patients with type A, 79.4% for type B1, 75. 9% for type B2, and 75.2% type C lesions. The higher risk for restenosis and an adverse outcome associated with complex lesions was also maintained after multivariate adjustment for other clinical and angiographic characteristics.

For in vivo tests, we included Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g (n = 54), received doxorubicin in cumulative dose of 12.0 mg/kg to model advance heart failure, registered by ultrasonography. We formed six groups: the first three groups of animals received, respectively, 0.06 ml Simdax, AuNPs, and conjugate (AuNPs-Simdax), intrapleurally, and the second three received them intravenously. The seventh group was control (saline). We performed dynamic assessment of heart failure regression in vivo measuring hydrothorax. Sonoporation of gold nanoparticles to cardiomyocytes was tested.We designed and constructed colloidal, spherical gold nanoparticles, AuNPs-Simdax conjugate, both founded biosafety (in cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and immunoreactivity). In all animals of the six groups after the third day post-medication injection, no ascites and liver enlargement were registered (P < 0.001 vs controls). Conjugate injection showed significantly higher hydrothorax reduction than Simdax injection only (P < 0.01); gold nanoparticle injection showed significantly higher results than Simdax injection (P < 0.05). AuNPs and conjugate showed no significant difference for rat recovery. Difference in rat life continuity was significant between Simdax vs AuNPs (P < 0.05) and Simdax vs conjugate (P < 0.05). Sonoporation enhances AuNP transfer into the cell and mitochondria that were highly localized, superior to controls (P < 0.01 for both).Gold nanoparticles of 30 nm and its AuNPs-Simdax conjugate gave positive results in biosafety and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. AuNPs-Simdax and AuNPs have similar significant cardioprotective effects in rats with doxorubicin-induced heart failure, higher than that of Simdax.

The annual effect of scribes in a real-world clinic on physician productivity and revenue has not been evaluated.We performed a retrospective study comparing the productivity during routine clinic visits of ten cardiologists using scribes vs 15 cardiologists without scribes. We tracked patients per hour and patients per year seen per physician. Average direct revenue (clinic visit) and downstream revenue (cardiovascular revenue in the 2 months following a clinic visit) were measured in 486 patients and used to calculate annual revenue generated as a result of increased productivity.Physicians with scribes saw 955 new and 4,830 follow-up patients vs 1,318 new and 7,150 follow-up patients seen by physicians without scribes. Physicians with scribes saw 9.6% more patients per hour (2.50±0.27 vs 2.28±0.15, P<0.001). This improved productivity resulted in 84 additional new and 423 additional follow-up patients seen, 3,029 additional work relative value units (wRVUs) generated, and an increased cardiovascular revenue of $1,348,437. Physicians with scribes also generated an additional revenue of $24,257 by producing clinic notes that were coded at a higher level. Total additional revenue generated was $1,372,694 at a cost of $98,588 for the scribes.Physician productivity in a cardiology clinic was ∼10% higher for physicians using scribes. This improved productivity resulted in 84 additional new and 423 additional follow-up patients seen in 1 year.

Obviously, there is a lack of solid scientific data to support such recommendations and the majority of them must remain based on expert consensus. The remarkable improvement in survival of surgically and interventionally treated patients with CHD has led to an increasing number of GUCH patients, in particular those with more complex disease. There are also patients with newly diagnosed CHD lesions in adulthood such as atrial septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, Ebstein's anomaly and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. The 32nd Bethesda Conference report in 20012 estimated that there were ∼2800 adults with CHD/million population, with more than half having moderate or highly complex disease. More recently, Marelli et al .3 reported a prevalence of 4090/million adults in Quebec for the year 2000 with 380 having severe disease. In Europe, we are currently faced with an estimated GUCH patient population of ∼2.3 million, which significantly outnumbers the paediatric CHD population of ∼1.9 million patients.4 There is general agreement that GUCH patients have very special needs and therefore physicians responsible of their care need specific expertise and training.1–11 It is …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/eht572", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116492753", "source": "openalex"}

The use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) gave the potential of non-invasive biopsy for fibrosis quantification. However, LGE is unable to detect diffuse myocardial disease. Native T1 mapping and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) provide knowledge about pathologies affecting both the myocardium and interstitium that is otherwise difficult to identify. Changes of myocardial native T1 reflect cardiac diseases (acute coronary syndromes, infarction, myocarditis, and diffuse fibrosis, all with high T1) and systemic diseases such as cardiac amyloid (high T1), Anderson-Fabry disease (low T1), and siderosis (low T1). The ECV, an index generated by native and post-contrast T1 mapping, measures the cellular and extracellular interstitial matrix (ECM) compartments. This myocyte-ECM dichotomy has important implications for identifying specific therapeutic targets of great value for heart failure treatment. On the other hand, T2 mapping is superior compared with myocardial T1 and ECM for assessing the activity of myocarditis in recent-onset heart failure. Although these indices can significantly affect the clinical decision making, multicentre studies and a community-wide approach (including MRI vendors, funding, software, contrast agent manufacturers, and clinicians) are still missing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000478901", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2750543512", "source": "openalex"}

There is no consensus regarding the actual definition of hypotension in the neonate or how best to raise perceived low blood pressure. In addition, there is no direct and prospectively collected information available on the result of treatment of a “low” blood pressure on neonatal morbidity and mortality. It also has not been clearly demonstrated that bringing systemic blood pressure to a “normal” range improve outcomes. However, it is widely accepted by clinicians that early and aggressive treatment of hypotension leads to improved neurologic outcome and survival in the neonate. Commonly used therapeutic maneuvers to correct systemic hypotension in the neonate include volume expansion, inotropic agents, and corticosteroids. Although there is a paucity of research on the cardiovascular response to these commonly used agents in neonates, among the commonly used inotropic drugs dopamine has been shown to be more effective than dobutamine in raising blood pressure in the neonate. The cardiology group focused on the use of inotropes, particularly dopamine and dobutamine, to treat very low birth weight infants with cardiac instability and neonatal postoperative cardiac patients. The cardiology group identified key issues that must be considered when designing studies of inotropic agents in preterm infants and proposed 2 clinical-trial designs: (1) a placebo-controlled trial with rescue for symptomatic infants; and (2) a targeted–blood pressure study. The first trial design would answer questions concerning efficacy of treatment with inotropic agents in this population. The second trial design would address concerns related to the lack of knowledge on normal blood pressure ranges in this population. The group identified specific design elements that would need to be addressed for the complicated trial design to study inotropic agents in neonates.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2005-0620f", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135313749", "source": "openalex"}

Coxibs were tested in accordance to modern drug development regulations with large numbers of patients included in clinical trials. These trials demonstrated that rofecoxib,6–8 celecoxib,9 valdecoxib,10 and parecoxib10 increased the risk of cardiovascular complications. As a result, coxibs currently have very limited indications for use. Paradoxically, an older and relatively selective COX-2 inhibitor, diclofenac,11 continues to be one of the most widely used drugs worldwide and is in most countries sold over the counter.1 Mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors such as ibuprofen and naproxen are also used widely and, without solid evidence, assumed to be safe. Given the current uncertainty regarding the safety of this class of agents and the rapidly accumulating data on their cardiovascular risks, this review summarizes the current evidence from randomized and observational studies on the cardiovascular safety of non-aspirin NSAIDs and presents a position for their use.

Motivated by these successes, the Pediatric Acute Care Cardiology Collaborative (PAC 3 ) was founded in late 2014 with an emphasis on improving outcomes of paediatric cardiology patients within cardiac acute care units; acute care encompasses all hospital-based inpatient non-intensive care. PAC 3 aims to deliver higher quality and greater value care by facilitating the sharing of ideas and building alignment among its member institutions. These aims are intentionally aligned with the work of other national clinical collaborations, registries, and parent advocacy organisations. The mission and early work of PAC 3 is exemplified by the formal partnership with the Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium (PC 4 ), as well as the creation of a clinical registry, which links with the PC 4 registry to track practices and outcomes across the entire inpatient encounter from admission to discharge. Capturing the full inpatient experience allows detection of outcome differences related to variation in care delivered outside the cardiac ICU and development of benchmarks for cardiac acute care. We aspire to improve patient outcomes such as morbidity, hospital length of stay, and re-admission rates, while working to advance patient and family satisfaction. We will use quality improvement methodologies consistent with the Model for Improvement to achieve these aims. Membership currently includes 36 centres across North America, out of which 26 are also members of PC 4 .

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology support the program. The Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model was developed by Million Hearts and the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services as a strategy to assess a value-based payment approach toward reduction in 10-year predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by implementing cardiovascular preventive strategies to manage the “ABCS” (aspirin therapy in appropriate patients, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation). The purpose of this special report is to describe the development and intended use of the Million Hearts Longitudinal ASCVD Risk Assessment Tool. The Million Hearts Tool reinforces and builds on the “2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk” by allowing clinicians to estimate baseline and updated 10-year ASCVD risk estimates for primary prevention patients adhering to the appropriate ABCS over time, alone or in combination. The tool provides updated risk estimates based on evidence from high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the ABCS therapies. This novel approach to personalized estimation of benefits from risk-reducing therapies in primary prevention may help target therapies to those in whom they will provide the greatest benefit, and serves as the basis for a Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services program designed to evaluate the Million Hearts Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000467", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2547673416", "source": "openalex"}

Supplementing their practical education with online instruction could make a significant difference in standardizing pediatric cardiology education in India.To present the rationale, methods and survey results of a live e-Teaching methodology implemented for Pediatric cardiology trainees in association with the National Board of Examinations, India.Between March 2010 and March 2014, 310 e-classes were conducted in the Pediatric cardiac sciences by 24 e-teachers. Content of the e-Learning program was based on a 2-year pediatric cardiology curriculum and included twice-weekly live online video training sessions, a library of recorded sessions and online test quizzes for the students. A total of 231 students accessed the program at various times over the 4-year period.In our study, requests for access to the e-lectures increased from 10/year the first year to 100/year by the fourth year with feedback surveys conveying a high satisfaction level from the students and a high need for this knowledge. The advantages of virtual live e-Learning included the fact that one teacher can teach multiple students in multiple geographic locations at the same time, obviating the issue of quality teacher shortage and the same content can be disseminated to all students undergoing specialist training so there is a national consensus on diagnostic and management approach among all trainees. Additionally, the e-classes can be recorded and replayed so they can be viewed repeatedly by the same group or new trainees.This is the first sustained use of e-Teaching in a medical super-specialty in India. We believe that e-Teaching is an innovative solution that can be applied, not just to Pediatric Cardiology as we have done, but to all branches of specialist and super-specialist medical training in India and globally.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-2069.149512", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2029072067", "source": "openalex"}

As a result, the off-label use of approved devices is routine in pediatric interventional cardiology, but the extent and nature of this practice has not been previously described. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the prevalence and nature of off-label cardiac device use in an active pediatric interventional program in the United States.This study is a retrospective review of all interventional cardiac procedures performed at our institution from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008. Diagnostic (noninterventional) catheterizations, myocardial biopsies, invasive electrophysiology studies, and studies involving investigational devices were excluded. Interventions performed were compared with the manufacturer's labeled indications for each device.During this 3-year period, 473 patients (median age 4.1 years) underwent 595 transcatheter interventions. An approved device was utilized for an off-label application in 63% of patients, and in 50% of all interventions performed. The most frequent off-label procedures were stent implantations (99% off-label), balloon dilations (78% off-label), and coil embolizations (29% off-label). In contrast, the off-label use of septal and ductal occluders was relatively uncommon.In our routine (noninvestigational) practice of pediatric interventional cardiology, 63% of patients underwent procedures utilizing medical devices for off-label indications. These data underscore the need to enhance cardiac device review and approval processes in the United States to include pediatric applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0803.2009.00364.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1992703462", "source": "openalex"}

Finally, we discuss the main open issues in applying machine learning tools to cardiology tasks, also drafting possible future directions. Despite the growing interest in these tools, we argue that there are many still underutilized techniques: while neural networks are slowly being incorporated in cardiovascular research, other important techniques such as semi-supervised learning and federated learning are still underutilized.

The primary reason for most requests for imaging in cardiovascular medicine is to assess left ventricular structure and function. As our understanding of left ventricular mechanics has become more intricate, tissue Doppler and speckle tracking modalities have been developed that deliver greater insights into diagnosis of cardiomyopathy and earlier warning of ventricular dysfunction. Increased accuracy has been achieved with the dissemination of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography, which has also acquired a central role in the pre-operative assessment of patients prior to reparative valvular surgery. The use of contrast has broadened the indications for transthoracic echocardiography and has increased the accuracy of stress echocardiography, while reducing the number of patients who cannot be scanned because of a limited acoustic window. Finally, echocardiography will be seen in the future not only as a diagnostic tool in those affected by cardiovascular disease but also as a method for prediction of risk and perhaps activation of targeted treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr/77730594", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099598566", "source": "openalex"}

DCM is a complex disease and its pathological architecture encounters many genetic determinants interacting with environmental factors. The old perspective that every pathogenic gene mutation would lead to a diseased heart, is now being replaced by the novel observation that the phenotype depends not only on the penetrance-malignancy of the mutated gene-but also on epigenetics, age, toxic factors, pregnancy, and a diversity of acquired diseases. This review discusses how gene mutations will result in mutation-specific molecular alterations in the heart including increased mitochondrial oxidation (sarcomeric gene e.g. TTN), decreased calcium sensitivity (sarcomeric genes), fibrosis (e.g. LMNA and TTN), or inflammation. Therefore, getting a complete picture of the DCM patient will include genomic data, molecular assessment by preference from cardiac samples, stratification according to co-morbidities, and phenotypic description. Those data will help to better guide the heart failure and anti-arrhythmic treatment, predict response to therapy, develop novel siRNA-based gene silencing for malignant gene mutations, or intervene with mutation-specific altered gene pathways in the heart.This article is part of the Mini Review Series from the Varenna 2017 meeting of the Working Group of Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvy122", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2804857783", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), together with the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons (EACTS), mindful of a distinct regulatory, medico-legal and medical practice environment in Europe, published comprehensive new guidelines for the management of patients with AF in 2010,1,2 and a focused update of these guidelines in 2012.3 The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), based on similar considerations, published a full set of AF guidelines in 2011,4–6 which was updated in 2012.7 In parallel, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) issued two focused updates (Supplementary material online, references 7, 8) that were subsequently integrated into the previous 2006 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines.8 While ACCF, AHA, and HRS have started to develop a completely new set of guidelines for AF, the present situation provides a unique opportunity to gather insight into the process that leads from new, published evidence to new recommendations.

Most registries have focused on single devices or specific etiologies of shock, limiting data regarding overall practice patterns with temporary MCS in cardiac intensive care units.The CCCTN (Critical Care Cardiology Trials Network) is a multicenter network of tertiary CICUs in North America. Between September 2017 and September 2018, each center (n=16) contributed a 2-month snapshot of consecutive medical CICU admissions.Of the 270 admissions using temporary MCS, 33% had acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (CS), 31% had CS not related to acute myocardial infarction, 11% had mixed shock, and 22% had an indication other than shock. Among all 585 admissions with CS or mixed shock, 34% used temporary MCS during the CICU stay with substantial variation between centers (range: 17%-50%). The most common temporary MCS devices were intraaortic balloon pumps (72%), Impella (17%), and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (11%), although intraaortic balloon pump use also varied between centers (range: 40%-100%). Patients managed with intraaortic balloon pump versus other forms of MCS (advanced MCS) had lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and less severe metabolic derangements. Illness severity was similar at high- versus low-MCS utilizing centers and at centers with more advanced MCS use.There is wide variation in the use of temporary MCS among patients with shock in tertiary CICUs.

Methods: Patient radiation dose metrics were derived from analysis of data from the 2008 to 2009 Nationwide Evaluation of X‐ray Trends (NEXT) survey of cardiac catheterization. This analysis used deidentified data and did not require review by an IRB. Data from 171 facilities in 30 states were analyzed. The distributions (percentiles) of radiation dose metrics were determined for diagnostic cardiac catheterizations, PCI, and combined diagnostic and PCI procedures. Confidence intervals for these dose distributions were determined using bootstrap resampling. Results: Percentile distributions (advisory data sets) and possible preliminary U.S. reference levels (based on the 75th percentile of the dose distributions) are provided for cumulative air kerma at the reference point (K a,r ), cumulative air kerma‐area product (P KA ), fluoroscopy time, and number of cine runs. Dose distributions are sufficiently detailed to permit dose audits as described in National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Report No. 168. Fluoroscopy times are consistent with those observed in European studies, but P KA is higher in the U.S. Conclusions: Sufficient data exist to suggest possible initial benchmarks for patient radiation dose for certain interventional cardiology procedures in the U.S. Our data suggest that patient radiation dose in these procedures is not optimized in U.S. practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4754300", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088096933", "source": "openalex"}

Around 25% of heart attacks in Europe are already attributed to hypertension and by 2025 up to 60% of the population will have hypertension. Physical inactivity has contributed to the rising prevalence of hypertension, but patients who exercise or engage in physical activity reduce their risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. Hence, current international guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention provide generic advice to increase aerobic activity, but physiological responses differ with blood pressure (BP) level, and greater reductions in BP across a population may be achievable with more personalized advice. We performed a systematic review of meta-analyses to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for a scientific Consensus Document reporting how exercise prescription could be personalized for BP control. The document discusses the findings of 34 meta-analyses on BP-lowering effects of aerobic endurance training, dynamic resistance training as well as isometric resistance training in patients with hypertension, high-normal, and individuals with normal BP. As a main finding, there was sufficient evidence from the meta-review, based on the estimated range of exercise-induced BP reduction, the number of randomized controlled trials, and the quality score, to propose that type of exercise can be prescribed according to initial BP level, although considerable research gaps remain. Therefore, this evidence-based Consensus Document proposes further work to encourage and develop more frequent use of personalized exercise prescription to optimize lifestyle interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaa141", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3136760555", "source": "openalex"}

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Ad Hoc Task Force on Cardiac Catheterization.", "text": "It is evident that the practice of cardiac catheterization has undergone, and continues to undergo, marked change. Most prominent are the recent very rapid proliferation of catheterization laboratories in general and the development of newer types of catheterization laboratory. No uniform definitions exist for these newer laboratories, so meaningful communication is difficult. The new settings are of particular concern because their location, mobility, organization, and ownership raise questions about the quality of patient care. Most difficult to address are the questions about patient safety and physician conflict of interest. There are no objective data in peer-reviewed literature to support the reported safety and cost savings of these newer settings. Through deliberations, surveys, interviews, and correspondence with the cardiology community embraced by the ACC and the AHA, the task force generally found that in freestanding catheterization laboratories, access to emergency hospitalization may be delayed, and appropriate oversight may be lacking. Additionally, opportunities for self-referral may be fostered and the perception of commercialism and entrepreneurial excess in practice created. All of these problems must be avoided. The growth and development of some freestanding facilities, particularly the mobile laboratories, do not seem to have been driven by an increased need in remote communities or for temporary support but rather almost exclusively by a desire to capture market share. Accordingly, a series of definitions, guidelines, and recommendations for the laboratories as well as for patient selection has been developed. The consensus was that a very restrictive and cautious attitude to the newer settings is appropriate at this time. The justification for development or expansion of cardiac catheterization services must be patient need. Documentation of this need must be based on objective estimates of the number of patients with known or suspected cardiac disease who meet generally accepted indications for laboratory study. Concerns about the lack of data from prospective clinical trials of patient safety in such a group necessitate a very cautious attitude toward any new catheterization services, in particular those without in-house cardiac surgical support. In view of the lack of appropriately controlled safety and need data for hospital-based, mobile, or freestanding laboratories operating without on-site (accessible by gurney) cardiac surgery facilities, the task force reaffirms the position that further development of these services cannot be endorsed at this time. In addition, there is reason for major concern that such proliferation in catheterization services may contribute to increasing costs and troubling ethical questions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.84.5.2213", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1988559014", "source": "openalex"}

In recent years, however, cataracts have been observed in populations exposed to lower doses. Interventional cardiologists are repeatedly and acutely exposed to scattered ionizing radiation (X-rays) during the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures they perform. These \"low\" exposures may cause damage to the lens of the eye and induce early cataracts, known as radiation-induced cataracts. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was designed to test the hypothesis that interventional cardiologists, compared with an unexposed reference group of non-interventional cardiologists, have an increased risk of cataracts. The O'CLOC study is a cross-sectional study that will include a total of 300 cardiologists aged at least 40 years: one group of exposed interventional cardiologists and another of non-interventional cardiologists. The groups will be matched for age and sex. Individual information, including risk factors for cataracts (age, diabetes, myopia, etc.), will be collected during a telephone interview. A specific section of the questionnaire for the exposed group focuses on occupational history, including a description of the procedures (type, frequency, radiation protection tool) used. These data will be used to classify subjects into \"exposure level\" groups according to cumulative dose estimates. Eye examinations for all participants will be performed to detect cataracts, even in the early stages (lens opacities, according to LOCS III, the international standard classification). The analysis will provide an estimation of the cataract risk in interventional cardiology compared with the unexposed reference group, while taking other risk factors into account. An analysis comparing the risks according to level of exposure is also planned. This epidemiological study will provide further evidence about the potential risk of radiation-induced cataracts at low doses and contribute to cardiologists' awareness of the importance of radiation protection.

In more than half of patients with atherosclerotic disease, their first presentation to medical attention becomes their last. Patients often survive their first cardiac event through acute revascularization and placement of drug‐eluting stents (DES), but only select coronary lesions are amenable to DES placement, resulting in the use of bare metal or no stent, both of which lack the benefit of antirestenotic therapy. In other patients, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and stroke constitute the initial presentation of disease. In these patients, the diagnostic and therapeutic options are woefully inadequate. Nanomedicine offers options to each of these challenges. Antiangiogenic paramagnetic nanoparticles may be used to serially assess the severity of atherosclerotic disease in asymptomatic, high‐risk patients by detecting the development of plaque neovasculature, which reflects the underlying lesion activity and vulnerability to rupture. The nanoparticles can locally deliver antiangiogenic therapy, which may acutely retard plaque progression, allowing aggressive statin therapy to become effective. Moreover, these agents may be useful as a quantitative marker to guide atherosclerotic management in an asymptomatic patient. In those cases proceeding to the catheterization laboratory for revascularization, nanoparticles incorporating antirestenotic drugs can be delivered directly into the wall of lesions not amenable to DES placement. Targeted nanoparticles could help ensure that antirestenotic drugs are available for all lesions. Moreover, displacement of antiproliferative agents from the intimal surface into the vascular wall is likely to improve rehealing of the endothelium, improving postprocedural management of these patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1380.034", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1985596847", "source": "openalex"}

Currently, more than 36 million people worldwide die from NCDs each year, accounting for 63% of annual global deaths; most are preventable. The global financial burden of NCDs is staggering, with an estimated 2010 global cost of $6.3 trillion (US dollars) that is projected to increase to $13 trillion by 2030. A number of NCDs share one or more common predisposing risk factors, all related to lifestyle to some degree: (1) cigarette smoking, (2) hypertension, (3) hyperglycemia, (4) dyslipidemia, (5) obesity, (6) physical inactivity, and (7) poor nutrition. In large part, prevention, control, or even reversal of the aforementioned modifiable risk factors are realized through leading a healthy lifestyle (HL). The challenge is how to initiate the global change, not toward increasing documentation of the scope of the problem but toward true action—creating, implementing, and sustaining HL initiatives that will result in positive, measurable changes in the previously defined poor health metrics. To achieve this task, a paradigm shift in how we approach NCD prevention and treatment is required. The goal of this American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation/American College of Preventive Medicine policy statement is to define key stakeholders and highlight their connectivity with respect to HL initiatives. This policy encourages integrated action by all stakeholders to create the needed paradigm shift and achieve broad adoption of HL behaviors on a global scale.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv207", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1672101516", "source": "openalex"}

All of these agents have potent effects on the cardiovascular system and, in addition, may undergo numerous drug-drug interactions with cardiovascular medications. Given the high incidence of both cardiovascular disease and psychoactive drug use in the United States, it is likely that clinicians manage many patients with cardiovascular disease, possible receiving cardiovascular medications, and also needing psychopharmacological interventions.

Already widely acknowledged with SPECT, there is an increasing body of literature data demonstrating that CT coronary calcium assessment is also of prognostic value. The amount of coronary atherosclerosis, as can be extrapolated from CT coronary calcium score, has been shown to be highly predictive of cardiac events. The principal difference between myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) and CT coronary calcium for prognostic application appears to be that the former is an excellent tool for assessing short-term risk, thus effectively guiding decisions regarding revascularization. In contrast, the atherosclerosis imaging methods are likely to provide greater long-term risk assessment and, thus, are more useful in determination of the need for aggressive medical prevention measures. Although the more recent development of CT coronary angiography is promising for diagnosis, there has been no information to date regarding the prognostic value of the CT angiographic data. Similarly, cardiac MRI has not yet been adequately studied for its prognostic content. The selection of the most appropriate test for a given patient depends on the specific question being asked. In patients with a very low likelihood of CAD, no imaging test may be required. In screening the remaining asymptomatic patients, atherosclerosis imaging may be beneficial. In symptomatic patients, MPS, CT coronary angiography, and cardiac MRI play important roles. We consider it likely that, with an increased emphasis on prevention and a concomitant aging of the population, many forms of noninvasive cardiac imaging will continue to grow, with nuclear cardiology continuing to grow.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2145047364", "source": "openalex"}

Data were abstracted for dose, type, and daily frequency for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Target doses for each medication class were based on current guidelines. Patients with devices (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, CRT with defibrillators, or CRT with pacemakers) more frequently received evidence-based medical therapy than did those without such devices, although treatment at or above target doses was low for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators 32.6%, CRT with pacemaker 30.7%, CRT with defibrillator 32.0%, no device 34.6%) and β-blockers (20.2%, 17.4%, 20.4%, and 15.3%, respectively). Fewer patients received aldosterone antagonists, although when used, doses were more frequently within the target dosing range (70.1%, 72.1%, 72.7%, and 76.5%, respectively). Multivariable models showed that use of CRT with defibrillators and CRT with pacemakers was significantly associated with delivery of β-blockers at or above target doses, but no device therapies were associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or aldosterone antagonist dosing.Patients treated with heart failure devices received evidence-based medical therapy at similar or greater frequency than did those without such devices.

Dr Maude Abbott of Montreal had published her wonderful atlas in 1936 under the auspices of the American Heart Association, a unique compilation of 1000 cases of congenital heart disease.1 Dr Helen Taussig of Baltimore had founded her cardiac clinic at Johns Hopkins and had begun in the 1930s to characterize the clinical and fluoroscopic findings of a wide variety of congenital heart malformations; this material matured into her 2-volume compendium on congenital heart disease published in 1960.2 Dr Robert E. Gross of the Children’s Hospital in Boston successfully ligated the patent arterial duct in 1938, and that signal accomplishment ushered in the era of surgery for congenital heart disease.3 On the basis of her clinical observations that some children with cyanotic congenital heart disease became progressively more cyanotic coincidently with closure of the arterial duct and cognizant of Gross’s benchmark contribution, Dr Taussig traveled to Boston to attempt to persuade him to construct an arterial duct. When he refused, she broached the subject to Dr Blalock at Johns Hopkins. Some years earlier, when in Vanderbilt and with the technical assistance of Vivien Thomas, in an attempt to produce pulmonary hypertension and using the dog as the experimental animal, Dr Blalock constructed an end-to-end surgical anastomosis between the subclavian artery and the pulmonary artery.

In 1996, 16 centers in Michigan were invited to participate in a multicenter PCI registry. Nine centers agreed to a pilot data collection and, as of July 2001, eight centers are still actively collecting data. An Oracle database was developed by the coordinating center. A common data collection form and a standard set of definitions were agreed on during several meetings. Data validity was insured through review of each form by a trained nurse, by automatic database diagnostic routines, and by site visits that included a review of the catheterization laboratory logs and a review of randomly selected charts. The average number of forms requiring query resolution was 33% in 1997 (range 7-76%), and it decreased to 5% in 1999 (range 1.4-10%). The most commonly queried variables were outcomes prior to discharge, lesion category, lesion complexity, date of birth, device used, gender, postprocedural percent stenosis, presence of left main disease, and MI date. Invalid dates, identification of the doctor, the presence of duplicate forms, and of duplicate outcomes were additional common queries generated by the internal diagnostic routines.

Life expectancy at all ages is also increasing. At 65 years life expectancy ranges from 14.9 to 18.9 years and at 80 years from 6.9 to 9.1 years for men and women, respectively. Cardiovascular disease is the most frequent single cause of death in persons over 65 years of age1, and most importantly it is responsible for considerable morbidity and a large burden of disability, particularly in the community. Cardiovascular pathologies such as hypertension and cerebrovascular disease, and heart diseases such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure, increase in incidence with increasing age.w1 The aging process itself also effects the cardiovascular system. It is difficult to differentiate \"normal\" aging, which is inevitable, from age related pathology, which is potentially preventable or treatable.w2 Age related changes are most likely to be seen in the \"old old\" who have escaped cardiovascular pathology earlier in life.

This event was co-sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Texas Heart Institute, two international leaders in the treatment of cancer and heart disease. Although similar meetings have been sponsored in the past, by us and by others, this meeting was remarkable for its scope and ambition. It was our intent to show that basic science can be used successfully to guide translational and clinical research. This First International Conference has heralded the coming of onco-cardiology as a research and clinical subspecialty. In this conference, cardiovascular complications were discussed in modules that comprised heart failure, imaging, radiation, thrombocytopenia, cardiac masses, and hypertension. Clinical experts from MD Anderson and other institutions presented updates on timely clinical topics, followed by question-and-answer sessions. A significant portion of the conference was devoted to basic mechanisms that drive paradigm shifts in this emerging field. Major discoveries were reported on a new paradigm for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and vascular complications caused by some targeted agents. The role of prior exposure to doxorubicin in trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity was also discussed. Early identification of cardiotoxicity using biomarkers or left ventricular strain imaging has commanded significant attention. The proceedings of these modules are summarized concisely in the accompanying articles. This conference was not designed to cover the entire field, but rather to create a model for future conferences. Consequently, there are many important clinical issues and basic mechanisms that remain to be covered in future meetings. In addition to the clinical and basic-science modules, there was a session on the dialogue between patient and doctor. As physicians, we are in our comfort zone when illness is defined by medical terms and laboratory numbers. It is refreshing to hear about it from a patient's perspective: illness is a personal affliction that alters one's sense of wellness and self-esteem. Indeed, this conference is dedicated to all cancer patients who have suffered cardiovascular complications. A decade ago, MD Anderson had 2 in-house cardiologists and referred most cardiovascular complications to surrounding hospitals in the Texas Medical Center. As the complexity of our patient population grew, it became difficult to obtain timely consultation and treatment for our patients. Consequently, the Department of Cardiology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center was established in 2000. I was recruited as the founding chair with the charge to develop a comprehensive cardiology service and to develop basic and clinical research relevant to cancer and the heart. The service now consists of 11 cardiologists, 7 physician extenders, 2 pharmacists, and 5 rotating cardiology fellows who provide comprehensive cardiac care to cancer patients. We have also built a cardiac catheterization laboratory that performs cardiac biopsies, diagnostic studies, and the implantation of pacemakers. We have strong basic research laboratories that have published their findings in prestigious scientific journals. Our experience is not unique because several institutions in the United States and Europe have already established “onco-cardiology” (or “cardio-oncology”) units. These centers include Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York) and the European Institute of Oncology (Milan). Each onco-cardiology unit faces different challenges that are associated with the size of the hospital, its affiliation with other general hospitals, and the scope of cancer treatments. Smaller onco-cardiology units are also emerging within major medical centers in the United States. These small units usually have cardiologists who have developed an interest in taking care of the heart problems of cancer patients, in addition to the problems encountered in a general cardiology practice. As these onco-cardiology units proliferate, it is important to establish communications between them in order to share common experiences and extraordinary challenges. Onco-cardiology is a medical subspecialty concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in cancer patients. Clearly, this field is not limited to cardiologists, but also includes medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgical oncologists, and all others who are interested in caring for cancer patients with cardiac problems. A major issue that our field must define is the scope of the core knowledge that needs to be shared by all practitioners. Furthermore, we must educate our cardiology and oncology colleagues about the importance of providing optimal cardiac care to cancer patients. These efforts should bring about improved clinical outcomes and enhance the development of new anticancer therapies. As cancer therapy becomes more effective and as more cancer patients become cancer survivors, it is the goal of the “onco-cardiologist” to ensure that our patients will have healthy hearts to enjoy their new lives.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2413834827", "source": "openalex"}

The authors hypothesized that blood speckle-tracking (BST) could visualize and quantify flow patterns. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, accuracy, and potential clinical applications of BST in pediatric cardiology.BST is based on high-frame rate ultrasound, using a combination of plane-wave imaging and parallel receive beamforming. Pattern-matching techniques are used to quantify blood speckle motion. Accuracy of BST velocity measurements was validated using a rotating phantom and by comparing BST-derived inflow velocities with pulsed-wave Doppler obtained in the left ventricles of healthy control subjects. To test clinical feasibility, 102 subjects (21 weeks to 11.5 years of age) were prospectively enrolled, including healthy fetuses (n = 4), healthy control subjects (n = 51), and patients with different cardiac diseases (n = 47).The phantom data showed a good correlation (r = 0.95, with a tracking quality threshold of 0.4) between estimated BST velocities and reference velocities down to a depth of 8 cm. There was a good correlation (r = 0.76) between left ventricular inflow velocity measured using BST and pulsed-wave Doppler. BST displayed lower velocities (mean ± SD, 0.59 ± 0.14 vs 0.82 ± 0.21 m/sec for pulsed-wave Doppler). However, the velocity amplitude in BST increases with reduced smoothing. The clinical feasibility of BST was high, as flow patterns in the area of interest could be visualized in all but one case (>99%).BST is highly feasible in fetal and pediatric echocardiography and provides a novel approach for visualizing blood flow patterns. BST provides accurate velocity measurements down to 8 cm, but compared with pulsed-wave Doppler, BST displays lower velocities. Studying blood flow properties may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of pediatric heart disease and could become an important diagnostic tool.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2019.11.003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3000871037", "source": "openalex"}

Since its first appearance in invasive cardiology, OCT maintains a strong presence in the research environments for the identification of vulnerable plaques, as it is able to overcome difficulties presented by other techniques such as virtual intravascular ultrasound, near-infrared spectroscopy, and histology. Moreover, OCT is increasingly being used in the clinical practice as a guide during coronary interventions and in the assessment of vascular response after coronary stent implantation. This review focuses on the relevance of OCT in research and clinical applications in the field of invasive cardiology and discusses the future directions of the field.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2174/1573403x10666140604120753", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107830995", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3195540246", "title": "Pediatric cardiology", "text": "Annals of Pediatric Cardiology (APC) is a global journal and has a vision to further expand its footprint across the world.[1] Indian health care has seen unprecedented growth in the last few decades, which has further received a great boost with the announcement of \"Make in India\" and \"Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India program)\" by the Government of India. The editorial board of APC has decided to dedicate the current issue to \"Research Made in India,\" an attempt to highlight the progress of pediatric cardiology in India. Besides, this editorial tries to address a few critical questions: \"Has India become self-reliant in the field of pediatric cardiology in terms of delivering clinical care, in training health professionals, and in addressing research questions relevant to India?\" SELF-RELIANCE IN THE DELIVERY OF PATIENT CARE The first pediatric cardiac surgery was performed in India way back in 1949 and the first Indian center that sought to deliver pediatric cardiac care was established in the 1960s.[2] After considerable hiatus until the mid to late 90s, multiple pediatric cardiac centers were established. Many of these are now offering high-quality pediatric cardiac and surgical services. In the current scenario, we need to address issues related to availability, accessibility, and affordability of pediatric cardiac care in India. A status report in 2005 estimated the number of pediatric cardiac centers in India at 14,[3] and the number stands now at 90 based on an inquiry done among the members of Pediatric Cardiac Society of India (PCSI). It only seems that pediatric cardiac care in India has grown from its infancy to childhood. The rate of increase in the number of hospitals is particularly steep in the past two decades with newer cities such as Jaipur, Raipur, Coimbatore, Bhubaneshwar, Palwal, and a few more added to the map of pediatric cardiac care in India. Despite this, patients face a variety of challenges in accessing standard pediatric cardiac care. Most of the pediatric cardiac centers are concentrated in major cities, and most of them are privately run. The distribution of pediatric cardiac centers is also not uniform across the country. For instance, Kerala has eight centers offering neonatal cardiac surgeries for an estimated 4.5 lakh annual childbirths. In stark contrast, the most populous states of India, namely Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with estimated annual childbirth of 48 and 27 lakhs, respectively (Census of India, 2012), do not have a center capable of performing neonatal cardiac surgery. Hence, all sick neonates born in these states who need emergency cardiac surgery have to be transported, often by trains, buses, or occasionally private ambulances to the nearest cardiac centers, which are usually hundreds of kilometers away. Many Indian pediatric cardiac programs have shown the way in terms of cost-efficiency. Most of the cardiac procedures are performed at a fraction of the cost compared to Western countries. For instance, an arterial switch surgery costs anywhere between 800 and 6000 USD in India, depending on the nature of the hospital, while the approximate cost for the same procedure exceeds 50,000 USD in the United States.[4] However, lack of insurance and dependency on out-of-pocket expenses have remained major hindrances, making pediatric cardiac care largely unaffordable for the average Indian family. Fortunately, several funding opportunities have emerged for children needing a cardiac surgery over the past decades. Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK), a program under the National Health Mission, intends to eliminate the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by families toward the treatment of infants in public health facilities. Ayushman Bharat, other state government insurance schemes for the underprivileged, and funding from nongovernmental organizations have made financial assistance for pediatric cardiac procedures available for most Indians. However, a lack of awareness about these schemes among parents remains a major constraint. Developing subspecialties of pediatric cardiac care in India is the need of the hour. Whereas interventional and surgical pediatric cardiology services are reasonably well established, especially in the Southern and Western parts of India, the rest of subspecialties lack an organized structure. Even in these parts, the rates of antenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) are dismal. Some specialized services such as inherited cardiovascular disease clinics[5] and pediatric heart transplant programs are getting established. However, organized adult CHD and pediatric electrophysiology services are almost nonexistent. There are no dedicated care providers for adults with CHD, with both trained adult cardiologists who lack CHD knowledge and pediatric cardiologists who lack expertise in managing adults, ultimately ending up caring for these patients. There are no dedicated pediatric electrophysiologists, and electrophysiology services for children with CHD are provided by adult electrophysiologists only. There are very few personnel qualified as pediatric cardiac intensivists, and there is really no system to train them. In delivering pediatric cardiac care, India has taken the first steps toward being self-sufficient. There is a lot that needs to be done for improving the access and the quality of care. The available resources, though limited, are to be utilized judiciously. Every state should establish enough pediatric cardiac centers to cater to their local needs and develop an integrated model of care for children with heart diseases. Lessons should be learned from programs like the Hridyam, a unique initiative by the Government of Kerala, aimed toward early detection and management of critical CHDs. At the hospital level, quality and outcomes are variable across India. Nationwide audits and quality control initiatives are needed. We need to set up centers of national excellence for uncommon pediatric cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathies, inherited cardiovascular diseases, and pulmonary hypertension. SELF-RELIANCE IN TRAINING OF PERSONNEL The US had 2966 pediatric cardiologists in 2019, with a ratio of one pediatric cardiologist per 29,196 population.[6] In contrast, India has only 300 pediatric cardiologists for a population of 1.39 billion with a ratio of one per 4,500,000 population. The comparison is even more dismal for pediatric cardiac surgeons, though accurate numbers are not available. An additional challenge is to motivate younger generation cardiovascular surgeons to take up the subspecialty of pediatric cardiac surgery. The number of centers offering pediatric cardiology fellowship programs has increased over the years. Yet, the total number of fellows trained (Doctorate in Medicine and Diplomate of National Board) is around 35 per year only. Unlike the Western world, where most fellows (59%) pursue advanced fellowships after their pediatric cardiology fellowship,[7] such opportunities are seldom available in India. To bridge the gap, PCSI has instituted fellowship programs in selected subspecialties of fetal cardiology, electrophysiology, and pediatric cardiac intensive care involving centers of excellence across the country. India needs to invest in training specialized nurses to provide critical care for children with CHD, a neglected field. The number of training centers, quality of training, and availability of advanced subspecialty training must further improve in India. SELF-RELIANCE IN RESEARCH In contrast to patient care and education, we are a lot less self-sufficient in terms of research in pediatric cardiology. India is a net consumer than the producer of original research in the field. In recent years, the major Indian contributions to pediatric cardiac surgery include two-stage arterial switch surgery,[8] delayed primary arterial switch surgery,[9] and an innovative approach of integrated extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit[10] for late presenters with transposition of great arteries (TGA) and intact ventricular septum. In the field of noninterventional pediatric cardiology, noteworthy Indian contributions include echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease,[11] drug therapy for children with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension[12] and adolescents with Eisenmenger syndrome,[13] use of thiamine to reverse infantile pulmonary hypertension,[14] management of nonspecific aortoarteritis,[15] and lifestyle diseases in children.[1617] Off-label use of devices for perimembranous ventricular septal defects[18] and Gerbode defect,[19] ductal stenting in late presenters with TGA,[2021] and balloon-assisted atrial septal defect device deployment technique[22] are some of the major contributions to the field of interventional pediatric cardiology. Truly Indian innovations include a percutaneous transvenous aortic valve technology (MyVal; Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd, India) and a multifunctional occluder device known as Lifetech™ Konar-MF.[23] Indian contributions to pediatric cardiac research could have been a lot better, considering the number of patients and the quality of expertise. It is unfortunate that none of the Indian articles featured among the most influential 100 articles compiled by Eynde et al.[24] in the field of CHD published between 2000 and 2020. This is despite the fact that research activity in Indian pediatric centers has increased exponentially, and the total number of articles published from India is at its peak in recent years. One of the main reasons for this paradox is that the research performed in India is not focused on areas that interest the Western world. For this editorial, the most cited Indian articles published over 30 years between 1991 and 2020 were compiled [Table 1]. The methodology used for compiling the list and relevant references is outlined in Supplementary Appendix 1 and 2. Such an approach focusing on citations, especially in a field known for low citation scores, has an inherent bias toward older articles and articles focusing on popular areas. Yet, this exercise presents some important learnings. Most of the impactful Indian researches in pediatric cardiology over the past three decades have come from only a few select institutions involving a group of dedicated clinical researchers. Furthermore, most of these articles concentrated on relevant Indian issues, prevalent tropical diseases, or introduced niche ideas. They offer the young Indian pediatric cardiac specialists an inspiration and motivation to aim higher and encourage them to focus on issues that are pertinent to Indian patients.Table 1: Most cited Indian articles published in the field of pediatric cardiology over 30 years between 1991-2020Focused issue on research \"Made in India\" In this issue of Annals, we decided to focus on Indian research articles, and it reflected a lot of our strengths. All the major Indian pediatric cardiac centers are represented, covering various aspects of pediatric cardiology including intensive care,[25] anesthesia,[26] fetal cardiology,[27] electrophysiology,[28] and heart transplantation,[29] fields in which articles published from India are limited. The PCSI COVID-19 registry[3031] is the first major collective effort from 24 pediatric cardiac centers across India. The first of the two papers offers a bird's eye view of what happened to pediatric cardiac care in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is heartening to see that emergent cases received appropriate care despite mounting challenges.[30] The second paper confirms the popular belief that the outcome of unoperated children with serious CHD could be compromised when they acquire a COVID-19 infection.[31] The accompanying editorial proposes a call for action and describes how we can prevent the situation in future in India and other low- and middle-income countries.[32] We sincerely hope that this first collaborative registry is the beginning of brighter things to come and not a one-time affair. To make this a reality, we need strong leadership, wider participation, and persistence. Successful percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) using three different percutaneous valve systems is presented[333435] and includes the first Indian multicenter experience of Melody valve implantation.[33] These articles raise the uncomfortable question that why Indian patients should wait for 20 years to get these newer and expensive technologies. The successful off-label use of relatively cheaper Indian MyVal system in pulmonary position could help us in making the therapy more affordable.[34] However, at current costs, these therapies are out of full insurance coverage by governmental and private insurance schemes. The editorial by Kothari[36] presents a critical appraisal of follow-up of operated patients with Tetralogy of Fallot and the thoughtful application of these expensive PPVI technologies in Indian patients. Considering the various concerns with PPVI in India, a strategy to reduce the subsequent requirement for pulmonary valve replacement during the primary surgery assumes greater importance, which was the focus of two different surgical approaches described from India in the current issue.[3738] Randomized controlled trials, especially drug trials, are a rarity among children with CHD. A randomized study of propranolol for heart failure in infants with ventricular septal defect demonstrated reduced hospitalizations and improved outcomes.[39] Exploring novel medical therapies is important for India, as many children diagnosed with critical heart disease do not receive timely interventions. Even though definitive evidence is lacking, the importance of beta-blockers for heart failure in children is highlighted in the editorial by Buchhorn.[40] He argues for a more widespread use of beta-blockers for heart failure in children, while more evidence becomes available. RESEARCH IN PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY IN INDIA: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS The major reasons for the current state of pediatric cardiac research in India include lack of manpower, overwhelming patient load and clinical care, lack of dedicated time for research, lesser funding opportunities, and limited collaborative multicenter research. Research in pediatric cardiac surgery is even less compared to the field of interventional cardiology, and so is research in the fields of pediatric cardiac anesthesia and intensive care. Rarely, various subspecialties come together to perform high-quality research. The status of medical research and the reasons for it are the same across various medical fields in India and are not unique to pediatric cardiology. Pediatric cardiac research in India is limited to a select few individuals of limited centers as stated earlier. Some of them excel in their fields and are world leaders. However, the number of such leaders is small for a country of the size of India. The most critical and urgent step needed is to increase the critical mass of persons involved in pediatric cardiac research. In this regard, it is heartening to see a few small centers thinking beyond anecdotal or uncommon case reports and coming up with innovative original research work. Importance of having our outcome data could not be overemphasized as it would help us realize how far and how fast we need to go before we could achieve self-reliance. We need to move beyond intervention-dominated research. Challenges in resource-limited settings are unique, and we need to focus on our own problems and innovate methods to resolve them. Long-term follow-up studies are difficult in the Indian system, but increased mobile phone penetration and advancements in telemedicine services provide good opportunities. Western medical curricula have integrated research as a core activity of academic training. Basics of research methodology are systematically taught, and pathways for becoming a physician–scientist are well established. Those in academic positions are periodically evaluated on the merits of projects and research output. Such systems are nonexistent in India even in academic institutions. Then, why do Indian physicians indulge in research? either due to compulsion to fulfill criteria for promotions or thesis requirements for their academic degrees. Only a handful are self-motivated and carry out research with an itch to solve an important problem. We need to make clinical research attractive in India by introducing both financial and nonfinancial incentives. Mentoring is another hurdle as the number of good quality mentors is limited in India. Often, mentoring is limited within the boundaries of catheterization laboratories and operating rooms in India. The pediatric cardiac community in India is witnessing a generational change. Those who are about to graduate to leadership positions need to have a futuristic vision and make a difference in research while maintaining the standards set in clinical care. In recent times, several youngsters are coming through and are importantly focused on a particular field. Many of them are inducted into the revamped editorial board of APC. Some institutions collaborate with foreign institutions and encourage young fellows and faculty, especially in their formative years, to take part in collaborative clinical work and research. In a nutshell, critical appraisal of pediatric cardiac research in India may identify a lot of missed opportunities. However, what is already achieved is commendable considering the dismal physician per patient ratios and workload. Each missed opportunity is a chance to learn and strategize a plan. We need to concentrate on collaborative research, high-quality randomized controlled studies, meta-analysis, and systematic reviews focusing on areas relevant to India. An increase in the critical number of clinicians involved in research, motivating the younger generation, and incentivizing research activities may be the first steps ahead. \"You are what your deep, driving desire is.

Given the complexity and variety of approaches and recordings, there is now growing recognition of the need to embed computational methods in cardiovascular medicine and science for analysis, integration and prediction. This paper describes a Workshop on Computational Cardiovascular Science that created an international, interdisciplinary and inter-sectorial forum to define the next steps for a human-based approach to disease supported by computational methodologies. The main ideas highlighted were (i) a shift towards human-based methodologies, spurred by advances in new in silico, in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo techniques and the increasing acknowledgement of the limitations of animal models. (ii) Computational approaches complement, expand, bridge, and integrate in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experimental and clinical data and methods, and as such they are an integral part of human-based methodologies in pharmacology and medicine. (iii) The effective implementation of multi- and interdisciplinary approaches, teams, and training combining and integrating computational methods with experimental and clinical approaches across academia, industry, and healthcare settings is a priority.

EBSC aims to harmonize the process of accreditation of sub-specialities and thereby to provide uniformity of accreditation standards throughout cardiology. Certification in cardiology, for instance, the EBSC Diploma of European Cardiologist, is essential before an individual applies for sub-speciality accreditation. European accreditation standards within sub-specialities should be clearly defined, thereby assuring patients and other doctors the competence and skills of the accredited sub-specialists. This is increasingly important in times of developing mobility of doctors and patients in Europe in agreement with the basic EU principles of free movement. The process of sub-speciality accreditation of physicians in Europe has already been initiated by a number of sub-specialities. Those initiatives are based on similar principles and include theoretical (knowledge assessment) and practical (log books) assessments of the training and expertise in the field. These initiatives so far have not followed any specific configuration, mainly because no recommendations have yet been established by authorized scientific or regulatory bodies. It is the aim of this document to provide such a guideline. It is important that European accreditation of General Cardiology and sub-specialities is compatible with existing national accreditation systems. European accreditation aims to develop, enhance, and harmonize national assessment and assurance of competence. It is therefore foreseen that, in future, national accreditation systems will develop into a European accreditation system, as defined by the EBSC. Standardization of the process will foster future compatibility of accreditation systems within cardiology at European and national level.

The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver‐operating‐characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers.

Concerning requirements for wearing personal dosemeters, only 57 % of the RB specifies the number and position of dosemeters for staff monitoring. Less than 40 % of the RBs could provide occupational doses. Reported annual median effective dose values (often <0.5 mSv) were lower than expected considering validated data from facility-specific studies, indicating that compliance with continuous individual monitoring is often not achieved in IC.

Few studies have assessed to what extent stage 1 hypertension in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure (BP) guidelines is associated with incident HF and AF.Analyses were conducted with a nationwide health claims database collected in the JMDC Claims Database between 2005 and 2018 (n=2 196 437; mean age, 44.0±10.9 years; 58.4% men). No participants were taking antihypertensive medication or had a known history of cardiovascular disease. Each participant was categorized as having normal BP (systolic BP <120 mm Hg and diastolic BP <80 mm Hg; n=1 155 885), elevated BP (systolic BP 120-129 mm Hg and diastolic BP <80 mm Hg; n=337 390), stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP 130-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg; n=459 820), or stage 2 hypertension (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg; n=243 342). Using Cox proportional hazards models, we identified associations between BP groups and HF/AF events. We also calculated the population attributable fractions to estimate the proportion of HF and AF events that would be preventable if participants with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension were to have normal BP.Over a mean follow-up of 1112±854 days, 28 056 incident HF and 7774 incident AF events occurred. After multivariable adjustment, hazard ratios for HF and AF events were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.15) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.99-1.17), respectively, for elevated BP; 1.30 (95% CI, 1.26-1.35) and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.13-1.29), respectively, for stage 1 hypertension; and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.97-2.13) and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.41-1.64), respectively, for stage 2 hypertension versus normal BP. Population attributable fractions for HF associated with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension were 23.2% (95% CI, 20.3%-26.0%) and 51.2% (95% CI, 49.2%-53.1%), respectively. The population attributable fractions for AF associated with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension were 17.4% (95% CI, 11.5%-22.9%) and 34.3% (95% CI, 29.1%-39.2%), respectively.Both stage 1 hypertension and stage 2 hypertension were associated with a greater incidence of HF and AF in the general population.

Gated SPECT for determining regional and global function have provided incremental diagnostic and prognostic information in the evaluation of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction and regional myocardial wall thickening can now be simultaneously evaluated with regional perfusion particularly with the use of the (99m)Tc-labeled perfusion agents such as sestamibi and tetrofosmin. Many studies have shown that the extent and severity of stress-induced perfusion defects have incremental prognostic value over exercise electrocardiographic stress test variables alone. Patients with normal perfusion scans have <1% combined cardiac death and myocardial infarction rates per year and thus have an excellent prognosis. Diabetics are particularly benefited from stress perfusion imaging for detection of coronary artery disease and risk assessment. Diabetics have a worse prognosis than nondiabetics for the same amount of hypoperfusion on stress SPECT studies. Quantitative rest perfusion imaging with (201)Tl or with one of the (99m)Tc-labeled imaging agents, or PET imaging with (18)F-deoxyglucose can accurately distinguish viable from irreversibly injured myocardium providing useful information for identifying which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy benefit most from coronary revascularization with a subsequent improvement in left ventricular function and enhanced survival. Finally, serial stress perfusion imaging can be employed to monitor the efficacy of medical therapy that improves endothelial function and myocardial blood flow reserve.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W110027091", "source": "openalex"}

To address these issues, the IAEA conducted a worldwide study of nuclear cardiology practice. We present the European subanalysis. In March 2013, the IAEA invited laboratories across the world to document all SPECT and PET studies performed in one week. The data included age, gender, weight, radiopharmaceuticals, injected activities, camera type, positioning, hardware and software. Radiation effective dose was calculated for each patient. A quality score was defined for each laboratory as the number followed of eight predefined best practices with a bearing on radiation exposure (range of quality score 0 – 8). The participating European countries were assigned to regions (North, East, South, and West). Comparisons were performed between the four European regions and between Europe and the rest-of-the-world (RoW). Data on 2,381 European patients undergoing nuclear cardiology procedures in 102 laboratories in 27 countries were collected. A cardiac SPECT study was performed in 97.9 % of the patients, and a PET study in 2.1 %. The average effective dose of SPECT was 8.0 ± 3.4 mSv (RoW 11.4 ± 4.3 mSv; P < 0.001) and of PET was 2.6 ± 1.5 mSv (RoW 3.8 ± 2.5 mSv; P < 0.001). The mean effective doses of SPECT and PET differed between European regions (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). The mean quality score was 6.2 ± 1.2, which was higher than the RoW score (5.0 ± 1.1; P < 0.001). Adherence to best practices did not differ significantly among the European regions (range 6 to 6.4; P = 0.73). Of the best practices, stress-only imaging and weight-adjusted dosing were the least commonly used. In Europe, the mean effective dose from nuclear cardiology is lower and the average quality score is higher than in the RoW. There is regional variation in effective dose in relation to the best practice quality score. A possible reason for the differences between Europe and the RoW could be the safety culture fostered by actions under the Euratom directives and the implementation of diagnostic reference levels. Stress-only imaging and weight-adjusted activity might be targets for optimization of European nuclear cardiology practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-015-3270-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2288070142", "source": "openalex"}

This contrasts with the remaining burden of cardiovascular disease in Europe and in the world. Thus, clinical cardiovascular research needs to adapt to address the impact of these challenges in order to ensure development of new cardiovascular medicines.The present paper is the outcome of a two-day workshop held by the Cardiovascular Round Table of the European Society of Cardiology. We propose strategies to improve development of effective new cardiovascular therapies. These can include (i) the use of biomarkers to describe patients who will benefit from new therapies more precisely, achieving better human target validation; (ii) targeted, mechanism-based approaches to drug development for defined populations; (iii) the use of information technology to simplify data collection and follow-up in clinical trials; (iv) streamlining adverse event collection and reducing monitoring; (v) extended patent protection or limited rapid approval of new agents to motivate investment in early phase development; and (vi) collecting data needed for health technology assessment continuously throughout the drug development process (before and after approval) to minimize delays in patient access. Collaboration across industry, academia, regulators, and payers will be necessary to enact change and to unlock the existing potential for cardiovascular clinical drug development.A coordinated effort involving academia, regulators, industry, and payors will help to foster better and more effective conduct of clinical cardiovascular trials, supporting earlier availability of innovative therapies and better management of cardiovascular diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv213", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099350710", "source": "openalex"}

The evidence suggests that this technique is feasible and provides haemodynamic and clinical improvement for up to 2 years in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis at high risk or with contraindications for surgery. Questions remain mainly concerning safety and long-term durability, which have to be assessed. Surgeons and cardiologists working as a team should select candidates, perform the procedure, and assess the results. Today, the use of this technique should be restricted to high-risk patients or those with contraindications for surgery. However, this may be extended to lower risk patients if the initial promise holds to be true after careful evaluation.Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a promising technique, which may offer an alternative to conventional surgery for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis.

Data Sources: Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1979-April 2008) using the search terms type 2 diabetes mellitus. thiazolidinediones. cardiovascular events, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and edema. Reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, observational studies (case-control, cohort), and descriptive studies (case reports, caso series) were included. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All articles that were written in English and identified from the data sources were reviewed. Data Synthesis: The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes, with the subsequent addition of a TZD, sulfonylurea, or insulin if the target is not met. Beyond glucose lowering, TZDs improvo various factors associated with cardiovascular risk. Whether the effects translate into beneficial cardiovascular outcomes is controversial. In PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), pioglitazone did not produce a significant reduction in the primary endpoint that included a composite of coronary and vascular deaths, but the secondary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, Ml, or stroke was significantly reduced. Concerns related to HF have led to warnings in the labeling of TZDs. The drugs are contraindicated in patients with New York Head Association Class Ill or IV HF. Rosiglilazone, but not pioglitazone, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemic events, although the absolute magnitude is extremely small. Conclusions: Although the glycemic efficacy of TZDs is comparable to that of metformin, ad verso effects and higher costs make TZDs less appealing for initial therapy. Among the TZDs. pioglitazone should be considered based on cardiovascular safety data. In combination with metformin, pioglitazone may be particularly beneficial for patients wilh diabetes and metabolic syndrome. For patients on rosigfitazone who are achieving glycemic goals and tolerating the therapy without apparent complications, rosiglitazone may be continued.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1k666", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148909008", "source": "openalex"}

However, little is known about the specific experience of cardiology fellows who become parents during training. Methods and Results A 66‐question Internet‐based survey about experiences of pregnancy during graduate medical training was administered between May 1 and July 15, 2013, to all trainees (N=1516) in the Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education across 3 academic sites. Questions explored the experiences of new mothers, fathers, and their fellow trainees. There were 644 survey respondents overall (response rate, 42%), and of 73 cardiovascular trainees, 29 (10 women [35%]) completed the survey. Of those surveyed, 59% reported having children. All trainee mothers reported making alterations to their training schedule due to pregnancy and maternity leave. Twenty percent of trainee fathers also reported changing their training because of their partner's pregnancy. Of trainees with children, 41% reported difficulty completing research because of pregnancy and childcare obligations. Nontrainee mothers were significantly more likely to breastfeed beyond 6 months compared with trainee mothers ( P =0.018). A perceived stigma attached to pregnancy was reported by 62% of trainees. Both male and female trainees felt that their programs did not promote pregnancy‐related schedule flexibility. Conclusions Our study shows that both men and women entering parenthood during cardiology training often have to change their schedule, research, and career path. Cardiology training programs should focus on curriculum design and supportive parenthood policies to both avoid negative stigma and optimize fellowship training during this time period.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.012137", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2957240793", "source": "openalex"}

Unfortunately, due to the lack of screening tools that address the specific needs of hospitalized patients, few cardiac inpatient programs offer routine screening for these forms of psychological distress, despite recommendations to do so. The purpose of this study was to validate single-item measures for depression and anxiety among cardiac inpatients. Consecutive inpatients were recruited from the cardiology and cardiac surgery step-down units at a university-affiliated, quaternary-care hospital. Subjects completed a questionnaire that included: (a) demographics, (b) single-item-measures for depression and anxiety (from the Screening Tool for Psychological Distress (STOP-D)), and (c) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). One hundred and five participants were recruited with a wide variety of cardiac diagnoses, having a mean age of 66 years, and 28% were women. Both STOP-D items were highly correlated with their corresponding validated measures and demonstrated robust receiver-operator characteristic curves. Severity scores on both items correlated well with established severity cut-off scores on the corresponding subscales of the HADS. The STOP-D is a self-administered, self-report measure using two independent items that provide severity scores for depression and anxiety. The tool performs very well compared with other previously validated measures. Requiring no additional scoring and being free, STOP-D offers a simple and valid method for identifying hospitalized cardiac patients who are experiencing psychological distress. This crucial first step triggers initiation of appropriate monitoring and intervention, thus reducing the likelihood of the adverse cardiac outcomes associated with psychological distress.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1474515114548649", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142506635", "source": "openalex"}

Prof Halle commented on his experience in the taskforce: “The level of evidence is rather low, so it is very much the personal perspective and the experience of the experts which made us come to that one conclusion in the guidelines. It is something that should be developed in years to come.” A series of videos were shown, presented by specialists who were invited to discuss some of the most relevant topics of the guidelines.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.33590/emjcardiol/20f1020", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4235172455", "source": "openalex"}

The impact of applying recent guideline definitions for nonpregnant adults to pregnant women is unclear. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine whether reclassification of hypertensive status using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline definition better identifies women at risk for preeclampsia or eclampsia and adverse fetal/neonatal events compared with the current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) definition of hypertension. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study used electronic medical record data of women who delivered singleton infants between 2009 and 2014 at a large US regional health system. Data analysis was performed from July 2020 to September 2020. <h3>Exposure</h3> Application of ACC/AHA and ACOG guidelines for the definition of chronic and gestational hypertension. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary maternal end point was the development of preeclampsia or eclampsia, and the primary fetal/neonatal end point was a composite of preterm birth, small for gestational age, and neonatal intensive care unit admission within 28 days of delivery. Net reclassification indices were calculated to examine how well the lower ACC/AHA diagnostic threshold reclassifies outcomes of pregnancy compared with the current ACOG definition of hypertension. <h3>Results</h3> Applying the ACC/AHA criteria to 137 389 pregnancies of women (mean [SD] age at time of delivery, 30.1 [5.8] years) resulted in a 14.3% prevalence of chronic hypertension (19 621 pregnancies) and a 13.8% prevalence of gestational hypertension (18 998 pregnancies). A 17.8% absolute increase was found in the overall prevalence of hypertension from 10.3% to 28.1%. The 2.1% of women who were reclassified with chronic rather than gestational hypertension had the highest risk of developing preeclampsia compared with women without hypertension by either criterion (adjusted risk ratio, 13.58; 95% CI, 12.49-14.77). Overall, the use of the ACC/AHA criteria to diagnose hypertension resulted in a 20.8% improvement in the appropriate identification of future preeclampsia, but only a 3.8% improvement of appropriate fetal/neonatal risk classification. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Using the lower diagnostic threshold for hypertension recommended in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline increased the prevalence of chronic and gestational hypertension, markedly improved the appropriate identification of women who would go on to develop preeclampsia, and was associated with the identification of adverse fetal/neonatal risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.3808", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3146443304", "source": "openalex"}

Based on the experiences from the literature and the authors own laboratory, the applications of the signal averaging technique in clinical cardiology are reviewed: extraction and analysis of the fetal EKG and P‐wave variations, His bundle electro‐grams from the body surface (recovery rate 33–100% of cases), ventricular delayed depolarizations within the ST segment of the surface EKG (recovery rate, 40–90% of cases, depending on patient groups investigated), preatrial activity (sinus nodal potentials) from intra‐cardiac (recovery rate, 80–90% of individuals), or surface EKGs (recovery rate, 60% of patients), analysis of frequency components of surface EKG‐QRS complexes in patients with previous myocardial infarctions, and detection of low amplitude diastolic signals from surface phonocardiogram (recovery rate, 80% of cases). At present, advantages and limitations of the signal averaging technique may be appraised as follows: (1) sinus nodal potentials: S‐A conduction times may be more reliable than those obtained by the extra‐stimulus technique, since with averaging they are recorded during undisturbed sinus rhythm; direct recordings of changing S‐A blocks may be impossible due to the summation process; validation of sinus nodal potentials in man necessary, (2) A‐V nodal potentials: demonstration of true A‐V nodal rhythm rather than His bundle rhythm; possibly direct identification of abnormal pathways in A‐V nodal tachycardias; direct recordings of single A‐V nodal blocks impossible due to summation process; (3) surface His bundle potentials: follow‐up or screening of patients with A‐V nodal and particularly His‐Pur‐kinje‐system blocks; monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug therapy; atrial overlap in one‐third of cases; direct identification of higher degree A‐V nodal blocks impossible due to summation process (future developments may overcome this problem); (4) ventricular delayed depolarizations: possible identification of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death; follow‐up of therapeutic measures like antiarrhythmic drug therapy or cardiac surgery (bypass grafting, aneurysmectomy); validation of delayed depolarizations from body surface by direct intracardiac and/or epicardial mapping necessary.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.4960050201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006090401", "source": "openalex"}

The 2016 Taiwan Society of Cardiology - Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (TSOC-HFrEF) registry showed that the guideline-recommended therapies were prescribed suboptimally both at the time of hospital discharge and during follow-up. We, therefore, conducted this 2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure to reinforce the importance of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of heart failure. The 2019 focused update discusses new diagnostic criteria, pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological management, and certain co-morbidities of heart failure. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If channel inhibitor is introduced as new and recommended medical therapies. Latest criteria of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device therapy are reviewed in the non-pharmacological management chapter. Co-morbidities in heart failure are discussed including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sleep-disordered breathing. We also explain the adequate use of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in heart failure management. A particular chapter for chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is incorporated in the focused update to emphasize the importance of its recognition and management. Lastly, implications from the TSOC-HFrEF registry and post-acute care of heart failure are discussed to highlight the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy and the benefits of multidisciplinary disease management programs.

The incidence of diabetes is steadily climbing, which is causing grave concern. As a result, it is essential to take into consideration the risk factors that are pervasive in Egyptian society and have led to the worsening of this problem. These risk factors include sedentary lifestyles, obesity, hepatitis C infections, pesticides, smoking, and bad cultural habits. In this review, we aim to demonstrate the possible solutions to fight diabetes mellitus and overcome its serious health and socioeconomic burdens in Egypt. A multidisciplinary, team-based approach is highly recommended in diabetes management. Primary care physicians, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and preventive cardiologists all play a crucial role in providing the highest possible level of care to diabetic patients by collaborating closely with one another. The assessment of cardiovascular risk and the prevention of life-threatening cardiovascular events, common among diabetic patients, warrant the introduction of preventive cardiology, a new and significant concept in diabetes care that demands adoption.

Methods and results: 56 consecutive patients (pts), 26 women, mean age 60.0 ± 11.9 years admitted in our Cardiology Department had an echocardiogram performed by both cardiology trainees using a HHE with B-mode capabilities only and by cardiologists with advanced training in echocardiography using a standard echocardiography device (SE). Several parameters were analyzed: the presence of wall motion abnormalities (WMA), aortic valve abnormalities (AVAbn), mitral valve abnormalities (MVAbn), the presence of pericardial effusion (PE), as well as the presence of a dilated (LVD) or hypertrophied left ventricle (LVH). The Kappa coefficient of correlation between the two methods (k) was determined, along with the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). Both HHE and SED examinations were possible in 52 of the 56 pts (92.8% feasibility). There was a moderate correlation in the assessment of WMA (k = 0.56) with a substantial agreement for MVAbn (k = 0.72), AVAbn (k = 0.76), LVH (k = 0.67) There was excellent agreement for LVD (k = 0.81). Valvular diseases were determined by HHE with good Sp (MVAbn – 97.4%, AVAbn – 100%), although the Sn and NPV were lower. Conclusions: Bedside evaluation using HHE is helpful for assessing LV chamber and walls dimensions, LV regional function, and morphological abnormalities of the valves.

On the basis of these findings, therefore, head protection would be a mandatory good practice to reduce effects of head exposure to ionizing radiation among invasive cardiology personnel (and among other exposed professionals).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s135561771500082x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2272813002", "source": "openalex"}

Randomized trials have shown a risk of major bleeding of 1-8% at 30 days in ACS patients, and of 2-5% per year in patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulants (OACs). Observational studies suggest that bleeding risk is even higher. Major bleeding is associated with a subsequent increase in both short-And long-Term mortality. Evenminimal bleedingmay have prognostic importance because it frequently leads to disruption of antithrombotic therapy. Severalmechanisms have been put forward to explain the relationship between major bleeding and increased mortality (Figure 1). The overlap in risk factors for bleeding and ischaemic events means that patients who are more likely to suffer from bleeding complications of antithrombotic therapy also tend to be at higher risk of thrombotic events.Discontinuation of antithrombotic drugs may lead to an increased rate of thrombotic events due to the progressive recovery of platelet function and coagulation activity. In addition, bleeding may provoke prothrombotic responses beyond those related to discontinuation of antithrombotic drugs.Clearly, balancing the risks of further bleeding vs. potentially fatal thrombotic events is critical for decisions about if and when to restart antithrombotic therapy after bleeding.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehw454", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2544588396", "source": "openalex"}

Many modifiable psychosocial risk factors have been identified and can affect the course of cardiac illness. These include the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, stress, anger/hostility, and social isolation. Anxiety has been found to increase the risk of developing CHD in healthy subjects and can lead to worsening of existing CHD. There is much overlap and confusion throughout the research literature between what authors define as anxiety, stress, Type A behavioral pattern, and anger/hostility. There is a need for better screening within the practice of cardiology for these psychosocial risk factors to ensure better integration of mental health services. Established screening tools such as the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionaire-9, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale are described and compared with the newer Screening Tool for Psychologic Distress as part of the initial work-up of every cardiac patient. Recommendations are made using the author's Anxiety Treatment Algorithm regarding when to refer to a mental health professional along with how to reduce stigma and provide more integrated care. The diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is reviewed, with attention to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress reduction, and behavioral medicine group programs. These group programs are recommended because they help to overcome social isolation and counsel patients on how to adapt to a healthy lifestyle.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1992005972", "title": "Developing a Transition Program from Pediatric- to Adult-Focused Cardiology Care: Practical Considerations", "text": "Until recent decades, the majority of infants born with congenital heart defects did not survive to reach adulthood. With such pessimistic mortality expectations, it was understandable that individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD) would be followed by pediatric cardiologists throughout their lives. However, due to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CHD, it is now estimated that over 90% will reach adulthood.1, 2 As a result, there are currently at least equal numbers of children and adults living with CHD.3 Improved survival expectations have contributed to an international movement favoring the transition of CHD patients from pediatric-focused to adult-centered cardiology care.4-7 An optimal transition process provides uninterrupted health care and emphasizes patient education and empowerment. The importance of a thoughtful and coordinated transition from pediatric- to adult-focused cardiology care has gained increased attention.8-10 While there is general consensus of the rationale for the transition of patients with CHD, practical information is less available. This article aims to (1) review the concept of transition, including the definition, rationale, timing, and domain of responsibility, and (2) present practical strategies to assist with the implementation and enhancement of transition services. Strategies target both developing and existing transition programs. As there is a paucity of CHD-specific transition research, studies from other health conditions are included as appropriate. Transition is not synonymous with the transfer of medical care. Transfer is typically considered an event, whereas transition is conceptualized as a process. Transfer of care refers to the movement of patients and their care from one medical facility or provider to another. In some countries, the health care system mandates that patients are discharged from pediatric care at a specified age. Transition, in contrast, refers to a shift in the responsibility of health care management from the family to the patient. It is a thoughtful and gradual process that is best initiated several years prior to transfer of care and continues following transfer. It has been defined as the \"purposeful, planned movement of adolescents and young adults with chronic physical and medical conditions from child-centered to adult-oriented health care systems.\"11 The goal is to \"provide uninterrupted health care that is patient-centered, age and developmentally appropriate, flexible, and comprehensive.\"9 Although transition should not be equated with transfer of care, the two concepts are not unrelated. Transfer of care is typically, although not always, part of a successful transition. Furthermore, the effectiveness of transition can impact whether successful transfer occurs. For example, one of the significant predictors of follow-up at a specialized adult CHD (ACHD) center is attendance at pediatric cardiology appointments without parents or siblings (an indication that health care responsibility has shifted to the young patient).12 Kieckhefer and Trahms present a shared management approach to transition that includes developmental and leadership considerations.13 In this model, patients first enters the medical system as children who receive care. As patients age, they become providers of certain aspects of self-care, then progress to become managers and later supervisors of their care. Eventually, patients are considered to be \"CEOs\" of their health care when they have assumed health care responsibility. Within this management model, there is a corresponding gradual shift in the role of parents. Although parents might enter the model as CEOs of their child's care, they gradually assume less responsibility over time. This shared management model illustrates the changing roles of both patients and parents and requires support within the care health care system. There are at least two strong reasons to focus on the transition from pediatric to adult-focused cardiology care. First, transition toward increased responsibility over health care decision making does not occur in isolation. Rather, it impacts and is impacted by other experiences associated with adolescence and young adulthood. This phase of life is linked with increased social independence, developing romantic relationships, and the pursuit of educational and career options. Erikson described the primary psychosocial conflict of adolescence to be \"identity vs. identity confusion.\"14 During this stage, adolescents transition between childhood and adulthood and attempt to develop a sense of identity and an understanding of their roles in society. The term \"emerging adulthood\" has been used to describe the stage between 18 and 25 years.15 Individuals in this age group have a sense of having left adolescence but not yet having fully reached adulthood.15 This feeling may be more prominent among young adults who have grown up with chronic diseases because they typically achieve fewer vocational, psychosexual, and social developmental milestones or achieve them at an older age than their healthy peers.16, 17 Two factors are most relevant for the process of reaching adulthood: (1) accepting responsibility for one's self, and (2) making independent decisions.15, 18 Accepting responsibility, decision making, and individual identity are also relevant to the transition from pediatric- to adult-focused care. The second reason to focus on transition relates to the goal of health optimization through consistent medial care.19 The American Academy of Pediatrics identified this goal \"to maximize lifelong functioning and potential through the provision of high-quality, developmentally appropriate health care services that continue uninterrupted as the individual moves from adolescence to adulthood.\"20 Well-informed patients are expected to recognize the importance of uninterrupted health care21 and thus medical sequelae would be detected and managed sooner. Yeung et al. investigated lapses in care among adults with CHD22. In patients with defects of moderate or great complexity, 63% had lapses in care of 2 years or longer. Patients with lapses of care were more likely to be symptomatic, receive new cardiac diagnoses, and require urgent cardiac intervention; one-third of patients with lapses recalled being told that cardiac follow-up was not required.22 Another study showed that the likelihood of admission to hospital through emergency departments nearly doubled during the transition period and was more common among uninsured patients or those with public insurance.23 Furthermore, in 21- to 44-year-old patients with CHD, the majority of CHD surgical hospitalizations occurred in hospitals that average <5 congenital heart surgeries per year.23 These findings highlight the need for better education regarding adult care, earlier recognition of symptoms, and regional ACHD centers. At a minimum, young patients with defects of moderate or great complexity must be informed of the need for regular follow-up in adulthood. There exists no single \"right\" time or age for transition or rigid age limit defining child vs. adult services.24 The ongoing process of transition might begin at the time of diagnosis and end following transfer to an adult care facility.25 The transition of CHD patients should start by adolescence around the age of 12 years.26, 10 A gradual process toward establishing autonomy, understanding one's cardiac anatomy and health status, and becoming aware of relevant lifestyle issues is recommended.7\"Envisioning a future\" has been identified as an important first step in the transition process for individuals with special health care needs or disabilities.27 Reiss et al. recommended \"starting early,\"27 which can be assisted with the creation of a written health care transition plan.20 An earlier start can lead to more successful transition. For example, in patients with cystic fibrosis, initial discussions regarding transition typically began at 17 years and patients were transferred at 19 years; there was limited time to develop important self-care skills.28 Although age of transfer is mandated in some countries, ideally, the timing of transfer would be flexible and depends on a patient's chronological age, medical and developmental status, adherence to therapy, maturity and independence, the preparation and readiness of both patient and family, and the availability of appropriate adult health care providers.19, 29 Adolescents and young adults with CHD and their parents prefer the transition process to be individualized to each adolescent.30 Transition and education regarding self-management should not culminate with transfer to adult care, and ought to continue through the period of emerging adulthood to address ongoing changes. Poor knowledge among ACHD patients regarding birth control, pregnancy, and genetic counseling, as well as the continued need for vocational and employment advice, highlight the importance of ongoing education during adulthood.31-33 Preferably, all health professionals caring for patients with CHD would be involved in the transition process. This includes (1) general pediatric health care providers who transfer their patients to adult health care providers, (2) physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants in the pediatric cardiology setting, and (3) adult health care providers. Clearly, the process of transition begins in the pediatric setting. However, as transition refers to the shift in health care responsibility from the family to the patient, ACHD providers are not excused from this responsibility; ongoing transition-focused services are often important. In pediatric and adult care settings, it is often nurses, nurse practitioners, and other midlevel providers who provide crucial transition services.34-36 Internal medicine/pediatric cardiologists who continue to follow their pediatric patients into adulthood are not exempt from the transition process. They should provide education and foster independence among the patients they continue to follow into adulthood. Therefore, even patients who continue to see the same health care providers for their CHD care should undergo a process of transition. This is similar to the care provided by family practitioners or internal medicine/pediatric specialists who transition their patients with no plans to transfer care out of their practice.37 There are several potential obstacles during the transition process including expectations and behaviors of patients, families, and health care providers. During the period of transition, patients unlearn pediatric adaptive behaviors and strategies and learn new \"adult system\" behaviors. They may have concerns about building new relationships with providers and receiving appropriate care.38 Even post-transfer, young adults may remain under their parent's insurance coverage and are often accompanied to clinic appointments by the primary insurance holder, thereby continuing the role established in childhood. Patients may be overwhelmed by self-care and decision-making responsibilities, particularly when confronted by difficult \"realities\" of increasing morbidity and shorter life expectancies. The timing of transfer often coincides with other stressful situations, including making educational, vocational, and relationship decisions. Post-transfer, many patients are faced with a loss or change of medical insurance and an increase in personal financial responsibilities. The regionalization of ACHD care often leads to long travel distances and may be impractical for young adults with limited finances and resources.39 In addition to medical providers, parents are to be credited for their children reaching adolescence and young adulthood, as they ensured their children attended medical appointments and adhered with medication regimens. Parents were also required to provide informed consent for all diagnostic, surgical, and interventional procedures. Many adults with CHD, however, recall parental overprotection during their teenage years.40-43 Parents may be concerned about the possibility that their adolescent and young adult children might be less vigilant to health care needs and thus receive suboptimal cardiac care. Hutchinson et al. found that almost one-third of parents resisted the idea of their children seeing health care providers on their own, but this figure was reduced to 15% following education regarding the importance of this process.44 In addition, parents often become very attached to pediatric care providers who saved or prolonged the lives of their children. Pediatric cardiologists may be reluctant to transition and transfer their patients to ACHD cardiologists because of the close relationships they develop with patients and their families. They might also lack confidence in adult providers.45 In addition, for pediatric cardiologists and nurses who entered that subspecialty to work with infants and younger children, it requires a shift in professional attitude to begin treating adolescents like young adults. For example, the discussion of more mature topics of sexuality and substance abuse can be uncomfortable to initiate. It has been suggested that pediatric cardiologists and parents must unlearn previously developed behaviors and promote \"closure\" to allow the development of relationships with new adult providers.46 As there is an inadequate number of ACHD care providers and clinics,7, 47 it may be difficult to locate and establish ACHD cardiac care. The establishment of adult primary care can also prove difficult, as many internists think they have had inadequate training to take care of adults with childhood onset conditions.48 In addition, adult care providers with less knowledge of the needs of transitioning patients might be less prepared to meet their ongoing educational needs. Transition to adult care occurs at a time when many young adults lose or change their medical insurance coverage. Insurance may be declined or offered at high premiums for patients with CHD49, 50 and, therefore, may prevent continued CHD care. Even when available, the patient may be required by their insurance providers to see a general cardiologist instead of an out-of-network ACHD cardiologist. The development of a comprehensive and fully integrated transition program is a significant undertaking, and health care professionals might feel overwhelmed by this prospect. In order to alleviate such concern, this article does not propose that a comprehensive transition program is the only model to consider. Rather, the goal is to provide a menu of options from which programs can select the ones that best match their needs and resources. A \"transition to transition\" approach is offered in order to support the introduction as well as the enhancement of transition services. This article will first present preliminary strategies focused on creating an environment of awareness and programmatic commitment. This will be followed by the presentation of specific projects that target various components of the transition process. Table 1 provides a summary of these strategies. One's personal knowledge can be enhanced through a review of key journal articles and relevant Internet resources. Knowledge of the developmental stages of adolescence and the impact of chronic illness are essential.51 Individuals are encouraged to begin with a review of specific transition guidelines, such as those provided by the American Society for Adolescent Medicine, the UK Department of Health, the Canadian Pediatric Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.19, 20, 24, 25 Once familiarity with general goals of transition has been achieved, individuals should become aware of international guidelines supporting the transition of CHD patients from pediatric-focused to adult-centered cardiology care.4-7 Finally, individuals are encouraged to remain current with the growing body of CHD-specific empirical and review literature.8-10 There are several ways in which to provide transition-focused education to one's colleagues. Depending on one's clinical practice and setting, this may be achieved by formal staff training, in-services, and Grand Rounds. Education, however, would ideally include all members of the health care team with any patient contact (e.g., physicians, nurses, and mid-level providers). Even front office staff in pediatric cardiology clinics should be educated about the transition process and asked to adopt certain transition-related practices, such as directing questions to the adolescent patient during the check-in process. It can be very helpful to consult with individuals at other programs of similar structure and size that have successfully introduced transition-focused initiatives. For example, pediatric cardiology programs based in tertiary care centers have different resources and needs than multiperson or solo community practices. In addition, it is important to determine whether there are other departments within one's institution that have implemented transition services or whether there are adolescent medicine specialists. Support from one's department or division's upper administration is crucial to the ongoing success of transition programs. Lack of institutional support has been identified as one of the main barriers to transition.52 In addition, many adult providers do not feel adequately trained to provide care for patients with congenital conditions and commitment for their professional educational needs should be secured.48 Personnel. Physicians, midlevel providers, nurses, allied health professionals, and administrative staff hold key roles in the facilitation of effective patient transition. Transition-focused education may be offered by all individuals with direct patient contact. Nurses are often best able to provide individualized education and counseling, and nurse-provided education in clinics is a cornerstone of many transition programs.35 Time and Space. Within scheduled pediatric clinic visits, there can be allocated time to discuss transition planning, provide tailored education, and answer questions. Many teenagers will ask questions if they are comfortable and encouraged to do so. This process requires designated staff time and room space. Finances. Although financial considerations (e.g., clinic space, human resources) cannot be ignored, they should not hamper the implementation of transition services; several of the strategies introduced in the next section can be provided at minimal cost. In a recent survey, fewer than 5% of pediatric cystic fibrosis centers reported a strong negative financial impact of establishing a transition program.28 Other Subspecialists. It is helpful to develop links and share resources with other subspecialists who face issues of transition. There may be hospital, institutional, or local community support to address transition needs and foster the development of patient self-care. This may include adolescent medicine specialists who are trained to address these issues and internal medicine/pediatric providers or family practitioners who provide ongoing general care. This collaboration can avoid the simultaneous transfer from all pediatric general and subspecialty providers to adult providers. Consider referring patients to a regional \"medical home,\" particularly those with complex medical conditions53 or other comorbid medical conditions. A \"medical home\" provides ongoing general care and coordinated medical services while the patient transitions to adult subspecialty care. The medical transition outcome has been shown to be higher among patients receiving general care in a medical home setting.54 Media. There is increasingly available information in the print and electronic media to provide information regarding transition for patients, their families, and providers. Among the useful websites are: http://hctransitions.ichp.edu, http://video.ichp.ufl.edu/twyd.php, http://www.sickkids.ca/good2go/ and http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/NationalServiceFrameworks/Children/Transitionfromchildrenstoadultservices/index.htm. Within a program, one might consider identifying committed physicians, nurses, and physician extenders to serve as leaders in the transition process. There are many approaches to developing a transition program and the following list of strategies is not meant to be prescriptive. The implementation of all components is unnecessary and may be unrealistic. Rather, a program can choose several projects best suited to their individual needs and resources. Specific considerations include the type and size of program, the policies and philosophy of the program, and unique aspects of the community and geographical region. Success with smaller-scale projects might provide impetus for the development of an increasingly comprehensive program. The identification of a transition coordinator has been identified as one of the critical first steps and recommended by ACHD tasks forces6, 20, 26. Research indicates the benefit of transition coordinators and easy phone access to nurses.55 The findings in adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis indicated that identified key workers would alleviate confusion regarding transition56. A designated transition coordinator should be committed (rather than assigned) to the transition program and have dedicated time. The roles of a transition service coordinator include clinical expert, consultant, leader, researcher, and educator57 and should be the primary contact for transitioning patients, family members, and staff. The development of a clinic database (compliant with privacy legislation) to identify patients approaching age for transition and subsequent transfer will ensure that no patient is excluded. This database can identify patients for transition classes, transitional social events/regional conferences, and relevant communication. Identifying patients approaching transfer, one can guarantee that any necessary evaluations or interventions are performed. It is important to prepare patients and their families for transition and transfer in advance.51 A written health care transition plan, prepared together with the young person and family, is recommended.20 Parents are important partners in transition and a plan will prompt them to consider future expectations for their children.27 Written transition plans should be prepared several years prior to transfer (e.g., by age 14 years). Unfortunately, many patients and parents with chronic medical conditions are not adequately prepared for transition. In a study of parents of 14- to 17-year-olds with special health care needs, approximately 50% of parents had discussed transition with their child's physician, but only 16% had discussed a plan for changing health care needs and eventual referral to a physician who provides adult care.58 In a national survey of parents of children with special care needs, only 41% reported discussions with their providers regarding future adult providers, future health care needs, changes in health insurance, and encouragement for their child to take increasing responsibility.54 Fewer than 10% of cystic fibrosis patients transferred at 19 years had written lists of desirable self-management skills.28 There is, therefore, room for improvement in the preparation of patients and families for transition and eventual transfer to adult-focused care. Not surprisingly, a predictor of successful follow-up at a specialized ACHD center is documentation in the medical chart regarding the need for ACHD follow-up.12 Health professionals should initiate dialogue with patients of all ages in order to establish comfort with health-related communication. Speaking with adolescents without the parents present gives young patients an opportunity to discuss their health, ask questions, and serve as their own advocate.25 One strategy is to establish the practice of independent patient dialogue in early adolescence. Although 12 years of age is likely reasonable for many patients, the timing must be flexible and developmental factors must be considered. This independent time may occur either during the physical examination59 or toward the end of the clinic visit. Adolescents may feel more comfortable with a same-sex provider present. Although this strategy requires adaptation by patients, family members, and the health care team, research suggests benefits. Adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis indicated that opportunities to speak to their health care providers alone facilitated more open disclosure and contributed to increased independence and control.56 In a survey of parental attitudes, 93% of parents supported their teens having an independent meeting with providers if the patient wished.44 Some young patients have difficulty managing independent consultations or explaining their preference to be seen alone. It is the responsibility of care providers to facilitate this independent consultation and provide adequate time to address patient concerns. Some adolescents may feel more comfortable communicating by electronic mail or text messages, and programs should develop guidelines (consistent with privacy regulations) to manage communication. A significant predictor of successful transfer to adult care is the independent attendance of the patient at pediatric cardiology appointments, an indication that the health care responsibility has shifted to the patient.12 Teenagers should be encouraged to contact the office to make appointments, request medication refills, and ask questions of their care provider. To the degree that it is reasonable, health care providers can include young patients in the decision-making process (e.g., timing elective tests to coordinate with school, social or sport schedules). These patient behaviors are important in the transition of the responsibility of health care management from the family to the patient. In the pediatric setting, programs can identify transition as a priority by demonstrating a \"public\" commitment to transition. Consider signs that read: \"We TRANSITION teenage patients to take more responsibility for their health care management,\"\"We TRANSFER patients to adult-focused care at the age of 18,\" or \"When our patients become teenagers, it is our practice to ensure that they have time to speak with their cardiologists alone.\" Therefore, even parents of young children with CHD will be prompted to consider future health care interactions and the initiation of transition services will be expected. Education is the foundation of the transitional process and begins with parents. \"Envisioning a future\" is an important first stage in the transition process, beginning early with the identification of a special health care need or disability.27 Education of the parents must include but not be limited to diagnostic and treatment-related information. A discussion of long-term medical plans will establish and emphasize the need for lifelong cardiac care and parents should be aware that there will come a time when their children will be transitioned to take increased responsibility for their health care management. Preparation of patients for self-care is an ongoing process that begins in early childhood and continues into adulthood.33 Even young children can be encouraged to discuss their activity level and symptoms with health care providers. Asking a 4-year-old child what they plan to do when they grow up encourages them to consider a future.26 In later childhood, knowledge of cardiac diagnosis, medication, exercise limitation, and antibiotic prophylaxis should be discussed directly with the patients and their parents or caregivers. In teenage years, heart-healthy behaviors and the risks of smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs should be introduced and discussed during regular clinic visits. The use of birth control, the risks of pregnancy, and relevant genetic aspects of their cardiac disease should be discussed as appropriate. Patients should be able to discuss these issues in a private and nonconfrontational environment. Although patients with defects of moderate or great complexity are at increased risk for medical residua, many patients with CHD consider themselves to be \"cured\" or have unrealistic life expectancy.1, 4, 60-62 As lapses in medical care have been associated with poorer cardiac status,22 at a minimum, patients must be educated about the need for lifelong cardiac care and follow-up, and this should be stated directly and emphasized often. Patients with CHD require accurate knowledge regarding their cardiac defects, treatment, and strategies to reduce complications in order to take responsibility for their health care.50 The core educational curriculum should include relevant medical information as well as broader lifestyle implications.9, 50Table 2 provides a list of education topics most relevant to the needs of CHD patients. This information can be provided in multiple learning opportunities including outpatient visits, inpatient stays, and educational seminars.9 Although education should begin in the pediatric setting, it must not end following transfer, as studies have shown that up to half of adults with CHD patients are unable to name or describe their heart defects.63-67 In both pediatric and adult settings, programs are encouraged to provide printed materials to supplement verbal information. The majority of young adults have used the Internet to seek health information.68 Programs can also develop podcasts, blogs, or video blogs to capture the interest of transitioning teenagers. To avoid overlooking important educational topics, an \"educational checklist\" can be placed in outpatient charts. Although time consuming, attempts should be made to incorporate education into most clinic visits.69 It is both unrealistic and inappropriate to cover all educational topics at every patient visit; thus, the checklist is designed to ensure that all topics are covered appropriately. A copy of this checklist may be given to the patients to encourage them to prepare relevant questions before clinic visits. The provision of specific transition clinics in both pediatric and adult settings is encouraged. Cystic fibrosis research suggests that patients and families are interested in transition clinics and that they are effective.55, 70 One successful model for CHD patients is the Copenhagen Transition Program, which invites adolescents to independently participate in a consultation with a specially trained nurse.35 There are several ways that transitional clinics can be arranged: (1) with a pediatric cardiologist with a specific interest in transition, (2) with the patient's regular pediatric cardiology provider with an adolescent care specialist,3 as an independent consultation with a specially trained nurse or midlevel provider, or4 with an ACHD care specialist. The transitional visit is designed to address unique transitional issues and not to provide general cardiac care. Transition clinics can provide a systematic approach to ensure that all \"departing\" or \"incoming\" patients receive a predefined level of information and transition consultation. Alternately, there could be a referral process by which selected patients are identified by colleagues, and might depend upon the patient's cardiac defect and their individual maturity level, needs, and preferences. When feasible, the facilitation of a meeting with ACHD providers to address concerns about post-transfer care can be effective. Research indicated that young people with chronic illnesses appreciated meeting adult care providers and had higher rates of post-transfer clinic attendance.55, 71 Practices with large referral areas might consider using telecommunication to establish a virtual transitional clinic. Diabetic patients reported a positive attitude to a virtual clinic and appreciated the opportunity to ask questions anonymously.72 A social network or \"chat room\" encourages communication and provides access to information73 and is appropriate for a teenager's lifestyle. Due to time constraints during busy outpatient clinics, an alternative is to schedule transitional classes or regional events. Ideally, these group events are scheduled with CHD patients of similar age, but if resources are limited, transition education can be provided to groups of teens with various chronic medical conditions. Inviting regional ACHD providers to these events can be an effective way to introduce patients to their future providers and address specific questions about the adult clinical practice or inpatient hospital facilities. In addition to group education events, camps offered to young people with CHD present a less formal but effective method to instill an awareness of the importance of lifelong cardiology care. Research suggests that attendance at a cardiac camp results in improved knowledge, adherence to therapy, emotional well-being, self-esteem, and adaptation to illness.74, 75 Adults with CHD can serve as volunteer counselors and \"mentors\" and provide encouragement. In addition to understanding their cardiac diagnoses and treatment history, it is important for patients to be able to communicate this information particularly in emergency situations.26 A portable and accessible summary of medical history allows for effective collaboration among health care providers.20 In order for transfer to occur, pediatric providers must first identify regional ACHD cardiologists or centers. Pediatric programs can provide written notification to patients prior to their final clinic appointments to encourage preparation of final questions for the pediatric team. Following this final pediatric visit, a transfer of care letter with relevant medical and psychosocial information and care plan should be provided to the adult congenital cardiologist in a timely fashion with a copy sent to the patient. Patients should be provided with contact information for the adult providers and how to schedule the first appointment. Following successful transfer, there should be limited communication between patients and their pediatric providers. The transfer of care to a designated ACHD provider is the culmination of pediatric cardiac care and a successful transition, and like any \"graduation,\" should be celebrated.46 When possible, joint meetings between pediatric and adult providers offer an opportunity to discuss both pre- and post-transfer issues. The accepting ACHD physician and care team may discuss any concern they have with the patient's former pediatric cardiologist and this may be reassuring for the patients and their families. A transition program should be evaluated regularly in order to determine its effectiveness and whether modifications are indicated.38 Eighty percent of cystic fibrosis clinics reported reviewing the patient's transition experiences.28 The administration of surveys to patients, families, and staff can provide useful feedback; it is important to maintain flexibility and make modifications as needed. Information on the effectiveness of CHD-specific transition programs is scarce,76 but the results of studies of patients with other chronic conditions are promising. Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were generally satisfied with structured transitional programs and reported significant postprogram benefits in health-related quality of life77 and significant improvement in knowledge, independent health behaviors, and prevocational experience.78 International working groups recommend that programs provide a coordinated transition process for CHD patients. This entails a gradual shift in the responsibility of health care management from the family to the patient. The goal is to provide uninterrupted and specialized CHD health care through patient education and empowerment. As such, it is ideally initiated in early adolescence and may continue for several years following transfer to adult health care providers. For individuals and programs wishing to introduce transition services, necessary first steps are focused on creating an environment of awareness and programmatic commitment. When developing transition initiatives, programs should choose projects that are tailored toward their program's unique needs and resources. Although programs might vary in their specific transition initiatives, the key themes remain: preparation, education, and evaluation. Effective transition strategies can successfully address the needs and provide positive experiences for all key stakeholders, including patients, family members, and health care providers.

We aim to assess in the real world the suitability of PCSK 9 inhibitors for acute coronary syndromes. Methods and Results We analyzed a prospective Swiss cohort of 2023 patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes between 2009 and 2014 with available data for low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipid‐lowering therapy at 1 year. Clinical familial hypercholesterolemia was defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network algorithm as unlikely, possible, probable, or definite. We simulated a fixed relative reduction of 24% in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 1 year in all patients not treated with ezetimibe, irrespective of the low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and statin regimen. At 1 year, 94.3% of patients were treated with statin, 5.8% with ezetimibe, and 35.8% of patients had on‐target low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (&lt;1.8 mmol/L); 25.6% met criteria for possible or probable/definite familial hypercholesterolemia. After a simulation of the lipid‐lowering effect of ezetimibe, the proportion of patients who would be eligible for PCSK 9 inhibitors at 1 year was 13.4% using American College of Cardiology criteria and 2.7% using European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society criteria. Patients with possible or probable/definite familial hypercholesterolemia were more eligible for PCSK 9 inhibitors compared with their non–familial hypercholesterolemia counterparts: 27.6% versus 8.8% according to American College of Cardiology criteria and 6.6% versus 1.8% according to European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society criteria ( P &lt;0.001).

However, there is a group of specific heart muscle diseases that are rare in nature whose clinical/echocardiographic phenotypes resemble those of the four classical morphological subgroups of hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic CMPs. These rare CMPs, often but not solely diagnosed in infants and paediatric patients, should be more properly labelled as specific CMPs. Emerging consensus exists that these conditions require tailored investigation and management. Indeed, an appropriate understanding of these conditions is mandatory for early treatment and counselling. At present, however, the multisystemic and heterogeneous presentation of these entities is a challenge for clinicians, and time delay in diagnosis is a significant concern.

Heart failure, type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, and thrombosis have been shown to be related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and a 'long COVID-19' illness has been recognized with fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnoea among the most frequent symptoms reported after discharge from hospital. This paper focuses on some open questions that cardiologists are going to face during the next months in a general cardiology outpatient clinic, in particular how to evaluate a 'post-COVID' patient during follow-up of CV complications of the acute phase and how to manage new CV symptoms that could be the consequence, at least in part, of heart/vessels and/or lung involvement of the previous virus infection. Present symptoms and signs, history of previous CV disease (both preceding COVID-19 and occurring during viral infection), and specific laboratory and imaging measurements during the acute phase may be of interest in focusing on how to approach the clinical evaluation of a post-COVID patient and how to integrate in our standard of care the new information on COVID-19, possibly in a multidisciplinary view.

Later Elizabeth Garrett, disbarred like all women in the UK from attending medical school, passed examinations for the licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries and was admitted to the register in 1865. The call-up of doctors during the first world war allowed more women to enter the profession and by the mid 1940s they constituted 20% of all doctors. Thereafter there was little change for 30 years, when numbers of women entering UK medical schools started to increase to the point that they came to outnumber men during the 1990s. Despite this, women remain underrepresented in many hospital specialties, particularly cardiology, where they constitute only 16.8% of trainees and 7.4% of consultants. The failure of cardiology to attract such a large proportion of the talent pool prompted the British Cardiac Society to establish this working group, whose remit has been to identify the scale of the problem and the reasons for it to develop strategies for improving recruitment and retention of female cardiologists. ### 1.

We have studied a good number of research papers on Artificial Intelligence on cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify its significant benefits, applications, and future scope. AI uses artificial neuronal networks (ANN) to predict. In cardiology, it is used to predict the survival of a COVID-19 patient from heart failure. AI involves complex algorithms for predicting somewhat successful diagnosis and treatments. This technology uses different techniques, such as cognitive computing, deep learning, and machine learning. It is incorporated to make a decision and resolve complex challenges. It can focus on a large number of diseases, their causes, interactions, and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper introduces AI-based care and studies its need in the field of cardiology. Finally, eleven major applications of AI in cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic are identified and discussed. Cardiovascular diseases are one of the major causes of death in human beings, and it is increasing for the last few years.

Despite early revascularization the mortality of cardiogenic shock remains high and roughly half of patients do not survive until hospital discharge or 30-day follow-up. However, there is only limited evidence-based scientific knowledge in the cardiogenic shock setting. Therefore, recommendations and actual treatments are often based on retrospective or prospective registry data and extrapolations from randomised clinical trials in acute myocardial infarction patients without cardiogenic shock.

DESIGN Consensus meeting. SETTING Multidisciplinary workshop supported by the National Institute on Aging, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Geriatrics Society, February 6–7, 2017. PARTICIPANTS Leaders in the Cardiology and Geriatrics communities, (officers in professional societies, journal editors, clinical trialists, Division chiefs), representatives from the NIA; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Food and Drug Administration; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine, Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, pharmaceutical industry, and trainees and early career faculty with interests in geriatric cardiology. MEASUREMENTS Summary of workshop proceedings and recommendations. RESULTS To better align older adults’ healthcare preferences with their care, research is needed to improve skills in patient engagement and communication. Similarly, to coordinate and meet the needs of older adults with multiple comorbidities encountering multiple healthcare providers and systems, systems and disciplines must be integrated. The lack of data from efficacy trials of CVD medications relevant to the majority of older adults creates uncertainty in determining the risks and benefits of many CVD therapies; thus, developing evidence‐based guidelines for older adults with CVD is a top research priority. Polypharmacy and medication nonadherence lead to poor outcomes in older people, making research on appropriate prescribing and deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy and methods to improve adherence to beneficial therapies a priority. CONCLUSION The needs and circumstances of older adults with CVD differ from those that the current medical system has been designed to meet. Optimizing pharmacotherapy in older adults will require new data from traditional and pragmatic research to determine optimal CVD therapy, reduce polypharmacy, increase adherence, and meet person‐centered goals. Better integration of the multiple systems and disciplines involved in the care of older adults will be essential to implement and disseminate best practices.

They should be helpful in everyday clinical decision-making. A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by different organizations-European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and other related societies. By means of links to web sites of National Societies several hundred guidelines are available. This profusion can put at stake the authority and validity of guidelines, which can only be guaranteed if they have been developed by an unquestionable decision-making process. This is one of the reasons why the ESC and others have issued recommendations for formulating and issuing guidelines. In spite of the fact that standards for issuing good quality guidelines are well defined, recent surveys of guidelines published in peer-reviewed journals between 1985 and 1998 have shown that methodological standards were not complied with in the vast majority of cases. It is therefore of great importance that guidelines and recommendations are presented in formats that are easily interpreted. Subsequently, their implementation programmes must also be well conducted. Attempts have been made to determine whether guidelines improve the quality of clinical practice and the utilization of health resources. In addition, the legal implications of medical guidelines have been discussed and examined, resulting in position documents, which have been published by a specific Task Force. The ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) supervises and coordinates the preparation of new Guidelines and Expert Consensus Documents produced by Task Forces, expert groups or consensus panels.

A registry from the European Society of Cardiology", "text": "Background Depression and anxiety are established psychosocial risk factors for coronary heart disease. Contemporary data on their prevalence and associations with other risk factors were evaluated as part of the EUROASPIRE IV survey. Design The design of this study was cross-sectional. Methods The study group consisted of 7589 patients from 24 European countries examined at a median of 1.4 years after hospitalisation due to coronary heart disease events. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results Symptoms of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety score ≥8) were seen in 26.3% of participants and were more prevalent in women (39.4%) vs men (22.1%). Of the patients, 22.4% (30.6% of women and 19.8% of men) had symptoms of depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression score ≥8). Nevertheless, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications were prescribed to only 2.4% of patients at hospital discharge, and 2.7% and 5.0% of patients, respectively, continued to take them at interview. Both anxiety and depression were associated with female gender, lower educational level and more sedentary lifestyle. Anxiety was more prevalent in younger age groups and depression rates increased with advancing age. Depression was positively associated with current smoking, central obesity and self-reported diabetes. A number of positive lifestyle changes reduced the odds of anxiety and depression. Conclusions A substantial proportion of patients have anxiety and depression symptoms after coronary heart disease events but these conditions are undertreated. These disorders, especially depression, are associated with other risk factors, including educational level, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, unhealthy diet and reduced compliance with risk factor modification.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487317711334", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2617552729", "source": "openalex"}

Over the past 25 years, the number of individuals with hypertension and the estimated associated deaths has increased substantially. There have been great debates in the past few years on the blood pressure (BP) targets. The 2013 European Society of Hypertension and European Society of Cardiology HT guidelines suggested a unified systolic BP target of 140 mmHg for both high-risk and low-risk patients. The 2014 Joint National Committee report further raised the systolic BP targets to 150 mmHg for those aged ≥ 60 years, including patients with stroke or coronary heart disease, and raised the systolic BP target to 140 mmHg for diabetes. Instead, the 2015 Hypertension Guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology and the Taiwan Hypertension Society suggested more aggressive BP targets of < 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, and atrial fibrillation patients on antithrombotic therapy. Based on the main findings from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and several recent meta-analyses, the HT committee members of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology and the Taiwan Hypertension Society convened and finalized the revised BP targets for management of HT. We suggested a new systolic BP target to < 120 mmHg for patients with coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease with an eGFR of 20-60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years, using unattended automated office BP measurement. When traditional office BP measurement is applied, we suggested BP target of < 140/90 mmHg for elderly patients with an age ≥ 75 years. Other BP targets with traditional office BP measurement remain unchanged.

These relate to the operational performance of cardiology units and capture the timeliness and cost efficiency of cardiac care. We also investigate the complementary role played by the experiential quality in enhancing the impact of clinical quality and clinical flexibility on operational performance measure. Experiential quality relates to patient‐centered delivery of care by a hospital. We collect and combine data for 876 U.S. hospitals from four distinct sources and undertake multi‐level analyses that consider a hierarchical structure in which the hospital is nested within county and state. To disentangle the effects at the levels of states, counties, and hospitals, we use the mixed‐effects modeling approach. The results obtained from econometric analyses indicate that clinical quality and clinical flexibility reduce cardiology unit average length of stay. Clinical flexibility also helps in reducing the average cost of cardiology units. Experiential quality moderates the impact of clinical quality on length of stay and plays a complementary role in the relationship between clinical flexibility and cost.

Recent findings First, the prenatal detection of congenital heart disease has improved, and continues to improve, with the increasingly widespread incorporation of the four-chamber view and outflow tracts into the routine screening fetal ultrasound evaluation. Second, increasingly sophisticated computer processing systems and improvements in imaging technology have enabled the development of automated three-dimensional ultrasound imaging systems that promise to revolutionize both the prenatal detection and diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Conventional two-dimensional imaging approaches may soon become obsolete. Third, there has been an increasing ability to intervene successfully prenatally not only for fetal arrhythmias and heart failure, but also for some forms of structural heart disease. In some cases of left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, early intervention during the second trimester may prevent the development of ventricular hypoplasia. Finally, several recent studies suggest that prenatal diagnosis may improve neonatal outcome for fetuses with congenital heart disease. The growing ability to intervene prenatally has the potential to improve neonatal outcome still further.

Here, the current medical and surgical applications of virtual reality are reviewed and the potential for future applications explored. Recent findings Multiple centers have begun to develop software designed to bring virtual reality technology to bear on congenital heart disease. These efforts have focused on surgical preparation, on education of medical providers, and on preparation of patients and their family members for cardiac interventions. Though relatively little statistical evidence for benefit has been generated to date, those studies currently available suggest that virtual reality may provide a significant benefit in all three of these aspects of medical care. Summary The immersive nature of virtual reality meshes well with the learning styles of adult practitioners and promises to be a powerful tool for both pediatric cardiologists and the patients with whose care they are entrusted.

In response, a multidisciplinary team approach, which includes clinical pharmacists, is recommended to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of the study was to describe interventions associated with integration of a clinical pharmacist, with an emphasis on pharmacist-generated patient cost avoidance. Methods: This is a prospective observational study detailing pharmacist-initiated interventions within an academic preventive cardiology service. Interventions targeting pharmacotherapy optimization, side effect management, patient education, medication adherence, and cost avoidance were implemented during shared office visits with providers and/or on provider consultation for remote follow-up. Tabulation of cost avoidance was arranged into 2 formats: clinical interventions implemented by the pharmacist and direct patient out-of-pocket expense reduction. Money saved per clinical intervention was extrapolated from data previously published. Patient out-of-pocket expense prior to and after pharmacist involvement was calculated to assess aggregate yearly patient cost savings. Results: Over 12 months the pharmacist intervened on 974 patients, totaling 3725 interventions. Cost avoidance strategies resulted in yearly savings of $830 748 in aggregate—$149 566 from clinical interventions and $681 182 from patient out-of-pocket expense reduction. Monthly patient out-of-pocket expense was reduced from a median (interquartile range) of $217 ($83.5-$347) before to $5 ($0-$18) after pharmacist intervention.

Recent temporal evolution and factors influencing representation are incompletely investigated. We aimed to contrast age and female representation in the most influential randomized controlled trials in cardiology of the last 20 years to population prevalence and to assess the study factors affecting representation. Methods and Results: Using Web of Science, we selected the 25 most-cited cardiology articles each year between 1996 and 2015, and extracted mean age, percentage of women, funding source, sample size, disease condition, intervention type, and exclusion criteria. The outcomes were the evolution of the mean age and the percentage of women over time. Protocol design elements and year of publication were assessed as predictors of outcomes in multivariable regressions. A total of 500 studies were analyzed, where the mean age was 62.6±7.4 years and the median percentage of women was 28.6% (22.2–40.5). Compared with population prevalence derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015–2016, gaps in representation were apparent and more pronounced for coronary artery disease (−5.0 years; −27.2% women) and heart failure (−6.0 years; −25.4% women). The mean age (0.15 year per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.26) and percentage of women (+0.29% per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.50), slightly but significantly increased over time. Private funding, small sample size, and exclusions pertaining to maximal age, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus were associated with a decreased mean age in multivariable linear regressions. Age and life expectancy exclusions were associated with lower female percentage. Conclusions: Although age and female representation increased over time, the modest trends are unlikely to resolve the persistently wide gaps with actual populational prevalence, especially for coronary artery disease and HF.

His Canon of Medicine remained the standard text in both the East and West until the 16 th century. Avicenna′s description of cardiac diseases was logically presented perhaps for the first time in the history of medicine. Avicenna was the first to describe carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which presents with vasovagal syncope. He was a pioneer in pulsology and the first correct explanation of pulsation was given by Avicenna, after he refined Galen′s theory of the pulse. Besides, he discussed the action of available drugs on the heart in details and mentioned their indications and contraindications. In conclusion, Avicenna made important contributions to cardiology.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends consideration of statin therapy for adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥7.5% based on traditional risk factors. Whether use of nontraditional risk markers can improve risk assessment in those below this threshold for statin therapy is unclear.Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population sample free of clinical CVD at baseline, we calibrated the Pooled Cohort Equations (cPCE). ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Adults with an initial cPCE <7.5% and elevated levels of additional risk markers (abnormal test) whose new calculated risk was ≥7.5% were considered statin eligible: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL; family history of ASCVD; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥2 mg/dL; coronary artery calcium score ≥300 Agatston units or ≥75th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity; and ankle-brachial index <0.9. We compared the absolute and relative ASCVD risks among those with versus without elevated posttest estimated risk. We calculated the number needed to screen to identify 1 person with abnormal test for each risk marker, defined as the number of participants with baseline cPCE risk <7.5% divided by the number with an abnormal test reclassified as statin eligible. Of 5185 participants not taking statins with complete data (age, 45-84 years), 4185 had a cPCE risk <7.5%. During 10 years of follow-up, 57% of the ASCVD events (183 of 320) occurred among adults with a cPCE risk <7.5%. When people with diabetes mellitus were excluded, the coronary artery calcium criterion reclassified 6.8% upward, with an event rate of 13.3%, absolute risk of 10%, relative risk of 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-5.7), and number needed to screen of 14.7. The corresponding numbers for family history of ASCVD were 4.6%, 15.1%, 12%, 4.3 (95% CI, 3.0-6.4), and 21.8; for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein criteria, 2.6%, 10%, 6%, 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4-4.8), and 39.2; for ankle-brachial index criteria, 0.6%, 9%, 5%, 2.3 (95% CI, 0.6-8.6), and 176.5; and for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol criteria, 0.5%, 5%, 1%, 1.2 (95% CI, 0.2-8.4), and 193.3, respectively. Of the 3882 with <7.5% cPCE risk, 431 (11.1%) were reclassified to ≥7.5% (statin eligible) by at least 1 of the additional risk marker criteria.In this generally low-risk population sample, a large proportion of ASCVD events occurred among adults with a 10-year cPCE risk <7.5%. We found that the coronary artery calcium score, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, family history of ASCVD, and ankle-brachial index recommendations by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines (Class IIB) identify small subgroups of asymptomatic population with a 10-year cPCE risk <7.5% but with observed ASCVD event rates >7.5% who may warrant statin therapy considerations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.115.016846", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1895546182", "source": "openalex"}

Such patients often have multiple coexisting geriatric syndromes that may affect management and outcomes and are frequently underdiagnosed and untreated. OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of geriatric syndromes and incidence of selected adverse events in hospitalized elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. DESIGN A prospective cohort study. SETTING Urban academic medical center. PATIENTS One hundred patients at least 70 years old with cardiovascular disease hospitalized on a cardiology ward. MEASUREMENTS Standard geriatric screens were administered to assess mood, function, and cognitive status. Patients were followed prospectively for adverse events such as falls, urinary tract infection (UTI), and use of restraints. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 79.2 ± 5.5 years, 61% were female, 68% were white, and mean length of stay was 7 days. Geriatric syndromes were prevalent and included functional impairment (35% dependent in ≥1 activity of daily living), cognitive impairment (19% with abnormal results on the Short Blessed Test), and polypharmacy. Thirty‐seven percent of patients were prescribed a potentially inappropriate medication on admission or discharge. Patients receiving a Foley catheter were at increased risk for UTI. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that geriatric syndromes are prevalent among older patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. Further study is needed to determine if interventions designed to increase recognition and treatment of these syndromes can improve outcomes in this patient population.

Prior randomized trials comparing antithrombotic agents suggest that a reduction in bleeding events is associated with improved survival.13,14Because prevention of major bleeding may represent an important step in improving outcomes by balancing safety and efficacy in the contemporary treatment of ACS, bleeding events have been systematically identified as a crucial end point for the assessment of the safety of drugs during the course of randomized clinical trials, and are an important aspect of the evaluation of new devices and interventional therapies.15 Unlike ischemic clinical events (eg, cardiac death, MI, stent thrombosis), for which there is now general consensus on end-point definitions,16,17 there is substantial heterogeneity among the many bleeding definitions currently in use. Lack of standardization makes it difficult to optimally organize key clinical trial processes such as adjudication, and even more difficult to interpret relative safety comparisons of different antithrombotic agents across studies, or even within a given trial, because results may vary according to the definition(s) used for bleeding. Finally, as reflected by the various terms used to describe bleeding (serious, severe, catastrophic, major, life-threatening, etc), the heterogeneity of definitions may undermine the ability of clinical trials to meaningfully define the balance of safety and efficacy in vascular interventions.In response to the need to develop, disseminate, and ultimately adopt standardized bleeding end-point definitions for patients receiving antithrombotic therapy, the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) convened in February 2010 at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) headquarters in White Oak, MD. Modeled after the 2006 Academic Research Consortium, which standardized key ischemic end-point definitions in studies aimed at evaluating coronary stents,17 the BARC effort brought together representatives from academic research organizations, the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and pharmaceutical and cardiovascular device manufacturers and independent physician thought leaders in the field of cardiovascular disease to develop consensus bleeding definitions that would be useful for cardiovascular clinical trials. Application of these definitions is recommended for both clinical trials and registries.Importance of Bleeding as an End PointHemorrhagic complications occur with a frequency of 1% to 10% during treatment for ACS and after PCI.18–20 This wide variability in the measured incidence is due to several factors, including differences in patient characteristics, concomitant therapies, timing of event reporting, and definitions across data sets. Regardless of the definition used, several studies have demonstrated that bleeding is associated with an increased risk for short- and long-term adverse outcomes, including death,18,20 nonfatal MI,6 stroke,5 and stent thrombosis.9 The exact mechanisms underlying this relationship are not known, but may include the cessation of evidence-based therapies, including antiplatelet agents, β-blockers, and/or statin therapies, in patients who suffer bleeding complications,21,22 the direct effects of blood transfusion used to treat bleeding,20,23 or greater prevalence of comorbidities in patients who bleed,21 as well as a deleterious role of anemia.24The relationship between bleeding and morbidity and mortality is underscored by studies demonstrating that bleeding reduction strategies are associated with improved survival in patients with ACS and those undergoing PCI. The data summarized inTable 1 emphasize the importance of bleeding as a common, clinically relevant safety event. To optimize both the end point and its role in clinical trial designs, a consistent approach to collecting bleeding data and adjudicating events is critical.30 Toward this end, a thoughtful, broadly based consensus definition of what constitutes a bleeding event, similar to what has been done with MI and stent thrombosis, is the objective of BARC efforts.17Table 1.

This initiative has since been expanded to other clinical domains, including percutaneous valves and peripheral arterial disease, and the effort to establish standardized bleeding definitions presented in this consensus document. These standardized definitions are intended to allow the clinical community to determine the relative safety of different antithrombotic strategies, to provide the industry with a framework in which to evaluate the safety of emerging antithrombotic therapies, and potentially to enhance the regulatory review of new anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.Heterogeneity of Bleeding Definitions Across TrialsSeveral definitions of bleeding have been used in published clinical trials and registries.33–35Table 2 highlights the lack of uniformity in bleeding definitions among recent ACS and PCI clinical trials. Current bleeding definitions consist of both laboratory parameters, such as decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit scores, and clinical events, including the need for transfusion or surgery, cardiac tamponade, hematomas, and various degrees of bleeding. Each definition incorporates a different combination of these data elements and then rank orders these combinations into severity categories, which vary widely between definitions.Table 2.

The aim of this two-part series is to provide practical knowledge and guidance to aid clinicians in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in association with COVID-19. Methods and results: A narrative literature review of the available evidence has been performed, and the resulting information has been organized into two parts. The first, reported here, focuses on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of cardiovascular (CV) conditions that may be manifest in patients with COVID-19. The second part, which will follow in a later edition of the journal, addresses the topics of care pathways, treatment, and follow-up of CV conditions in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: This comprehensive review is not a formal guideline but rather a document that provides a summary of current knowledge and guidance to practicing clinicians managing patients with CVD and COVID-19. The recommendations are mainly the result of observations and personal experience from healthcare providers. Therefore, the information provided here may be subject to change with increasing knowledge, evidence from prospective studies, and changes in the pandemic.

We sought to compare the Diamond-Forrester (DF) score with the 2 CAD consortium scores recently recommended by the European Society of Cardiology. Methods: We included 2274 consecutive patients (age, 56±13 years; 57% male) without prior CAD referred for coronary computed tomographic angiography. Computed tomographic angiography findings were used to determine the presence or absence of obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis). We compared the DF score with the 2 CAD consortium scores with respect to their ability to predict obstructive CAD and the potential implications of these scores on the downstream use of testing for CAD, as recommended by current guidelines. Results: The DF score did not satisfactorily fit the data and resulted in a significant overestimation of the prevalence of obstructive CAD ( P &lt;0.001); the CAD consortium basic score had no significant lack of fitness; and the CAD consortium clinical provided adequate goodness of fit ( P =0.39). The DF score had a lower discrimination for obstructive CAD, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.713 versus 0.752 and 0.791 for the CAD consortium models ( P &lt;0.001 for both). Consequently, the use of the DF score was associated with fewer individuals being categorized as requiring no additional testing (8.3%) compared with the CAD consortium models (24.6% and 30.0%; P &lt;0.001). The proportion of individuals with a high pretest probability was 18% with the DF and only 1.1% with the CAD consortium scores ( P &lt;0.001) Conclusions: Among contemporary patients referred for noninvasive testing, the DF risk score overestimates the risk of obstructive CAD. On the other hand, the CAD consortium scores offered improved goodness of fit and discrimination; thus, their use could decrease the need for noninvasive or invasive testing while increasing the yield of such tests.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.116.023396", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2473077508", "source": "openalex"}

With the growth of molecular biology have come new therapeutic interventions and the requirement for new diagnostic imaging approaches. Noninvasive targeted radiotracer based as well as transporter gene imaging strategies are evolving to meet these new needs, but require the development of an interdisciplinary approach which focuses on molecular processes, as well as the pathogenesis and progression of disease. This progress has been made possible with the availability of transgenic animal models along with many technological advances. Future adaptations of the developing experimental procedures and instrumentation will allow for the smooth translation and application to clinical practice. This review is intended as a brief overview on the subject molecular imaging. Basic concepts and historical perspective of molecular imaging will be reviewed first, followed by description of current technology, and concluding with current applications in cardiology.

Such events confer substantial mortality, physical and/or mental disability, and cost for the individual and society.1 Indeed, no finite value can be attributed to the cost to the individual, although survival and subsequent quality of life are critical factors, especially in young individuals with ASCVD.2 Although the advent of precision medicine and innovative treatments have been the driver for an individualized approach to patient management and prevention, the ever-increasing financial restraints in healthcare systems worldwide often require clinical benefit to be balanced with the cost of a given intervention. The causality of plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced LDL receptor-mediated LDL uptake in the pathophysiology of ASCVD has been established beyond any reasonable doubt.3 For patients at very high risk of premature ASCVD, including those with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) without ASCVD, elevated LDL-C is a common risk factor.4,5 Indeed, high LDL-C levels are prevalent in both FH and non-FH patients in the acute secondary prevention setting.6 In the case of the latter, polygenic effects may account for an elevated LDL-C concentration as reflected by genetic risk scores.7 The key clinical issue is attainment of guideline-recommended LDL-C levels (<1.8 mmol/L or 70 mg/dL) for patients at very high cardiovascular risk.4 Even with high-intensity statin treatment, a substantial proportion of these patients will remain above this LDL-C goal due to <50% lowering of LDL-C levels, in part as result of pharmacogenetic effects that underlie wide inter-individual variability in statin response.8 This eventuality emphasizes the need for additional LDL-C reduction with new therapeutic approaches which target these atherogenic particles.

Methods and Results All manuscripts published between March 1, 2019 to June 1, 2019 and March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 in 4 high-impact cardiology journals (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Circulation, JAMA Cardiology, and European Heart Journal) were identified using bibliometric data. Authors' genders were determined by matching first name with predicted gender using a validated multinational database (Genderize.io) and manual adjudication. Proportions of women and men first, co-first, senior, and co-senior authors, manuscript types, and whether the manuscript was COVID-19 related were recorded. In 2019, women were first authors of 176 (22.3%) manuscripts and senior authors of 99 (15.0%) manuscripts. In 2020, women first authored 230 (27.4%) manuscripts and senior authored 138 (19.3%) manuscripts. Proportions of woman first and senior authors were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019. Women were more likely to be first authors if the manuscript's senior author was a woman (33.8% for woman first/woman senior versus 23.4% for woman first/man senior; P<0.001). Women were less likely to be first authors of COVID-19-related original research manuscripts (P=0.04).

He made the observation that a thin liquid jet, passing through a narrow channel which is followed by a curved surface, deviates according to the surface' shape, adhering to it. The description of the phenomenon and a possible explanation was found in a patent registrated in France, in 1934. It is interesting how a physical phenomenon described 70 years ago has found its clear demonstration and real time visualization on color Doppler flow mapping. Coandă effect influences jet size and color encoding, determining (for eccentric jets) smaller color Doppler jet areas, greater variance and reverse velocity encoding. The phenomenon may alter the interpretation of color Doppler images and needs to be taken into account for an appropriate echocardiography assessment of valvular regurgitation and other abnormal flows.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2459/01.jcm.0000269720.25812.55", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1988165381", "source": "openalex"}

Recent changes in lifestyle have both reduced the incidence of infections and increased lifespan, and HF is now seen as a complex disease—one that is still caused by mechanical disorder, but also associated with ischemia and senescence. The long‐held view that CH serves to restore myocardial economy back to normal is still valid. The adaptive process is characterized by a quantitative and a qualitative fetal gene reprogramming, which is now being confirmed by recent advances in microRNA research. It underscores the fact CH is the physiologic reaction of the heart to a pathologic stimulus. The goal for therapy is economic, not inotropic.

Following SOP implementation, these proportions increased to 38.7% (p < 0.001) and 2.7% (p = 0.56), respectively. Qualitative analysis revealed that lack of motivation, e.g. role incongruence, appeared to be a major barrier.Introduction of a set of standard operating procedures for smoking cessation advice was effective with physicians but not nurses. Analysis of barriers to implementation highlighted lack of motivation rather than capability or opportunity as a major factor that would need to be addressed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487312462803", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105605432", "source": "openalex"}

Cross-sectional surveys are used to evaluate the implementation of such guidelines. The present survey investigated screening for glucose perturbations in people with coronary artery disease and compared patients with known and newly detected type 2 diabetes with those without diabetes in terms of their life-style and pharmacological risk factor management in relation to contemporary European guidelines. A total of 6187 patients (18–80 years) with coronary artery disease and known glycaemic status based on a self reported history of diabetes (previously known diabetes) or the results of an oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c (no diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes) were investigated in EUROASPIRE IV including patients in 24 European countries 2012–2013. The patients were interviewed and investigated in order to enable a comparison between their actual risk factor control with that recommended in current European management guidelines and the outcome in previously conducted surveys. A total of 2846 (46 %) patients had no diabetes, 1158 (19 %) newly diagnosed diabetes and 2183 (35 %) previously known diabetes. The combined use of all four cardioprotective drugs in these groups was 53, 55 and 60 %, respectively. A blood pressure target of <140/90 mmHg was achieved in 68, 61, 54 % and a LDL-cholesterol target of <1.8 mmol/L in 16, 18 and 28 %. Patients with newly diagnosed and previously known diabetes reached an HbA1c <7.0 % (53 mmol/mol) in 95 and 53 % and 11 % of those with previously known diabetes had an HbA1c >9.0 % (>75 mmol/mol). Of the patients with diabetes 69 % reported on low physical activity. The proportion of patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programmes was low (≈40 %) and only 27 % of those with diabetes had attended diabetes schools. Compared with data from previous surveys the use of cardioprotective drugs had increased and more patients were achieving the risk factor treatment targets.

In this work, we focus on cardiology patients' information needs related to their hospital medications. We assessed these needs to inform the design of interactive, electronic views of medication information for cardiology inpatients. We present results of in-situ interviews with 11 inpatients and 6 nurses in a cardiology step-down unit. Our findings suggest that cohesive trends in medication information needs exist across cardiology inpatients. We discuss interview results and their implications for the design of inpatient-facing information technology.

Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are >1 year past an MI?We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33 051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21 162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15 603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT >1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000405", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2335478445", "source": "openalex"}

These guidelines update and replace the previous ESC guidelines on the management of stable angina pectoris, issued in 2006. There are several new aspects in the 2013 ESC guidelines compared with the 2006 version. This opinion paper provides an in-depth interpretation of the ESC guidelines with regard to these issues, to help physicians in making evidence-based therapeutic choices in their routine clinical practice. The first new element is the definition of stable coronary artery disease itself, which has now broadened from a 'simple' symptom, angina pectoris, to a more complex disease that can even be asymptomatic. In the first-line setting, the major changes in the new guidelines are the upgrading of calcium channel blockers, the distinction between dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and the presence of important statements regarding the combination of calcium channel blockers with beta-blockers. In the second-line setting, the 2013 ESC guidelines recommend the addition of long-acting nitrates, ivabradine, nicorandil or ranolazine to first-line agents. Trimetazidine may also be considered. However, no clear distinction is made among different second-line drugs, despite different quality of evidence in favour of these agents. For example, the use of ranolazine is supported by strong and recent evidence, while data supporting the use of the traditional agents appear relatively scanty.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487316648475", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2398675171", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the potential for such evolution to improve patient care, clinicians, including practicing cardiologists, often find themselves poorly prepared for the introduction of more-sensitive assays, because they fail to consider the implications of increasing sensitivity on the interpretation of the test results.

This review aims to identify factors influencing physician guideline adherence relevant to cardiology and to provide insights and suggestions for future improvement. Physician adherence was measured as adherence to standard local medical practice and applicable guidelines. Female gender and older age had a negative effect on physician guideline adherence. In addition, independent of the type of heart disease, physicians without cardiologic specialization were linked to physician noncompliance. Also, guideline adherence in primary care centers was at a lower level compared with secondary or tertiary care centers. The importance of guideline adherence increases as patients age, and complex diseases and comorbidity arise. Appropriate resources and interventions, taking important factors for nonadherence in account, are necessary to improve guideline adoption and adherence in every level of the chain.

Those that fare poorly with COVID-19 infection more commonly have cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes. There are also several other conditions that raise concern for the welfare of patients with and at high risk for CVD during this pandemic. Traditional ambulatory care is disrupted and many patients are delaying or deferring necessary care, including preventive care. New impediments to medication access and adherence have arisen. Social distancing measures can increase social isolation and alter physical activity and nutrition patterns. Virtually all facility based cardiac rehabilitation programs have temporarily closed. If not promptly addressed, these changes may result in delayed waves of vulnerable patients presenting for urgent and preventable CVD events. Here, we provide several recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects of these disruptions in outpatient care. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be continued in patients already taking these medications. Where possible, it is strongly preferred to continue visits via telehealth, and patients should be counselled about promptly reporting new symptoms. Barriers to medication access should be reviewed with patients at every contact, with implementation of strategies to ensure ongoing provision of medications. Team-based care should be leveraged to enhance the continuity of care and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. Patient encounters should include discussion of safe physical activity options and access to healthy food choices. Implementation of adaptive strategies for cardiac rehabilitation is recommended, including home based cardiac rehab, to ensure continuity of this essential service. While the practical implementation of these strategies will vary by local situation, there are a broad range of strategies available to ensure ongoing continuity of care and health preservation for those at higher risk of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2020.100009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3023344734", "source": "openalex"}

The PET – CT hybrid, which consists of two scanning machines: PET scanner and an x-ray Computed Tomography (CT). At present these represent the technological hierarchy of Nuclear Medicine, occupying an important position in diagnostics. In fact, PET – CT has the capability to evaluate diseases through a simultaneous functional and morphostructural analysis. This allows for an earlier diagnosis of the disease state which is crucial for obtaining the required information to provide a more reliable prognosis and therapy. Presently, the most frequently used PET radiotracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has a major role in oncology. Useful information is being regularly obtained by using both FDG and a selection of radiotracer compounds to evaluate some of the most important biological processes. Thus, creating an opening for ‘Molecular Imaging’ and providing a platform for a potential revolution in the clinical diagnostic field. In this review, we hope to present the most interesting technicalogical and methodological advances in clinical diagnostics for oncology, neurology, and cardiology. A particular attention is dedicated to the applications of PET in neuropsychiatric diseases and its connections with receptor imaging.

Also, biplane systems are used that imply an additional source of staff doses. The objective of this paper is to measure scatter doses in four X-ray systems, using polymethyl methacrylate phantoms with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 16 cm to simulate paediatric patients, for the different acquisition modes. Scatter dose rates measured at the position of cardiologist's eyes ranged from 0.8 to 12 mSv h(-1), and about twice the above values at lower extremities, as a linear function of the surface air kerma at the phantom, keeping the irradiated area constant. Therefore, the respective personal dose equivalent for the lens of the eyes may be around 0.5 and 1 mSv throughout the procedure, if additional protection is not used. Simultaneous cine acquisition in biplane systems yielded scatter doses to cardiologists, increased by factors from 5 to 21, compared with a single C-arm acquisition case and depending on geometry. Knowledge of scatter doses for different operation modes, patient thicknesses and the biplane operation should help paediatric cardiologists to adopt conservative attitudes in respect of their occupational radiation risks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/rpd/ncq039", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979331064", "source": "openalex"}

We compared treatments and outcomes of patients at six regional percutaneous coronary intervention centers in the United States to determine if aggressive care of elderly patients was warranted. Design: Retrospective evaluation of registry data. Setting: Six interventional cardiology centers in the United States. Patients: Six hundred and twenty-five unresponsive cardiac arrest survivors aged 18–75 were compared with 129 similar patients aged more than 75. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Cardiac arrest survivors aged more than 75 had more comorbidities (3.0 ± 1.6 vs 2.0 ± 1.6, p < 0.001), but were matched to younger patients in initial heart rhythm, witnessed arrests, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and total ischemic time. Patients aged more than 75 frequently underwent therapeutic hypothermia (97.7%), urgent coronary angiography (44.2%), and urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (24%). They had more sustained hyperglycemia (70.5% vs 59%, p = 0.015), less postcooling fever (25.2% vs 35.2%, p = 0.03), were more likely to have do-not-resuscitate orders (65.9% vs 48.2%, p < 0.001), and undergo withdrawal of life support (61.2% vs 47.5%, p = 0.005). Good functional outcome at 6 months (Cerebral Performance Category 1–2) was seen in 27.9% elderly versus 40.4% younger patients overall (p = 0.01) and in 44% versus 55% (p = 0.13) of patients with an initial shockable rhythm. Of 35 survivors more than 75 years old, 33 (94.8%) were classified as Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2 at (mean) 6.5-month follow-up. In multivariable logistic regression modeling, age more than 75 was significantly associated with outcome only when the presence of a do-not-resuscitate order was excluded from the model. Conclusions: Elderly patients were more likely to have do-not-resuscitate orders and to undergo withdrawal of life support. Age was independently associated with outcome only when correction for do-not-resuscitate status was excluded, and functional outcomes of elderly survivors were similar to younger patients. Exclusion of patients more than 75 years old from aggressive care is not warranted on the basis of age alone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3182a26ec6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1993737952", "source": "openalex"}

Despite perceived benefit of preoperative consultation, evidence is lacking specifically for major vascular surgery on the effect of preoperative cardiac consultation.Patient and clinical data were obtained from a statewide vascular surgery registry between January 2012 and December 2014. Patients were risk stratified by revised cardiac risk index category and compared poMI between patients who did or did not receive a preoperative cardiology consultation. We then used logistic regression analysis to compare the rate of poMI across hospitals grouped into quartiles by rate of preoperative cardiology consultation.Our study population comprised 5191 patients undergoing open peripheral arterial bypass (n = 3037), open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 332), or endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 1822) at 29 hospitals. At the patient level, after risk-stratification by revised cardiac risk index category, there was no association between cardiac consultation and poMI. At the hospital level, preoperative cardiac consultation varied substantially between hospitals (6.9%-87.5%, P <0.001). High preoperative consulting hospitals (rate >66%) had a reduction in poMI (OR, 0.52; confidence interval: 0.28-0.98; P <0.05) compared with all other hospitals. These hospitals also had a statistically greater consultation rate with a variety of medical specialties.Preoperative cardiology consultation for vascular surgery varies greatly between institutions, and does not appear to impact poMI at the patient level. However, reduction of poMI was noted at the hospitals with the highest rate of preoperative cardiology consultation as well as a variety of medical services, suggesting that other hospital culture effects play a role.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002014", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2521172958", "source": "openalex"}

A review was conducted of these studies, gathering data on kerma area product (PKA), fluoroscopic screening time (FT), air kerma, and estimates of effective dose and organ doses. The majority of studies focus on PKA and FT with no estimation of dose to the patient. A greater than ten-fold variation in average PKA was found between different studies, even where data were stratified by patient age or weight. Typical values of PKA were 0.6–10 Gy · cm2 (<1 year/10 kg), 1.5–30 Gy · cm2 (1–5 years), 2–40 Gy · cm2 (5–10 years), 5–100 Gy · cm2 (10–16 years) and 10–200 Gy · cm2 (>16 years). PKA was lowest for heart biopsy (0.3–10 Gy · cm2 for all ages combined) and atrial septostomy (0.4–4.0 Gy · cm2), and highest for pulmonary artery angioplasty (1.5–35 Gy · cm2) and right ventricular outflow tract dilatation (139 Gy · cm2). Most estimates of patient dose were in the form of effective dose (typically 3–15 mSv) which is of limited usefulness in individualised risk assessment. Few studies estimated organ doses. Despite advances in radiation protection, recent publications have reported surprisingly large doses, as represented by PKA and air kerma. There is little indication of a fall in these dose indicators over the last 15 years. Nor is there much suggestion of a fall in doses associated with the use of flat panel detectors, as opposed to image intensifiers.

We retrospectively analysed 1229 consecutive echocardiograms (57% males) for the utility of echocardiographic measures including left atrial volume index (LAVI), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and pulmonary venous and mitral inflow Doppler. LAVI of 40 ml/m 2 provided the greatest sensitivity and specificity of 76 and 77%, respectively, with reference to E / e ′ for the detection of diastolic dysfunction. The ESC definition of raised LVMI yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 32 and 99%, respectively. We found that the mitral and pulmonary inflow provided little incremental information. These results remained consistent between those with normal and abnormal ejection fraction. There appears to be little incremental value of pulmonary and mitral Doppler measures beyond the measure of mitral E wave. An LAVI cut-off of 40 ml/m 2 maximizes both sensitivity and specificity.

Over 1-year follow-up the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.09; 1.03-1.15) was higher but the risk of first HF (re-) hospitalization was lower (0.93; 0.89-0.97) in non-cardiology vs. cardiology care.In HFrEF, non-cardiology care was independently associated with older ageand lower education. After covariate adjustment, non-cardiology care was associated with lower use of beta-blockers and devices, higher mortality, and lower risk of HF hospitalization.

The quality in cardiological consultation lies also in timely and accurate medical visits as early diagnosis enables prompt interventions that can improve the overall patients' stay in the hospital. The reduction of the time to deliver a cardiological consultation in hospital settings is therefore an indicator of the overall quality of the consultation service. In this work, discrete event simulation was used to analyze and improve the medical consultation process in a Complex Operative Unit of Rehabilitation Cardiology. The proposed approach allowed the identification of critical issues in the consultation process and assess possible improvement actions to be implemented in order to reduce the waiting time for cardiological consultations in rehabilitation cardiology.

Based on lessons learned, we assessed the weak points to clear the way for routine operations. Methods: We analyzed the system with respect to recommendations of the ESC Guidelines and experiences gained throughout the trial to identify potential improvements. The following components have been identified: a patient terminal with highest usability, integrated way to document drug-intake and well-being, and automated event detection for worsening of CHF. As a consequence the system was extended by Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and by an event management tool. Results: Usability evaluation with 30 adults (14f, median 51y. IQR[45-65]) showed that 21 (8f) were able to immediately operate the system after reading a step-by-step manual. Eight (6f) needed one time demonstration and one man (80y) failed to operate the blood pressure meter. Routine operation of the revised system started in March 2009. Within 9 months, 15 patients (4f, median 74y. IQR[71-83], all NYHA-III) transmitted 17,149 items. 43 events were detected because of body weight gain of more then 2kg within 2 days. 49 therapy adjustments were documented. Three patients stopped using the system, two (1f) because of non-compliance and one (m, 82y) because of death. Overall, the rate of adherence to daily data transfer was 78%.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2139156225", "title": "Aspirin and Clopidogrel: A Sweeping Combination in Cardiology", "text": "Platelets play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis, believed to be integrally involved in both the development and progression of atherosclerotic heart disease, as well as in its acute thrombotic complications. Antiplatelet therapy constitutes the cornerstone in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes and generally high-risk patients with atherothrombosis. Until recently, long-term antiplatelet therapy for the treatment and prevention of the complications of atherothrombotic disease was traditionally limited to aspirin. The availability of the thienopyridines, in particular clopidogrel, represents an important addition to the physicians armamentarium. Clopidogrel is currently one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease. Aspirin and clopidogrel interfere with platelet activation in complementary, but separate pathways. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase, thus preventing the production of thromboxane A2, which is a prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive substance. Clopidogrel, a newer thienopyridine which has largely supplanted ticlopidine due to a more favorable safety profile, irreversibly prevents platelet activation by blocking one of the three known adenosine 5-diphosphate (ADP) receptors (the P2Y12 receptor) on the platelet surface, thus interfering with platelet activation, degranulation and aggregation. Both these antiplatelet agents have a potent protective effect against adverse vascular events, but the combination of these two agents has an even stronger antiplatelet effect translating into superior antithrombotic protection in coronary, cerebral or peripheral arterial disease, without an inordinate increase in bleeding complications. A number of seminal clinical trials have demonstrated and confirmed the incremental benefit and efficacy of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy above and beyond that of aspirin alone, with multiple other important large-scale clinical trials currently ongoing. Newer data are being accumulated from studies where indications for the use of clopidogrel and aspirin continue to expand into other patient groups, rendering this dual antiplatelet drug therapy a sweeping combination in Cardiology. However, important issues remain to be further and more thoroughly explored about the benefit of this antiplatelet drug combination in these other patient groups, such as in patients with heart failure, where preliminary data indicate a favorable effect on thrombotic vascular events, in patients with atrial fibrillation, where there is hope that this combination may replace or be an alternative treatment modality to coumadin in certain subpopulations, in patients undergoing demanding catheter ablation procedures, where data point to a protective effect from thromboembolic events. Another pertaining issue to be further investigated is the occurrence of drug-resistance observed in some patients for both these antithrombotic agents. This article is a comprehensive review of all these data and the landmark trials on the two antiplatelet agents, the issues involved and the current recommendations for their use in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders and procedures.

Patient-specific factors and the risk of the surgery itself are considerations in the need for an evaluation and the treatment strategy before noncardiac surgery. In most instances, coronary revascularization before noncardiac surgery has not been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality, except in patients with left main disease.

A variety of sources of big data in healthcare are available, such as biometric data, registration data, electronic health record, medical imaging, patient reported data, biomarker data, clinical data, and administrative data. Visualization of data is a key tool for producing images, diagrams, or animations to convey messages from the viewed insight. The role of cardiology in healthcare is obvious for living and life. The function of heart is the control of blood supply to the entire parts of the body. Recent speedy growth in healthcare and the development of computation in the field of cardiology enable researchers and practitioners to mine and visualize new insights from patient data. The role of visualization is to capture the important information from the data and to visualize it for the easiness of doctors and practitioners. To help the doctors and practitioners, the proposed study presents a detailed report of the existing literature on visualization of data in the field of cardiology. This report will support the doctors and practitioners in decision-making process and to make it easier. This detailed study will eventually summarize the results of the existing literature published related to visualization of data in the cardiology. This research uses the systematic literature protocol and the data was collected from the studies published during the year 2009 to 2018 (10 years). The proposed study selected 53 primary studies from different repositories according to the defined exclusion, inclusion, and quality criteria.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends consideration of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if two or more clinical risk factors (RFs) are present, but this approach to risk stratification has not been formally validated. Methods and results Four hundred and eleven paediatric HCM patients were assessed for four clinical RFs in accordance with current ESC recommendations: severe left ventricular hypertrophy, unexplained syncope, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and family history of SCD. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of SCD or an equivalent event (aborted cardiac arrest, appropriate ICD therapy, or sustained ventricular tachycardia), defined as a major arrhythmic cardiac event (MACE). Over a follow-up period of 2890 patient years (median 5.5 years), MACE occurred in 21 patients (7.5%) with 0 RFs, 19 (16.8%) with 1 RFs, and 3 (18.8%) with 2 or more RFs. Corresponding incidence rates were 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–1.73], 2.07 (95% CI 1.25–3.23), and 2.52 (95% CI 0.53–7.35) per 100 patient years at risk. Patients with two or more RFs did not have a higher incidence of MACE (log-rank test P = 0.34), with a positive and negative predictive value of 19% and 90%, respectively. The C-statistic was 0.62 (95% CI 0.52–0.72) at 5 years. Conclusions The incidence of MACE is higher for patients with increasing numbers of clinical RFs.

Several recent studies suggested that circulating FGF23 and α-Klotho concentrations might be related to cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with advanced renal failure.Using data from 100 cardiology inpatients who were not undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the association of circulating levels of FGF23, α-Klotho, and other calcium-phosphate metabolism-related parameters with the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular mass (LVM) was analyzed.LVEF was measured using the modified Simpson method for apical 4-chamber LV images and the LVM index (LVMI) was calculated by dividing the LVM by body surface area. Univariate analysis showed that log transformed FGF23, but not that of α-Klotho, was significantly associated with LVEF and LVMI with a standardized beta of -0.35 (P<0.001) and 0.26 (P<0.05), respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and serum concentrations of intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D as covariates into the statistical model, log-transformed FGF23 was found to be a statistically positive predictor for decreased left ventricular function and left ventricular hypertrophy.In cardiology department inpatients, circulating FGF23 concentrations were found to be associated with the left ventricular mass and LVEF independent of renal function and other calcium-phosphate metabolism-related parameters. Whether modulation of circulating FGF23 levels would improve cardiac outcome in such a high risk population awaits further investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073184", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086951936", "source": "openalex"}

Cardiologists and sport physicians are required to identify high-risk individuals harbouring such conditions and provide appropriate advice regarding participation in regular exercise programmes and competitive sport. The three aspects that need to be considered are: (a) the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias by participating in sports; (b) control of symptoms due to arrhythmias that are not life-threatening but may hamper performance and/or reduce the quality of life; and (c) the impact of sports on the natural progression of the underlying arrhythmogenic condition. In many cases, there is no unequivocal answer to each aspect and therefore an open discussion with the athlete is necessary, in order to reach a balanced decision. In 2006 the Sports Cardiology and Exercise Section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology published recommendations for participation in leisure-time physical activity and competitive sport in individuals with arrhythmias and potentially arrhythmogenic conditions. More than a decade on, these recommendations are partly obsolete given the evolving knowledge of the diagnosis, management and treatment of these conditions. The present document presents a combined effort by the Sports Cardiology and Exercise Section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology and the European Heart Rhythm Association to offer a comprehensive overview of the most updated recommendations for practising cardiologists and sport physicians managing athletes with supraventricular arrhythmias, and provides pragmatic advice for safe participation in recreational physical activities, as well as competitive sport at amateur and professional level.

Related terms also include m-health (‘mobile health’) building on the concept of mobile devices delivering health information such as drug and treatment options, screening patients, monitoring vital signs, providing direct care and patient education, and p-health (‘personalized health’) used to describe wearable micro- and nano-technologies with sensors, actuators, and ‘smart’ fibres to help facilitate personalized health and social care decision making and delivery.2 In 2010, COCIR, the European Coordination Committee of the Radiological, Electromedical and Healthcare IT Industry, established a dictionary of telemedicine terms to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the overlapping terms and concepts.3 e-Health can provide innovative solutions addressing problems in ageing societies with increasing numbers of citizens living with chronic conditions, limited healthcare funding, and personnel. It can support the strong political drive to move care closer to patients' homes and away from specialist centres. Technological innovation has brought e-health services that enable co-operation, information sharing, and decision support based on good practices and emerging evidence-based guidelines. However, social and technological issues hinder healthcare systems from reaping the benefits of wide adoption.

We previously confirmed these deficiencies using a 50‐question multimedia cardiac examination (CE) test featuring video vignettes of patients with auscultatory and visible manifestations of cardiovascular pathology (virtual cardiac patients). Previous testing of 62 internal medical faculty yielded scores no better than those of medical students and residents. Hypothesis: In this study, we tested whether cardiologists outperformed other physicians in cardiac examination skills, and whether years in practice correlated with test performance. Methods: To obviate cardiologists' reluctance to be tested, the CE test was installed at 19 US teaching centers for confidential testing. Test scores and demographic data (training level, subspecialty, and years in practice) were uploaded to a secure database. Results: The 520 tests revealed mean scores (out of 100 ± 95% confidence interval) in descending order: 10 cardiology volunteer faculty (86.3 ± 8.0), 57 full‐time cardiologists (82.0 ± 3.3), 4 private‐practice cardiologists (77.0 ± 6.8), and 19 noncardiology faculty (67.3 ± 8.8). Trainees' scores in descending order: 150 cardiology fellows (77.3 ± 2.1), 78 medical students (63.7 ± 3.5), 95 internal medicine residents (62.7 ± 3.2), and 107 family medicine residents (59.2 ± 3.2). Faculty scores were higher in those trained earlier with longer practice experience. Conclusions: Academic and volunteer cardiologists outperformed other medical faculty, as did cardiology fellows. Lower scores were observed in more recently trained faculty. Remote testing yielded scores similar to proctored tests in comparable groups previously studied. No significant improvement was seen after medical school with residency training. Copyright © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Studies focusing on digital means of patient education performed in other disciplines of medicine demonstrated its positive effect in these areas. Therefore, a review of the current literature was performed to (i) evaluate the status of innovative, digitalized means of patient education in cardiology and (ii) assess the impact of digital patient education on outcome parameters (i.e., patient knowledge (or health literacy), QoL, depression, anxiety, and patient satisfaction). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A review of the current literature was performed to evaluate the effect of digitalized patient education for any purpose in the field of cardiology. Medline and EMBASE were searched for articles reporting any digital educational platform used for patient education up to May 2020. The articles were compared on their effect on patient knowledge or health literacy, QoL, depression or anxiety, and patient satisfaction. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The initial search yielded 279 articles, 34 of which were retained after applying in, and exclusion criteria. After full-text analysis, the total number of articles remaining was 16.

In interventional cardiology, the hope is for AI to provide automated analysis and deeper interpretation of data from electrocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electronic health records, among others. Furthermore, high-performance predictive models supporting decision-making hold the potential to improve safety, diagnostic and prognostic prediction in patients undergoing interventional cardiology procedures. These applications include robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and automatic assessment of coronary stenosis during diagnostic coronary angiograms. Machine learning (ML) has been used in these innovations that have improved the field of interventional cardiology, and more recently, deep Learning (DL) has emerged as one of the most successful branches of ML in many applications. It remains to be seen if DL approaches will have a major impact on current and future practice. DL-based predictive systems also have several limitations, including lack of interpretability and lack of generalizability due to cohort heterogeneity and low sample sizes. There are also challenges for the clinical implementation of these systems, such as ethical limits and data privacy. This review is intended to bring the attention of health practitioners and interventional cardiologists to the broad and helpful applications of ML and DL algorithms to date in the field. Their implementation challenges in daily practice and future applications in the field of interventional cardiology are also discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.711401", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200250868", "source": "openalex"}

A steep decline in morbidity and mortality has been observed in most western countries. The HIV epidemic is now moving into middle‐aged populations which are already at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Since the cardiovascular system is frequently affected in HIV infection, reflections on traditional cardiovascular risk factors is a pressing issue. Moreover, during the last few years, complex lipodystrophic body changes in association with metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia and insulin resistance have become a common feature in HIV + patients on HAART. Although the precise mechanisms are not fully understood, early reports on myocardial infarctions and vascular changes have raised concern about the possibility of an epidemic of cardiovascular events among HAART patients within the next decade. Not only more data on lipid‐lowering drugs in the context of HAART, on switching strategies, and treatment interruptions, but also from intervention studies on traditional risk factors such as smoking, are urgently needed. In this review the key issues concerning cardiovascular aspects of HIV infection in the era of HAART and possible preventive strategies are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03908.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2093613731", "source": "openalex"}

In this Position Paper, we critically interpret and integrate the results obtained in both experimental and clinical studies on anti-inflammatory actions of lipid-lowering therapy and the mechanisms involved. We highlight that: (i) besides decreasing cholesterol through different mechanisms, most lipid-lowering therapies share anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, and the anti-inflammatory response to lipid-lowering may be relevant to predict the effect of treatment, (ii) using surrogates for both lipid metabolism and inflammation as biomarkers or vascular inflammation imaging in future studies may contribute to a better understanding of the relative importance of different mechanisms of action, and (iii) comparative studies of further lipid lowering, anti-inflammation and a combination of both are crucial to identify effects that are specific or shared for each treatment strategy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvy293", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2904065723", "source": "openalex"}

Given this background, the potential value of chronic vagal stimulation was explored in humans with an implantable neuro-stimulator capable of delivering low current pulses with adjustable parameters to stimulate the right vagus. A small multicenter feasibility and safety study exploring efficacy has recently been completed. A total of 32 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35% and a history of chronic heart failure in symptomatic NYHA class II-III were included in the study.

The Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship Boot Camp (PCBC) at Boston Children’s Hospital was designed to provide incoming fellows with an intensive exposure to congenital cardiac pathology and a broad overview of major areas of paediatric cardiology practice. Methods The PCBC curriculum was designed by core faculty in cardiac pathology, echocardiography, electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, exercise physiology, and cardiac intensive care. Individual faculty contributed learning objectives, which were refined by fellowship directors and used to build a programme of didactics, hands-on/simulation-based activities, and self-guided learning opportunities. Results A total of 16 incoming fellows participated in the 4-week boot camp, with no concurrent clinical responsibilities, over 2 years. On the basis of pre- and post-PCBC surveys, 80% of trainees strongly agreed that they felt more prepared for clinical responsibilities, and a similar percentage felt that PCBC should be offered to future incoming fellows. Fellows showed significant increase in their confidence in all specific knowledge and skills related to the learning objectives. Fellows rated hands-on learning experiences and simulation-based exercises most highly. Conclusions We describe a novel 4-week-long boot camp designed to expose incoming paediatric cardiology fellows to the broad spectrum of knowledge and skills required for the practice of paediatric cardiology. The experience increased trainee confidence and sense of preparedness to begin fellowship-related responsibilities. Given that highly interactive activities were rated most highly, boot camps in paediatric cardiology should strongly emphasise these elements.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951116002614", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2583411901", "source": "openalex"}

Risk prediction tools facilitate risk communication to the patient and their family, and this may increase commitment and motivation to improve their health. Over the years many risk algorithms have been developed to predict 10-year cardiovascular mortality or lifetime risk in different populations, such as in healthy individuals, patients with established cardiovascular disease and patients with diabetes mellitus. Each risk algorithm has its own limitations, so different algorithms should be used in different patient populations. Risk algorithms are made available for use in clinical practice by means of – usually interactive and online available – tools.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2160423365", "title": "Quality assessment and improvement in interventional cardiology: A position statement of the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, part 1: Standards for quality assessment and improvement in interventional cardiology", "text": "Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improves quality of life and survival in certain clinical settings [1]. These benefits are counterbalanced by the procedural risks. To encourage quality patient care, each PCI program must evaluate its performance through a meaningful continuous quality improvement (CQI) process. The ACC/AHA/SCAI 2005 PCI guideline update, as well as the newly implemented SCAI/ACC catheterization laboratory accreditation program, Accreditation for Cardiovascular Excellence (ACE), requires a CQI program for every health care facility in which PCI is performed [2]. CQI is an iterative method to evaluate operational approaches and remedy deficiencies [3]. The primary emphasis in CQI is on evaluating the overall program structure, processes, and outcomes of care; however, specific operator performance assessed by peer review is highly desirable. The Federal Health Care Improvement Act of 1986 recognized the importance of these programs by protecting participants and their deliberations. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) has previously published guidelines to develop a framework for these activities in the catheterization laboratory [4, 5]. This statement is intended to establish the standard by which interventional program quality should be measured. Interventional cardiologists are best suited to perform the primary role in evaluating PCI quality and guiding a program focused on objective measures. The process must not be payor or hospital administration directed, as these stakeholders may have conflicting goals [6]. Nevertheless, quality will have important reimbursement ramifications in the future; this is particularly true if \"pay for performance\" is instituted, by which larger payments would be provided to institutions and cardiologists with higher quality measures [7-9]. The critical questions are \"what is quality?\" and \"who decides?\" Active physician participation in developing the tools to measure and report quality outcomes is essential; otherwise, control over the process will be lost to those who do not possess an in-depth comprehension of interventional practice [10]. Quality measurement in the interventional laboratory goes beyond simply self-reporting excellent procedural outcomes. An optimal CQI process should include the input and concerns of physicians (including both those who perform the procedures and those who refer their patients for interventions), health care staff, hospital administration and patients in an attempt to continually improve processes and efficiencies as well as outcomes. Quality improvement methods evaluate (1) the structure of the system, (2) the processes (actions and policies) performed to further improve the results, and (3) the outcomes achieved [11]. Programmatic quality is comprehensive, evaluating quality over multiple patient subsets, so as to promote both individual physician and system-wide quality improvement. The evaluation of individual operator quality is an integral part of the PCI CQI process. CQI must include an ongoing, peer review assessment of the clinical proficiency of each operator including random case review, realistic identification of programmatic and individual operator strengths and weaknesses, and comparison of individual and aggregate outcomes against national standards and benchmark databases. Although a high standard of performance may be the goal of each operator, an acceptable minimum level of quality level must also be defined that individual operators at all levels of competence must achieve for maintenance of privileges [12]. PCI quality is a complex entity, and it cannot be adequately characterized by any single clinical variable. Operator procedural volume is a weak and inconsistent measure of quality, and it should not be used alone as a quality indicator. Institutional volume is a better programmatic predictor of outcomes, but does not supersede actual outcomes [2, 13]. An appraisal of comorbidities, case risk, and appropriateness is critical when PCI volume is used as a process measure. A complete and accurate comprehension of clinical results requires benchmarking of risk-adjusted outcomes to account for differences in patient characteristics [14]. The optimal CQI program measures and evaluates all of the relevant variables, and seeks to improve PCI outcomes systematically. SCAI urges that only validated methods be used to measure quality. Advertising and testimonials are not measures of quality. Hospital and practitioner ranking systems and self-proclaimed \"centers of excellence\" are not reliable quality indicators. Only an objective, physician-led process that includes appropriate evaluation and corrective action plans and is organized to assure a fair and impartial review of performance, provides a reasonable level of assurance that quality is being accurately assessed and promoted. Based upon the previously published SCAI guidelines for quality assessment and improvement in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, Table I provides an outline for the implementation of a CQI program for PCI [4, 5]. The five elements in the SCAI \"blueprint\" for a CQI program include (1) identification of quality indicators, (2) systematic data collection using standard definitions, (3) analysis of the data with benchmarking to determine areas that require improvement, (4) development of an implementation plan to correct deficiencies, and (5) systematic repeat data collection to determine the effect of the corrective action. Programs must provide confidential and constructive feedback of performance and outcomes data to clinicians that promote changes in practice to improve performance [12]. These parameters, based on national guidelines and peer reviewed literature, should address the program's specific outcomes and complications in addition to its overall quality metrics. An effective CQI process includes random case review, develops critical pathways, and accomplishes and documents positive changes in procedures and practice. Practical examples of successful implementation in PCI programs demonstrate improved outcomes and recognizing the barriers to improvement likely to be encountered [3, 15]. Assuring PCI quality depends on the active participation of physicians and the provision of adequate resources by the institution. An independent and dedicated committee which interacts with other divisional and hospital quality CQI committees should be established (Table I). Although a consensus on organizational design does not exist, the committee structure should include both physicians and relevant health care personnel in a cooperative effort [3, 4, 16]. The composition of a PCI CQI committee may include noninvasive cardiologists, primary care physicians, catheterization laboratory nurses, and hospital administrators. In small PCI programs, all active interventionists may be included as members. In larger laboratories, a formal and equitable process for selecting and replacing members must be devised to assure fair representation. An expert in interventional cardiology who has attained the trust of multiple stake holders to conduct a fair and unbiased review of the sensitive issues discussed should chair this committee; the catheterization laboratory director or director of interventional cardiology is a reasonable choice. An oversight mechanism to evaluate the chair, as an operator, should be defined. Dedicated CQI staff trained to collect the data should be identified and participate in the data analysis under the direction of the committee. The CQI Committee is responsible for all aspects of the CQI process (Table I). The monitoring of standard metrics, the identification of facility quality indicators, appropriate remediation, and follow-up are the critical responsibilities of the committee. Protecting patient safety is the central purpose of the CQI process. Programmatic deficiencies must be identified openly with the involvement of hospital risk management as appropriate. Attention to local political and interpersonal matters is essential. The CQI committee should meet at regular intervals, review each serious adverse outcome, and conduct random audits of all operators. A determination should be made regarding the impact of each event on the patient and the responsibility of the operator, with the committee chair charged to establish a consensus. When a disagreement as to the cause and/or significance of an event exists, a mechanism must be in place to reconcile or note these differences. There are numerous challenges in applying PCI CQI and peer review processes in a constructive and impartial manner. A health care institution must assure that patients are selected appropriately and that procedures are performed safely. The hospital's \"quality management\" department, responsible for investigation of reported events and government-mandated quality indicators, should work with the physician-centered PCI CQI program. Its purpose should coincide with that of the CQI committee, namely, to document and improve \"the quality of patient care.\" Use of this data for nonquality purposes, e.g. developing marketing strategies or improving operating margin, should be strongly discouraged. Conflicts of interest are common among competing physicians who may perceive a financial advantage to adjudicate adversely another physician's care. There are unsettling reports of the subversion of the CQI and peer review processes for political, financial, or other reasons [17]. Therefore, SCAI recommends that a formal method of oversight for perceived conflicts of interest within the CQI and Peer Review processes be developed by the hospital CQI process and/or medical staff bylaws. An independent facility accreditation process, when it becomes available, may be invaluable in this regard. The use of the CQI and peer review process for purposes that undermine its proper functions is not acceptable. Strong sanctions for such behavior should be formalized in the Medical Staff Bylaws and applied to any individual who violates the process. Educational activities such as cardiac catheterization conferences and Morbidity and Mortality conferences should be held routinely, and an attendance threshold for maintenance of privileges enforced. Presentation of clinical and technically challenging cases, including those with complications and unexpected developments during the conduct of a PCI, is rewarding to review and discuss in these conferences. Separation of peer review from such teaching activities is essential to the success of both in view of the legal issues involved, in particular, the possibility of potential discovery in nonprotected conferences. The committee must behave equitably and transparently to ensure fairness to the operator, quality for the patient, and credibility for the committee. Federal and state regulations shield participants from litigation in peer review activities. Proceedings of peer review activities are protected against subpoena and are not discoverable in most situations. Admixing peer review proceedings in other settings should not occur. Operator outcomes must be presented so that absolute confidentiality is maintained. Physicians whose activities are being investigated for issues related to quality of care also should be protected. Use of confidential information to target an individual physician should be considered a breach of the process [17]. Further, Committee members who may have conflicts of interests should remove themselves from deliberating in selected matters, as appropriate. The individual being investigated must always receive impartial consideration and \"due process.\" When the CQI process identifies a systemic problem that requires remediation, the CQI committee must investigate the cause and devise a solution. Illustrative examples may include an excessively high rate of access site complications, contrast-induced nephropathy, radiation dose, etc. Quality issues arising from catheterization laboratory structure or process indicators should result in a formalized plan and implementation strategy, including continued reassessment. Ongoing modification may be required to reach the target result. All policy and procedure changes must meet institutional approval requirements. Concerns with operator performance may be due to problems either in professional behavior, including but not limited to attitude or ethical conduct, and/or deficiencies in cognitive knowledge, judgment, procedural skills, mental impairment, addictive substance abuse, or a combination. Issues of professional behavior are frequently difficult to confront and require sensitivity to resolve [5]. To assure credibility, the CQI and Peer Review processes must be impartial. Criteria for review of cases for cause must be applied consistently and a mechanism for random review established. Although each case is unique, recommendations should be based on a comprehensive knowledge of the issue and input from all appropriate stakeholders. An initial approach to influence physician behavior may be to charge a \"neutral,\" well-respected individual in the department to discuss the quality issue with the operator in question, comparing his/her performance in that regard with other operators based on objective benchmark data. This activity should be designated as a legally protected activity of the peer review process. Such quiet discussion may be all that is needed to improve performance. When an alteration in technique or approach is considered necessary, a non-punitive action plan must be developed by the committee. Behavior modification requires appropriate feedback; this should always be constructive and, whenever possible, non-punitive. The corrective action plan should include metrics to determine effectiveness and should clearly state the expected outcome and targets. A random review is important to avoid \"gaming\" of the system. All corrective actions should be reassessed in an ongoing process to determine the effectiveness of the steps taken. If the goals are not met, further steps should be identified. Referral to an outside agency and/or to the proper review body within the institution is reserved for circumstances in which internal resolution cannot be achieved and when the difficulty encountered has serious connotations. When requested, it is imperative that outside reviewers be expert and impartial, and that all parties agree that potential or real conflicts of interest do not exist. It would be optimal if the selection of the outside expert was made after consultation with all parties. Penalities or sanctions, e.g., suspension of privileges, should be considered only after other methods of correction have failed. The seriousness of the sanction should fairly mirror the seriousness of the problem and the responsiveness of the operator [4, 5]. If it is concluded that the operator has a deficiency in knowledge or skill, the CQI Committee or outside reviewer can recommend an appropriate educational approach or mentorship and consider limiting privileges until defined expectations have been met. When all other appropriate measures to improve performance are unsuccessful, the committee may recommend revocation of an operator's privileges. All institutions have a policy covering this situation that should be used through their Medical Staff Bylaws, including reporting to required state regulatory bodies. To evaluate the quality of a PCI program, a group of \"quality indicators\" must be identified and carefully followed. These should be established by the committee as suggested by guidelines, accreditation bodies, and local practice requirements. The frequency of internal evaluation is arbitrary, but monthly or quarterly are reasonable intervals, depending on institutional volumes. Many indicators can be evaluated both for the laboratory as a whole and for each operator. They should include processes and outcomes in which PCI is the central function but may include indicators outside the laboratory environment which impact on PCI quality. One example is the \"door-to-balloon\" time in acute myocardial infarction. Other examples include the following: appropriate administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, renal protection measures, lipid management and systems-based issues aimed at reducing bleeding complications and hospital readmission. Components of an optimal CQI program require that several key outcome and process measures be routinely collected, analyzed, and constructively employed. As recommended previously [4, 5], a dedicated database must be established with hospital support. The database should include quality indicators that reflect patient outcomes and processes of care. Data should be recorded using standard definitions and submitted to national or regional databases. Significant variation from these norms should prompt internal peer review of cases to evaluate the appropriateness of patient selection and risk-adjusted outcome. Sufficient resources must be available to the CQI committee to adequately measure baseline patient risk permitting valid risk-adjustment of outcomes and determining appropriateness of the intervention. The CQI process may be best implemented by incorporating clinical practice guidelines and appropriateness criteria [2, 18-20]. When guidelines are followed, clinical outcomes improve [21-24]. Of course, such guidelines usually apply only for those patients shown to lie within the boundaries covered by clinical trials and registries. In addition, guidelines are intended only as suggestions based on scientific studies; application to individual patients always requires clinical judgment. It cannot be over-emphasized that quality measurement tools must be applied properly, and uniformly, and to the correct patient subsets, to achieve an accurate evaluation and true quality improvement. Specific quality measures to constructively improve patient selection for PCI, operator performance, team proficiency, and overall care systems should be selected carefully by the CQI committee. Outcomes of direct importance to the individual patient are the most clinically meaningful measures. Given wide variation in baseline patient risk, outcomes closely linked to PCI are perhaps the most useful quality assurance measures. A proposed list of core and optional measures may be found in Tables II-IV. Benchmarking against national standards is a valuable means to understand high variances in low incidence adverse events. Comparing observed programmatic and individual operator outcomes to expected results is critical to avoid the criticisms related to self-reported data. Such analyses and collection of many of these variables are captured in ACC-NCDR CathPCI Registry version 4 [25, 26], as well as in other recognized regional registries. Not only has registry data been shown to be effective in predicting outcomes, but also they provide quarterly reports with benchmarking and risk-adjusted outcomes [27]. The registries use standardized definitions to collect patient demographics, clinical variables, and outcomes on each procedure. These evidence-based data elements are combined with process and performance measures that are linked to current ACC/AHA/SCAI clinical practice guidelines [12]. Quarterly reports are sent to each participating facility benchmarking its results, including risk-adjusted mortality, against national and peer groups [27]. Collaboration with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is ongoing in a variety of projects to measure and assess quality. There are limitations, however, in the registries: (1) there is no long-term follow-up, (2) the data are self-reported without mandated periodic auditing, (3) the existing models risk-adjust only mortality, not other outcomes, and (4) participation is voluntary so that the data may not be representative. The desire to gather all adverse events must be balanced against the available resources and personnel required to collect, manage, and analyze extensive amounts of data. Although the core elements should be present in every program, which optional elements to include will depend on the problems and concerns at each site. Since accurate data collection is a pivotal component of this process, data verification is essential. Adequate staff with knowledge of interventional procedures is required. An accurate tool to collect the data is indispensable; Table V provides an example. Random audits from competent, objective reviewers should be conducted to assure data correctness. Decreasing the number of times a given data set has to be entered decreases staff time and potential for error. A well-integrated information system is extremely helpful to this process. Data access to the CQI database must be restricted to those directly involved in the CQI process, for both patient privacy and potential medical-legal concerns. The optimal internal quality assurance program employs patient-specific risk prediction tools to supplement clinical judgment and intuition in nonemergency PCI cases [28, 29]. For example, validated prediction tools for contrast-induced nephropathy and bleeding risk should routinely prompt activation of risk mitigation strategies and intensified care and surveillance for early detection and appropriate treatment of adverse outcomes [30-33]. Future integration of health information systems may facilitate tracking of longer-term (i.e., ≥30 day) outcomes and provide further insights for optimizing PCI Verification that appropriate short-term follow-up has been arranged prior to discharge should be mandatory. Thirty-day outcomes are increasingly required by both government and private payers and acquisition of these data should be supported by hospital resources, as it will affect their reimbursement. For example, 30-day readmission has been suggested by NQF and CMS as an important metric, although not necessarily attributable to PCI directly. These longer term measures are critical to assess whether treatment choices and long-term care have optimized patient outcomes in a complex medical environment. The optimal internal quality improvement program would employ ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines, the most recent peer reviewed scientific literature and quantitative tools to assess the appropriateness of institutional PCI case selection [18]. Although it is important that each institution address the appropriateness of each procedure, this is logistically challenging. Random case reviews should be performed and include a review of the report for appropriate indication and procedure documentation as well as cine review to address technique. Operators who do predominantly low risk cases that should be treated medically might appear to be competent PCI operators utilizing the risk-adjusted models and volume criteria which currently exist but not be providing optimal patient care [34, 35]. The preprocedure evaluation for ischemia either by noninvasive or in-lab functional testing (e.g. FFR) further contributes to an assessment of appropriate patient selection. More sophisticated patient-specific outcome prediction under various management strategies may become feasible as tools continue to be developed, validated, and more efficiently implemented, such as SYNTAX Score, Euroscore, and Global Risk Score [36-42]. Transition from anatomic-based decisions is crucial in the correct evaluation of appropriateness as a quality measure [43]. More contemporary appropriateness use criteria are currently being developed that embrace and promulgate the importance of combining functional assessments and individualized outcome prediction along with traditional anatomic characterizations for optimal patient management. Each institution in which PCI is performed must have a specific Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory CQI Committee devoted to PCI quality performance with adequate resources provided by the hospital to support this activity. Interventional operator participation and direction are essential. The PCI CQI program must be focused on quality of care with careful attention to the quality indicators: structure, process, and outcomes. All proceedings should be confidential and conducted equitably and impartially. Development of a written protocol for PCI review, including the use of standard definitions of adverse events, is necessary to minimize arbitrariness in process and maximize physician and staff acceptance. Quality measures should be compared to benchmarks from the medical literature. National or regional database participation is strongly recommended. The PCI quality review process should include evaluation of the individual operators' performance (peer review), including random case reviews. This process must be nonpunitive with the primary purpose to improve process within the spectrum of care. Specific methods of remediation with defined follow-up and goals should be established by the CQI Committee. Referral to outside agencies and to the proper review body within the institution is reserved for circumstances in which external resolution is deemed necessary by the CQI committee. When outside review is requested to determine issues related to quality of care, a professional, objective and independent organization or individual should be selected. All potential conflicts of interest must be clarified prior to any external review. Breaching of the confidentiality of the PCI review process is unacceptable. Each institution should provide clear guidelines and sanctions for such behavior. The concept of \"due process\" should be followed in evaluating operator performance to protect the operator and the process.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.22982", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160423365", "source": "openalex"}

The aims of this study were to observe how district hospitals use a pediatric telecardiology service, and to compare the costs and outcomes of patients referred to specialists by means of this service or conventionally. Methods: A telemedicine service was set up between a pediatric cardiac center in London and four district hospitals for referrals of second trimester women, newborn babies, and older children. Clinicians in each hospital decided on the role for their service. Clinical events were audited prospectively and costed, and patient surveys were conducted. Results: The hospitals differed in their selection of patient groups for the service. In all, 117 telemedicine patients were compared with 387 patients seen in London or in outreach clinics. Patients selected for telemedicine were generally healthier. For all patients, the mean cost for the initial consultation was £411 for tele-referrals and £277 for conventional referrals, a nonsignificant difference. Teleconsultations for women and children were significantly more expensive because of technology costs, whereas for babies, ambulance transfers were much more costly. After 6-months follow-up, the difference between referral methods for all patients was nonsignificant (telemedicine, £3,350; conventional referrals, £2,172), and nonsignificant within the patient groups. Conclusions: Telemedicine was perceived by cardiologists, district clinicians, and families as reliable and efficient. The equivocal 6-month cost results indicate that investment in the technology is warranted to enhance pediatric and perinatal cardiology services.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462307051653", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017409544", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the Position Paper is to identify specific barriers and knowledge gaps for the use of wearables, in particular for heart rate (HR) and activity tracking, in clinical cardiovascular healthcare to support their implementation into clinical care. The widespread use of HR and fitness tracking technologies provides unparalleled opportunities for capturing physiological information from large populations in the community, which has previously only been available in patient populations in the setting of healthcare provision. The availability of low-cost and high-volume physiological data from the community also provides unique challenges. While the number of patients meeting healthcare providers with data from wearables is rapidly growing, there are at present no clinical guidelines on how and when to use data from wearables in primary and secondary prevention. Technical aspects of HR tracking especially during activity need to be further validated. How to analyse, translate, and interpret large datasets of information into clinically applicable recommendations needs further consideration. While the current users of wearable technologies tend to be young, healthy and in the higher sociodemographic strata, wearables could potentially have a greater utility in the elderly and higher-risk population. Wearables may also provide a benefit through increased health awareness, democratization of health data and patient engagement. Use of continuous monitoring may provide opportunities for detection of risk factors and disease development earlier in the causal pathway, which may provide novel applications in both prevention and clinical research. However, wearables may also have potential adverse consequences due to unintended modification of behaviour, uncertain use and interpretation of large physiological data, a possible increase in social inequality due to differential access and technological literacy, challenges with regulatory bodies and privacy issues. In the present position paper, current applications as well as specific barriers and gaps in knowledge are identified and discussed in order to support the implementation of wearable technologies from gadget-ology into clinical cardiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjdh/ztab011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3127871879", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we prospectively evaluated clinical characteristics and causes of chest pain in children referred to our paediatric cardiology unit. Methods A total of 380 children were included. Associated symptoms and past and family histories were evaluated. All patients underwent physical examination. The following studies were performed: complete blood count in all patients; fasting lipid profiles in overweight and obese children and children with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease; and electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram in all patients. If necessary, 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring or exercise stress tests were performed. Patients with a history of positive psychological findings were evaluated by a child psychiatrist. Results The most common causes of chest pain were musculoskeletal disorders (37.1%), idiopathic chest pain (29.2%), and miscellaneous disorders, for example precordial catch syndrome (15%), respectively. Only 1 of 380 (0.3%) patients had chest pain due to a cardiac disorder. Electrocardiograms were abnormal in 4 of 380 (1.1%) patients. A total of 9 of 380 patients (2.3%) had dyslipidaemia. Conclusions Although a paediatric cardiology referral may provide reassurance to the primary care and emergency department physicians, our results show that cardiac aetiologies for paediatric chest pain are very rare.

Dose-area product (DAP) values, exposure parameters and geometry, together with procedure, patient and cardiologist characteristics, were also registered. Procedures were divided into two groups: diagnostic procedures (coronary angiography) and therapeutic procedures (dilatation, stent, combined procedures (e.g. coronary angiography + dilatation + stent)). The mean value of the MSD was 0.310 Gy for diagnostic and 0.699 Gy for therapeutic procedures. The most critical projection for receiving the MSD is the LAO90 (left anterior oblique) geometry. In 3% of cases, the MSD exceeded the 2 Gy dose threshold for deterministic effects. Action levels in terms of DAP values as the basis for a strategy for follow-up of patients for deterministic radiation skin effects were derived from measured MSD and cumulative DAP values. Two DAP action levels are proposed. A first DAP action level of 125 Gy cm(2) corresponding to the dose threshold of 2 Gy would imply an optional radiopathological follow-up depending on the cardiologist's decision. A second DAP action level of 250 Gy cm(2) corresponding to the 3 Gy skin dose would imply a systematic follow-up. Dose reference levels - 71.3 Gy cm(2) for diagnostic and 106.0 Gy cm(2) for therapeutic procedures - were derived from the 75 percentile of the DAP distributions. As a conclusion, we propose that total DAP is registered in patient's record file, as it can serve to improve the follow-up of patients for radiation-induced skin injuries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr/29449648", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152002082", "source": "openalex"}

AI modalities have expanded feet to the specialty of pediatric cardiology as well. We conducted a scoping review searching the Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases covering the recent literature between 2002-2022. We found that the use of neural networks and machine learning has significantly improved the diagnostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiograms, computer tomography scans, and electrocardiographs, thus augmenting the clinicians' diagnostic accuracy of pediatric heart diseases. The use of AI-based prediction algorithms in pediatric cardiac surgeries improves postoperative outcomes and prognosis to a great extent. Risk stratification and the prediction of treatment outcomes are feasible using the key clinical findings of each CHD with appropriate computational algorithms. Notably, AI can revolutionize prenatal prediction as well as the diagnosis of CHD using the EMR (electronic medical records) data on maternal risk factors. The use of AI in the diagnostics, risk stratification, and management of CHD in the near future is a promising possibility with current advancements in machine learning and neural networks. However, the challenges posed by the dearth of appropriate algorithms and their nascent nature, limited physician training, fear of over-mechanization, and apprehension of missing the 'human touch' limit the acceptability.

A variety of indirect measures have been used to reduce the impact of attenuation, most notably electrocardiography-gated SPECT imaging. However, all available techniques have limitations, making interpretation in the presence of attenuation difficult. The ultimate solution, similar to positron emission tomography imaging, is to use hardware/software algorithms to eliminate attenuation and provide images that are more uniform and easier to interpret. Several attenuation correction solutions are currently available and more will be available soon. The value of these solutions has been varied, particularly with clinical applications. Guidelines and standards clearly are necessary. In recognition of the importance of this issue, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology and the Society of Nuclear Medicine convened a joint task force to develop a position statement on attenuation correction. It is being published concurrently in the Journal of Nuclear Cardiology and The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, a first for these societies. The purpose of this position statement is to clarify the role of attenuation correction in SPECT procedures, to provide guidelines for its clinical use, and to provide a basis for the evaluation of published validation. It is hoped that this position statement will provide an important and useful road map to the widespread adoption of attenuation correction into clinical practice. Gary V.

RESULTS--Patients who made emergency calls did so sooner after onset of symptoms than those who called their doctor (median time 40 (95% confidence interval 30 to 52) minutes v 70 (60 to 90) minutes). General practitioners took a median of 20 (20 to 25) minutes to visit patients, rising to 30 (20 to 30) minutes during 0800-1200. The median time from call to arrival in hospital was 41 (38 to 47) minutes for patients who called an ambulance from home and 90 (90 to 94) minutes for those who contacted their doctor.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of health-related QOL assessment in a pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic. Design The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed by a convenience sample of 176 patients, aged 8–18 years, being seen in a pediatric cardiology clinic. Three cardiologists enrolled in this study reviewed the completed PedsQL during the clinic visit and recorded their responses to items reported to be a problem \"Often\" or \"Almost Always.\" This utilization of the instrument was compared to standardized scoring and the practicality and perceived usefulness of the practice was evaluated by physician interview. Results PedsQL responses showed 38% of patients reporting significant (Often or Almost Always) problems on at least one domain (19% Physical Functioning, 18.2% Emotional Functioning, 11.4% Social Functioning, and 22.3% School Functioning problems). Using standardized scoring, the prevalence of scores below the cutoff score for clinically significant impaired QOL in each domain ranged from 10% to 20%, with agreement between scoring methods ranging from 89% to 93%, sensitivity 68% to 86%, and specificity 89% to 97%. Cardiologists reported interventions in 30.1% of patients. They found that the PedsQL was easy to use, did not interfere with clinic operations, required minimal time (1–5 minutes), and provided information that had an important impact on their practice in some patients. Conclusions This study demonstrates the clinical utility of health-related QOL assessment using the PedsQL in a pediatric cardiology outpatient setting.

Thirty sets of protective eyewear have been tested in x-ray fields using anthropomorphic phantoms to simulate the patient and clinician in two centres. The experiments performed have determined DRFs from simulations of interventional procedures by measuring doses to the eyes of the phantom representing the clinician, using TLDs in Glasgow, Scotland and with an electronic dosemeter in Gothenburg, Sweden. During interventional procedures scattered x-rays arising from the patient will be incident on the head of the clinician from below and to the side. DRFs for x-rays incident on the front of lead glasses vary from 5.2 to 7.6, while values for orientations similar to those used in the majority of clinical practice are between 1.4 and 5.2. Specialised designs with lead glass side shields or of a wraparound style with angled lenses performed better than lead glasses based on the design of standard spectacles.

A new task for cardiologists is therefore to integrate these data in order to give the most relevant information to the patients and the relatives, to discuss genetic testing, and to use the data to optimise the management of the family. At the same time the various impacts of genetic management such as psychological, social, ethical and legal issues should be recognised, anticipated and taken into account.

The present paper focuses on some of the practical issues the cardiologist may be facing in the context of a monogenic disorder. Genetic counselling has been defined as a communication process which deals with the human and psychological problems associated with the occurrence, or the risk of occurrence, of a genetic disorder in a family.1 The general aim is to serve the interest of the family, either patients or relatives, and the primary responsibility is to provide information as accurately as possible.

Whether elderly patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) had increased risks for mortality and rehospitalization compared with younger patients during the long-term follow-up was examined. The predictors of these adverse outcomes were also identified. Methods and Results: The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) studied prospectively the characteristics and treatments in a broad sample of 2,675 patients hospitalized with worsening HF and the outcomes were followed up. The majority of elderly patients were female, had lower body mass index (BMI), a higher rate of ischemic, valvular, and hypertensive heart disease as etiologies of HF, a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lower hemoglobin, and higher left ventricular ejection fraction values. Even after adjustment for covariates, the elderly patients were associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes. The predictors for all-cause death were: lower eGFR, lower BMI, male sex, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF), and the use of diuretics at discharge. Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with HF, elderly patients had a worse prognosis than younger patients. Lower eGFR, lower BMI, male sex, sustained VT/VF, and diuretic use were independent predictors for all-cause death in these patients with higher risk.

Within a single institution, some issues such as provider interaction, information exchange, or administrative directives should not play a significant role, and should favour successful transfer. Objective We studied patients who were eligible for transfer to the adult congenital heart disease service within our institution in order to identify factors associated with successful transfer to adult care providers versus failure to transfer. Methods Patients above18 years of age with CHD who were seen by paediatric cardiologists before January, 2008 were identified through a patient-care database. Records were reviewed to determine follow-up between 2008 and 2011 and to determine whether the patient was seen in the adult congenital cardiology clinic, paediatric cardiology clinic, or had no follow-up, and statistical comparisons were made between groups. Results After reviewing 916 records, 229 patients were considered eligible for transition to adult congenital cardiology. Of these, 77 (34%) were transferred successfully to adult congenital cardiology, 47 (21%) continued to be seen by paediatric cardiologists, and 105 (46%) were lost to follow-up. Those who transferred successfully differed with regard to complexity of diagnosis, insurance, and whether a formal referral was made by a paediatric care provider. Only a small fraction of the patients who were lost to follow-up could be contacted. Conclusion Within a single institution, with shared information systems, administrations, and care providers, successful transfer from paediatric to adult congenital cardiology was still poor. Efforts for successful retention are just as vital as those for transfer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951115000220", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160622717", "source": "openalex"}

Mechanically actuated steerable catheters appear the most in the clinical setting; however, they are bound to a number of mechanical limitations. The aim of this research is to gain insight in these limitations and use this information to develop a new prototype of a catheter with increased steerability. The main limitations in mechanically steerable catheters are identified and analysed, after which requirements and solutions are defined to design a multi-steerable catheter. Finally, a prototype is built and a proof-of-concept test is carried out to analyse the steering functions. The mechanical analysis results in the identification of five limitations: (1) low torsion, (2) shaft shortening, (3) high unpredictable friction, (4) coupled tip-shaft movements, and (5) complex cardiac environment. Solutions are found to each of the limitations and result in the design of a novel multi-steerable catheter with four degrees of freedom. A prototype is developed which allows the dual-segmented tip to be steered over multiple planes and in multiple directions, allowing a range of complex motions including S-shaped curves and circular movements. A detailed analysis of limitations underlying mechanically steerable catheters has led to a new design for a multi-steerable catheter for complex cardiac interventions. The four integrated degrees of freedom provide a high variability of tip directions, and repetition of the bending angle is relatively simple and reliable. The ability to steer inside the heart with a variety of complex shaped curves may potentially change conventional approaches in interventional cardiology towards more patient-specific and lower complexity procedures. Future directions are headed towards further design optimizations and the experimental validation of the prototype.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0954411919877709", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2977886389", "source": "openalex"}

Joseph Stokes and I were close colleagues for most of our careers as faculty at Harvard University, Boston University, and the Framingham Study. We shared a long and abiding interest in preventive medicine in general and preventive cardiology in particular. We were fortunate to have participated in the evolution of preventive cardiology from its inception by identifying correctable predisposing cardiovascular risk factors using population data from the pioneering Framingham Study. It is gratifying to see how this has stimulated cardiovascular drug development, trials to demonstrate their efficacy, and public health measures to alter cardiovascular disease (CVD)-promoting behavior in the population. It is satisfying to reflect on the many important lessons gleaned from our epidemiological investigation over the past 6 decades. Clinical misconceptions were corrected. The impact of overt and subclinical atherosclerotic CVD was revealed. The importance of the principle of multivariable risk factor influences on CVD, with no single essential and sufficient cause, was established. Population-based incidence of nonfatal cardiovascular events was provided to enhance mortality statistics. Useful multivariable cardiovascular risk assessment profiles were developed that minimize possibilities of falsely reassuring or needlessly alarming many potential CVD candidates.1 We provided clues to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular for further investigation. Familial and genetic influences are being studied in second and third generations of our study participants. We are now able to document the lifetime risks of CVD events and its predisposing risk factors from 6 decades of long-term investigation.2 This provides a more compelling depiction of CVD risk for both patients and physicians than current 10-year risk assessments. Major contributions of observational studies to preventive cardiology also include: proposal and fine-tuning of the multivariable risk factor concept of the etiology of atherosclerotic CVD and its use for risk assessment and gaining pathogenic insights, arousal of interest in preventive cardiology with epidemiology as its fundamental tenet, and redefinition of acceptable levels for predisposing risk factors from usual as normal to optimal for avoiding CVD.3 The complete gamut of cardiovascular events not captured from clinical data, including those immediately fatal and those silent or unrecognized, were revealed. Pathogenic insights provided include the fact that all the major risk factors cluster, suggesting underlying metabolic linkage; that silent or unrecognized cardiovascular events are not benign; that atrial fibrillation is a direct embolic threat, rather than a derivative of underlying cardiac disease, as formerly believed; that obesity promotes multiple atherogenic risk factors that comprise a metabolic syndrome; and that lipid ratio profiles provide insights into atherogenesis and their CVD hazard.3, 4 Other lessons include the observation that lifetime risk assessment better reflects the hazard of cardiovascular risk factors than short-term assessment, and that age and positive family history can be regarded as modifiable risk factors.5, 6 Population-based multivariable risk instruments have enabled assessment of the net, joint, and interactive influence of risk factors and estimation of multivariable CVD risk.7 Further lessons gleaned about preventive cardiology include: the fact that all major identified risk factors cluster, implying metabolic linkage; that cigarette smoking is a major cardiovascular as well as pulmonary risk; that silent or unrecognized cardiovascular events are common and far from benign; that obesity is an important promoter of major risk factors; that most of the cardiovascular hazard of type 2 diabetes derives from its accompanying risk factors; and that lipid ratio profiles provide best estimates of lipid atherogenesis and their cardiovascular hazard.8 It was shown that benign essential hypertension was far from benign or essential and that the J-curve phenomenon of hypertension risk may derive from an increased pulse pressure. The view that most of the adverse consequences of hypertension derive from the diastolic pressure was dispelled by demonstration of the dominant influence of the systolic and pulse pressure.9 Useful multivariable risk assessment profiles were developed for coronary disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and cardiac failure. We also crafted a total CVD multivariable risk assessment tool that encompasses all the forgoing, which can also be used to predict occurrence of each of its component events.7 Further elaboration of multivariable risk algorithms is needed because 40% to 50% of people having cardiovascular events are not considered high-risk candidates by most risk profiles in use. These events occur in people deemed at intermediate risk. We need to better define risk within this large population segment. Areas under consideration for improved risk assessment are biomarkers, genetic markers, and vascular imaging. Costly biomarkers may not significantly enhance the Framingham study multivariable risk score, but may be useful for assessing benefits of therapy. Imaging requires scanning technology to find already existing vascular disease. It stratifies intermediate cardiovascular risk best, but requires a primary care referral. Challenges for the future include postrecession funding, finding better ways to stimulate greater use of multivariable risk assessment in clinical primary care, determining appropriate us of technological advances in molecular medicine, imaging, ecological forces, and new interventional tools in population research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.20923", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103147701", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the effect of CVD on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults, individuals aged 75 and older have been markedly underrepresented in most major cardiovascular trials, and virtually all trials have excluded older adults with complex comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive disabilities, frailty, or residence in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence‐based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older adults typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence‐based decision‐making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, a detailed review was conducted of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC / AHA ) and American Stroke Association ( ASA ) guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older adults. A pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision‐making in older adults with CVD was found, as well as a paucity of data on the effect of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on outcomes that are particularly important to older adults, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population‐based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older adults representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older adults in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence‐based guidelines applicable to older adults and enhance person‐centered care of older individuals with CVD in the United States and around the world.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.14576", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2526578470", "source": "openalex"}

Patient dosimetry methods currently used in interventional radiology may be divided into three categories according to dosimetry purpose: (I) dosimetry for stochastic risk evaluation, (II) dosimetry for quality assurance and (III) dosimetry to prevent the deterministic effects of radiation.

Angina pectoris affects approximately 112 million people globally. Up to 70% of patients undergoing invasive angiography do not have obstructive coronary artery disease, more common in women than in men, and a large proportion have INOCA as a cause of their symptoms. INOCA patients present with a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs that are often misdiagnosed as non-cardiac leading to under-diagnosis/investigation and under-treatment. INOCA can result from heterogeneous mechanism including coronary vasospasm and microvascular dysfunction and is not a benign condition. Compared to asymptomatic individuals, INOCA is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events, repeated hospital admissions, as well as impaired quality of life and associated increased health care costs. This consensus document provides a definition of INOCA and guidance to the community on the diagnostic approach and management of INOCA based on existing evidence from research and best available clinical practice; noting gaps in knowledge and potential areas for further investigation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4244/eijy20m07_01", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3039015991", "source": "openalex"}

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse of stroke display the banners of hypertension, tobacco, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidaemia.2 All are responsible for cerebral arteriosclerosis. Transient ischaemic events are powerful predictors of stroke. Coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation increase stroke risk. Compounds lowering cholesterol, the “statins,” reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.3 At no age and in neither sex is a systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg acceptable.

There is an increasing number of trials demonstrating a new treatment is non-inferior to standard treatment. The hypotheses, design and interpretation of non-inferiority trials are different to superiority trials. Non-inferiority trials are designed with the notion that the new treatment offers advantages over standard treatment in certain important aspects. The non-inferior margin is a predetermined margin of difference between the new and standard treatment that is considered acceptable or tolerable for the new treatment to be considered ‘similar’ or ‘not worse’. Both relative difference and absolute difference methods can be used to define the non-inferior margin. Sequential testing for non-inferiority and superiority is often performed. Non-inferiority trials may be necessary in situations where it is no longer ethical to test any new treatment against placebo. There are inherent assumptions in non-inferiority trials which may not be correct and which are not being tested. Successive non-inferiority trials may introduce less and less effective treatments even though these treatments may have been shown to be non-inferior. Furthermore, poor quality trials favour non-inferior results. Intention-to-treat analysis, the preferred way to analyse randomised trials, may favour non-inferiority. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses should be recommended in non-inferiority trials. Clinicians should be aware of the pitfalls of non-inferiority trials and not accept non-inferiority on face value.

The need to stem poor lifestyle habits has led to the development of a new field of Lifestyle Medicine, whose mission is to prevent, treat, and even reverse chronic diseases through lifestyle interventions. Three fields within Cardiology relate to this mission: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Preventive Cardiology, and Behavioral Cardiology. Each of these three fields have contributed substantially to the reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The historic contributions of these three cardiac fields are reviewed as well as the challenges each of these fields has faced in optimizing the application of lifestyle medicine practices. A shared agenda between Cardiology and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine could further the utilization of behavioral interventions. This review suggests seven steps that could be shared by these organizations and other medical societies. First, there is a need to develop and promulgate the assessment of lifestyle factors as \"vital signs\" during patient visits. Second, developing a strong partnership between the fields of Cardiology and Physiatry could improve important aspects of cardiac care, including a potential redesign of cardiac stress testing. Third, behavioral evaluations should be optimized at patients' entrée points into medical care since these may be considered \"windows of opportunity\". Fourth, there is a need to broaden cardiac rehabilitation into inexpensive programs and make this program eligible for patients with risk factors but no known CVD. Fifth, lifestyle medicine education should be integrated into the core competencies for relevant specialties. Sixth, there is a need for inter-societal advocacy to promote lifestyle medicine practices. Seventh, the well-being effects of healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as their impact on one's sense of vitality, should be emphasized.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2023.04.004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4365151207", "source": "openalex"}

Overall patient management and workflow were examined in the initial phase. In phase 2, we implemented POCT but utilized central laboratory results for patient management. In phase 3, therapeutic decisions were based on POCT results. The final phase, phase 4, sought to optimize workflow around the availability of POCT. Patient wait and timing of phlebotomy, availability of laboratory results, and therapeutic action were monitored. Split sampling allowed comparability of POCT and central laboratory results throughout the study.In phase 1, 44% of central laboratory results were not available before the scheduled time for procedure (n = 135). Mean waiting times (arrival to procedure) were 188 +/- 54 min for patients who needed renal testing (phase 2; n = 14) and 171 +/- 76 min for those needing coagulation testing (n = 24). For patients needing renal testing, POCT decreased patient wait times (phases 3 and 4 combined, 141 +/- 52 min; n = 18; P = 0.02). For patients needing coagulation testing, wait times improved only when systematic changes were made in workflow (phase 4, 109 +/- 41 min; n = 12; P = 0.01).Although POCT has the potential to provide beneficial patient outcomes, merely moving testing from a central laboratory to the medical unit does not guarantee improved outcomes.

Future risk of CVD events was modelled, using published risk models based on patient characteristics.

This will have major implications for cardiological practice since much of the excess morbidity and mortality among diabetic patients is attributable to accelerated atherogenesis. Young diabetics are at particular risk and, by the age of 50 years, 33% of those requiring insulin have died from coronary heart disease. Indeed, 75% of all deaths in patients with diabetes are from this cause. Generally speaking, the management of diabetic patients with heart disease is underpinned by the same evidence base as applies to non-diabetic patients, and it is noteworthy that 15–20% of the patients in most of the landmark clinical trials have been diabetic. Recently, however, trials such as the UKPDS, HOPE, and DIGAMI studies (see below) have identified novel strategies for reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetes. These trials have already had a major impact on cardiological practice, emphasising the prime importance of blood pressure control and converting enzyme inhibition for reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetes, and also the value of insulin treatment for reducing mortality in diabetic myocardial infarction. Additional trials, already in progress, are expected to refine further the cardiovascular management of patients with diabetes in order to provide an effective challenge for a problem that shows no signs of going away. Three large epidemiological studies have shaped current understanding of the natural history of diabetic heart disease.

The left ventricular diastolic dysfunction may be a manifestation of various combinations of cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, renal, and geriatric conditions. Thus, in addition to treatment with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in all patients, the most effective method of improving clinical outcomes may be therapy tailored to each patient's clinical profile. To better outline a phenotype‐based approach for the treatment of HFpEF, in this joint position paper, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, the European Heart Rhythm Association and the European Hypertension Society, have developed an algorithm to identify the most common HFpEF phenotypes and identify the evidence‐based treatment strategy for each, while taking into account the complexities of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2894", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4377099139", "source": "openalex"}

This research was conducted in Latin America under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supporting programs on radiological protection (RP) of patients. Methods: Patient age, gender, weight, height, number of cine series, total number of cine frames, fluoroscopy time, and two dosimetric quantities [air kerma‐area product (P ka ) and cumulative dose (CD) at the patient entrance reference point] were recorded for each procedure. Results: The study includes 544 patients grouped into four age groups. The distributions by age group were 150 for &lt;1 yr; 203 for 1 to &lt;5 yr; 97 for 5 to &lt;10 yr; and 94 for 10 to &lt;16 yr. Median values of P ka and CD for the four age groups were 0.94, 1.46, 2.13, and 5.03 Gy cm 2 and 23.9, 26.8, 33.5, and 51.6 mGy, respectively. No significant statistical differences were found between diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. A moderate correlation ( r = 0.64) was seen between P ka and patient weight. Conclusions: The dose values reported in this paper were lower than those published in the previous work for the same age groups as a result of the optimization actions carried out by cardiologists and medical physicists with the support of the IAEA. Methodology and results will be used as a starting point for a wider survey in Chile and Latin America with the goal to obtain regional diagnostic reference levels as recently recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection for interventional procedures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1118/1.3702590", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076679568", "source": "openalex"}

Two thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLD) were used to assess operators' extremity doses (left shoulder and left foot) during 20 coronary angiographies (CAs) and 20 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCAs) in five European centres. X-ray equipment, radiation protection measures used and the dose delivered to the patient in terms of dose-area product (DAP) were recorded so as to subsequently associate them with operator's dose. The range of staff doses noted for the same TLD position, centre and procedure type emphasizes the importance of protective measures and technical characteristics of x-ray equipment. Correlation of patient's DAP with staff shoulder dose is moderate whereas correlation of patient's DAP with staff foot dose is poor in both CA and PTCA. Therefore, it is difficult to predict operator's dose from patient's DAP mainly due to the different use of protective measures. A preliminary occupational dose constraint value was defined by calculating cardiologists' annual effective dose and found to be 0.6 mSv.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/49/6/010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035814692", "source": "openalex"}

We evaluated the trends and gender differences in the guideline writing groups of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines from 2006 to 2020. Methods and Results We extracted all guidelines authors from 2006 to 2020, assessed their gender from publicly available profiles, and compared differences based on subspecialties and specific societies. Stratified and trend analyses were performed using χ2 and average annual percentage change/average 5 year percentage change. A total of 80 ACC/AHA (1288 authors [28% women]), 64 CCS (988 authors [26% women]), and 59 ESC (1157 authors [16% women]) guidelines were analyzed. A significant increase in inclusion of women was seen in ACC/AHA (12.6% [2006] to 42.6% [2020]; average annual percentage change, 6.6% [2.3% to 11.1%]; P=0.005) and ESC (7.1% [2006] to 25.8% [2020]; average annual percentage change, 6.6% [0.2% to 13.5%]; P=0.04), but the trend remained similar in CCS (20.6% [2006] to 36.3% [2020]; average annual percentage change, -0.1% (-3.7% to 3.5%); P=0.94), guideline authors. More women were coauthors in the ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines when women were chairs of guidelines. There was a persistent disparity of women among guideline authors for general cardiology and all subspecialties, except for pediatric cardiology and heart failure guidelines. The appointment of women authors as a chair was significantly low in all societies (22.4% [ACC/AHA], 16.9% [CCS], and 7.2% [ESC]; P=0.008).

Cardiologists need to understand emerging payment models to succeed in the evolving payment landscape. We review existing payment and delivery reforms that affect cardiologists, present 4 emerging examples, and consider their implications for clinical practice. <h3>Observations</h3> Public and commercial payers have recently implemented payment reforms and new models are evolving. Most cardiology models are modified fee-for-service or address procedural or episodic care, but population models are also emerging. Although there is widespread agreement that payment reform is needed, existing programs have significant limitations and the adoption of new programs has been slow. New payment reforms address some of these problems, but many details remain undefined. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Early payment reforms were voluntary and cardiologists' participation is variable. However, conventional fee-for-service will become less viable, and enrollment in new payment models will be unavoidable. Early participation in new payment models will allow clinicians to develop expertise in new care pathways during a period of relatively lower risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2016.3965", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2555375202", "source": "openalex"}

Data from 2014 were analyzed. In 2014, an estimated 5460 visiting consultant clinic days were provided in 96 predominantly rural cities by 167 cardiologists from Iowa and adjoining states. Forty-five percent of Iowa cardiologists participated in rural outreach. Visiting cardiologists from Iowa and adjoining states drive an estimated 45 000 miles per month. Because of monthly outreach clinics, the average driving time to the nearest cardiologist falls from 42.2±20.0 to 14.7±11.0 minutes for rural Iowans. Cardiology outreach improves geographic access to office-based cardiology care for more than 1 million Iowans out of a total population of 3 million. Direct travel costs and opportunity costs associated with physician travel are estimated to be more than $2.1 million per year.Cardiologists in Iowa and adjoining states have expanded access to office-based cardiology care from 18 to 89 of the 99 counties in Iowa.

Broadly speaking, it refers to the technology which converts a predesigned virtual model to a touchable object. In clinical medicine, it usually converts a series of two-dimensional medical images acquired through computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or 3D echocardiography into a physical model. Medical 3D printing consists of three main steps: image acquisition, virtual reconstruction and 3D manufacturing. It is a promising tool for preoperative evaluation, medical device design, hemodynamic simulation and medical education, it is also likely to reduce operative risk and increase operative success. However, the most relevant studies are case reports or series which are underpowered in testing its actual effect on patient outcomes. The decision of making a 3D cardiac model may seem arbitrary since it is mostly based on a cardiologist's perceived difficulty in performing an interventional procedure.

Etiology – Pericardial effusion, symptomatic bradycardia, and heartworm‐induced caval syndrome are examples of clinical scenarios commonly requiring intervention. Pericardial effusion in small animals occurs most frequently from cardiac neoplasia, idiopathic pericarditis, or congestive heart failure. Indications for temporary pacing include transient bradyarrhythmias, ingestions resulting in chronotropic incompetence, and emergency stabilization of critical bradyarrhythmias. Caval syndrome results from a large dirofilarial worm burden, pulmonary hypertension, and mechanical obstruction of right‐sided cardiac output with resultant hemolysis and organ dysfunction. Diagnosis – The diagnosis of pericardial effusion is suspected from signalment and physical findings and confirmed with cardiac ultrasound. Symptomatic bradycardias often present for syncope and definitive diagnosis derives from an ECG. Caval syndrome is diagnosed upon clinical, hematologic, and ultrasonographic evidence of severe heartworm infestation, cardiovascular compromise, and/or mechanical hemolysis. Therapy – Pericardial effusion is alleviated by pericardiocentesis in the emergency setting, though may require further intervention for long‐term palliation. Temporary transvenous pacing can be performed emergently to stabilize the symptomatic patient with a bradyarrhythmia. Dirofilariasis leading to caval syndrome requires urgent heartworm extraction. Prognosis – The prognosis for pericardial effusion is dependent upon the underlying etiology; the prognosis for cardiac pacing is favorable, and the prognosis for caval syndrome is grave if untreated and guarded to fair if heartworm extraction is performed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2011.00623.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1674569495", "source": "openalex"}

Large, cost‐free and real‐world datasets may be easily accessed yielding to observational studies, but such analyses often lead to problematic results in the absence of careful methods, especially from a statistic point of view. We aimed to appraise the performance of current multivariable approaches in the estimation of causal treatment and effects in studies focusing on drug‐eluting stents (DES). Methods and Results: Pertinent studies published in the literature were searched, selected, abstracted, and appraised for quality and validity features. Six studies with a logistic regression were included, all of them reporting more than 10 events for covariates and different length of follow‐up, with an overall low risk of bias. Most of the 15 studies with a Cox proportional hazard analysis had a different follow‐up, with less than 10 events for covariates, yielding an overall low or moderate risk of bias. Sixteen studies with propensity score were included: the most frequent method for variable selection was logistic regression, with underlying differences in follow‐up and less than 10 events for covariate in most of them. Most frequently, calibration appraisal was not reported in the studies, on the contrary of discrimination appraisal, which was more frequently performed. In seventeen studies with propensity and matching, the latter was most commonly performed with a nearest neighbor‐matching algorithm yet without appraisal in most of the studies of calibration or discrimination. Balance was evaluated in 46% of the studies, being obtained for all variables in 48% of them.

A tool that has the potential to compensate for decreased faculty time and thereby to improve medical education is multimedia computer instruction that is applicable at all levels of medical education, developed according to instructional design principles, and supported by evidence of effectiveness. The authors describe the experiences of six medical schools in implementing a comprehensive computer-based four-year curriculum in bedside cardiology developed by a consortium of university cardiologists and educational professionals. The curriculum consisted of ten interactive, patient-centered, case-based modules focused on the history, physical examination, laboratory data, diagnosis, and treatment. While an optimal implementation plan was recommended, each institution determined its own strategy. Major goals of the project, which took place from July 1996 to June 1997, were to identify and solve problems of implementation and to assess learners' and instructors' acceptance of the system and their views of its value. A total of 1,586 students used individual modules of the curriculum 6,131 times. Over 80% of students rated all aspects of the system highly, especially its clarity and educational value compared with traditional lectures. The authors discuss the aspects of the curriculum that worked, problems that occurred (such as difficulties in scheduling use of the modules in the third year), barriers to change and ways to overcome them (such as the type of team needed to win acceptance for and oversee implementation of this type of curriculum), and the need in succeeding years to formally assess the educational effectiveness of this and similar kinds of computer-based curricula.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-199902000-00011", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2065484866", "source": "openalex"}

To keep pace with evolving evidence, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (\"Task Force\") has issued this focused update to revise guideline recommendations on the basis of recently published data. This update is not based on a complete literature review from the date of previous guideline publications, but it has been subject to rigorous, multilevel review and approval, similar to the full guidelines. For specific focused update criteria and additional methodological details, please see the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual. 1 In response to published reports from the Institute of Medicine 2, 3 and ACC/AHA mandates, 4-7 processes have changed leading to adoption of a \"knowledge byte\" format. This entails delineation of recommendations addressing specific clinical questions, followed by concise text, with hyperlinks to supportive evidence. This approach better accommodates time constraints on busy clinicians, facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving technology (eg, smart phone apps), and supports the evolution of guidelines as \"living documents\" that can be dynamically updated as needed. Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may inform regulatory or payer decisions, they are intended to improve quality of care in the interest of patients. The Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) are derived independently of one another according to established criteria. The COR indicates the strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit of a clinical action in proportion to risk. The LOE rates the quality of scientific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 1). 1, 7, 8 The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time. The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All Guideline Writing Committee (GWC) members and reviewers are required to disclose current industry relationships or personal interests from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced GWC and assuring that the chair and a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI (Appendixes 1 and 2). Members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. For transparency, members' comprehensive disclosure information is available. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online. The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators. For additional information pertaining to the methodology for grading evidence, assessment of benefit and harm, shared decision making between the patient and clinician, structure of evidence tables and summaries, standardized terminology for articulating recommendations, organizational involvement, peer review, and policies for periodic assessment and updating of guideline documents, we encourage readers to consult the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual. 1 The recommendations in this focused update represent the official policy of the ACC and AHA until superseded by published addenda, statements of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-text guidelines. To ensure that guidelines remain current, new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether recommendations should be modified. In general, full revisions are posted in 5-year cycles. 1 Jonathan L. Halperin, MD, FACC, FAHA Chair, ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines The scope of this focused update is limited to considerations relevant to multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombus aspiration in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI. Clinical trials presented at the major cardiology organizations' 2013 to 2015 annual scientific meetings and other selected reports published in a peer-reviewed format through August 2015 were reviewed by the 2011 PCI and 2013 STEMI GWCs and the Task Force to identify trials and other key data that might affect guideline recommendations. The information considered important enough to prompt updated recommendations is included in evidence tables in the Online Data Supplement (http://jaccjacc.acc.org/Clinical_Document/2015_Focused_Update_on_Primary_PCI_in_STEMI_Data_Supplements.pdf). Consult the full-text versions of the 2011 PCI and 2013 STEMI guidelines 9, 10 for recommendations in clinical areas not addressed in the focused update. The individual recommendations in this focused update will be incorporated into future revisions or updates of the full-text guidelines. For this focused update, representative members of the 2011 PCI and 2013 STEMI GWCs were invited to participate. Members were required to disclose all RWI relevant to the topics under consideration. The entire membership of both GWCs voted on the revised recommendations and text. The latter group was composed of experts representing cardiovascular medicine, interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, heart failure, cardiac surgery, emergency medicine, internal medicine, cardiac rehabilitation, nursing, and pharmacy. The GWC included representatives from the ACC, AHA, American College of Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI). This document was reviewed predominantly by the prior reviewers from the respective 2011 and 2013 guidelines. These included 8 official reviewers jointly nominated by the ACC and AHA, 4 official/organizational reviewers nominated by SCAI, and 25 individual content reviewers. Reviewers' RWI information was distributed to the GWC and is published in this document (Appendix 3). This document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC, the AHA, and the SCAI and was endorsed by the Latin American Society of Interventional Cardiology. (See Section 5.2.2.2 of 2011 PCI guideline and Section 4.1.1 of 2013 STEMI guideline for additional recommendations.) Approximately 50% of patients with STEMI have multivessel disease. 25, 26 PCI options for patients with STEMI and multivessel disease include: 1) culprit artery–only primary PCI, with PCI of nonculprit arteries only for spontaneous ischemia or intermediate- or high-risk findings on predischarge noninvasive testing; 2) multivessel PCI at the time of primary PCI; or 3) culprit artery–only primary PCI followed by staged PCI of nonculprit arteries. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and meta-analyses comparing culprit artery–only PCI with multivessel PCI have reported conflicting results, 11, 12, 14-24, 27, 28 likely because of differing inclusion criteria, study protocols, timing of multivessel PCI, statistical heterogeneity, and variable endpoints (Data Supplement). Previous clinical practice guidelines recommended against PCI of nonculprit artery stenoses at the time of primary PCI in hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI. 9, 10 Planning for routine, staged PCI of noninfarct artery stenoses on the basis of the initial angiographic findings was not addressed in these previous guidelines, and noninfarct artery PCI was considered only in the limited context of spontaneous ischemia or high-risk findings on predischarge noninvasive testing. The earlier recommendations were based in part on safety concerns, which included increased risks for procedural complications, longer procedural time, contrast nephropathy, and stent thrombosis in a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state, 9, 10 and in part on the findings from many observational studies and meta-analyses of trends toward or statistically significant worse outcomes in those who underwent-multivessel primary PCI. 12-16, 21-23 Four RCTs have since suggested that a strategy of multivessel PCI, either at the time of primary PCI or as a planned, staged procedure, may be beneficial and safe in selected patients with STEMI17, 18, 24, 27 (Data Supplement). In the PRAMI (Preventive Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial (n=465), 24 the composite primary outcome of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or refractory angina occurred in 21 patients (9%) treated with multivessel primary PCI, compared with 53 patients (22%) treated with culprit artery–only PCI (HR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.58; P<0.001). In the CvLPRIT (Complete Versus Culprit-Lesion Only Primary PCI) trial, 18 296 patients were randomized to culprit artery–only or multivessel PCI during the index hospitalization (72% underwent multivessel primary PCI). The composite primary outcome of death, reinfarction, heart failure, and ischemia-driven revascularization at 12 months occurred in 15 patients (10%) who underwent multivessel PCI, compared with 31 patients (21%) receiving culprit artery–only PCI (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.84; P=0.009). In the DANAMI 3 PRIMULTI (Third Danish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial, 17 the composite primary outcome of all-cause death, nonfatal MI, or ischemia-driven revascularization of nonculprit artery disease occurred in 40 of 314 patients (13%) who underwent multivessel staged PCI guided by angiography and fractional flow reserve before discharge, versus 68 of 313 patients (22%) treated with culprit artery–only PCI (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.83; P=0.004). In the PRAGUE-13 (Primary Angioplasty in Patients Transferred From General Community Hospitals to Specialized PTCA Units With or Without Emergency Thrombolysis) trial, 27 214 patients with STEMI were randomized to staged (3 to 40 days after the index procedure) revascularization of all ≥70% diameter stenosis noninfarct lesions or culprit-only PCI. Preliminary results at 38 months' mean follow-up showed no between-group differences in the composite primary endpoint of all-cause death, nonfatal MI, and stroke. On the basis of these findings, 17, 18, 24, 27 the prior Class III (Harm) recommendation with regard to multivessel primary PCI in hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI has been upgraded and modified to a Class IIb recommendation to include consideration of multivessel PCI, either at the time of primary PCI or as a planned, staged procedure. The writing committee emphasizes that this change should not be interpreted as endorsing the routine performance of multivessel PCI in all patients with STEMI and multivessel disease. Rather, when considering the indications for and timing of multivessel PCI, physicians should integrate clinical data, lesion severity/complexity, and risk of contrast nephropathy to determine the optimal strategy. The preceding discussion and recommendations apply to the strategy of routine PCI of noninfarct related arteries in hemodynamically stable patients. Recommendations in the 2013 STEMI guideline with regard to PCI of a non–infarct-related artery at a time separate from primary PCI in patients who have spontaneous symptoms and myocardial ischemia or who have intermediate- or high-risk findings on noninvasive testing (Section 6.3 of that guideline) remain operative. Although several observational studies 19, 20 and a network meta-analysis 13 have suggested that multivessel staged PCI may be associated with better outcome than multivessel primary PCI, there are insufficient observational data and no randomized data at this time to inform a recommendation with regard to the optimal timing of nonculprit vessel PCI. Additional trial data that will help further clarify this issue are awaited. Issues related to the optimal method of evaluating nonculprit lesions (eg, percent diameter stenosis, fractional flow reserve) are beyond the scope of this focused update. (See Section 5.5.2 of the 2011 PCI guideline and Section 4.2 of the 2013 STEMI guideline for additional recommendations.) The 2011 PCI and 2013 STEMI guidelines' 9, 10 Class IIa recommendation for aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI was based on the results of 2 RCTs 29, 31, 32 and 1 meta-analysis 30 and was driven in large measure by the results of TAPAS (Thrombus Aspiration During Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study), a single-center study that randomized 1071 patients with STEMI to aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI or primary PCI only. 29, 32 Three multicenter trials, 2 of which enrolled significantly more patients than prior aspiration thrombectomy trials, have prompted reevaluation of this recommendation. In the INFUSE-AMI (Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction) trial 37 of 452 patients with anterior STEMI due to proximal or mid-left anterior descending occlusion, infarct size was not reduced by aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI. The TASTE (Thrombus Aspiration During ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial (n=7244) incorporated a unique design that allowed randomization within an existing national registry, resulting in enrollment of a remarkably high proportion of eligible patients. 34, 36 No significant 30-day or 1-year differences were found between the group that received aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI and the group that received primary PCI only with regard to death, reinfarction, stent thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, or a composite of major adverse cardiac events. The TOTAL (Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI) trial randomized 10,732 patients with STEMI to aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI or primary PCI only. 35 Bailout thrombectomy was performed in 7.1% of the primary PCI–only group, whereas the rate of crossover from aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI to primary PCI only was 4.6%. There were no differences between the 2 treatment groups, either in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, cardiogenic shock, or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure at 180 days, or in the individual components of the primary endpoint, stent thrombosis, or target-vessel revascularization. There was a small but statistically significant increase in the rate of stroke in the aspiration thrombectomy group. An updated meta-analysis that included these 3 trials among a total of 17 trials (n=20 960) found no significant reduction in death, reinfarction, or stent thrombosis with routine aspiration thrombectomy. Aspiration thrombectomy was associated with a small but nonsignificant increase in the risk of stroke. 33 Several previous studies have found that higher thrombus burden in patients with STEMI is independently associated with higher risks of distal embolization, no-reflow phenomenon, transmural myocardial necrosis, major adverse cardiac events, stent thrombosis, and death. 38-42 However, subgroup analyses from the TASTE and TOTAL trials did not suggest relative benefit from aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI in patients with higher thrombus burden or in patients with initial Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0–1 or left anterior descending artery/anterior infarction. 34, 35 On the basis of the results of these studies, the prior Class IIa recommendation for aspiration thrombectomy has been changed. Routine aspiration thrombectomy before primary PCI is now not recommended (Class III: No Benefit, LOE A). There are insufficient data to assess the potential benefit of a strategy of selective or bailout aspiration thrombectomy (Class IIb, LOE C-LD). \"Bailout\" aspiration thrombectomy is defined as thrombectomy that was initially unplanned but was later used during the procedure because of unsatisfactory initial result or procedural complication, analogous to the definition of \"bailout\" glycoprotein IIb/IIIa use. It should be noted that the preceding recommendations and text apply only to aspiration thrombectomy; no clinical benefit for routine rheolytic thrombectomy has been demonstrated in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. 30, 43, 44 Presidents and Staff American College of Cardiology Kim A.

Advances in echocardiography can overcome most limitations of conventional imaging modalities and provide successful completion of each step of any catheter-based treatment. Echocardiography's unique characteristics rendered it the ideal technique for percutaneous catheter-based procedures.

Renewed interest in federally funded clinical research makes it timely to propose a comprehensive research agenda that, with its associated rationale, will attract public funds for research into child cardiovascular health and disease. Recent findings We propose here a comprehensive pediatric cardiology research agenda consisting of 22 topics and associated research questions. We describe the following five topics in more detail: the need for life-course studies of pediatric cardiac disease and epigenetic factors for later onset of cardiovascular effects; the need to study cardiometabolic disease risk in children; recent pediatric cardiology clinical trials and observational studies; the need to explore the role of physical activity in preventing and treating pediatric cardiology patients; and the need to develop and implement evidence-based interventions to manage pediatric cardiovascular problems. Summary If the field of pediatric cardiology can adopt a comprehensive research agenda that identifies the most-needed studies, then research could be better coordinated, long-term and collaborative studies would be more readily organized and funded, and the overall financial and scientific efficiency of research in pediatric cardiology would be improved. Targeted research efforts are more likely to realize potential breakthroughs in areas such as genetic and epigenetic screening, biomarkers, cardioprotective strategies, life-course studies, long-term monitoring technologies, environmental influences on disease, evidence-based practice guidelines, and more rapid and safer development of drugs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0b013e32832e48df", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2035843644", "source": "openalex"}

In clinical trials (IMPACT‐II and ESPRIT) concomitant administration of eptifibatide to patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduced thrombotic complications. In the PURSUIT trial, in patients with non‐ST‐elevation acute coronary syndromes, eptifibatide, compared to placebo, significantly reduced the primary endpoint of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days. In patients with STEMI eptifibatide has been studied as an adjunct to fibrinolysis and primary PCI; it improved epicardial flow and tissue reperfusion.

Cardiac causes are rarely found despite expenditure of considerable time and resources. We describe validation throughout New England of a clinical guideline for cost-effective evaluation of pediatric patients first seen by a cardiologist for chest pain using a unique methodology termed the Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plans (SCAMPs).A total of 1016 ambulatory patients, ages 7 to 21 years initially seen for chest pain at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) or the New England Congenital Cardiology Association (NECCA) practices, were evaluated by using a SCAMPs chest pain guideline. Findings were analyzed for diagnostic elements, patterns of care, and compliance with the guideline. Results from the NECCA practices were compared with those of Boston Children's Hospital, a regional core academic center.Two patients had chest pain due to a cardiac etiology, 1 with pericarditis and 1 with an anomalous coronary artery origin. Testing performed outside of guideline recommendations demonstrated only incidental findings. Patients returning for persistent symptoms did not have cardiac disease. The pattern of care for the NECCA practices and BCH differed minimally.By using SCAMPs methodology, we have demonstrated that chest pain in children is rarely caused by heart disease and can be evaluated in the ambulatory setting efficiently and effectively using minimal resources. The methodology can be implemented regionally across a wide range of clinical practice settings and its approach can overcome a number of barriers that often limit clinical practice guideline implementation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-0086", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010420345", "source": "openalex"}

This study therefore aimed to evaluate incremental diagnostic value of tele-medicine at-home assessment in patients who called emergency medical service (EMS). Methods: A total of 27,841 consecutive EMS patients referred for suspected heart disease underwent ECG assessment with a mobile ECG-recorder device. ECGs were transmitted with mobile-phone support to a tele-cardiology ‘hub’ active 24/7 where a cardiologist read the ECGs. Rate of prevalence of AF, age of patients, and symptoms were analysed. Results: AF was diagnosed in 11.67% of patients who underwent ECG examination. Typical symptoms were complained by 6.56% of whole patients, only 14.05% of patients with AF: rate of subjects with AF and typical symptoms significantly decreased with age (&lt;65 years 29.58%, 65–75 years 17.06%, &gt;75 years 10.35%, p &lt; 0.001). Number needed to diagnose an AF with atypical presentation (number needed to treat) decreased from 45 (&lt;65 years) to 9 (65–75 years) and 5 (&gt;75 years) ( p &lt; 0.001). Tele-cardiology support increased the rate of at-home diagnosis of AF from two-fold (in 40-year-olds) up to four-fold (60-year-olds) and seven-fold (70-year-olds). Conclusions: AF with symptoms other than palpitations is a common finding in elderly EMS patients. Tele-cardiology support improves the sensitivity of diagnosis of AF in elderly EMS patients and is useful in at-home identification of subjects with AF and atypical presentation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1741826711406060", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148160186", "source": "openalex"}

Overall, the procedure rates were 3–10 times higher in the European than in the non-European ESC countries. Economic resources were not the only driver for utilization of arrhythmia therapies as in some Eastern European countries with relative low gross domestic product the procedure rates exceeded the average values. These data will help the healthcare professionals and stakeholders to identify and to understand in more depth the trends, disparities, and gaps in cardiac arrhythmia care and thereby promote harmonization of cardiac arrhythmias therapies in the ESC area.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euw244", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2491324736", "source": "openalex"}

Background Simulation based‐catheter training is a valuable tool to practice interventional procedures. Whether this type of training enhances the procedural skills of fellows learning percutaneous coronary interventions has never been studied. Methods Eighteen cardiology fellows were randomized either into the simulation‐based training (n = 9) or the control group (n = 9). The simulation group received 7.5 hours of virtual reality (VR) simulation training, whereas the control group attended 4.5 hours of lectures. Each participant had to perform a simple (pre‐evaluation) and a more complex (post‐evaluation) catheter intervention on a pulsatile coronary flow model in a catheterization laboratory. All procedures were videotaped, analyzed, and rated by 3 expert interventionalists, who were blinded to the randomization. To assess the individual performance level, a “skills score” was determined, comprising 14 performance characteristics (5‐level Likert scale, maximum score of 70 points). Results The “skills score” increased by 5.8 ± 6.1 points in the VR simulation group and decreased by 6.7 ± 8.4 in the control group (P = 0.003) from the simple stenosis at pre‐ to the more complex lesion at post‐evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of simulation‐based training. Conclusion This pilot study suggests that curriculum‐based mentored VR simulation training improves the performance level of cardiology fellows in coronary interventions. Further investigation to evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes is warranted.

As stated in the updated ESC HF guidelines, clinicians responsible for managing patients with AHF must frequently make treatment decisions without adequate evidence, usually on the basis of expert opinion consensus.2 Specifically, the treatment of acute HF remains largely opinion-based with little good evidence to guide therapy. Acute heart failure is a syndrome in which emergency physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, nurses, and other healthcare providers have to cooperate to provide ‘rapid’ benefit to the patients. We hereby would like to underscore the wider experience grown in different settings of the area of intensive care on acute heart failure, actually larger and more composite than that got in specialized Care Units. The distillate of such different experiences is discussed and integrated in the present document. Hence, the authors of this consensus paper believe a common working definition of AHF covering all dimensions and modes of presentations has to be made, with the understanding that most AHF presentations are either acute decompensations of chronic underlying HF or the abrupt onset of dyspnoea associated with significantly elevated blood pressure. Secondly, recent data show that, much like acute coronary syndrome, AHF might have a ‘time to therapy’ concept. Accordingly, ‘pre-hospital’ management is considered a critical component of care. Thirdly, most patients with AHF have normal or high blood pressure at presentation, and are admitted with symptoms and/or signs of congestion. This is in contradiction to the presentation where low cardiac output leads to symptomatic hypotension and signs/symptoms of hypoperfusion, a circumstance that is relatively rare, present in coronary care unit/intensive care unit (CCU/ICU) but associated with a particularly poor outcome. Hence, it is important to note that appropriate therapy requires appropriate identification of the specific AHF phenotype.3 The aim of the current paper is not to replace guidelines, but, to provide contemporary perspective for early hospital management within the context of the most recent data and to provide guidance, based on expert opinions, to practicing physicians and other healthcare professionals (Figure 1). We believe that the experience accrued in the different settings from the emergency department through to the ICU/CCU is collectivel valuable in determining how best to manage the patients with AHF. Herein, a shortened version mainly including group recommendations is provided.

A cardiology team supervised all network activities, using the Internet to keep in contact with remote health facilities. The network developed protocols for screening heart defects. Echocardiograms were performed by physicians under direct online supervision of a cardiologist; alternatively, a video recording of the examination was subsequently reviewed by a cardiologist. Cardiovascular surgeons came to a paediatric hospital in the state capital once a week to perform heart surgeries.Until 2011, the State of Paraíba had no structured programme to care for children with heart disease. This often resulted in missed or late diagnosis, with adverse health consequences for the children.From 2012 to 2014, 73,751 babies were screened for heart defects and 857 abnormalities were identified. Detection of congenital heart diseases increased from 4.09 to 11.62 per 1000 live births (P < 0.001). Over 6000 consultations and echocardiograms were supervised via the Internet. Time to diagnosis, transfers and hospital stays were greatly reduced. A total of 330 operations were carried out with 6.7% (22/330) mortality.Access to an echocardiography machine with remote supervision by a cardiologist improves the detection of congenital heart disease by neonatologists; virtual outpatient clinics facilitate clinical management; the use of Internet technology with simple screening techniques allows resources to be allocated more efficiently.Offrir une couverture médicale aux enfants atteints de cardiopathies congénitales reste un problème majeur dans les pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire.En octobre 2011, le gouvernement de l'État de Paraíba, au Brésil, a mis en place un réseau de cardiologie pédiatrique en partenariat avec l'organisation non gouvernementale Círculo do Coração. Une équipe de cardiologie a supervisé toutes les activités du réseau, en restant en contact avec les établissements de santé distants grâce à Internet. Le réseau a mis au point des protocoles pour détecter les malformations cardiaques. Des médecins ont réalisé des échocardiogrammes sous la supervision directe en ligne d'un cardiologue; dans d'autres cas, un cardiologue a visionné l'enregistrement vidéo des examens. Des chirurgiens cardiovasculaires se sont rendus une fois par semaine dans un hôpital pédiatrique de la capitale de l'État afin de pratiquer des interventions de chirurgie cardiaque.Jusqu'en 2011, l'État de Paraíba n'avait pas de programme structuré de prise en charge des enfants atteints de cardiopathies. Cela entraînait souvent des diagnostics erronés ou tardifs, qui avaient des conséquences négatives sur la santé des enfants.De 2012 à 2014, 73 751 bébés ont fait l'objet d'un examen visant à détecter des malformations cardiaques; 957 ont été découvertes. La détection de cardiopathies congénitales est passée de 4,09 à 11,62 pour 1000 naissances vivantes (P < 0,001). Plus de 6000 consultations et échocardiogrammes ont été supervisés via Internet. Les délais de diagnostic, les transferts et les séjours à l'hôpital ont été fortement réduits. Un total de 330 opérations a été pratiqué, avec un taux de mortalité de 6,7% (22/330).L'accès à un échocardiographe avec supervision à distance par un cardiologue améliore la détection des cardiopathies congénitales par les néonatologistes; les cliniques ambulatoires virtuelles facilitent la prise en charge clinique; l'utilisation d'Internet associée à des techniques de détection simples permet une affectation plus efficace des ressources.Proporcionar atención sanitaria a los niños con cardiopatías congénitas sigue siendo uno de los principales desafíos en los países de ingresos bajos y medios.En octubre de 2011, el Gobierno de Paraíba, Brasil, estableció una red de cardiología pediátrica en asociación con la organización no gubernamental Círculo do Coração. Un equipo de cardiología supervisó todas las actividades de la red mediante el uso de Internet para mantenerse en contacto con los centros sanitarios remotos. La red desarrolló protocolos para revisar defectos cardíacos. Los médicos llevaron a cabo ecocardiogramas bajo la directa supervisión online por parte de un cardiólogo; como alternativa, un cardiólogo podía revisar la grabación del examen posteriormente. Los cirujanos cardiovasculares acudían al hospital pediátrico de la capital una vez por semana para llevar a cabo cirugías cardíacas.Hasta 2011, el Estado de Paraíba no contaba con un programa estructurado para tratar a los niños con enfermedades cardíacas. Esto se traducía en diagnósticos erróneos o tardíos, con consecuencias adversas en la salud de los niños.De 2012 a 2014, se examinaron 73.751 bebés en busca de defectos cardiacos y se identificaron 957 anomalías. La detección de enfermedades cardíacas congénitas subió de 4,09 a 11,62 por cada 1.000 nacimientos (P<0,001). Se supervisaron más de 6.000 consultas y ecocardiogramas a través de Internet. Se redujeron considerablemente los tiempos de diagnóstico, traslado y estancias hospitalarias. Se llevaron a cabo 330 operaciones con un 6,7% (22/330) de mortalidad.El acceso a una máquina de ecocardiogramas con supervisión remota por parte de un cardiólogo mejora la detección de enfermedades cardíacas congénitas por parte de neonatólogos; las clínicas ambulatorias virtuales facilitan la gestión clínica; el uso de Internet con simples técnicas de revisión permite que los recursos se distribuyan con mayor eficacia.يظل تقديم الرعاية الصحية للأطفال الذين يعانون من أمراض القلب الخلقية يمثل تحديًا رئيسيًا في البلدان منخفضة ومتوسطة الدخل.أنشأت حكومة بارايبا، في البرازيل شبكة لعلاج أمراض القلب لدى الأطفال بالشراكة مع المنظمة غير الحكومية Círculo do Coração في أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2011. وأشرف فريق أمراض القلب على جميع الأنشطة التي تجريها هذه الشبكة، مع الاستعانة بالإنترنت لاستمرار الاتصال بالمنشآت الصحية النائية. وقد وضعت الشبكة بروتوكولات لفحص عيوب القلب. وتم إجراء عمليات رسم القلب بالموجات فوق الصوتية على يد بعض الأطباء تحت الإشراف المباشر لمختص بأمراض القلب عبر الإنترنت؛ وبديلًا عن ذلك تم اللجوء لمراجعة الفحص بعد تسجيله بالفيديو في وقت لاحق على يد طبيب مختص بأمراض القلب. وقد حضر بعض من جراحي القلب والأوعية الدموية إلى إحدى مستشفيات الأطفال بالولاية العاصمة مرة كل أسبوع لإجراء جراحات القلب.لم يتوفر في ولاية بارايبا حتى عام 2011 أي هيكل منظم لبرنامج يعمل على تقديم الرعاية الصحية للأطفال الذين يعانون من أمراض القلب. وقد نتج عن ذلك في أغلب الأحيان افتقار الحالات إلى التشخيص أو تأخره، إلى جانب حدوث آثار سلبية على الصحة لدى الأطفال.تم فحص 73751 رضيعًا للتأكد من وجود عيوب بالقلب وتم تحديد 957 حالة من الاختلال، وذلك في الفترة بين عامي 2012 و2014. وزادت نسبة اكتشاف الحالات المصابة بأمراض القلب الخلقية من 4.09 إلى 11.62 بين كل 1000 مولود على قيد الحياة (الاحتمال < 0.001). وتم الإشراف على ما يزيد عن 6000 استشارة طبية ورسم للقلب بالموجات فوق الصوتية عبر الإنترنت. وقلت إلى حد كبير المدة التي يستغرقها التشخيص ونقل المرضى للمستشفيات وإقامتهم بها. وتم إجراء عدد من الجراحات بإجمالي يبلغ 330 جراحة، بلغت نسبة الوفيات بها 6.7% (22/330).إن الاستفادة من جهاز رسم القلب بالموجات فوق الصوتية تحت إشراف مختص في أمراض القلب عن بُعد أدى إلى رفع مستوى اكتشاف أمراض القلب الخلقية على يد مختصي طب الأطفال حديثي الولادة؛ كما أن العيادات الخارجية الافتراضية تُيسِّر من الإدارة السريرية؛ فضلًا عن أن استخدام تقنية الإنترنت فيما يتعلق بأساليب الفحص البسيطة يتيح تخصيص الموارد على نحو أكثر فعالية.在低收入和中等收入国家，为患有先天性心脏病的儿童提供医疗保健服务仍然是一项重大挑战。.在 2011 年 10 月，巴西帕拉伊巴州政府与非政府组织 Círculo do Coração 合作，创立了儿科心脏病网络。心脏病学团队使用互联网与远程医疗设施保持联系，监督所有的网络活动。该网络制定出筛查心脏缺陷的协议。内科医生直接在心脏病专家的在线监督下完成超声波心动图；或者随后由心脏病专家审查检查的视频录像。心血管外科医生一周来州立儿科医院一次，进行心脏手术。.在 2011 年之前，帕拉伊巴州没有具备组织性的项目来关怀患有心脏病的儿童。这经常导致错过或延误诊断，给孩子的健康带来不利的结果。.从 2012 年至 2014 年，73751 名婴儿被筛查出具有心脏缺陷，且鉴定出 957 例畸形。先天性心脏病的检测从每 1000 名新生儿中 4.09 增加至至 11.62 (P < 0.001)。超过 6000 例咨询和超声波心动图通过互联网监督。诊断时间、转移和住院天数均大大降低。共进行了 330 例手术，死亡率为 6.7% (22/330)。.通过使用心脏病专家远程监督的超声波心动描记术机器，改进新生儿学专家对先天性心脏病的检测；虚拟门诊促进了临床管理；利用含简单筛查技术的互联网技术，可实现更高效的资源分配。.Обеспечение медико-санитарного обслуживания для детей с врожденными заболеваниями сердца остается одной из серьезных проблем в странах с низким и средним уровнем дохода.В октябре 2011 года правительство штата Параиба, Бразилия, создало сеть детской кардиологии в сотрудничестве с неправительственной организацией Círculo do Coração. Группа кардиологов осуществляла надзор над всей деятельностью сети, используя Интернет для связи с отдаленными лечебными учреждениями. Сеть разработала протоколы для выявления нарушения сердечной деятельности. Врачи выполняли эхокардиографию под непосредственным контролем кардиологов в режиме онлайн; в качестве альтернативы велась видеозапись обследования, которую затем просматривал кардиолог. Раз в неделю для проведения операций на сердце в педиатрическую больницу столицы штата приезжали врачи, специализирующиеся на сердечно-сосудистой хирургии.До 2011 года в штате Параиба отсутствовала структурированная программа лечения детей с заболеваниями сердца. Из-за этого диагноз ребенку часто не ставился или ставился с опозданием, что приводило к неблагоприятным последствиям для его здоровья.В период с 2012 по 2014 год было проведено обследование 73 751 ребенка с целью выявления заболеваний сердца, в результате которого было обнаружено 957 отклонений. Количество выявленных врожденных заболеваний сердца выросло с 4,09 до 11,62 на 1 000 живорожденных младенцев (P < 0,001). С помощью Интернета было проведено более 6000 консультаций и процедур эхокардиографии под наблюдением специалистов. Время постановки диагноза, количество перемещений пациентов и время их пребывания в больнице значительно сократились. В общей сложности было проведено 330 операций, причем уровень смертности составил 6,7% (22 случая из 330).Возможность использования эхокардиографа при дистанционной консультации кардиолога позволяет неонатологам выявить больше врожденных заболеваний сердца; виртуальные амбулатории содействуют клиническому лечению; использование интернет-технологий в сочетании с простыми методиками скринингового обследования позволяет более эффективно распределять ресурсы.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.14.148874", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2264443286", "source": "openalex"}

The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with >100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/str.0000000000000211", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2982303713", "source": "openalex"}

Fetal cardiology today raises special needs in screening programs, training of the involved staff, and allocations of services. Due to the increased detection rate and to the substantial number of terminations, the reduced incidence of CHD at birth can affect the workload of centers of pediatric cardiology and surgery. In utero transportation and competition among centers may change the area of referral in favor of the best centers. Echocardiography is a powerful means to diagnose and to guide lifesaving medical treatment of sustained tachyarrhythmias in the fetus. Prenatal diagnosis not only improves the preoperative conditions in most cases but also postoperative morbidity and mortality in selected types of CHD. Intrauterine transcatheter valvuloplasty in severe outflow obstructive lesions has been disappointing so far and this technique remains investigational, until its benefits are determined by controlled trials. Prenatal diagnosis allows counselling of families which are better prepared for the foreseeable management and outcome of the fetus. These benefits can reduce the risks of litigation for missed ultrasound diagnosis. As increased costs can be expected in institutions dealing with a large number of fetal CHD, the administrators of these institutions should receive protected funds, proportional to their needs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2459/01.jcm.0000247429.28957.80", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063255608", "source": "openalex"}

The post-cardiac arrest period is often marked by hemodynamic instability as well as metabolic abnormalities. Support and treatment of acute myocardial dysfunction and acute myocardial ischemia can increase the probability of survival. Interventions to reduce secondary brain injury, such as therapeutic hypothermia, can improve survival and neurological recovery. Every organ system is at risk during this period, and patients are at risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction. The comprehensive treatment of diverse problems after cardiac arrest involves multidisciplinary aspects of critical care, cardiology, and neurology. For this reason, it is important to admit patients to appropriate critical-care units with a prospective plan of care to anticipate, monitor, and treat each of these diverse problems. It is also important to appreciate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different tools for estimating the prognosis of patients after cardiac arrest.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.110.971002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141167900", "source": "openalex"}

The recommendations are intended to guide decision making but do not replace clinical judgment. We highlight the core concepts of the guidelines that rest on widespread consensus, discuss controversial aspects, and suggest a potential middle ground for clinicians and patients struggling with how to proceed in the midst of the controversy.Core ConceptsValue of the Art of MedicineThe new guidelines value the art of medicine in that they allow room for individualizing primary prevention on the basis of shared decision making between the patient and clinician. When one is considering whether to initiate a statin for primary prevention in adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year risk for myocardial infarction or stroke of 5% or greater, the guidelines advise that patients and clinicians engage in a “risk discussion.” Such a discussion can address potential benefits and harms of statin therapy, drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences. Along these lines, we previously suggested consideration of the “5 Ps” (3): preference, precision, participation, potency, and price (Table).Table. The 5 PsEncouraging greater patient–provider dialogue is a virtue of the new guidelines, but finding time for these risk discussions will be challenging. We suspect that nearly an entire visit, or perhaps several visits, will need to be dedicated to this purpose. Careful discussion will be critical to clinical decision making, particularly in patients with prior statin intolerance and elderly patients with greater propensity for drug–drug interactions and competing risks. Even when high-quality evidence is available, the art of medicine still matters. In fact, the more we learn, the finer an art it becomes.Statins as First-Line Pharmacologic TherapySeveral classes of drugs decrease atherogenic cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk (4). In 2001, the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline recommended a statin, bile acid sequestrant, or nicotinic acid (4). Since then, efficacy and safety data have accumulated for statins, with trial data from more than 170 000 patients representing various populations (5). Generic high-intensity statins have also become available. The new guidelines strongly recommend statins as first-line pharmacologic therapy. Furthermore, they advise clinicians to prioritize efforts to maximize statin dose and to try alternative statins or dosing regimens in patients with intolerance.Expanding the Scope of PreventionThe new guidelines expand the scope of prevention from coronary heart disease to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Adding stroke to the risk calculator created a challenge because stroke is not uniformly atherosclerotic in origin; however, the guidelines succeeded in incorporating it. This expansion should help unite primary care providers, cardiologists, neurologists, and gynecologists in addressing the shared risk factors of cerebrovascular and coronary disease and their common pathophysiologic pathway: atherosclerosis.Areas of ControversyAccuracy of Risk AssessmentThe most controversial aspect of the new guidelines is the inclusion of a new calculator for 10-year risk for myocardial infarction or stroke based on 4 cohort studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (1). During the development of the guideline, calculator validation in 2 external cohorts yielded c-statistics ranging from 0.56 to 0.77, with systematic overestimation of risk. After its release, some clinicians began testing the calculator and questioning its clinical accuracy. Compounding concern, examination of the calculator's performance in 3 additional cohorts showed a 75% to 150% overestimation of risk (6). Future studies should clarify reasons for overestimation and evaluate refinements to the calculator.To manage potential limitations of the risk calculator, a reasonable middle ground might be to expand the definition of intermediate risk from a range of 5.0% to 7.5% to a range of 5% to 15%. Patients falling in this range who desire greater certainty could then consider their family history or coronary artery calcium score to refine risk assessment. For example, the Canadian guidelines double the estimated risk if a family history of premature cardiovascular disease is present (first-degree relative aged <60 years) (7). A coronary artery calcium score of 0 portends a favorable 10-year prognosis, and a score of 100 or greater signifies a risk level that approximates that in persons who have already had an event (8).Abandonment of Lipid GoalsUnlike Adult Treatment Panel III and recent European and Canadian guidelines, the new recommendations do not target fixed LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) goals. Rather, they recommend lipid measurement at baseline, 1 to 3 months after statin initiation, and yearly thereafter to check for the expected percentage decrease of LDL-C levels (30% to 45% with a moderate-intensity statin and ≥50% with a high-intensity statin). The guideline panel considered only selected randomized, controlled trials and concluded that treatment targets are not “evidence-based.” However, true evidence-based medicine is “the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients” (9). Therefore, a truly evidence-based approach may be to synthesize randomized evidence with other lines of evidence, which supports selective use of LDL-C or non–HDL-C targets in high-risk adults.Strict devotion to lipid targets might inadvertently lead to withholding treatment in high-risk patients with favorable baseline lipid levels or unnecessary addition of nonstatin drugs. Still, some experts maintain that lipid targets can also enhance care when applied during follow-up in high-risk patients. Indeed, LDL-C goals were part of the expressed strategy in landmark secondary prevention trials (TNT [Treating to New Targets], COURAGE [Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation], and AIM-HIGH [Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes]).In addition, some studies, such as AIM-HIGH and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) (10), suggest possible benefit of add-on therapy for patients with high triglyceride levels and low HDL-C levels, which are markers of remnant lipoprotein cholesterol. A follow-up non–HDL-C goal could guide the treatment of these patients. In fact, add-on therapy to optimize atherogenic cholesterol levels in high-risk patients is compatible with the guideline advice for familial hyperlipidemia that “nonstatin cholesterol-lowering medications are often needed to lower LDL-C to acceptable levels” (2). Our view is that risk- and lipid-based paradigms are not mutually exclusive and could be complementary. At baseline, obtaining the most accurate assessment of risk is crucial in deciding whom to treat, whereas in follow-up, lipid measurements can serve as a marker of therapeutic response, promote adherence, motivate lifestyle improvements, and guide discussions about add-on pharmacologic therapy for patients who are clearly established as high-risk.ConclusionThe 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment and cholesterol treatment guidelines emphasize important core concepts to rally behind. We intend our perspective to be a springboard for more detailed discussions on how best to implement and enhance the optimum care of individual patients. A patient's risk estimate is now the number to know rather than his or her LDL-C level, unless the LDL-C level is 190 mg/dL or greater. We hope that the results of ongoing studies will help us determine whether aiming for a non–HDL-C target is more “evidence-based” than simply giving a statin once risk exceeds a threshold level.References1.

Keller, MD, MS, FACPNone10 March 2014 Should we be measuring statin blood concentrations? Patients who are at risk of adverse events due to atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) are treated with statins, which have been well-proved to reduce these risks. Until now, physicians were told to treat these patients to goals based on blood levels of LDL cholesterol. Now, we are told that the evidence does not support treating to LDL goals, but rather dictates that certain doses of statin be administered, based on the doses which were used in clinical trials. All medications work by some pharmacological effect. Prior guidelines were based on the assumption that lowering the LDL cholesterol concentration in the blood was the beneficial mechanism. This hypothesis implied that other types of medications should be as effective as statins at reducing adverse ASVD event rates, for equal degrees of LDL-lowering. If this has been disproved, then the new guidelines are reasonable to emphasize statin dose rather than LDL level as the treatment goal. However, we can and should strive to quantify and normalize our statin treatment for each patient. If the pharmacological benefit of statin therapy is caused by the concentration of the statin in the blood, rather than by blood LDL levels, we should be measuring and monitoring statin levels now, instead of LDL levels. Otherwise, we are treating patients blindly. A given dose of a statin will result in very different blood concentrations of that statin in different individuals, depending on their renal and hepatic functions, their body mass, their cytochrome genetics, and on other factors. To account for these differences in each unique patient, blood statin concentrations would seem to be required to most precisely maximize the benefits and minimize the risks for each patient.

Data Sources: Pertinent articles related to the etiology, risk factors, and preventive strategies were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966–March 2007) using the MeSH terms atrial fibrillation, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac surgery, etiology, neurohormonal, sympathetic, volume, fluid, inflammation, risk factors, operative, pacing, β-adrenergic blockers, amiodarone, sotalol, calcium-channel blockers, magnesium, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, fatty acids, PUFA, steroids, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles evaluated were limited to human studies, published in the English language, with a Jadad score greater than 3. References of identified articles were reviewed for additional pertinent articles. Data Synthesis: Post-CTS atrial fibrillation most commonly occurs on the second or third postoperative day, with an incidence of 20–50%. Etiology theories include neurohormonal activation, volume overload, and inflammation. Studies examining nonpharmacologic therapies have shown that maintenance of the anterior epicardial fat pad is not a viable prophylactic strategy. Biatrial cardiac pacing, especially in combination with amiodarone, is a viable preventive option. Withdrawal of preoperative β-blockers places patients at higher risk for atrial fibrillation; these drugs should be continued postoperatively. Evidence exists supporting the use of amiodarone, sotalol, and magnesium in addition to β-blockers. Since most of these strategies work by attenuating neurohormonal activation, adverse events, including hypotension and bradycardia, are of concern. Adding agents with antiinflammatory properties, including hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or corticosteroids, may prove to be of benefit. Additional studies using novel therapies are needed in addition to established preventive strategies. Conclusions: Available evidence supports the continuation of preoperative β-blockers, as well as prophylactic amiodarone, sotalol, and magnesium. Other novel therapies, mostly targeting inflammation, are under investigation and may provide additional strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1h594", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138470527", "source": "openalex"}

It is foreseeable that RT-3D TEE will have the most clinical utility in the following 5 years. This review summarises the current development and clinical applications of RT-3D TEE for the guidance of percutaneous cardiac interventions, as well as surgical planning and subsequent follow-up of valvular repair and replacement. 3D TEE was developed approximately 25 years ago with the aim of providing additional anatomical detail and improved spatial relationships, not previously seen with transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography. Until the introduction of the matrix TEE probe 2 years ago, 3D TEE was performed with a multiplane probe using a rotational approach for sequential data acquisition, gated to ECG and respiration. From a transesophageal fixed acoustic window, 2D images were collected at small angular increments, post-processed offline and converted into a Cartesian coordinate system to obtain conical volume datasets. From these data, any desired cut-plane could be derived and structures of interest rendered. Unfortunately, this methodology was limited by the need for multiple image sampling resulting in lengthy data acquisition times and frequent radial artifacts. As a consequence, this methodology has not been routinely embraced in clinical practice and was predominantly used for research purposes. To overcome these limitations and introduce …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/hrt.2009.190025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140368229", "source": "openalex"}

Affected patients often experience severe exertional dyspnea and debilitating fatigue, as well as poor quality of life, frequent hospitalizations, and a high mortality rate. Until recently, most pharmacological intervention trials for HFpEF yielded neutral primary outcomes. In contrast, trials of exercise-based interventions have consistently demonstrated large, significant, clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms, objectively determined exercise capacity, and usually quality of life. This success may be attributed, at least in part, to the pleiotropic effects of exercise, which may favorably affect the full range of abnormalities—peripheral vascular, skeletal muscle, and cardiovascular—that contribute to exercise intolerance in HFpEF. Accordingly, this scientific statement critically examines the currently available literature on the effects of exercise-based therapies for chronic stable HFpEF, potential mechanisms for improvement of exercise capacity and symptoms, and how these data compare with exercise therapy for other cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, data reviewed herein demonstrate a comparable or larger magnitude of improvement in exercise capacity from supervised exercise training in patients with chronic HFpEF compared with those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, although Medicare reimbursement is available only for the latter group. Finally, critical gaps in implementation of exercise-based therapies for patients with HFpEF, including exercise setting, training modalities, combinations with other strategies such as diet and medications, long-term adherence, incorporation of innovative and more accessible delivery methods, and management of recently hospitalized patients are highlighted to provide guidance for future research.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001122", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4328051538", "source": "openalex"}

We sought to determine the performance of HCM Risk-SCD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles reporting on the prevalence of SCD within 5 years of evaluation in low, intermediate and high-risk patients as defined by the 2014 guidelines (predicted risk &lt;4%, 4%–&lt;6% and ≥6%, respectively). Methods The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42017064203). MEDLINE and manual searches for papers published from October 2014 to December 2017 were performed. Longitudinal, observational cohorts of unselected adult patients, without history of cardiac arrest were considered. The original HCM Risk-SCD development study was included a priori. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Results Six (0.9%) out of 653 independent publications identified by the initial search were included. The calculated 5-year risk of SCD was reported in 7291 individuals (70% low, 15% intermediate; 15% high risk) with 184 (2.5%) SCD endpoints within 5 years of baseline evaluation. Most SCD endpoints (68%) occurred in patients with an estimated 5-year risk of ≥4% who formed 30% of the total study cohort. Using the random effects method, the pooled prevalence of SCD endpoints was 1.01% (95% CI 0.52 to 1.61) in low-risk patients, 2.43% (95% CI 1.23 to 3.92) in intermediate and 8.4% (95% CI 6.68 to 10.25) in high-risk patients. Conclusions This meta-analysis demonstrates that HCM Risk-SCD provides accurate risk estimations that can be used to guide ICD therapy in accordance with the 2014 ESC guidelines.

Of these 86 were included and screened for mental disorder with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) psychosis screening, the Clock Drawing Test, and the WHO-5 Well-being Index. The cardiologists were asked to rate the severity of somatic and mental problems in each patient on visual analogue scales (VAS-som and VAS-men). The current treatments, including psychiatric and psychological treatments, were noted, and the survival was followed for 3 years. Of the 86 patients included, 34 (40%) had a diagnosis of mental disorder. Eleven (12.8%) had major depression, six (7.0%) minor depression, six (7.0%) anxiety disorder, two unspecified somatoform disorder, seven (8.1%) dementia, one alcohol abuse and one psychosis. Three of the patients were in long-term psychopharmacological treatment. Although the cardiologists predicted mental disorder significantly better than chance, none of the patients was in relevant treatment for their mental disorder. At 3-year follow-up, 20 (24%) of the patients had died. Age and severity of heart disease predicted mortality, while the presence of a mental disorder did not. Mental disorders, especially depression, were frequent in cardiology outpatients.

Currently, stents are implanted to prevent immediate vascular recoil and elution of an antimitotic drug from the stent struts minimizes restenosis. An unwanted side‐effect of this drug elution is delayed re‐endothelialization which requires treatment with two anti‐platelet drugs, in many cases for a minimum of 1 year to prevent acute in‐stent thrombosis. Advances in stent design and drug elution technology, now in its fourth generation, have not abated this issue. Nanotechnology‐based local drug delivery has the potential to achieve restenosis prevention while not impeding endothelial healing. Molecularly targeted drugs can be aimed to specifically bind to epitopes in the injured media and adventitia. Thus, endothelial healing may progress unhindered. To prevent restenosis, this technology may be used with bare metal or biodegradable stents. In this article novel nanoparticulate agents will be compared regarding their potential to deliver drugs to molecular targets within the vascular wall. Potential molecular targets, targeting mechanisms, drug‐delivery propensities, and biocompatibility will be reviewed.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) were created to standardize preoperative cardiology consultation and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This study's purpose is to determine if these practices are over used and delay time to surgery at a safety net hospital. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level 1 trauma center and safety net hospital. Patients: Charts were reviewed for indications of preoperative cardiology consultation or TTE per AHA and ACC CPG in 412 patients admitted with geriatric hip fracture. Intervention: Criteria meeting the AHA/ACC guidelines for preoperative TTE and cardiac consultations. Main Outcome Measurements: Time to surgical intervention. Results: Despite 17.7% of patients meeting criteria, 44.4% of patients received cardiology consultation. Of those patients, 33.8% met criteria for receiving preoperative TTE but 89.4% received one. Time to surgery was greater for patients receiving cardiology consultation (25.42 ± 14.54 hours, P -value &lt;0.001) versus those who did not (19.27 ± 13.76, P -value &lt;0.001) and for those receiving preoperative TTE (26.00 ± 15.33 hours, P -value &lt;0.001) versus those who did not (18.94 ± 12.92, P -value &lt;0.001). Conclusions: Cardiology consultation and TTE are frequently used against AHA/ACC CPG. These measures are expensive and delay surgery, which can increase morbidity and mortality. These findings persisted despite limited resources available in a safety net hospital. Hospitals should improve adherence to CPG, or modify protocols. Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level II.

Position Paper of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Heart", "text": "Despite advances in myocardial reperfusion therapies, acute myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury and consequent ischaemic heart failure represent the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized societies. Although different therapeutic interventions have been shown beneficial in preclinical settings, an effective cardioprotective or regenerative therapy has yet to be successfully introduced in the clinical arena. Given the complex pathophysiology of the ischaemic heart, large scale, unbiased, global approaches capable of identifying multiple branches of the signalling networks activated in the ischaemic/reperfused heart might be more successful in the search for novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets. High-throughput techniques allow high-resolution, genome-wide investigation of genetic variants, epigenetic modifications, and associated gene expression profiles. Platforms such as proteomics and metabolomics (not described here in detail) also offer simultaneous readouts of hundreds of proteins and metabolites. Isolated omics analyses usually provide Big Data requiring large data storage, advanced computational resources and complex bioinformatics tools. The possibility of integrating different omics approaches gives new hope to better understand the molecular circuitry activated by myocardial ischaemia, putting it in the context of the human 'diseasome'. Since modifications of cardiac gene expression have been consistently linked to pathophysiology of the ischaemic heart, the integration of epigenomic and transcriptomic data seems a promising approach to identify crucial disease networks. Thus, the scope of this Position Paper will be to highlight potentials and limitations of these approaches, and to provide recommendations to optimize the search for novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets for acute ischaemia/reperfusion injury and ischaemic heart failure in the post-genomic era.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvx070", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2607712273", "source": "openalex"}

The emergence of novel technologies from cardiothoracic surgery and interventional cardiology are welcome developments in the light of an overwhelming chronic disease burden. However, as these complementary yet often competing disciplines rely on expensive technologies, hastily prepared resource plans threaten to consume a substantial proportion of limited healthcare resources. By describing procedural and professional trends as well as current and emerging technologies, this review aims to provide useful knowledge to help managers make informed decisions for the planning of cardiovascular disease management. Since their inception, developments in both specialties have been very rapid. Owing to differences in patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes, results of studies comparing cardiothoracic surgery and interventional cardiology have been conflicting. Outcomes for both specialties continue to improve through the years. Despite the persistent demand for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) as a rescue procedure following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), there is a widening gap between the numbers of PCI and CABG. Procedural volumes seem to have affected career choices of physicians. Emerging technologies from both disciplines are eagerly awaited by the medical community. For long-term planning of both disciplines, conventional health technology assessment methods are of limited use due to their rapid developments. In the absence of established prediction tools, planners should tap alternative sources of evidence such as changes in disease epidemiology, procedural volumes, horizon scan reports as well as trends in disease outcomes.

METHODS: A series of 557 patients who suffered cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) at the Dante Pazzanese Cardiology Institute over a period of 5 years was analyzed to examine factors predicting successful resuscitation and long-term survival. RESULTS: Ressuscitation maneuvers were tried in 536 patients; 281 patients (52.4%) died immediately, and 164 patients (30.6%) survived for than 24 hours. The 87 patients who survived for more than 1 month after CRA were compared with nonsurvivors. Coronary disease, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disease had a better prognosis. Primary arrhythmia occurred in 73.5% of the >1-month survivor group and heart failure occurred in 12.6% of this group. In those patients in whom the initial mechanism of CRA was ventricular fibrillation, 33.3% survived for more than 1 month, but of those with ventricular asystole only 4.3% survived. None of the 10 patients with electromechanical dissociation survived. There was worse prognosis in patients included in the extreme age groups (zero to 10 years and 70 years or more).

When standard echocardiography (SE) was specifically indicated on the basis of clinical history, electrocardiogram and physical examination, the same cardiologist (level-2 or level-3 trained) immediately performed an HCU examination. The cardiologist then reassessed the clinical situation to confirm or cancel the SE request according to the information provided by HCU. The SE examination was performed by a sonographer and examined in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist expert in echocardiography. Findings from the two examinations were compared.HCU was performed in 108/222 patients, and a definite diagnosis was established in 34 of them (31%), making SE examination potentially avoidable. In the 74 patients with inconclusive HCU results and for whom SE was still indicated, the decision was mainly dictated by the lack of spectral Doppler modality in the HCU system. The overall agreement between HCU and SE for diagnosis of normal/abnormal echocardiograms was 73% (kappa = 0.4). On the basis of the potentially avoided SE examinations and the obviated need for a second cardiac consultation, a total cost saving of euro2142 per 100 patients referred for echocardiography was estimated.The use of a simple HCU device in the outpatient cardiology clinic allowed reliable diagnosis in one third of the patients referred for echocardiography, which translates into cost and time saving benefits.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/hrt.2006.094201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159242907", "source": "openalex"}

The European Union Medical Exposures Directive 97/43/Euroatom strongly recommend patient dosimetry in interventional radiology, including IC. IC patient radiation doses in four representative IC rooms in Croatia were investigated. Setting reference levels for these procedures have difficulties due to the large difference in procedure complexity. Nevertheless, it is important that some guideline values are available as a benchmark to guide the operators during these potentially high-dose procedures. Local and national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) were proposed as a guidance. A total of 138 diagnostic (coronary angiography, CA) and 151 therapeutic (PTCA, stenting) procedures were included. Patient irradiation was measured in terms of kerma–area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time (FT) and number of cine-frames (F). KAP was recorded using calibrated KAP-meters. DRLs of KAP, FT and F were calculated as third quartile values rounded up to the integer. Skin doses were assessed on a selected sample of high skin dose procedures, using radiochromic films, and peak skin doses (PSD) were presented. A relative large range of doses in IC was detected. National DRLs were proposed as follows: 32 Gy cm2, 6.6 min and 610 frames for CA and 72 Gy cm2, 19 min and 1270 frames for PTCA. PSD <1 Gy were measured in 72 % and PSD >2 Gy in 8 % of selected patients. Measuring the patient doses in radiological procedures is required by law, but rarely implemented in Croatia. The doses recorded in the study are acceptable when compared with the literature, but optimisation is possible. The preliminary DRL values proposed may be used as a guideline for local departments, and should be a basis for radiation reduction measures and quality assurance programmes in IC in Croatia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/rpd/ncp237", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2074454517", "source": "openalex"}

The effect of AF on long-term outcomes, including mortality and rehospitalization, among unselected HF patients hospitalized with HF in routine clinical practice in Japan was assessed in the present study. Methods and Results: The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) prospectively studied the characteristics and treatment strategies of a broad sample of patients hospitalized with worsening HF and the outcomes were followed with an average of 2.4 years of follow-up. The study cohort (n=2,659) was grouped according to the presence (n=937; 35.2%) or absence (n=1,722; 64.8%) of AF at baseline. After multivariable adjustment, patients with and without AF had a comparable risk for all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.931, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690-1.258, P=0.643), cardiac death (adjusted HR 0.949, 95%CI 0.655-1.377, P=0.784), rehospitalization because of the worsening HF (adjusted HR 1.028, 95%CI 0.816-1.295, P=0.816), and all-cause death or rehospitalization (adjusted HR 1.039, 95%CI 0.842-1.281, P=0.722). Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized for HF in Japan, AF was common, but was not an independent risk for long-term adverse outcomes, including death or rehospitalization, in routine clinical practice.

Both SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA were first studied as glucose-lowering drugs, which may have impeded uptake by cardiologists in the wake of proven cardiovascular efficacy. Their significant effect on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, which are largely independent of glucose-lowering effects, must drive a broader use of these drugs. Cardiologists are 3 times more likely than endocrinologists to see patients with both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, thus they are ideally positioned to share responsibility for SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA treatment with primary care providers. In order to increase adoption, SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA must be reframed as primarily cardiovascular and kidney disease risk-reducing agents with a side effect of glucose-lowering. Coordinated and multifaceted interventions engaging clinicians, patients, payers, professional societies, and health systems must be implemented to incentivize the adoption of these medications as part of routine cardiovascular and kidney care. Greater use of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA will improve outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.121.053766", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3178245457", "source": "openalex"}

The most diverse of these orders is the Squamata, which is further subdivided into Sauria (lizards), Amphisbaenia (amphisbaenians), and Ophidia (snakes). Snakes are a unique and very diverse group of reptiles that have become popular in zoological collections and in the pet trade. This popularity necessitates the veterinarian who treats reptiles to be familiar with snakes and their related medical conditions. Knowledge of the unique anatomy and physiology of these species is paramount for successful management of the ophidian patient. As with most reptilian patients, husbandry-related problems and infectious conditions are common. But as these conditions become less prevalent through proper husbandry and biosecurity, metabolic and degenerative disorders are beginning to be described more in snakes, including cardiovascular disorders. As reptilian medicine evolves, the responsible clinician will need to stay abreast of the growing knowledge of these disorders. This article is to serve as a literature review of cardiology as it applies to snakes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5818/1529-9651-27.1-2.62", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606554834", "source": "openalex"}

Global CVD risk assessment involves estimation of cardiovascular risk using a basic panel of risk factors. The Framingham Heart Study championed the first such risk scores, followed by others around the world. Most recently, the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) have been recommended in the United States as a starting point in CVD risk assessment. Persons at low (<5%) 10-year risk are generally recommended for lifestyle management only and those at highest (>20%) 10-year risk are recommended for both lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy to reduce risk. Assessing the presence of one or more \"risk enhancing\" factors is intended to inform the treatment decision in those at borderline (5-<7.5%) or intermediate (7.5–20%) risk, with the use of coronary calcium scores to further refine the treatment decision. Moreover, not all those with ASCVD are treated equal, and recent guidelines provide criteria for identifying those at very high risk. While current techniques best predict long-term risk of CVD events, biomarkers strategies are being developed to predict near-term events, and other imaging techniques such as coronary CT angiography and vascular MRI hold promise to identify vulnerable plaque. Validation and incorporating into clinical practice such state of the art techniques will be vital to moving CVD risk assessment to the next level.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2020.100008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3023278819", "source": "openalex"}

The patients' partners or direct relatives also participated in the study. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving the preventive treatment goals. Patients could enter from two sources. First, patients with chronic stable angina or acute coronary syndrome were recruited from hospitals. Second, patients at high risk for vascular events were recruited from general practices. Patients from the hospital followed a 16-week programme and those from general practices followed a 1-year programme. At the end of the respective programmes, the effect of the intervention was assessed.

We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 10‐year risk score would perform better than the FRS and the Reynolds Risk Score (RRS) in identifying RA patients known to have elevated cardiovascular risk based on high coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores. Methods Among 98 RA patients eligible for risk stratification using the ACC/AHA risk score, we identified 34 patients with high CAC (defined as ≥300 Agatston units or ≥75th percentile of expected coronary artery calcium for age, sex, and ethnicity) and compared the ability of the 10‐year FRS, RRS, and ACC/AHA risk scores to correctly assign these patients to an elevated risk category. Results All 3 risk scores were higher in patients with high CAC ( P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of patients with high CAC correctly assigned to the elevated risk category was similar among the 3 scores (FRS 32%, RRS 32%, ACC/AHA risk score 41%) ( P = 0.223). The C statistics for the FRS, RRS, and ACC/AHA risk score predicting the presence of high CAC were 0.65, 0.66, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusion The ACC/AHA 10‐year risk score does not offer any advantage compared to the traditional FRS and RRS in the identification of RA patients with elevated risk as determined by high CAC. The ACC/AHA risk score assigned almost 60% of patients with high CAC to a low risk category. Risk scores and standard risk prediction models used in the general population do not adequately identify many RA patients with elevated cardiovascular risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/art.38944", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125939871", "source": "openalex"}

However, its utility in reducing primary ischaemic events is more controversial; it appears to reduce the incidence of ischaemic stroke, but increase the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke. Aspirin therapy can also lead to an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and other haemorrhagic complications. Lower doses of aspirin are associated with a reduced risk of gastrointestinal side effects and are equally effective in reducing cardiovascular risk. Co-therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, clopidogrel or warfarin increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, while co-therapy with proton pump inhibitors reduces it.Both the benefits and risks need to be considered carefully when prescribing aspirin, particularly in primary prevention. Patients should be prescribed lower doses rather than higher doses of aspirin in line with prescribing guidelines. Co-prescription of a proton pump inhibitors may be necessary in patients at high risk for upper gastrointestinal complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01908.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107023533", "source": "openalex"}

Current guidelines on CVD suggest for healthy adults to perform at least 150 min/week of moderate intensity or 75 min/week of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity. The current review explores the effects of physical activity on some risk factors, specifically: diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and hyperuricemia. Physical activity induces an improvement in insulin sensitivity and in glucose control independently of weight loss, which may further contribute to ameliorate both diabetes-associated defects. The benefits of adherence to physical activity have recently proven to extend beyond surrogate markers of metabolic syndrome and diabetes by reducing hard endpoints such as mortality. In recent years, obesity has greatly increased in all countries. Weight losses in these patients have been associated with improvements in many cardiometabolic risk factors. Strategies against obesity included caloric restriction, however greater results have been obtained with association of diet and physical activity. Similarly, the beneficial effect of training on blood pressure via its action on sympathetic activity and on other factors such as improvement of endothelial function and reduction of oxidative stress can have played a role in preventing hypertension development in active subjects. The main international guidelines on prevention of CVD suggest to encourage and to increase physical activity to improve lipid pattern, hypertension and others cardiovascular risk factor. An active action is required to the National Society of Cardiology together with the Italian Society of Sports Cardiology to improve the prescription of organized physical activity in patients with CVD and/or cardiovascular risk factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000000855", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2969626175", "source": "openalex"}

However, this technique was plagued by multiple problems including the risk of acute occlusion of the vessel due to extensive dissection requiring emergency bypass surgery 1 . While late luminal enlargement and vascular remodelling could occur, more often constrictive vascular remodelling was the case instead, with consequent restenosis. The advent of bare metal stenting and the landmark BENESTENT trial have established bare metal stenting as the second revolution in interventional cardiology 2 . This technology provided a solution to acute vessel occlusion by sealing the dissection flaps and preventing recoil. The rate of subacute occlusion was reduced to 1.5%, making emergency by-pass surgery a rare occurrence, truly a thing of the past. Restenosis rates were further reduced from 32% to 22% at seven months, but this was still high, and neointimal hyperplasia still occurred, necessitating repeat revascularisation. Since the vessel was now caged with metal, late luminal enlargement and advantageous vascular remodelling no longer occurred. Another problem, namely that of late stent thrombosis, was also first described 3 . To solve the issue of in-stent restenosis - after the failure of brachytherapy - drug eluting stents were introduced. Indeed, the followup of the first 45 patients implanted with the sirolimus eluting Bx velocity stent (Cordis, Johnson & Johnson, Warren, NJ, USA) had negligible neointimal hyperplasia. This was confirmed in the RAVEL study 4,5 . Drug eluting stents were thus dubbed the third revolution in interventional cardiology. Both large scale randomised trials and allcomer registries showed excellent results in terms of the need for repeat revascularisation. This technology brought closer the results of percutaneous coronary intervention to that of coronary bypass graft surgery. Serruys’ “rosy” prophecy came true 6 , however, it soon turned out that, as in all true “roses”, this one also has its thorns. The thorn of the first generation of drug eluting stents was an increased risk of late stent thrombosis. Registries of all comers treated with drug eluting stents showed late stent thrombosis rates of 0.53% per year, with a continued increase to 3% over four years 7,8 . In patients with complex multivessel disease (ARTS II), the rate of combined definite, probable and possible stent thrombosis was as high as 9.4% at five years, accounting for 32% of MACE events 9 . In addition, the pathology showed uncovered struts and inflammatory reaction in post-mortem specimens. Vasomotion testing showed abnormal vasoconstriction response to acetylcholine distal to the stent, suggesting that the structure and function of the endothelium remained abnormal 10 .

For general pediatric applications, however, the need for phased array probes emerges due to the limited intercostal acoustic window available. In this paper, a clinically approved real-time duplex imaging setup with phased array probes was used to investigate the potential of blood ST for the 2-D vector flow imaging of children with congenital heart disease. To investigate transmit beam pattern and tracking accuracy, straight tubes with parabolic flow were simulated at three depths (4.5, 7, and 9.5 cm). Due to the small aperture available, diffraction effects could be observed when approaching 10 cm, which limited the number of parallel receive beams that could be utilized. Moving to (slightly) diverging beams was shown to solve this issue at the expense of a loss in signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve consistent estimates, a forward-backward tracking scheme was introduced to avoid measurement bias occurring due to tracking kernel averaging artifacts at flow domain boundaries. Promising results were observed for depths <10 cm in two pediatric patients, where complex cardiac flow patterns could be estimated and visualized. As a loss in penetration compared with color flow imaging is expected, a larger clinical study is needed to establish the clinical feasibility of this approach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2017.2689799", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2608757402", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings Nuclear techniques to quantify RV function have been available for many years, but newer methods to evaluate RV function are emerging. Recent investigations into the pathophysiology of RV failure from a variety of causes have identified RV ischemia and alterations in RV metabolism as major contributors. Because nuclear-imaging techniques also allow evaluation of RV ischemia and metabolism, nuclear imaging may allow a comprehensive assessment of RV function and physiology. Summary In addition to providing a reliable determination of RV systolic function, nuclear-imaging techniques are emerging as clinically useful tools to assess RV perfusion and metabolism.

In this review, we describe the evidence-based uses of nicardipine injection in interventional cardiology and cardiac catheterization procedures. In comparison to other calcium channel blockers, nicardipine injection appears to be potentially safer, easier to administer and capable of producing a more predictable response. This drug has potential advantages in preventing or reversing the no-reflow phenomenon that sometimes occurs after interventions in coronary bypass grafts. Nicardipine may also be effective when administered in a flush solution with other drugs during rotational atherectomy and clot debulking with or without distal protection devices. It also can control the hypertension that occurs after sternotomy and cardiac surgery, and in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

Third, we proposed a novel evaluation metric that considers different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, reflecting the clinical reality that some diagnoses have similar outcomes and varying risks. Over 200 teams submitted 850 algorithms (432 of which successfully ran) during the unofficial and official phases of the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches from both academia and industry for identifying cardiac abnormalities.

Professional medical associations such as the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) support these obligations. In Europe, the costs of continuing medical education (CME) are insufficiently supported from governments and employers; however, medical associations have been criticized for accepting alternative financial support from industry. Medical education and training in research include learning how to assess the quality and reliability of any information. There is some risk of bias in any form of scientific communication including intellectual, professional, and financial and it is essential that in particular, the latter must be acknowledged by full disclosure. It is essential that there is strong collaboration between basic and clinical researchers from academic institutions on the one hand, with engineers and scientists from the research divisions of device and pharmaceutical companies on the other. This is vital so that new diagnostic methods and treatments are developed. Promotion of advances by industry may accelerate their implementation into clinical practice. Universities now frequently exhort their academic staff to protect their intellectual property or commercialize their research. Thus, it is not commercial activity or links per se that have become the target for criticism but the perceived influence of commercial enterprises on clinical decision-making or on messages conveyed by professional medical organizations. This document offers the perspective of the ESC on the current debate, and it recommends how to minimize bias in scientific communications and CME and how to ensure proper ethical standards and transparency in relations between the medical profession and industry.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehr480", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2089984761", "source": "openalex"}

In a multivariate analysis, race/ethnicity was not associated with HTN control, but private insurance (odds ratio [OR] 3.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-9.28), nonsmoker status (OR 4.36, CI 1.22-15.51), and number of medications used (OR 1.32, CI 1.12-1.56) were associated with HTN control. Correct recognition of systolic blood pressure goal and knowledge of one's current state of HTN control were also associated with control. In conclusion, in a general cardiology practice where patients had a high degree of healthcare access, race/ethnicity was not associated with HTN control, while type of insurance, nonsmoker status, and increased number of medications used were associated. In addition, 2 novel predictors of HTN control, recognition of systolic blood pressure goal and knowledge of HTN control, were identified that can be utilized in creating new HTN treatment interventions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-7176.2010.00298.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068142747", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, we printed pre- and postoperative 3D-models of a complex congenital heart defect. With this example, we intend to illustrate that these models hold value in preoperative planning, postoperative evaluation of a complex procedure, communication with the patient, and education of trainees. At this moment, 3D printing only leaves a small footprint, but makes already a big impression in the domain of cardiology and cardiovascular surgery.

There is overlap with the information from other imaging techniques, but no technique is static and new developments have expanded its role. This review focuses on ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, infection and inflammation. Radiopharmaceutical development includes the wider availability of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers such as rubidium-82, which allows myocardial perfusion to be quantified in absolute terms. Compared with alternative techniques, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have the advantages of being widely applicable using exercise or pharmacological stress, full coverage of the myocardium and a measure of ischaemic burden, which helps to triage patients between medical therapy and revascularisation. Disadvantages include the availability of expertise in some cardiac centres and the lack of simple SPECT quantification, meaning that global abnormalities can be underestimated. In patients with heart failure, despite the findings of the STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial, there are still data to support the assessment of myocardial hibernation in predicting when abolition of ischaemia might lead to improvement in ventricular function. Imaging of sympathetic innervation is well validated, but simpler markers of prognosis mean that it has not been widely adopted. There are insufficient data to support its use in predicting the need for implanted devices, but non-randomised studies are promising. Other areas where radionuclide imaging is uniquely valuable are detection and monitoring of endocarditis, device infection, myocardial inflammation in sarcoidosis, myocarditis and so on, and reliable detection of deposition in suspected transthyretin-related amyloidosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2019-315628", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3126095713", "source": "openalex"}

For individual fellows, a trend towards reduction of exposure parameters was seen over time, but only KAP(cine) was significant (25.7 +/- 14/22.2 +/- 11 Gycm2, P <or= 0.001). In conclusion, all parameters measured in this study increased significantly in diagnostic procedures performed with fellows when compared with staff members alone, fluoroscopy time and the related KAP in particular.

This has been demonstrated to improve perinatal mortality and morbidity in neonates with CHD. Thus, antenatal diagnosis of CHD is most likely to benefit patients who require surgery in early infancy. We aimed to examine the frequency of antenatal diagnosis in neonates presenting to The Royal Children’s Hospital severe CHD. Methods: Main outcome measures were antenatal diagnosis and whether the individual lesion would have been expected to be detected on a four‐chamber view or four‐chamber and outflow tract view during a routine obstetric anomaly ultrasound. Poisson regression was used to estimate the average trend over the study period. Results: A total of 610 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 164 had an antenatal diagnosis (26.8%). If routine ultrasound screening was ideal, we would have expected 63.9% of cases to be detected on four‐chamber view and 83.6% on four‐chamber and outflow tract view. Trend analysis demonstrated an annual rate of improvement of 9% in actual versus expected antenatal diagnosis of CHD. Malformation‐specific analysis showed that antenatal detection was the highest for double inlet/outlet ventricle (51.3%, 95% confidence interval 34.8–67.6%) and the lowest for simple transposition of the great arteries (15.6%, 95% confidence interval 9.0–24.5).

After initial stabilization and management, one of the most important decisions is to determine which patients can be safely discharged and which require hospitalization. This is a complex decision that depends on numerous subjective factors, including both the severity of the patient's underlying condition and an estimate of the acuity of the presentation. An emergency department observation period may help select the correct option. Ideally, during an observation period, risk stratification should be carried out using parameters specifically designed for use in the emergency department. Unfortunately, there is little objective literature to guide this disposition decision. An objective and reliable definition of low-risk characteristics to identify early discharge candidates is needed. Benchmarking outcomes in patients discharged from the emergency department without hospitalization could aid this process. Biomarker determinations, although undoubtedly useful in establishing diagnosis and predicting longer-term prognosis, require prospective validation for emergency department disposition guidance. The challenge of identifying emergency department acute heart failure discharge candidates will only be overcome by future multidisciplinary research defining the current knowledge gaps and identifying potential solutions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2048872616633853", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2286068073", "source": "openalex"}

Presented in this work is a thorough assessment of the occupational eye lens dose based on clinical measurements with active personal dosimeters worn by staff during various types of procedures in interventional radiology, cardiology and neuroradiology. Results are presented in terms of the estimated equivalent eye lens dose for various medical professions. In order to compare the risk of exceeding the regulatory annual eye lens dose limit for the widely different clinical situations investigated in this work, the different medical professions were separated into categories based on their distinct work pattern: staff that work (a) regularly beside the patient, (b) in proximity to the patient and (c) typically at a distance from the patient. The results demonstrate that the risk of exceeding the annual eye lens dose limit is of concern for staff category (a), i.e. mainly the primary radiologist/cardiologist. However, the results also demonstrate that the risk can be greatly mitigated if radiation protection shields are used in the clinical routine.

These include lack of explanations in clinically meaningful terms, handling the presence of unknown medical conditions, and transparency regarding the system's limitations, both in terms of statistical performance as well as recognizing situations for which the system's predictions are irrelevant. We articulate these unmet clinical needs as machine-learning (ML) problems and systematically address them with cutting-edge ML techniques. We focus on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis as an example domain in which AI has great potential and tackle two challenging tasks: the detection of a heterogeneous mix of known and unknown arrhythmias from ECG and the identification of underlying cardio-pathology from segments annotated as normal sinus rhythm recorded in patients with an intermittent arrhythmia. We validate our methods by simulating a screening for arrhythmias in a large-scale population while adhering to statistical significance requirements. Specifically, our system 1) visualizes the relative importance of each part of an ECG segment for the final model decision; 2) upholds specified statistical constraints on its out-of-sample performance and provides uncertainty estimation for its predictions; 3) handles inputs containing unknown rhythm types; and 4) handles data from unseen patients while also flagging cases in which the model's outputs are not usable for a specific patient.

In addition to shared risk factors, a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence reveals numerous commonalities in the biology underlying both pathologies. Inflammation emerges as a common hallmark for both diseases as it contributes to the initiation and progression of both HF and cancer. Under stress, malignant and cardiac cells change their metabolic preferences to survive, which makes these metabolic derangements a great basis to develop intersection strategies and therapies to combat both diseases. Furthermore, genetic predisposition and clonal haematopoiesis are common drivers for both conditions and they hold great clinical relevance in the context of personalized medicine. Additionally, altered angiogenesis is a common hallmark for failing hearts and tumours and represents a promising substrate to target in both diseases. Cardiac cells and malignant cells interact with their surrounding environment called stroma. This interaction mediates the progression of the two pathologies and understanding the structure and function of each stromal component may pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and improved outcomes in patients. The interdisciplinary collaboration between cardiologists and oncologists is essential to establish unified guidelines. To this aim, pre-clinical models that mimic the human situation, where both pathologies coexist, are needed to understand all the aspects of the bidirectional relationship between cancer and HF. Finally, adequately powered clinical studies, including patients from all ages, and men and women, with proper adjudication of both cancer and cardiovascular endpoints, are essential to accurately study these two pathologies at the same time.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2029", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3093860253", "source": "openalex"}

While some studies have shown positive effects of the flipped classroom in undergraduate medical education, there is a paucity of data on its use in graduate medical education. Objective We hypothesized that a flipped classroom curriculum of Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program (MKSAP) content with group case discussions could improve resident knowledge and preparedness in cardiology. Methods Ninety-eight internal medicine residents who rotated on the inpatient cardiology service from March to October 2017 were quasi-randomized into control and intervention groups, with the intervention group assigned MKSAP readings and cases to review on their own, accompanied by weekly case discussion. Pre-post surveys evaluated for change in knowledge and preparedness, quantity of teaching received, and use of MKSAP. Results A total of 93 of 98 residents (95%) participated in the curriculum. There were 37 of 51 residents (73%) in the control group and 37 of 47 residents (79%) in the intervention group who responded to pre-post assessments. In paired analysis, knowledge score did not improve significantly between the groups, nor did self-reported preparedness, number of teaching sessions per week, or reported MKSAP use. However, all participants had positive perceptions of the curriculum, and the majority felt it should be continued. Conclusions This flipped classroom curriculum did not affect knowledge, preparedness, or number of teaching sessions for internal medicine residents on a cardiology rotation when compared to usual teaching, although residents experiencing the new model expressed high satisfaction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4300/jgme-d-18-00543.1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2920144424", "source": "openalex"}

The measurements were carried out in a surgical theatre using a mobile C-arm system and electronic occupational dosimeters (worn over the lead apron). Patient and staff dose measurements were collected in a sample of 34 urology interventions (nephrolithotomies). The same dosimetry system was used in other medical specialties for comparison purposes. Median and 3rd quartile values for urology procedures were: patient doses 30 and 40 Gy cm(2); personal dose equivalent Hp(10) over the apron (μSv/procedure): 393 and 848 (for urologists); 21 and 39 (for nurses). Median values of over apron dose per procedure for urologists resulted 18.7 times higher than those measured for radiologists and cardiologists working with proper protection (using ceiling suspended screens) in catheterisation laboratories, and 4.2 times higher than the values measured for vascular surgeons at the same hospital. Comparison with passive dosimeters worn near the eyes suggests that dosimeters worn over the apron could be a reasonable conservative estimate for ocular doses for interventional urology.

The diagnosis and the management of hypertension, in fact, must be viewed today not in isolation, but as part of a patients' global cardiovascular (CV) risk, resulting from the concomitant presence of a variety of risk factors, organ damage (left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid or peripheral atherosclerosis, microalbuminuria or impaired glomerular filtration rate), and hypertension-related clinical conditions. The choice of timing and the intensity of antihypertensive treatment should be based on blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy and the propensity to favourably impact patient's individual absolute CV disease risk profile. As part of this paradigm shift in CV disease prevention strategy, cardiologists can take several key steps to help improve standards of hypertension control: (i) increase the awareness of total risk management; (ii) initiate an integrated management strategy tailored to the individual patient's global CV risk (e.g. hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, age, smoking and gender); (iii) use any elevation in BP as a gateway to begin total risk management and (iv) utilise combination therapies (particularly fixed-dose combinations) to achieve more rapid and persistent BP control and improve patient compliance/persistence with therapy. To help improve standards of hypertension control in the cardiology setting, this review examines the concept of treating hypertension using a global risk assessment approach and proposes effective hypertensive therapy as part of global risk management in patients typically seen in cardiology practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01821.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154258312", "source": "openalex"}

Since publication of these guidelines, multiple randomized controlled trials evaluating nonstatin lipid-modifying medications have been published.We performed a systematic review to assess the magnitude of benefit and/or harm from additional lipid-modifying therapies compared with statins alone in individuals with known ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD. We included data from randomized controlled trials with a sample size of >1 000 patients and designed for follow-up >1 year. We performed a comprehensive literature search and identified 10 randomized controlled trials for intensive review, including trials evaluating ezetimibe, niacin, cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors, and PCSK9 inhibitors. The prespecified primary outcome for this review was a composite of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.The cardiovascular benefit of nonstatin lipid-modifying therapies varied significantly according to the class of medication. There was evidence for reduced ASCVD morbidity with ezetimibe and 2 PSCK9 inhibitors. Reduced ASCVD mortality rate was reported for 1 PCSK9 inhibitor. The use of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) reduced the primary outcome by 1.8% over 7 years (hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84-0.96], 7-year number needed to treat: 56). The PSCK9 inhibitor evolocumab in the FOURIER study (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) decreased the primary outcome by 1.5% over 2.2 years (hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73-0.88; 2.2=year number needed to treat: 67). In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab), alirocumab reduced the primary outcome by 1.6% over 2.8 years (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79-0.93; 2.8-year number needed to treat: 63). For ezetimibe and the PSCK9 inhibitors, rates of musculoskeletal, neurocognitive, gastrointestinal, or other adverse event risks did not differ between the treatment and control groups. For patients at high risk of ASCVD already on background statin therapy, there was minimal evidence for improved ASCVD risk or adverse events with cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors. There was no evidence of benefit for the addition of niacin to statin therapy. Direct comparisons of the results of the 10 randomized controlled trials were limited by significant differences in sample size, duration of follow-up, and reported primary outcomes.In a systematic review of the evidence for adding nonstatin lipid-modifying therapies to statins to reduce ASCVD risk, we found evidence of benefit for ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors but not for niacin or cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000626", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4251774089", "source": "openalex"}

The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45-75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40-75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70-189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a <140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults.

Because women who develop obstructive coronary heart disease and heart failure tend to do so 10 years later than men, cardiology clinical trials that use arbitrary age cutoffs or exclusion criteria based on comorbidities and polypharmacy often limit the pool of potential participants to a greater extent for women. Issues related to trial design and insufficient accounting for female-predominant disease patterns have contributed to low rates of enrollment of women in certain domains of cardiology research. Accordingly, women do not benefit from as rich an evidence base for cardiology as men. Here, we review major sex differences in heart disease and discuss areas of cardiology research in which women have been underrepresented. Considering the widespread sex differences in cardiovascular structure and function, it is important to include balanced numbers of women and men in cardiovascular clinical trials. Beyond inclusion, sex-specific reporting is also essential. Moreover, with ongoing developments of clinical-trial methodology, it is imperative to seek innovative ways to learn as much as possible about how interventions behave in women and men. Adaptive trials are specifically identified as promising opportunities to consider sex-based analyses at interim stages, allowing sex-specific flexibility as these trials unfold. Finally, we emphasize the importance of factoring sex as a biological variable into the design, analysis, and reporting of preclinical research, because this research critically informs the design and execution of clinical trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.22907", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2792812580", "source": "openalex"}

Some studies have suggested that closer adherence to guidelines can reduce variations in care, can improve quality, and may ultimately result in better outcomes, but this finding is incompletely understood. Guidelines themselves must change to be responsive to continuously evolving clinical practice. Our goal here was to investigate whether any relationship existed between the most recent ACC/AHA recommended indications for PCI and short term in-hospital outcomes. Methods and Results— We analyzed the ACC National Cardiovascular Data Registry for the period of January 1, 2001, through March 31, 2004. We excluded PCI procedures performed for acute myocardial infarction (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction); all others were grouped by their indications according to the standard ACC/AHA scheme: Class I, evidence and/or agreement that PCI is useful and effective; Class IIa, conflicting evidence and/or divergent opinions, weight is in favor; Class IIb, usefulness/efficacy is less well established; and Class III, evidence and/or agreement that PCI is not useful or effective and may be harmful. Clinical success was defined as angiographic success (&lt;20% residual stenosis) at all lesions attempted without the adverse events of myocardial infarction, same-admission bypass surgery, or death. There were 412 617 PCI procedures included in the analysis. Frequency of indications was as follows: Class I, 64%; Class IIa, 21%; Class IIb, 7%; and Class III, 8%. Clinical success declined across the indications classes (92.8%, 91.7%, 89%, and 85.5%, respectively; P &lt;0.001), whereas adverse events increased. Conclusions— In this large survey of contemporary PCI practice, most procedures were performed for Class I indications. A significant relationship between evidence-based indications recommended by the ACC/AHA Task Force and in-hospital outcomes was noted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.105.553727", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118373540", "source": "openalex"}

The aim was to describe the yield and concordance of FPG, HbA1c, and 2hPG alone, or in combination, to identify dysglycaemia in patients with coronary artery disease. In EUROASPIRE IV, a cross-sectional survey of patients aged 18–80 years with coronary artery disease in 24 European countries, 4004 patients with no reported history of diabetes had FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c measured. All participants were divided into different glycaemic categories according to the ADA and WHO criteria for dysglycaemia. Using all screening tests together, 1158 (29%) had undetected diabetes. Out of them, the proportion identified by FPG was 75%, by 2hPG 40%, by HbA1c 17%, by FPG + HbA1c 81%, and by OGTT (=FPG + 2hPG) 96%. Only 7% were detected by all three methods FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c. The ADA criteria (FPG + HbA1c) identified 90% of the population as having dysglycaemia compared with 73% with the WHO criteria (OGTT = FPG + 2hPG). Screening according to the ADA criteria for FPG + HbA1c identified 2643 (66%) as having a 'high risk for diabetes', while the WHO criteria for FPG + 2hPG identified 1829 patients (46%). In patients with established coronary artery disease, the OGTT identifies the largest number of patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes and should be the preferred test when assessing the glycaemic state of such patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1863506399", "source": "openalex"}

It is an antiplatelet agent with a unique mechanism of action, allowing a direct and reversible competitive inhibition of P2Y12 receptor. According to newest guidelines, it is recommended for prevention of thrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Moreover, it is preferred over clopidogrel, an older generation antiplatelet drug, and therefore gains more interest in modern cardiology and vascular medicine.Areas covered: This review is a comprehensive and thorough summary of the most important findings on ticagrelor. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics, drug-drug interactions, adverse effects, efficacy in specific patient populations and off-label properties of ticagrelor are discussed in this paper. Moreover, the results from pivotal clinical trials are presented.Expert opinion: Introduction of ticagrelor, a first directly-acting and reversible P2Y12 inhibitor, gave some new possibilities as the efficacy of older drugs was often insufficient. Despite some drawbacks, such as a risk of bleeding events or dyspnea, a rapid onset of action, consistency in the antiplatelet effect and reports on pleiotropic properties make this drug a promising candidate for a first-choice antiplatelet agent in patients with acute coronary events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2017.1421634", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2780042637", "source": "openalex"}

Since myocardial damage is characterized by connective tissue disease, including fibrosis and diffuse vascular lesions or microcirculation, nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging has been a promising option for evaluating myocardial damages in early stages. In addition to the conventional stress-rest perfusion imaging, the current use of quantitative electrocardiographic gated imaging has contributed to more precise evaluation of cardiac perfusion, ventricular wall motion, and diastolic function, all of which have enhanced diagnostic ability of evaluating myocardial dysfunction. Abnormal sympathetic imaging with Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine might be another option for identifying myocardial damage.

Abnormal changes to the proteome, the complete cellular protein complement, are responsible for the various disease phenotypes. The proteome is dynamic, however, and is constantly changing due to a combination of factors, including temporal and functional regulation of gene expression, differrential mRNA splicing and subsequent protein post-translational modifications. This dynamic response is compounded during the development of acute responses of the heart (such as myocardial preconditioning, stunning and infarction), just as it is during the development and onset of chronic heart disease (eg, heart failure). Proteomic analyses enable the identification and characterization of these disease-induced protein changes using a multitude of experimental techniques. This review provides an overview of proteomic technology with emphasis on the unique problems associated with the analysis of the heart, summarizes the latest proteomic studies, assesses what information analogous genomic studies can provide for the design and execution of proteomics, and finally discusses the implications of proteomics for the identification and development of diagnostics and therapeutic targets specifically for heart disease. The future holds great promise for the availability of a panel of cardiac serum biomarkers able to delineate different stages of each heart disease, thus allowing the design of clinical interventions potentially using stage-specific therapeutics.

Patients with heart failure may be at greater risk of infection with COVID-19 and the consequences might also be more serious, but they are also at risk of adverse outcomes if their clinical care is compromised. As physicians and clinical trialists, it is our responsibility to ensure safe and effective care is delivered to trial participants without affecting the integrity of the trial. The social contract with our patients demands no less. Many regulatory authorities from different world regions have issued guidance statements regarding the conduct of clinical trials during this COVID-19 crisis. However, international trials may benefit from expert guidance from a global panel of experts to supplement local advice and regulations, thereby enhancing the safety of participants and the integrity of the trial. Accordingly, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology on 21 and 22 March 2020 conducted web-based meetings with expert clinical trialists in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia. The main objectives of this Expert Position Paper are to highlight the challenges that this pandemic poses for the conduct of clinical trials in heart failure and to offer advice on how they might be overcome, with some practical examples. While this panel of experts are focused on heart failure clinical trials, these discussions and recommendations may apply to clinical trials in other therapeutic areas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa461", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3033074701", "source": "openalex"}

Although this model has been shown to be effective in bringing cardiovascular care to the patients' environment, its effectiveness in creating sustainable service is questioned. This study reports the barriers to contribution of missions to effective skill transfer and possible improvements needed in the future, from the perspective of both the local and overseas teams.We reviewed the mission-based activities in the Children's Heart Fund Cardiac Center in the past six years. We distributed questionnaires to the local surgeons and the lead surgeons of the overseas teams.Twenty-six missions visited the center 57 times. There were 371 operating days and 605 surgical procedures. Of the procedures performed, 498 were open-heart surgeries. Of the operations, 360 were congenital cases and 204 were rheumatic. Six local surgeons and 18 overseas surgeons responded. Both groups agree the current model of collaboration is not optimal for effective skill transfer. The local surgeons suggested deeper involvement of the universities, governmental institutions, defined training goals and time frame, and communication among the overseas teams themselves as remedies in the future. Majority of the overseas surgeons agree that networking and regular communication among the missions themselves are needed. Some reflected that it would be convenient if the local surgeons are trained by one or two frequently visiting surgeons in their early years and later exposed to multiple teams if needed.The current model of collaboration has brought cardiac care to patients having cardiac diseases. However, the model appears to be suboptimal for skill transfer. The model needs to be reshaped to achieve this complex goal.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135116668834", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2551666906", "source": "openalex"}

This paper describes the experience and the initial results of a system able to register and to process simultaneously staff and patient doses in interventional cardiology and the practical use of this system in the optimisation of occupational exposure. The system used simultaneously collects and manages patient and staff doses for all radiation events. The personal electronic dosimeters worn over the protective apron of health professionals working inside catheterisation laboratories can send (wireless) doses and dose rate values to an X-hub and provide the operators inside the catheterisation rooms with real-time information. Individual and global reports for all the health professionals may be periodically obtained from the system to help with the optimisation. The results for eight cardiologists, one fellow and four nurses for a total of 2468 interventional cardiology procedures and 3207 occupational dose values collected over one year are presented here. Annual doses Hp(10) measured over the apron for cardiologists ranged from 0.3 to 6.3 mSv. For the cardiologist, the ratio between occupational doses (over the apron) and patient doses ranged from 0.05 to 0.23 μSv Gy−1 cm−2, with a mean value of 0.12 μSv Gy−1 cm−2. The system allows defining optimisation strategies by comparing the results between the different operators while considering the workload and complexity of the procedures (based on the total Kerma Area Product managed by the different operators). The registration of the date and time of the occupational radiation doses allows auditing the use of the personal dosimeters worn by the various operators.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6498/aad429", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2884826118", "source": "openalex"}

We aim to evaluate the performance of the ESC 0/1 hour algorithm across different contexts. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published between 1 January 2008 and 31 May 2019. The primary outcome was index myocardial infarction and the secondary outcome was major adverse cardiac event or mortality. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive the pooled estimate of each outcome. Results A total of 11 014 patients from 10 cohorts were analysed for the primary outcome. The algorithm based on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)T (Roche), hs-cTnI (Abbott) and hs-cTnI (Siemens) had pooled sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI=95.1% to 99.5%), 98.1% (95% CI=94.6% to 99.3%) and 98.7% (95% CI=97.3% to 99.3%), respectively. The algorithm based on hs-cTnT (Roche) and hs-cTnI (Siemens) had pooled specificity of 91.2% (95% CI=86.0% to 94.6%) and 95.9% (95% CI=94.1% to 97.2%), respectively. Among patients in the rule-out category, the pooled mortality rate at 30 days and at 1 year was 0.1% (95% CI=0.0% to 0.4%) and 0.8% (95% CI=0.5% to 1.2%), respectively. Among patients in the observation zone, the pooled mortality rate was 0.7% (95% CI=0.3% to 1.2%) at 30 days but increased to 8.1% (95% CI=6.1% to 10.4%) at 1 year, comparable to the mortality rate in the rule-in group.

This study reported the differences in age-adjusted prevalence and treatment status of hypertension according to race among US adults per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-16 data was analyzed. The main outcomes were age-adjusted prevalence and treatment status of hypertension among adults aged ≥20 years.

During the interview patients were asked to fill out the HeartQoL health-related quality of life questionnaire as well as the EQ-5D and the hospital anxiety and depression scale questionnaire. Psychometric analyses assessing the reliability and validity of the HeartQoL instrument were performed. A total of 7449 patients completed the HeartQoL instrument. Cronbach's alpha indicated excellent internal consistency for the global HeartQoL scale (α = 0.92) and the physical subscale (α = 0.91) and good internal consistency for the emotional subscale (α = 0.87). Factor analysis confirmed the two-dimensional construct although mixed results were found regarding the model fit. Discriminative validity analysis confirmed better HeartQoL results in men, younger patients and higher educated persons. Likewise, convergent validity was confirmed with moderate to strong correlations among hypothesised constructs. Overall, psychometric analyses of the HeartQoL instrument in a population of patients with stable coronary heart disease showed good reliability and validity both at the European as well as the country-specific level. However, further research should focus on the responsiveness of the HeartQoL, the possible ceiling effect of the emotional subscale, construct validity and the minimal clinically important difference.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487315604837", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2303722987", "source": "openalex"}

CMR was performed at median 7 days (interquartile range 4-20 days) after clinical presentation and included cine imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and late gadolinium enhancement. CMR images were evaluated to assign each patient to a diagnosis. By using non-CMR criteria only, the 2013 ESC-PSC were positive for suspected myocarditis in 151 patients and negative in 30. In the remaining 122 patients, there was insufficient information available for ESC-PSC assessment, mostly due to lack of coronary angiography (CAG) before the CMR examination (n = 116, 95%). There were no in-hospital deaths. CMR provided a diagnosis in 158 patients (52%), including myocarditis in 104 (34%), myocardial infarction in 44 (15%), and other pathology in 10 patients (3%). Non-urgent CAG (>24 h after presentation) was performed before the CMR examination in 85 patients, of which 20 (24%) were done in patients with subsequently confirmed AM, which could potentially have been avoided if CMR was performed first. ESC-PSC was correct in diagnosing AM before the CMR in 50 of the 151 patients (33%) and was correct in ruling out AM in all the 30 patients (100%). However, ESC-PSC provided an incorrect diagnosis of AM in 27 of the 151 patients (18%), which was corrected by CMR through the identification of new cardiac disease that could explain the clinical syndrome. Patients with insufficient ESC-PSC information had a relatively low pre-test probability of coronary artery disease. In this group, CMR confirmed the diagnosis of AM in a relatively high percentage (44%) but still revealed myocardial infarction in 8% of them.Tissue characterization by CMR provided a good diagnostic yield in this large clinical population of patients with suspected AM. CMR provided incremental diagnostic value to the ESC-PSC by ruling out the diagnosis of AM on one hand and by potentially sparing AM patients from CAG on the other.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jex308", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768491863", "source": "openalex"}

This study was the first conducted in Latin America for pediatric interventional cardiology under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Methods: Over three years, the following data regarding demographic and patient dose values were collected: age, gender, weight, height, number of cine series, total number of cine frames, fluoroscopy time (FT), and two dosimetric quantities, dose‐area product (DAP) and cumulative dose (CD), at the patient entrance reference point. The third quartile values for FT, DAP, CD, number of cine series, and the DAP/body weight ratio were proposed as the set of quantities to use as local DRLs. Results: Five hundred and seventeen patients were divided into four age groups. Sample sizes by age group were 120 for &lt;1 yr; 213 for 1 to &lt;5 yr; 82 for 5 to &lt;10 yr; and 102 for 10 to &lt;16 yr. The third quartile values obtained for DAP by diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and age range were 1.17 and 1.11 Gy cm 2 for &lt;1 yr; 1.74 and 1.90 Gy cm 2 for 1 to &lt;5 yr; 2.83 and 3.22 Gy cm 2 for 5 to &lt;10 yr; and 7.34 and 8.68 Gy cm 2 for 10 to &lt;16 yr, respectively. The third quartile value obtained for the DAP/body weight ratio for the full sample of procedures was 0.17 (Gy cm 2 /kg) for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Conclusions: The data presented in this paper are an initial attempt at establishing local DRLs in pediatric interventional cardiology, from a large sample of procedures for the standard age bands used in Europe, complemented with the values of the ratio between DAP and patient weight. This permits a rough estimate of DRLs for different patient weights and the refining of these values for the age bands when there may be large differences in child size. These DRLs were obtained at the largest pediatric hospital in Chile, with an active optimization program, and could be used by other hospitals in the Latin America region to compare their current patient dose values and determine whether corrective action is appropriate.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4905116", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2047857289", "source": "openalex"}

Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is causally involved in atherosclerosis and a clear, monotonic relationship between pharmacologic LDL-C lowering and a reduction in cardiovascular events post-ACS has been shown, a concept termed 'the lower, the better'. Current ESC guidelines suggest an LDL-C guided, step-wise initiation and escalation of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT). Observational studies consistently show low rates of guideline-recommended LLT adaptions and concomitant low rates of LDL-C target goal achievement, leaving patients at residual risk, especially in the vulnerable post-ACS phase. In addition to the well-established 'the lower, the better' approach, a 'strike early and strike strong' approach in the early post-ACS phase with upfront initiation of a combined lipid-lowering approach using high-intensity statins and ezetimibe seems reasonable. We discuss the rationale, clinical trial evidence and experience for such an approach and highlight existing knowledge gaps. In addition, the concept of acute initiation of PCSK9 inhibition in the early phase is reviewed.

Since then, the number of new defibrillator implants has gradually increased following an exponential curve. In 1998, nearly 50 000 new ICD implants were carried out worldwide. This tremendous increase was due to technological improvements in the device and the effectiveness of ICD therapy. Technological improvements in devices and leads included a gradual reduction in the size of the device, the introduction of the endocardial approach in 1988, the biphasic waveform and antitachycardia pacing in 1991, pectoral implantation in 1995, inclusion of DDD pacing in 1996 and finally, inclusion of DDDR and also atrial defibrillation in 1998. Efficacy assessment started with observational studies. In 1985, FDA approval for ICD implantation was obtained. Results of prospective randomized studies, which assessed the effectiveness of ICDs, were obtained in the late 1990s. The first reported trial was essentially an analysis of cost-effectiveness, which compared ICD implantation as first-choice therapy vs conventional strategy starting with antiarrhythmic drugs in postinfarct sudden death survivors. If drugs failed, the patient was treated with endocardial resection or a late defibrillator implant. The cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as costs per day of life, was significantly in favour of early ICD implantation. However, because the number of patients was relatively small, total mortality showed only a trend in favour of early ICD implantation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1053/euhj.2001.2584", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2098737871", "source": "openalex"}

Whether that might ever be possible would depend on how we define intelligence, but what is indisputable is that new methods are needed to analyse and interpret the copious information provided by digital medical images, genomic databases, and biobanks. Technological advances have enabled applications of artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) to be implemented into clinical practice, and their related scientific literature is exploding. Advocates argue enthusiastically that AI will transform many aspects of clinical cardiovascular medicine, while sceptics stress the importance of caution and the need for more evidence. This report summarizes the main opposing arguments that were presented in a debate at the 2021 Congress of the European Society of Cardiology. Artificial intelligence is an advanced analytical technique that should be considered when conventional statistical methods are insufficient, but testing a hypothesis or solving a clinical problem—not finding another application for AI—remains the most important objective. Artificial intelligence and ML methods should be transparent and interpretable, if they are to be approved by regulators and trusted to provide support for clinical decisions. Physicians need to understand AI methods and collaborate with engineers. Few applications have yet been shown to have a positive impact on clinical outcomes, so investment in research is essential.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjdh/ztab090", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3205457855", "source": "openalex"}

Beekman, III, MD, FACC, FAHA, FAAP, Co-ChairPediatric cardiology is a complex, multifaceted specialty composed of diverse clinical and academic subspecialty areas. It is characterized by rapid growth of subspecialty areas and swift incorporation of new information from the clinical and laboratory sciences. It is important, therefore, to define the fellowship training required to launch a successful career in pediatric cardiology. The following document represents the first broad-based effort to do so.In 2000, the Society of Pediatric Cardiology Training Program Directors (SPCTPD) embarked on the process of defining fellowship training guidelines. The process itself was broad-based and inclusive. All pediatric cardiology training program directors were invited to nominate members to participate in the training guidelines task forces; in turn, each task force was comprised of all nominated members who agreed to participate. Therefore, all training programs were provided an opportunity to actively participate.In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) approved and published the Revised Recommendations in Adult Cardiovascular Medicine Core Cardiology Training.1 As the SPCTPD was concluding its training guideline development, plans were formalized to use a similar process through the ACC Pediatric Cardiology/Congenital Heart Disease Committee and the ACC Training Program Directors Committee. Accordingly, a steering committee was developed with original authors of the Pediatric Cardiology Training Guidelines to form a liaison with the ACC, the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Section on Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to agree on the final guidelines and to publish them widely.These guidelines are written with the planned goal of serving as a practical resource for directors of pediatric cardiology training programs. We also hope that this document will prove useful to the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for pediatric training programs in the revision of requirements for the accreditation of pediatric cardiology programs. The general requirements, clinical competencies, and oversight for fellows in pediatric cardiology would remain the same as outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).The guidelines proposed in this document address overall recommendations for training in pediatric cardiology and important subspecialties within the field of pediatric cardiology. Although we understand that the pediatric RRC sets minimum standards for accreditation of fellowship programs, this document endeavors to define a more comprehensive set of guidelines for pediatric cardiology fellowship training. Fellowship training guidelines are presented for: general pediatric cardiology (including inpatient care and consultations); echocardiography and noninvasive imaging; electrophysiology; cardiac catheterization and intervention; cardiac intensive care; adult congenital heart disease; and research participation. Each section other than general pediatric cardiology specifies \"core\" and \"advanced\" training experiences. Core recommendations are intended to be common training experiences for all pediatric cardiology trainees regardless of long-term career goals. Advanced recommendations are additional training experiences for trainees intending to develop a clinical or academic area of special competence. All guidelines are recommended experiences, and not absolute mandates, as it is recognized that each training program has unique strengths and that clinical and academic variation across training programs provides important diversity for the specialty.Table 1 summarizes the approximate time commitment (in months) recommended for core training in the task force reports that follow. Variations in these time commitments should be allowed, as pediatric cardiology programs vary widely in size, organization, and emphasis. For example, in some programs, fellows may get considerable cardiac intensive care unit training during their general inpatient experiences and not require a two- to four-month stand-alone rotation. Thus, the training guidelines must provide programs with flexibility to address individual trainee clinical and/or research training needs during a core fellowship of 36 months' duration.The training program must possess the faculty expertise, patient volume, and inpatient/outpatient facilities to provide meaningful trainee experiences as outlined in this document. All faculty should be board certified or possess suitable equivalent qualifications. Recommendations for trainee and faculty evaluation are those outlined in the \"general and special requirements\" as published by the ACGME, and training should take place within a program that is accredited by the ACGME.A comment about trainee research participation is appropriate. The field of pediatric cardiology is absolutely dependent upon research (basic and clinical) for meaningful progress. There is a critical need for the development of physician-scientists in our specialty to assure such future progress. Therefore, it is key that training programs begin to prepare trainees for a successful investigative career. Such preliminary research training will in most instances require 18 months or more. The balancing of clinical and research training will continue to be a major issue for training programs. It is highly probable that trainees who want to pursue a physician-scientist career will require at least four years of fellowship to begin the academic process and to finish training in the clinical areas. The authors are in complete agreement with the newly published American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) Training Requirements for subspecialty certification concerning scholarly activity, meaningful accomplishments in research, scholarship oversight, and differing pathways to train physician-scientists.The authors of this section declare they have no relationships with industry pertinent to this topic.The goals of pediatric cardiology training include acquiring the cognitive and procedural expertise required to provide high-quality care to children with cardiovascular disease, acquiring the academic skills to make meaningful scholarly contributions to the specialty, and, importantly, to develop the capacity for ongoing self-education beyond the years of formal training.The general training of pediatric cardiology fellows builds on the general clinical and academic skills acquired during residency training. The pediatric cardiology fellow should be given broad exposure to clinical activities in pediatric cardiology inpatient and outpatient care, pediatric cardiology inpatient and outpatient consultations, and in preventive cardiology. The academic skills of formal presentation, small-group teaching, literature review, data analysis, and study design are also components of the general training guidelines.A fundamental goal of clinical training is to acquire bedside diagnostic skill and the ability to provide high-qualilty consultative inpatient and outpatient pediatric cardiology care. The core skills of history-taking and physical examination are the only means for correctly initiating diagnostic and management options appropriate to the individual patient, and these must be heavily stressed at all points of patient contact. Pediatric cardiology fellows should be observed by faculty while performing key portions of the history and physical examination, and to also have the opportunity to observe faculty perform history-taking and physical examination, so that meaningful discussion of useful strategies and techniques may develop. Consultation services, general inpatient wards, and outpatient clinics all provide excellent opportunities for such interaction.The pediatric cardiology fellow must have the opportunity to provide not only inpatient and outpatient consultation services but also direct patient care in both inpatient and outpatient settings. There must be a continuity of care in the outpatient clinic so that fellows can begin to appreciate the course of pediatric cardiac disease over time and its cumulative impact on individual patients and their families. The combined time commitment of the general inpatient and inpatient consultation services should be no less than three months. The continuity outpatient clinic should begin early in fellowship and continue throughout training, preferably on a biweekly basis. Both inpatient and outpatient experiences should include exposure to the management of the adult patient with congenital heart disease.There are many ways for general inpatient and outpatient practices to be organized. In the delivery of high-level inpatient and outpatient care the pediatric cardiologist must demonstrate effective team leadership, accurate and efficient medical record keeping, sensitivity to medical ethical issues, an ability to communicate with and support patients and their families through stressful decisions and experiences, and show strict compliance with federal regulatory statutes. The general inpatient and outpatient training environment for pediatric cardiology fellows must provide full opportunity for observation, acquisition, and application of these skills by the trainee.During the course of inpatient and outpatient activities the pediatric cardiology fellow will become familiar with a core knowledge base, as outlined in Table 1, at a minimum.The program should offer courses, seminars, workshops, and/or laboratory experiences to provide appropriate background in basic and fundamental disciplines related to the heart and cardiovascular system. A lecture series encompassing a core curriculum in clinical and basic science topics must be provided for pediatric cardiology fellows. It should be designed so that the spectrum of topics presented will be completed at least once in the three years of accredited fellowship training. Pediatric cardiology fellows should contribute formal presentations of selected topics in the core curriculum, both to strengthen their knowledge base and to develop formal presentation skills. General areas to be covered in the core curriculum include those listed in Table 1.Preoperative conferences with the cardiovascular surgical service are essential. Journal clubs are a recommended element of an academic environment and provide an excellent venue for participatory evaluation of study design and data analysis. Quality assurance evaluation and morbidity/mortality conferences should be held periodically. Multidisciplinary clinical and research conferences are highly desirable; according to the strengths of the institution, contributors might include neonatology, cardiothoracic surgery, adult cardiology, cardiac pathology, physiology, pharmacology, pulmonology, intensive care, cardiac anesthesiology, cardiovascular radiology, clinical genetics, molecular genetics, tissue engineering, stem cell biology, or developmental biology. In all of these conferences, pediatric cardiology fellows should be provided with active roles appropriate to their level of knowledge and training.It is a fundamental responsibility in academic medicine that those with the most experience must teach. The pediatric cardiology fellow will often be the most clinically experienced house officer on a team of residents, interns, and/or medical students. The fellow in that setting should be expected to provide lectures/seminars to the team of house officers. The pediatric cardiology fellow should also be allowed the opportunity to practice clinical leadership, organizational skills, and impromptu educational activities as appropriate to his/her demonstrated level of knowledge and training. There should be occasion for observation and critique of these skills by the attending physician as well as demonstration of these skills to the fellow by the attending.Pediatric cardiology fellows should develop formal evaluation of trainees and training skills during their fellowship. To do so, they should participate in feedback to residents, students, and cardiology attendings throughout their rotations regarding their own educational and technical progress and the progress of other team members. Accurate self-evaluation is the most valuable skill of all and should be nurtured in all phases of pediatric cardiology training.The authors of this section declare they have no relationships with industry pertinent to this topic.Noninvasive imaging, including echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is a primary means for elucidating the anatomy and physiology of childhood heart disease. Competence in performance and interpretation of echocardiography and MRI is now essential to the practice of pediatric cardiology. Depending upon one's individual career goals, varying levels of expertise may be expected to be achieved during fellowship training. This document defines the levels of knowledge and expertise that pediatric cardiology trainees should acquire in echocardiography and MRI during training, and it offers guidelines for achieving these levels of competence.Training guidelines have been previously published for pediatric echocardiography,1 fetal echocardiography,2 and pediatric transesophageal echocardiography.3 Those documents were reviewed and considered during preparation of these guidelines. The guidelines presented here differ in some instances from previous recommendations because this task force recognizes that training programs have changed significantly over the decade since the last guidelines were promulgated.Echocardiography, as used in this document, includes two-dimensional imaging of the heart and related structures, M-mode echocardiography for assessment of chamber size and function, color M-mode and Doppler tissue and flow mapping, pulsed and continuous-wave spectral Doppler flow analysis, and other variations of these basic modalities used to assess the structure and function of the heart and related organs, including new technologies such as three-dimensional echocardiography as they become available.The pediatric echocardiography laboratory should serve a hospital with inpatient and outpatient facilities, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, a pediatric cardiac catheterization/interventional laboratory, and an active pediatric cardiac surgical program. The pediatric echocardiography laboratory should be under the supervision of a full-time pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer qualified to direct a laboratory, and whose primary responsibility is supervision of the laboratory. The laboratory must perform a sufficient number of pediatric transthoracic, pediatric transesophageal, and fetal echocardiograms1,4 each year to allow trainees sufficient exposure to both normal and abnormal examinations.Training goals defined here are to enable trainees to achieve one of two levels of expertise in echocardiography as appropriate for career goals.Core training should be achieved by all pediatric cardiology fellows during core clinical training, typically during four to six months dedicated to echocardiography over the course of the standard three-year training program. This level of expertise is anticipated to be sufficient for those fellows who do not plan to pursue echocardiography as an area of subspecialization.Advanced training requires an additional 9 to 12 months of training and may be achieved through a dedicated experience in pediatric echocardiography after completion of core pediatric echocardiography instruction. This level of training is appropriate for those physicians who intend to be dedicated pediatric echocardiographers.Successful completion of each training level should result in competence in the following specific areas.In addition to core competencies, other goals include: Each level of training may be achieved by the methods outlined in the following text or by comparable alternative methods. A summary of the recommended minimum number of procedures is found in Table 1.Each trainee should perform and interpret at least 150 pediatric echocardiograms, including at least 50 in patients one year of age or younger, under the supervision of the laboratory director or other qualified staff pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer(s). Each trainee should also review at least 150 additional pediatric echocardiograms.In addition, the laboratory director or other staff pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer(s) should conduct regular laboratory conferences with the trainee(s) to present illustrative cases and to teach proper interpretation and the limitations of echocardiography. Pathological specimens, models, or photographs for echocardiographic-anatomic correlation are excellent teaching aids that should be incorporated wherever possible.Integration of echocardiography into the clinical practice of pediatric cardiology should be demonstrated on inpatient and outpatient rotations and at medical-surgical management conferences.Research training for pediatric cardiology trainees should include active participation in reviews of scientific journal articles that pertain to echocardiography.Each advanced-level trainee should perform and interpret at least 200 additional pediatric transthoracic echocardiograms and review, or perform and interpret, another 200 pediatric echocardiograms. As with core training, at least 50 of these should be done in infants one year of age or younger. Each trainee should perform a significant number of echocardiograms independently (one-third to one-half of the exams), with subsequent review and critique of the examination by the responsible staff pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer. Teaching methods outlined in the previous text should be continued here.Each advanced-level trainee should perform and interpret at least 50 pediatric transesophageal echocardiograms, including manipulation of the transducer and registration of images, under direct supervision by a dedicated pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer. The trainee should perform intubation of the esophagus in at least 20 patients under the direct supervision of a pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer or anesthesiologist experienced in the procedure. An ideal environment for learning pediatric transesophageal echocardiography is the operating suite during performance of intraoperative examinations, but the training experience should not be limited to this venue and should include the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization suite, and outpatient examinations.Each advanced trainee should perform and/or review at least 50 fetal echocardiograms. The trainee must master the fundamental skills of determining fetal position, situs, cardiac anatomy, and cardiac rhythm under the supervision of a dedicated pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer. The trainee should observe and participate in the discussion of the findings with the parents by the staff echocardiographer responsible for the examination. As the trainee's experience progresses, a significant proportion (30% to 50%) of studies should be performed independently, including cases with normal and abnormal cardiac anatomy and rhythm, with supervision by a dedicated pediatric cardiologist-echocardiographer. Each trainee should understand how to recognize and approach fetal heart failure, and he or she should understand the association of fetal heart disease with extracardiac structural abnormalities, syndromes, and chromosomal abnormalities.Research training for pediatric cardiology trainees should include, at a minimum, active participation in reviews of scientific journal articles that pertain to echocardiography. In addition, participation in basic or clinical research in echocardiography should be encouraged.Each advanced-level trainee should be given responsibility for participating in the training of sonographers and junior pediatric cardiology fellows, initially with supervision of the laboratory director and then independently and also presenting echocardiography-related teaching conferences and formal didactic lectures.The laboratory director, in consultation with the teaching staff, should evaluate each trainee in writing on a regular basis. Trainees should maintain a log of all echocardiograms performed and reviewed, including the age of the patient and the diagnosis. The log should be reviewed regularly by both the laboratory director and the training program director to ensure that each trainee is obtaining adequate and balanced experience.The evaluation should be reviewed with each trainee and a written copy provided. If a trainee does not appear to be progressing adequately during the rotation, a meeting should be scheduled as soon as possible to inform the trainee and to discuss potential remedial measures. The evaluation should be based on achievement of the expected levels of competence in the areas outlined in the previous text.Direct observation of the trainee during performance of echocardiograms provides information about imaging skills and understanding of the ultrasound instruments. Conferences in which echocardiograms are presented provide an opportunity to assess skills in interpretation of images and Doppler recordings. The trainees' understanding of research design and methods and ability to review research can be critically evaluated during journal club meetings or other venues for medical literature review. Teaching skills and effectiveness can be evaluated by direct observation and from evaluations by sonographers and more junior trainees and by performance at teaching conferences prepared and delivered by trainees.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as used in this document includes anatomic and functional cardiovascular MRI in congenital and acquired pediatric heart disease as well as in the adult with congenital heart disease. At present, there are no specific guidelines for training or credentialing in pediatric cardiovascular MRI. It is likely that the training guidelines for pediatric cardiovascular MRI proposed here will require amendment as the field evolves. These guidelines must be considered as goals and should not be considered as requirements.Trainees may achieve one of two levels of expertise in pediatric cardiovascular MRI as appropriate for career goals.Training in pediatric cardiovascular MRI should occur within a pediatric cardiology fellowship program and/or a pediatric radiology training program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The MR laboratory should serve a hospital with both inpatient and outpatient facilities, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, a pediatric cardiac catheterization/interventional laboratory, and an active pediatric cardiac surgical program. The MRI laboratory should be under the supervision of a full-time cardiologist and/or radiologist qualified in cardiovascular MRI, and it must perform a sufficient number of annual examinations to allow each trainee sufficient exposure to both normal and abnormal examinations.Core training should be achieved by all pediatric cardiology fellows during the core clinical years of the program. This level of expertise may be sufficient for those fellows who plan to practice clinical pediatric cardiology with access to a pediatric cardiologist or radiologist with special expertise in pediatric cardiovascular MRI.Advanced training requires a minimum of six months of instruction in addition to core training. This level of training is appropriate for those physicians who intend to have special expertise in pediatric cardiovascular MRI and is recommended for directors of pediatric cardiovascular MRI laboratories.Successful completion of each training level should result in competence in the following specific areas.Each level of training may be achieved by the methods outlined in the following text or by comparable alternative methods.Pediatric cardiology trainees should gain exposure to cardiovascular MRI through active review of scientific journal articles that pertain to pediatric cardiovascular MRI, discussion with cardiologists and radiologists who perform cardiovascular MRI, and, if possible, review of cardiovascular MRI examinations.During a fellowship in pediatric cardiovascular MRI, each trainee should perform and/or interpret at least 100 cardiovascular MRI examinations in patients with congenital or acquired childhood heart disease, including adult patients with congenital heart disease. As the trainee's experience progresses, an increasing proportion of these examinations should be performed independently, with review and critique by the laboratory director.Research training should include continued critical review of the pediatric cardiovascular MRI literature and an opportunity to perform basic or clinical research leading to publication or presentation of scientific data.Each trainee should be given responsibility for participating in the training of technologists and junior pediatric cardiology fellows, initially with supervision of the laboratory director and subsequently independently. In addition, each trainee should have opportunities to observe and participate in the management of the laboratory, especially quality improvement initiatives.The laboratory director, in consultation with the teaching staff, should evaluate each trainee in writing. The evaluation should be reviewed with each trainee and a written copy provided. The trainee should maintain a log of all examinations performed and reviewed, including the age of the patient, diagnosis, and role of the trainee in the examination.The authors of this section declare they have no relationships with industry pertinent to this topic.The purpose of this document is to recommend minimum training experiences in cardiac catheterization for clinical fellows in pediatric cardiology training programs. Training guidelines in cardiac catheterization are well-established in adult cardiovascular medicine,1,2 and they have been considered recently in pediatric cardiology as well.3,4Pediatric cardiac catheterization is a unique specialty encompassing a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques applied to a diverse group of congenital and acquired cardiovascular disorders. A physician who performs a pediatric cardiac catheterization must possess the technical skills and clinical judgment to safely and accurately perform a thorough diagnostic cardiac catheterization and angiographic study. Furthermore, an interventional pediatric cardiologist must also assess the indications for a catheter intervention, including the risks of performing or not performing the procedure (i.e., requires knowledge of the natural history of the defect), and must skillfully perform the appropriate catheter intervention. It is appropriate, therefore, to delineate minimal training requirements in cardiac catheterization for pediatric cardiology trainees.There are no studies relating training experiences to subsequent clinical skill in pediatric cardiac catheterization. Therefore, the recommendations in Task Force 3 represent the opinions of the authors. To help guide this process, all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited pediatric cardiology training programs were surveyed in 2001 to inquire about current practices and opinions regarding fellow training in pediatric cardiac catheterization and intervention. Thirty-two programs responded. The responses represented the opinions of fellowship directors (n = 21), catheterization laboratory directors (n = 15), and division directors (n = 13) (in some programs one individual holds more than one position). This document draws on this Training Program Survey to help define training guidelines in this specialty.Training in cardiac catheterization should occur within a pediatric cardiology fellowship program that is accredited by the ACGME. The cardiac catheterization laboratory should serve a hospital with inpatient and outpatient facilities, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, and an active pediatric cardiac surgical program. The pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory should be under the supervision of a full-time pediatric cardiologist, whose primary responsibility is supervision of the laboratory. The laboratory must perform a sufficient number of cardiac catheterizations and interventional procedures to provide each trainee with an acceptable experience.The cardiac catheterization program must have a regular teaching conference in which diagnostic data (hemodynamic and angiographic) and therapeutic outcomes are formally discussed. In addition, each program that provides advanced interventional training must have a regular morbidity and mortality conference in which all adverse outcomes of catheter interventions are systematically reviewed. Participants in this conference should include cardiology faculty, clinical fellows, and preferably pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons and cardiac anesthesiologists.

Yet, powerful alternative modalities have emerged for this purpose, and their growth has resulted in increasing competition. But the potential of the tracer principle goes beyond the assessment of physiology and function, toward the interrogation of biology and molecular pathways. This is a unique selling point of radionuclide imaging, which has been underrecognized in cardiovascular medicine until recently. Now, molecular imaging methods for the detection of myocardial infiltration, device infection, and cardiovascular inflammation are successfully gaining clinical acceptance. This is further strengthened by the symbiotic quest of cardiac imaging and therapy for an increasing implementation of molecule-targeted procedures, in which specific therapeutic interventions require specific diagnostic guidance toward the most suitable candidates.

Older patients have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease, high rates of CV risk factors, and multiple age-related comorbidities. Although prevention and management strategies have been shown to be effective in older people, they continue to be under-used, and under-studied. In addition to hard endpoints, frailty, cognitive impairments, and patients' re-assessment of important outcomes (e.g. quality of life vs. longevity) are important aspects for older patients and emphasize the need to include a substantial proportion of older patients in CV clinical trials. To complement the often skewed age distribution in clinical trials, greater emphasis should be placed on real-world studies to assess longer-term outcomes, especially safety and quality of life outcomes. In the complex environment of the older patient, a multidisciplinary care team approach with the involvement of the individual patient in the decision-making process can help optimize prevention and management strategies.

Methods : Prospective, cohort assessment of EM housestaff and faculty performance on 3 valvular abnormality simulations (mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation) conducted on the cardiology patient simulator, “Harvey.” Participants examined each of the 3 study disease simulations and proposed a diagnosis (session I). They were then given a cardiac examination form and repeated the programmed simulations (session II). The examination form was used to prompt physicians to interpret 23 separate cardiac findings for each simulation in a multiple‐choice format. Results : Forty‐six EM housestaff (PGY1–3) and attending physicians were tested over a 2‐month study period. Physician responses did not differ significantly among the different levels of postgraduate training. The overall correct response rates for participants were 59% for aortic regurgitation, 48% for mitral regurgitation, and 17% for mitral stenosis. For aortic regurgitation, recognition of a widened pulse pressure and recognition of diastolic decrescendo murmur were associated with a correct diagnosis (p &lt; 0.01). For mitral regurgitation, correct assessment of the contour of the holosystolic murmur predicted a correct diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001). For mitral stenosis, proper characterization of the mitral area diastolic murmur predicted a correct diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion : Housestaff and faculty had difficulty establishing a correct diagnosis for simulations of 3 common valvular heart diseases. However, accurate recognition of a few critical signs was associated with a correct diagnosis in each simulation.

Recommendations for statin therapy according to 2013 versus 2004 guidelines were assessed among those with/without HRM coronary plaque.Among all subjects, 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score was 3.3% (1.6, 6.6), yet 36% of subjects had HRM coronary plaque. Among those with HRM coronary plaque, statins would be recommended for 26% by 2013 guidelines versus 10% by 2004 guidelines (P = 0.04).

We aimed to assess the effect on self‐care of (i) the European Society of Cardiology/Heart Failure Association website ‘ heartfailurematters.org ’ on top of usual care, and (ii) an e‐health adjusted care pathway leaving out ‘in person’ routine HF nurse consultations in stable HF patients. Methods and results In a three‐group parallel‐randomized trial in stable HF patients from nine Dutch outpatient clinics, we compared two interventions ( heartfailurematters.org website and an e‐health adjusted care pathway) to usual care. The primary outcome was self‐care measured with the European Heart Failure Self‐care Behaviour Scale. Secondary outcomes were health status, mortality, and hospitalizations. In total, 450 patients were included. The mean age was 66.8 ± 11.0 years, 74.2% were male, and 78.8% classified themselves as New York Heart Association I or II at baseline. After 3 months of follow‐up, the mean score on the self‐care scale was significantly higher in the groups using the website and the adjusted care pathway compared to usual care (73.5 vs. 70.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6–6.2; and 78.2 vs. 70.8, 95% confidence interval 3.8– 9.4, respectively). The effect attenuated, until no differences after 1 year between the groups. Quality of life showed a similar pattern. Other secondary outcomes did not clearly differ between the groups. Conclusions Both the heartfailurematters.org website and an e‐health adjusted care pathway improved self‐care in HF patients on the short term, but not on the long term. Continuous updating of e‐health facilities could be helpful to sustain effects.

The aim of this study is to determine how often these three risk-prediction tools agree on the classification of patients as low risk (less than 1%) of major adverse cardiac event. Methods This is a retrospective observational study using a sample of 10,000 patient records. The risk of cardiac complications was calculated for the Revised Cardiac Index and the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest models using published coefficients, and for the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator using the publicly available website. The authors used the intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa analysis to quantify the degree of agreement between these three risk-prediction tools. Results There is good agreement between the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest estimates of major adverse cardiac events (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.70), while only poor agreement between (1) American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator and the Revised Cardiac Index (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.40), and (2) Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest and Revised Cardiac Index (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.30). The three prediction models disagreed 29% of the time on which patients were low risk.

We describe and assess a pragmatic approach to these patients first seen by a pediatric cardiologist in the New England region, using Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plans (SCAMPs). Ambulatory patients aged 7 to 21 years initially seen for syncope at participating New England Congenital Cardiology Association practices over a 2.5-year period were evaluated using a SCAMP. Findings were iteratively analyzed and the care pathway was revised. The vast majority (85%) of the 1254 patients had typical syncope. A minority had exercise-related or more problematic symptoms. Guideline-defined testing identified one patient with cardiac syncope. Syncope Severity Scores correlated well between physician and patient perceived symptoms. Orthostatic vital signs were of limited use. Largely incidental findings were seen in 10% of ECGs and 11% of echocardiograms. The 10% returning for follow-up, by design, reported more significant symptoms, but did not have newly recognized cardiac disease. Iterative analysis helped refine the approach. SCAMP methodology confirmed that the vast majority of children referred to the outpatient pediatric cardiology setting had typical low-severity neurally mediated syncope that could be effectively evaluated in a single visit using minimal resources. A simple scoring system can help triage patients into treatment categories. Prespecified criteria permitted the effective diagnosis of the single patient with a clear cardiac etiology. Patients with higher syncope scores still have a very low risk of cardiac disease, but may warrant attention.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.115.002931", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2292963030", "source": "openalex"}

The present position paper endorsed by the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) provides a comprehensive overview on the scientific evidence of psychosocial aspects of heart failure (HF). In order to synthesize newly available information and reinforce best medical practice, information was gathered via literature reviews and consultations of experts. It covers the evidence for aetiological and prospective psychosocial risk factors and major underlying psycho-biological mechanisms. The paper elucidates the need to include psychosocial aspects in self-care concepts and critically reviews the current shortcomings of psychotherapeutic and psycho-pharmacological interventions. It also highlights the need for involvement of psychological support in device therapy for patients with HF and finally calls for better palliative care in the final stage of HF progression.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwac006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210429736", "source": "openalex"}

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) is a standardized and widely used method, but the manual classification is an enormously time-consuming endeavor. Natural language processing together with machine learning allows automated structuring of diagnoses using ICD-10 codes, but the limited performance of machine learning models, the necessity of gigantic datasets, and poor reliability of terminal parts of these codes restricted clinical usability. We aimed to create a high performing pipeline for automated classification of reliable ICD-10 codes in the free medical text in cardiology. We focussed on frequently used and well-defined three- and four-digit ICD-10 codes that still have enough granularity to be clinically relevant such as atrial fibrillation (I48), acute myocardial infarction (I21), or dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0). Our pipeline uses a deep neural network known as a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network and was trained and tested with 5548 discharge letters and validated in 5089 discharge and procedural letters. As in clinical practice discharge letters may be labeled with more than one code, we assessed the single- and multilabel performance of main diagnoses and cardiovascular risk factors. We investigated using both the entire body of text and only the summary paragraph, supplemented by age and sex. Given the privacy-sensitive information included in discharge letters, we added a de-identification step. The performance was high, with F1 scores of 0.76–0.99 for three-character and 0.87–0.98 for four-character ICD-10 codes, and was best when using complete discharge letters. Adding variables age/sex did not affect results. For model interpretability, word coefficients were provided and qualitative assessment of classification was manually performed. Because of its high performance, this pipeline can be useful to decrease the administrative burden of classifying discharge diagnoses and may serve as a scaffold for reimbursement and research applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00404-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3131759468", "source": "openalex"}

However, in heart failure (HF), elevated body mass index (BMI) has been shown to be associated with better prognosis, but it is unknown whether this is the case in unselected HF patients encountered in routine clinical practice in Japan. Methods and Results: The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) studied prospectively the characteristics and treatments in a broad sample of patients hospitalized with worsening HF and the outcomes were followed for 2.1 years. Study cohort (n=2,488) was classified into 3 groups according to baseline BMI: <20.3kg/m2 (n=829), 20.3-23.49kg/m2 (n=832), and ≥23.5kg/m2 (n=827). The mean BMI was 22.3±4.1kg/m2. Patients with higher BMI had lower rates of all-cause death, cardiac death, and rehospitalization because of worsening HF. After multivariable adjustment, the risk for all-cause death and cardiac death significantly increased with decreased BMI levels compared with patients with BMI ≥23.5kg/m2. However, BMI levels were not associated with rehospitalization for worsening HF.

The British Nuclear Cardiology Group.", "text": "There is little information on the practice of nuclear cardiology in Great Britain. On behalf of the British Nuclear Cardiology Group in October 1988 we sent a postal questionnaire to 143 hospitals with nuclear medicine facilities (at least 70% of such hospitals). Sixty nine replies were received (48%), of which 23 (33%) were from teaching hospitals and 46 (39%) non-teaching. In these hospitals 147,904 isotope investigations were performed annually (mean 2311 per centre) of which 17,298 (12%) (mean 254 per centre) were cardiac studies. Of these, 59% were equilibrium radionuclide ventriculograms, 14% first pass ventriculograms, and 27% thallium-201 scans. Rest studies were performed more commonly by radiographers or technicians (63%) than by doctors (20%), but doctors were more commonly involved in stress studies (48%). Radiologists reported the studies more often (28%) than they performed them (6%). Methods of acquisition and analysis were varied and, for instance, the lower limit of normal left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 35% to 75% (mean 49%). For thallium imaging 42% of centres used dipyridamole in some patients and 24% used tomography. These data show that nuclear cardiology techniques are used much less frequently in Great Britain than in countries such as the United States and Germany, that the ratio of blood pool to myocardial perfusion imaging is much higher than elsewhere, and that methods are poorly standardised.

This study centers on the development and evaluation of an evidence‐based model curriculum for improving clinical attention to tobacco use and SHS exposure in cardiology. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the curriculum would be associated with improvements in clinician tobacco‐related knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and counseling behaviors from pre‐to post‐training and at the 3‐month follow‐up. Methods: The 1‐hour Cardiology Rx for Change curriculum was evaluated with 22 cardiology fellows and 77 medical residents with consistent training effects observed between the 2 groups. Results: Trainees' tobacco treatment knowledge increased significantly from pre‐ to post‐training (t[81] = 6.51, P&lt; 0.001), and perceived barriers to providing cessation treatment decreased significantly (t[81] = −3.97, P&lt; 0.001). The changes, however, were not sustained at the 3‐month follow‐up, suggesting the need for booster training efforts. From pretraining to 3‐month follow‐up, the training was associated with significant sustained gains in clinician confidence for treating tobacco dependence (t[61] = 3.69, P = 0.001) and with improvements in clinicians assessing patients' readiness to quit smoking (from 61% to 79%, t[59] = 3.69, P&lt; 0.001) and providing assistance with quitting (from 47% to 59%, t[59] = 2.12, P = 0.038). Asking patients about tobacco use, advising cessation, and arranging follow‐up also increased over time, but not significantly. All participants (100%) recommended the curriculum for dissemination to other training programs.

This is important for patients and staff who are exposed to ionising radiation during diagnostic imaging or interventional procedures. Ionising radiation refers to radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, which has enough energy to remove electrons from an atom. For the purposes of diagnostic imaging, this includes X-rays and gamma rays. The UK average background radiation dose is 2.7 mSv per year, and about 0.4 mSv (16%) of this is from diagnostic medical examinations.1 2 In the UK, the number of CT scans performed increased fivefold between 1996/1997 and 2012/2013.3 Similar trends are seen in other countries and with other imaging modalities. The USA has seen a threefold increase in the annual number of nuclear medicine procedures, and CT procedures have increased 20-fold between 1985 and 2005.4 Cardiac imaging and interventional procedures are responsible for approximately 40% of the US cumulative effective dose due to medical imaging.5 ### Estimating patient radiation dose The term ‘radiation dose’ can refer to one of several measures (table 1). Dose area product (DAP) is used in X-ray and fluoroscopic imaging (eg, invasive coronary angiography [ICA]). Radiation dose in CT is calculated from dose indices measured in standardised phantoms. Volume CT dose index (CTDIVOL) can be used to compare protocols, and dose length product (DLP) can be used to compare doses between patients for the same CT …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312493", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2914657109", "source": "openalex"}

DATA SOURCES: 1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines. STUDY SELECTION: The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described. CONCLUSIONS: Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST—segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. β -Adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy for vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.10319", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2102107074", "source": "openalex"}

AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, and detailed knowledge of its epidemiology is important both for provision of adequate care and for resource allocation. Available epidemiological studies have mainly focused on prevalence of AF. Important frequency variations have been recorded, often linked to different detection procedures.1 Most of what we know about the incidence of AF in the general population comes from two large North American studies and a single study from Britain mostly regarding hospitalized patients.1 Thus, the new population-based cohort study by Herringa et al. 2 on the epidemiological profile of AF in Rotterdam is highly relevant. This work, based on almost 8000 inhabitants of (a suburb of) Rotterdam aged at least 55 years at enrollment, provides a valuable picture of the age-specific prevalence and incidence of AF, as well as the lifetime risk of developing this clinically challenging arrhythmia. The Rotterdam study suggests that sex–age-specific incidence increases progressively before peaking at around 80 years. This result fits well with the main available data on incidence of AF, which are summarized in Figure 1 . The high reported lifetime risk of developing AF (around … *Corresponding author.

However, there is no common position taken by international cardiovascular societies to unite diverse availability, interpretation and application of such data, nor is there recognition of the challenges of variation in clinical practice between countries within Europe. Aside from the considerable barriers to implementing pharmacogenomic testing and the complexities of clinically actioning results, there are differences in the availability of resources and expertise internationally within Europe. Diverse legal and ethical approaches to genomic testing and clinical therapeutic application also require serious thought. As direct-to-consumer genomic testing becomes more common, it can be anticipated that data may be brought in by patients themselves, which will require critical assessment by the clinical cardiovascular prescriber. In a modern, pluralistic and multi-ethnic Europe, self-identified race/ethnicity may not be concordant with genetically detected ancestry and thus may not accurately convey polymorphism prevalence.

The interventional approach to the management of CHD in the adult population is becoming increasingly recognized as the preferred treatment option for a wide number of congenital cardiac conditions. The files of all consecutive patients over 18 years of age who were hospitalized in our department from January 2000 to December 2004 were reviewed. Over the study period, 1,115 ACHD (583 women; mean age 41 +/- 13.8, years, range 18-72 years) were hospitalized in our department; 752 patients underwent cardiac catheterization and 82.4% of them had an interventional procedure carried out. ASD (329/620) and PFO (159/620) closure account for 78% of all the procedures carried out, with a 2.7% of major complications incidence (all of them closing ASDs). Other procedures such as stenting aortic coarctation (40/620), ventricular septal defect closure (33/620), patent ductus arteriosus embolization (30/620), pulmonary valvuloplasty (12/620), stenting pulmonary artery branches (8/620), etc (5/620) were carried out. The most important complication was one death, which occurred in the case of a 22-year-old woman after stent implantation for a recurrent aortic coarctation. A trivial residual shunt was detected in only 5% of the patients who had a 6-month follow-up after VSD closure; no residual shunt was found after PDA embolization during the 12-month follow-up. In conclusion, we believe that the interventional approach is a safe and successful treatment option for a wide number of congenital cardiac conditions. The increasing use of catheter interventions for these patients will be responsible for an increase of complex cases in surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.20612", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016698139", "source": "openalex"}

The number of interventions continues to increase, and the associated radiation exposure to patients and personnel is of major concern. This study was undertaken to determine whether a newly developed x-ray tube deploying grid-switched pulsed fluoroscopy and extra beam filtering can achieve a reduction in radiation exposure while maintaining fluoroscopic images of high quality.Three fluoroscopic techniques were compared: continuous fluoroscopy, pulsed fluoroscopy, and a newly developed high-output pulsed fluoroscopy with extra filtering. To ascertain differences in the quality of images and to determine differences in patient entrance and investigator radiation exposure, the radiated volume curve was measured to determine the required high voltage levels (kVpeak) for different object sizes for each fluoroscopic mode. The fluoroscopic data of 124 patient procedures were combined. The data were analyzed for radiographic projections, image intensifier field size, and x-ray tube kilovoltage levels (kVpeak). On the basis of this analysis, a reference procedure was constructed. The reference procedure was tested on a phantom or dummy patient by all three fluoroscopic modes. The phantom was so designed that the kilovoltage requirements for each projection were comparable to those needed for the average patient. Radiation exposure of the operator and patient was measured during each mode. The patient entrance dose was measured in air, and the operator dose was measured by 18 dosimeters on a dummy operator. Pulsed compared with continuous fluoroscopy could be performed with improved image quality at lower kilovoltages. The patient entrance dose was reduced by 21% and the operator dose by 54%. High-output pulsed fluoroscopy with extra beam filtering compared with continuous fluoroscopy improved the image quality, lowered the kilovoltage requirements, and reduced the patient entrance dose by 55% and the operator dose by 69%.High-output pulsed fluoroscopy with a grid-switched tube and extra filtering improves the image quality and significantly reduces both the operator dose and patient dose.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.89.6.2710", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2059257962", "source": "openalex"}

Prospective studies that evaluated the ESC 0/1-hour, 0/2-hour, or 0/3-hour algorithms in adult patients presenting with suspected AMI. The primary outcome was index AMI. Twenty unique cohorts were identified. Primary data were obtained from investigators of 16 cohorts and aggregate data were extracted from 4 cohorts. Two independent authors assessed each study for methodological quality. A total of 32 studies (20 cohorts) with 30 066 patients were analyzed.

We sought to describe the perceptions and attitudes of caregivers in cardiology regarding end-of-life situations. We performed a qualitative study using semi-directive interviews in the cardiology department of a university teaching hospital in France. Physicians, nurses and nurses' aides working full-time in the department at the time of the study were eligible. Participants were asked to describe how they experienced end-of-life situations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded using thematic analysis to identify major and secondary themes. All physicians (N = 16)(average age 43.5 ± 13 years), 16 nurses (average age 38.5 ± 7.6 years) and 5 nurses' aides (average age 49 ± 7.8 years) participated. Interviews were held between 30 March and 17 July 2017. The main themes to emerge from the physicians' discourse were the concept of cardiology being a very active discipline, and a very curative frame of mind was prevalent. Communication (with paramedical staff, patients and families) was deemed to be important. Advance directives were thought to be rare, and not especially useful. Nurses also reported communication as a major issue, but their form of communication is bounded by several factors (physicians' prior discourse, legislation). They commonly engage in reconciling: between the approach (curative or palliative) and the reality of the treatment prescribed; performing curative interventions in patients they deem to be dying cases causes them distress. The emergency context prevents nurses from taking the time necessary to engage in end-of-life discussions. They engage in comfort-giving behaviors to maximize patient comfort. Current perceptions and practices vis-à-vis end-of-life situations in our department are individual, heterogeneous and not yet aligned with recommendations of professional societies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-018-0366-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2895502079", "source": "openalex"}

Thirty three (15 stable and 18 unstable) patients undergoing single lesion percutaneous transluminal coronary angio plasty were studied with intravascular ultrasound before and after intervention. All examinations, recorded on S-VHS video tape, were studied off-line and matched sites from the point of minimum lumen area after the procedure and the corresponding site prior to intervention were com pared. The morphology of lesions before intervention was noted and the mechanisms of angioplasty (vessel stretch, lesion remodelling and lesion tears) were determined by comparing pre- and post-interventional morphology and dimensions. The only significant morphological difference between stable and unstable lesions was the presence of a demarcated inner layer in unstable lesions, delimited by a fine circumferential line. This pattern was noted in 77% (14/18) of unstable lesions and in 7% (1/15) of stable lesions (P<0·0l). Unstable lesions tended to have more echolucent zones than stable lesions (72% (13/18) vs 46% (7/15), P=0·13) The mechanisms of angioplasty were also found to differ. Whereas lesion remodelling (or 'compression') was seen in 77% (14/18) of unstable lesions, it occurred in only 13% (2/15) of stable lesions and mean lesion cross- sectional area reduction was greater in unstable lesions, −14·8±8·3% (2·1+1·3 mm2) compared to stable lesions, −4sup1+8·4% (0·42+0·9 mm P<0·0l. In contrast, vessel stretch was seen more frequently in stable lesions (73%, 11/15) compared to unstable lesions (22%, 4/18) P<0·0l and the mean increase in vessel cross-sectional area was +13·5±6·8 (1·6±0·9 mm2 in stable lesions compared to +5·5±5·6% (0·8+0·9 mm2 in unstable lesions, P<0·01. Lesion tear was present to a similar degree in both groups of patients. In this observational study we found a set of echographic markers that distinguished unstable lesions. The mechanisms of angioplasty differed between stable and unstable angina, with greater lesion remodelling seen in unstable lesions and vessel stretch in stable lesions.

This concept, however, was based on a few studies of small and selected series of highly trained athletes from a limited number of sports disciplines.5,6 Systematic pre-participation screening in Italy offers the unique opportunity to investigate ECG changes in large cohorts of athletes, engaged in a broad variety of sports activities with different levels of training and fitness.1,2,4,7 The data available define the spectrum of athletes’ ECG patterns, which permits delineation of common, physiological ECG changes and uncommon ECG abnormalities which are usually unrelated to training but associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. This new perspective in the interpretation of an athlete's ECG raises the need for a revision of accuracy, utility, and cost–benefit analysis of the use of ECG in screening athletes for cardiovascular diseases. In Table 1, athletes' ECG abnormalities are divided into two groups according to their prevalence, relationship to exercise training, association with an increased cardiovascular risk, and need for further clinical investigation to … *Corresponding author.

Although the cause remains unknown, discussion sections highlight new insights into the epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, pathology, natural history, and long-term outcomes. Prompt diagnosis is essential, and an updated algorithm defines supplemental information to be used to assist the diagnosis when classic clinical criteria are incomplete. Although intravenous immune globulin is the mainstay of initial treatment, the role for additional primary therapy in selected patients is discussed. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients do not respond to initial intravenous immune globulin, and recommendations for additional therapies are provided. Careful initial management of evolving coronary artery abnormalities is essential, necessitating an increased frequency of assessments and escalation of thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification for long-term management is based primarily on maximal coronary artery luminal dimensions, normalized as Z scores, and is calibrated to both past and current involvement.

Patients with a high degree of stenosis have a significant rate of stroke despite medical therapy. Two randomized trials of stenting have failed to show benefit. Improving periprocedural complication rates and patient selection may improve stenting outcomes. Fractional flow reserve (FFR), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are intravascular imaging techniques employed to improve patient selection and stent placement in interventional cardiology. FFR has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes when used in patient selection for intervention. Studies of FFR in intracranial atherosclerosis show that the measure may predict which plaques lead to stroke. IVUS is used in cardiology to quantify stenosis and assist with stent placement. Comparisons with histology show that it can reliably characterize plaques. Several case reports of IVUS in intracranial arteries show the technique to be feasible and indicate it may improve stent placement. Plaque characteristics on IVUS may help identify vulnerable plaques. In interventional cardiology, OCT provides excellent visualization of vessel geometry and is useful periprocedurally. Images reliably identify thin-capped fibroatheromas and other plaque features. Case reports indicate that OCT is safe for use in intracranial arteries.

Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1601-5215.2002.51020.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2040598063", "source": "openalex"}

It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.

Between the 10-year period before the interventions and the 3-year period during the interventions, there was a significant increase in the annual mean (SD) percentage of women (22.4% [2.9%] vs 26.4% [0.07%];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and UREG applicants (10.5% [1.1%] vs 12.5% [1.9%];<i>P</i> = .01) to the program. Among applicants interviewed, the percentage of women increased from 20.0% to 33.5% (<i>P</i> = .01) and that of and UREGs increased from 14.0% to 20.0% (<i>P</i> = .01). Before the interventions, a mean (SD) of 23.2% (16.2%) women and 9.7% (7.8%) UREGs matriculated as first-year fellows, whereas after the interventions, a mean (SD) of 54.2% (7.2%) women and 33.3% (19.0%) UREGs matriculated as first-year fellows. The proportion of the entire fellowship who were women increased from a 5-year mean (SD) of 27.0% (8.8%) to 54.2% (7.2%) after 3 years of interventions, and that of UREGs increased from 5.6% (4.6%) to 33.3% (19.0%). Overall, the proportion of applicants in the entire population who were either women or from UREGs increased from 27.8% to 66.7%. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> After implementing interventions to promote equity of opportunity in the cardiovascular disease fellowship, the percentage of women and UREGs significantly increased in the fellowship over a 3-year time period. These interventions may be applicable to other cardiovascular disease fellowships seeking to diversify training programs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.30832", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3120565569", "source": "openalex"}

Although each method is appropriate in certain subgroups, their application frequently lacks a scientific basis. Current, clinically relevant, evidence-based practice guidelines are needed for secondary prevention for survivors after an AMI. To meet this need, the California Cardiology Working Group was assembled to evaluate the available data from clinical trials and other published studies and develop evidence-based, cost-effective guidelines for clinicians to use as a basis for patient management after an AMI. The group consisted of 18 members, including cardiologists from academic institutions and physicians working in cardiac intensive care, private practices, and managed care settings, representing a broad spectrum of expertise pertaining to patients who have had an AMI. The members had expertise in cardiac intensive care, interventional cardiology, nuclear cardiology, lipid disorders, echocardiography, and cardiac rehabilitation. The intended audience for these practice guidelines includes all physicians who treat survivors of MI. A literature review of all relevant clinical trials and other published data about the natural history after AMI and the effects of current therapeutic modalities are discussed herein. Case histories served as models for application of the literature-based data. The recommendations for management were reached by consensus vote based on the scientific evidence.

A cardiac problem, such as the bidomain or monodomain model, consists of a singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion system coupled with a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations. The algorithm first uses an operator splitting technique to separate linear diffusion from nonlinear stiff reactions in the model problem to be solved. The reactions are integrated adaptively with a second-order singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method. The decoupled linear diffusion is implicitly discretized with a conforming finite element approximation on adaptively refined grids, which are dynamically created by the AMR algorithm. The resulting composite grid equations are solved by a standard multilevel/multigrid iteration algorithm. The AMR algorithm uses quadrilateral or hexahedral elements to construct a hierarchy of properly nested level grids. The grid on each level is generated through regular bisection or refinement from a subgrid of that on the previous coarser level. We represent a grid by lists of elements and the lower dimensional facets, including nodes, edges and sides. With this grid representation, the connectivity of grid entities is well established, which makes grid-based operations easy to implement. Since the composite grids in the hierarchy do not match along coarse-fine grid interfaces, the Steklov-Poincare continuity conditions are weakly enforced, which results in a conforming finite element discretization on composite grids. The AMR algorithm follows Berger-Oliger's approach in time stepping. The hierarchical system is recursively integrated. Starting from the root level, a coarse level is first integrated with a large time step, followed by integrating its next finer level with a few small time steps until both levels are synchronized. At the moment of synchronization, the algorithm invokes some of the typical routines such as mesh regridding and data up-/downscaling. An error estimation technique of Richardson extrapolation type is proposed for tagging of cells. Numerical experiments with the AMR algorithm are presented at the end as part of the thesis work. It is demonstrated that the convergence rate of our AMR algorithm is second-order. Numerical results also show the numerical accuracy, algorithm efficiency, geometry flexibility and the promising application to realistic simulations of our AMR algorithm.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2506880855", "source": "openalex"}

In addition, there have been several advances in cardiac imaging, especially in 3-dimensional imaging of echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cineangiography. Therefore, more types of congenital heart diseases can be treated in the cardiac catheter laboratory today than ever before. Furthermore, lesions previously considered resistant to interventional therapies can now be managed with high success rates. The hybrid approach has enabled the overcoming of limitations inherent to percutaneous access, expanding the application of endovascular therapies as adjunct to surgical interventions to improve patient outcomes and minimize invasiveness. Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation has become a successful alternative therapy. However, most of the current recommendations about pediatric cardiac interventions (including class I recommendations) refer to off-label use of devices, because it is difficult to study the safety and efficacy of catheterization and transcatheter therapy in pediatric cardiac patients. This difficulty arises from the challenge of identifying a control population and the relatively small number of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Nevertheless, the pediatric interventional cardiology community has continued to develop less invasive solutions for congenital heart defects to minimize the need for open heart surgery and optimize overall outcomes. In this review, various interventional procedures in patients with congenital heart disease are explored.

The aim is for all patients resident in Portugal who are eligible for CR programs to have the same opportunities for access and attendance. In order to preserve the benefits and safety of this intervention, CR needs to be performed according to international guidelines. The fact that various initiatives in this field have been developed by different professional groups, some of them non-medical, that do not follow the European guidelines, has prompted us to prepare a series of norms defining mandatory criteria for CR, based on current knowledge and evidence.

Clinical evidence for any high-risk device must be reported by the manufacturer in a Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) that will be publicly available in the European Union Database on Medical Devices (Eudamed) maintained by the European Commission; this will facilitate evidence-based choices of which devices to recommend. Hospitals must record all device implantations, and each high-risk device will be trackable by Unique Device Identification (UDI). Important new roles are envisaged for clinicians, scientists, and engineers in EU Expert Panels—in particular to scrutinize clinical data submitted by manufacturers for certain high-risk devices and the evaluations of that data made by notified bodies. They will advise manufacturers on the design of their clinical studies and recommend to regulators when new technical specifications or guidance are needed. Physicians should support post-market surveillance by reporting adverse events and by contributing to comprehensive medical device registries. A second law on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices will take effect from 2022.

Moreover, Turkey currently has the highest rate of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Europe. During the last decades, Turkey made fundamental reforms in the health system to improve the treatment of risk factors to prevent CVD. The most outstanding success was in the area of tobacco control (13.4% decrease in smoking prevalence) and decreasing the salt consumption of the population (from 18 to 9.9 g/day) leading to a significant decrease in CVD mortality from 45% to 36.8% of all deaths. However, obesity and diabetes are increasing rapidly as a result of urbanization, low physical activity and unhealthy eating and the new generation is starting to take up smoking. The increase in cardiometabolic risk factors and aging of the population are expected to increase the number of CVD deaths. All CVD risk factors except smoking are significantly more prevalent in women. In addition, rare disease is a country specific problem with a significant contribution to the high rates of premature CVD in Turkey. Despite major improvements in management in acute coronary syndromes, sustained achievement in guideline recommended goals is suboptimal.

We asked about aspirin prescribing, lipid testing, and lipid-lowering drug prescribing. <h3>Results</h3> Of 202 physicians surveyed, 99 (49%) responded. The physicians made guideline-concordant aspirin decisions 51% to 91% of the time using risk factor information alone. Providing 10-year risk estimates increased concordant aspirin prescribing when the 10-year coronary risk was moderately high (15%) and decreased guideline-discordant prescribing when the 10-year risk was low (2 of 4 cases). Providing the lifetime risk information sometimes increased guideline-discordant aspirin prescribing. The physicians selected guideline-concordant thresholds for initiating treatment with lipid-lowering drugs 44% to 75% of the time using risk factor information alone. Selecting too low or too high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol thresholds was common. Ten-year risk information improved concordance when the 10-year risk was moderately high. Providing lifetime risk information increased willingness to initiate pharmacotherapy at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were lower than those recommended by guidelines when the 10-year risk was low but the lifetime risk was high. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Providing 10-year coronary risk information improved some hypothetical aspirin-prescribing decisions and improved lipid management when the short-term risk was moderately high.

The data of the remaining 255 patients (149 males; mean age, 65 ± 13 years; range, 18–95 years) are presented. Mean conventional blood pressure was significantly lower compared with the wrist device (137 ± 20/80 ± 11 mmHg versus 153 ± 28/87 ± 18 mmHg; P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). The mean difference was 16 ± 25/6 ± 17 mmHg. In clinical terms, differences in blood pressure exceeding ±20/±10 mmHg reflecting classification of hypertension are considered important. Measurements of 101 (40%) patients were within these limits. Systolic readings of 110 (43%) and diastolic readings of 117 patients (46%) were beyond this scope. Conclusion Due to low reliability of wrist blood pressure measurement, it cannot compete with the upper arm standard procedure. If ever, it should only be used if test readings in an individual comparing wrist and upper arm measurement show differences within a range of ±20/±10 mmHg.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004872-200018080-00004", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001639725", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS AND RESULTS: Under the auspice of the Clinical Practice Guideline Quality Indicator Committee of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the Working Group for cardiac pacing QIs was formed. The Group comprised Task Force members of the 2021 ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, members of the European Heart Rhythm Association, international cardiac device experts, and patient representatives. We followed the ESC methodology for QI development, which involved (i) the identification of the key domains of care by constructing a conceptual framework of the management of patients receiving cardiac pacing, (ii) the development of candidate QIs by conducting a systematic review of the literature, (iii) the selection of the final set of QIs using a modified-Delphi method, and (iv) the evaluation of the feasibility of the developed QIs. Four domains of care were identified: (i) structural framework, (ii) patient assessment, (iii) pacing strategy, and (iv) clinical outcomes. In total, seven main and four secondary QIs were selected across these domains and were embedded within the 2021 ESC Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization therapy. CONCLUSION: By way of a standardized process, 11 QIs for cardiac pacing were developed. These indicators may be used to quantify adherence to guideline-recommended clinical practice and have the potential to improve the care and outcomes of patients receiving cardiac pacemakers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab193", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3196720277", "source": "openalex"}

In view of the unique function that KATP channels play in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, this novel class of ion channel modulators adds to existent pharmacotherapy with potential in promoting cellular protection under conditions of metabolic stress. Indeed, experimental studies have demonstrated broad therapeutic potential for KCOs, including roles as cardioprotective agents, vasodilators, bronchodilators, bladder relaxants, anti-epileptics, insulin secretagogues and promoters of hair growth.

Focus of the evaluation is on telemedicine effectiveness and usability, either from a patient’s or a medical operator’s perspective. The evaluation has been performed by testing three remote health platforms designed according to different technological approaches, in a realistic scenario involving older adults and medical operators (doctors and nurses). The aim of the testing activity was not to benchmark a specific solution with respect to the others, but to evaluate the main positive and negative issues related to the system and service design philosophy each solution was built upon. Though preliminary, the results discussed in the paper can be used as a set of guidelines in the selection of proper technological equipments for services targeted to elderly users, from a usability perspective. These results need to be complemented with more focused discussions of the ethical, medical, and legal aspects of the use of technology in remote healthcare.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/104561", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115814224", "source": "openalex"}

Identifying and reporting medical errors is one of the most significant steps toward the adoption of measures to increase patient safety.The goal of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to evaluate attitudes toward patient safety and the tendencies to medical error among cardiology and cardiovascular surgery nurses in Turkey.The study sample consisted of nurses who worked in the cardiology and cardiovascular surgery departments of a University Hospital in Izmir, the third largest city in Turkey. A total of 103 nurses working in the day shift of the mentioned departments volunteered and participated in the study. A \"Nurse Information Form,\" a \"Patient Safety Attitude Questionnaire (PSAQ),\" and a \"Malpractice Tendency Scale in Nursing-(MTSN)\" were used as data collection instruments.The mean ± 1 standard deviation of the nurses' PSAQ scores were 141.86 ± 18.39, whereas their MTSN scores were 237.20 ± 18.12. Although no statistically significant difference could be evidenced between cardiology and cardiovascular surgery nurses in their total MTSN scores (t = -0.99, P = 0.32), their PSAQ scores showed a significant difference (t = 2.34, P = 0.02).This study showed that the tendencies to medical error among cardiology and cardiovascular surgery nurses working in a Turkish facility were low, whereas their attitudes toward patient safety were not at a particularly satisfactory level. The cardiology nurses were found to have a more positive attitude toward patient safety than their colleagues in cardiovascular surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000202", "url": "https://openalex.org/W263609682", "source": "openalex"}

The Army Knowledge Online (AKO) Telemedicine Consultation Program was initiated by the Office of the Surgeon General to electronically link deployed medical providers with subspecialty consultants to assist and guide triage and disposition.Electronic consultation triggered a text page to an on-call staff cardiologist at Brooke Army Medical Center. Cardiology teleconsultations for the first 3.5 years were analyzed.Two hundred seven cardiology teleconsults were managed, with an average response time of 4 hours 54 minutes. The three most prevalent reasons for teleconsultation were electrocardiographic abnormalities, chest pain syndromes, and syncope. Six evacuations were avoided; 29 evacuations were facilitated. An estimated $144,000 was saved, plus intangible benefits.Cardiology teleconsultation provides a valuable service to deployed providers, decreases medical evacuation costs, and facilitates transfer of patients to appropriate facilities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7205/milmed-d-00-2309", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969833809", "source": "openalex"}

Methods In this prospective case–control study, all patients aged 11–18 years with chest pain and no history of trauma and referred to a paediatric cardiology clinic from March, 2009–April, 2010 were selected. A chest pain protocol including a detailed history, full physical examination, required blood tests, electrocardiography, and echocardiography was performed for all. The presence of depression and anxiety and their severity were assessed by Beck questionnaires. The patients were compared with age- and sex-matched, randomly selected healthy controls. Results In total, 194 patients with a mean age of 14±2 years were selected. The most frequent presentation was idiopathic chest pain (43.3%), followed by the psychological group (29.9%). These groups had no abnormal points in history, physical, and para-clinical tests. Moderate-to-severe depression was found in 45.9% in the patients group, compared with 17.6% of controls, which was statistically significant (p=0.016). Moreover, anxiety was detected in 67.5% of patients versus 15.4% in controls, which is a statistically significant difference (p=0.009). Cardiac chest pain with 9.27% was the most common type of organic causes. Conclusion Chest pain during teenage is more prevalent, but not risky. Undergoing a detailed history and full physical examination can help diagnose the causes in the majority of cases. Given the prevalence of a psychological group as well as role of anxiety and depression in most patients, referring to a psychiatrist is suggested.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951116000238", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2300063497", "source": "openalex"}

Among the biomarkers used extensively in clinical practice in cardiology, hs-TroponinT, CK-MB and NTproBNP have been shown to be strongly influenced by multiple neurological conditions. Newer ones such as galectin-3, lysophosphatidylcholine, copeptin, sST2, S100B, myeloperoxidase and GDF-15 have been extensively studied in recent years as alternatives with an increased sensitivity for cardiovascular diseases, but also with significant results in the field of neurology.

In 1665, the Royal Society released the first medical journal, Philosophical Transactions. In 1812, the New England Journal of Medicine published its first edition. As a means to widely circulate advances in medical science in the 19th and 20th centuries, multiple medical journals focusing on medical subspecialties were subsequently founded to share newly discovered data. The European Society of Cardiology was established around World War II. On 29 January 1949, 14 National Societies established the Board and laid down its by-laws. The following year (1950), the First General Assembly, comprised of 200 people, met in Paris for the World Congress of Cardiology and discussed general cardiology topics. The field of interventional cardiology was born following Andreas Gruentzig’s first successful coronary angioplasty on 16 September 1977 using a balloon dilatation catheter in which he treated a short lesion in the left anterior descending artery. Gruentzig presented the results of his first four angioplasty cases at the 1977 American Heart Association meeting. Between 1978 and 1980, he organised four courses in Zurich, Switzerland, demonstrating his new technique in humans. In 1983, Professor Jean Marco organised the first course on angioplasty with live cases from Toulouse. Over the next 35 years, this course evolved from a French to a European gathering and finally, now an international conference with more than 12 000 attendees.1 As interventional cardiology became more widespread, due to refinements in stent platforms, pharmacotherapy and advances in other technologies, particularly in the structural arena, societies have sought options to accommodate such growth. One such option includes smaller chapters conducting their own regional or institutional workshops and meetings. With the advent of the World Wide Web, individual researchers have relied on the PubMed Medline …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2019-001031", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2944888207", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the study was to compare the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the 2017 International criteria for differential diagnosis between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and athlete's heart.The study populations included 200 patients with HCM and 563 athletes grouped as follows: 'group 1', including normal ECG and isolated increase of QRS voltages, which are considered non-pathologic according to ESC and International criteria; 'group 2', including left atrial enlargement or left axis deviation in isolation and Q-waves with an amplitude ≥4 mm but <25% of the ensuing R-wave and a duration <0.04 s which are considered pathologic according to the ESC but not according to the International criteria; and 'group 3', including abnormalities which are considered pathologic according to ESC and International criteria.Overall, the 2010 ESC criteria showed a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 86.9%. Considering group 2 ECG changes as normal according to the International criteria led to a statistically significant (p<0.001) increase of specificity to 95.9%, associated with a non-significant (p=0.47) reduction of sensitivity to 93%. Among patients with HCM, there was a significant increase of maximal left ventricular wall thickness from group 1 to 3 (p=0.02).The use of 2017 International criteria is associated with a substantial increase in specificity and a marginal decrease in sensitivity for differential diagnosis between HCM and athlete's heart.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2016-097438", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2735512315", "source": "openalex"}

Methods and results In this substudy of a multicentre randomized controlled trial, we compared 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)-endorsed pre-test probabilities with observed prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease on computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). We assessed associations between pre-test probability, 5-year coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction and study intervention (standard care vs. CTCA). The study population consisted of 3755 patients (30–75 years, 46% women) with a median pre-test probability of 11% of whom 1622 (43%) had a pre-test probability of &amp;gt;15%. In those who underwent CTCA (n = 1613), the prevalence of obstructive disease was 22%. When divided into deciles of pre-test probability, the observed disease prevalence was similar but higher than the corresponding median pre-test probability [median difference 2.3 (1.3–5.6)%]. There were more clinical events in patients with a pre-test probability &amp;gt;15% compared to those at 5–15% and &amp;lt;5% (4.1%, 1.5%, and 1.4%, respectively, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Across the total cohort, fewer clinical events occurred in patients who underwent CTCA, with the greatest difference in those with a pre-test probability &amp;gt;15% (2.8% vs. 5.3%, log rank P = 0.01), although this interaction was not statistically significant on multivariable modelling. Conclusion The updated 2019 ESC guideline pre-test probability recommendations tended to slightly underestimate disease prevalence in our cohort. Pre-test probability is a powerful predictor of future coronary events and helps select those who may derive the greatest absolute benefit from CTCA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjqcco/qcaa006", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3002710937", "source": "openalex"}

Thus, we compared the association between WC and BMI with all‐cause mortality in relation to traditional CAD risk factors in a high‐risk cohort. Study population included 5,453 consecutive new patients seen between 1996 and 2005 for management of CAD risk factors in a preventive cardiology clinic. Mortality was determined from the Social Security Death Index. There were 359 deaths over a median follow‐up of 5.2 years. Mortality was greater in high (&gt;102 cm in men and &gt;88 cm in women) vs. normal WC in both genders ( P &lt; 0.01). The unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) for continuous WC (per cm) was 1.02 ( P &lt; 0.001) in both genders and remained significant after adjustment for CAD risk factors (HR = 1.01 in men, HR = 1.03 in women, both P &lt; 0.05). BMI did not associate statistically with mortality. WC associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and CAD prevalence ( P &lt; 0.001). BMI associated only with DM ( P &lt; 0.001) and this association disappeared when WC was added to the model. We conclude that WC is an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality in a preventive cardiology population. These data affirm the clinical importance of WC measurements for mortality, DM, and CAD risk prediction and suggest that obesity‐specific interventions targeting WC in addition to traditional risk factor management may favorably impact these outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.44", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2005489545", "source": "openalex"}

Percutaneous transluminal coronary interventions have become the most prevalent treatment option for coronary artery disease; however, due to serious complications, such as stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis (ISR), the efficacy and safety of the procedure remain important issues to address. Strategies to overcome these aspects are under extensive investigation. In this review, we summarise relevant milestones during the time to overcome these limitations of coronary stents, such as the development of polymer-free drug-eluting stents (DES) to avoid pro-inflammatory response due to the polymer coating or the developement of stents with cell-directing drugs to, simultaneously, improve re-endothelialisation and inhibit ISR amongst other techniques most recently developed, which have not fully entered the clinical stage.

The earlier the reperfusion therapy is instituted, the higher the incidence of aborted infarction. Treatment within an hour after symptom onset may result in 25% of aborted infarction and is in combination with complete (70%) ST-segment resolution associated with better survival. This endpoint is easy to define and occurs promptly in time. The faster that effective treatment is initiated, the more likely aborted infarction will occur.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) performed a multinational educational needs assessment study among cardiologists, general practitioners/family physicians (GPs/FPs), and neurologists in order to evaluate knowledge and skills of physicians and system factors related to AF care delivery. A total of 561 physicians (294 cardiologists, 131 neurologists, and 136 GPs/FPs) from six European countries participated. This mixed-methods study included exploratory semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 30) and a quantitative survey that included two clinical cases (n = 531). We identified eight key knowledge gaps and system barriers across all domains of AF care. A majority across all specialties reported skills needing improvement to classify AF pathophysiologically, rather than based on duration of episodes, and reported lack of availability of long-term electrocardiogram recording. Skills interpreting the CHA2DS2-VASc and the HAS-BLED scores were reported as needing improvement by the majority of neurologists (52% and 60%, respectively) and GPs/FPs (65% and 74%). Cardiologists calculated the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores in 94%/70% in a presented case patient, but only 60%/49% of neurologists and 58%/42% of GPs/FPs did. There was much uncertainty on how to deal with anticoagulant therapy in complex patients. There was also a high disparity in using rate or rhythm control strategies, and indications for ablation. Information delivery to patients and communication between different specialties was often considered suboptimal, while national regulations and restrictions often hamper international guideline implementation. We identified major gaps in physicians’ knowledge and skills across all domains of AF care, as well as system factors hampering guideline-compliant care implementation and communication. These gaps should be addressed by targeted educational and advocacy efforts.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euy039", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2793861793", "source": "openalex"}

Since its introduction in the clinic 20 years ago, use of intravascular ultrasound innovation has been relatively limited. Intravascular ultrasound remains a niche technology; its clinical practice did not vastly expand, except in Japan, where intravascular ultrasound is an appraised tool for guiding percutaneous coronary interventions. In this qualitative research study, we follow scholarship on the sociology of innovation in exploring both the current adoption practices and perspectives on the future of intravascular ultrasound. We conducted a survey of biomedical experts with experience in the technology, the practice, and the commercialization of intravascular ultrasound. The collected information enabled us to map intravascular ultrasound controversies as well as to outline the dynamics of the international network of experts that generates intravascular ultrasound innovations and uses intravascular ultrasound technologies. While the technology is praised for its capacity to measure coronary atherosclerotic plaque morphology and is steadily used in clinical research, the lack of demonstrated benefits of intravascular ultrasound guided coronary interventions emerges as the strongest factor that prevents its expansion. Furthermore, most of the controversies identified were external to intravascular ultrasound technology itself, meaning that decision making at the industrial, financial and regulatory levels are likely to determine the future of intravascular ultrasound. In light of opinions from the responding experts', a wider adoption of intravascular ultrasound as a stand-alone imaging modality seems rather uncertain, but the appeal for this technology may be renewed by improving image quality and through combination with complementary imaging modalities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097215", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110265601", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4317780090", "title": "2023 Guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology on the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Coronary Syndrome.", "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) covers a wide spectrum from persons who are asymptomatic to those presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and sudden cardiac death. Coronary atherosclerotic disease is a chronic, progressive process that leads to atherosclerotic plaque development and progression within the epicardial coronary arteries. Being a dynamic process, CAD generally presents with a prolonged stable phase, which may then suddenly become unstable and lead to an acute coronary event. Thus, the concept of \"stable CAD\" may be misleading, as the risk for acute events continues to exist, despite the use of pharmacological therapies and revascularization. Many advances in coronary care have been made, and guidelines from other international societies have been updated. The 2023 guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for CAD introduce a new concept that categorizes the disease entity according to its clinical presentation into acute or chronic coronary syndromes (ACS and CCS, respectively). Previously defined as stable CAD, CCS include a heterogeneous population with or without chest pain, with or without prior ACS, and with or without previous coronary revascularization procedures. As cardiologists, we now face the complexity of CAD, which involves not only the epicardial but also the microcirculatory domains of the coronary circulation and the myocardium. New findings about the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis have changed the clinical landscape. After a nearly 50-year ischemia-centric paradigm of coronary stenosis, growing evidence indicates that coronary atherosclerosis and its features are both diagnostic and therapeutic targets beyond obstructive CAD. Taken together, these factors have shifted the clinicians' focus from the functional evaluation of coronary ischemia to the anatomic burden of disease. Research over the past decades has strengthened the case for prevention and optimal medical therapy as central interventions in patients with CCS. Even though functional capacity has clear prognostic implications, it does not include the evaluation of non-obstructive lesions, plaque burden or additional risk-modifying factors beyond epicardial coronary stenosis-driven ischemia. The recommended first-line diagnostic tests for CCS now include coronary computed tomographic angiography, an increasingly used anatomic imaging modality capable of detecting not only obstructive but also non-obstructive coronary plaques that may be missed with stress testing. This non-invasive anatomical modality improves risk assessment and potentially allows for the appropriate allocation of preventive therapies. Initial invasive strategies cannot improve mortality or the risk of myocardial infarction. Emphasis should be placed on optimizing the control of risk factors through preventive measures, and invasive strategies should be reserved for highly selected patients with refractory symptoms, high ischemic burden, high-risk anatomies, and hemodynamically significant lesions. These guidelines provide current evidence-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the guidelines are not mandatory, and members of the Task Force fully realize that the treatment of CCS should be individualized to address each patient's circumstances. Ultimately, the decision of healthcare professionals is most important in clinical practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.6515/acs.202301_39(1).20221103a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4317780090", "source": "openalex"}

This desire has been highlighted by the recent, and ongoing, enquiry into the outcome of paediatric cardiac surgery at the unit in Bristol, in the United Kingdom, and the resulting obligation to provide national and international comparisons of surgical results between centres caring for these patients. In order to incorporate effective clinical governance and best practice into our speciality, a method is required to gather accurate and validated data on the diagnosis, therapy and outcome of patients with heart disease from prenatal life through to adulthood. This would facilitate comparisons between individual units which fully take into account the mix of cases involved, and thus attempt to focus on the relevant and genuine factors underlying the differing outcomes in terms of both mortality and morbidity. For this to be achieved, it is essential to have a comprehensive system of coding and classification, using mutually exclusive and unambivalent terms. The system must be both easy to use, and fulfil the needs and expectations of widely different cultures of practice. Although many centres have developed their own system of internal audit, with their own coding system, and some co-operation has taken place between centres nationally and across international boundaries within Europe by the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Federation (see below), a cohesive, and comprehensive system suitable for setting standards has yet to emerge. Historically, this has partly been due to the lack of recognition by governments of the importance of such a process, with underfunding of initiatives aimed at addressing these issues, both technologically and in terms of human resources.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951100007757", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4230170974", "source": "openalex"}

Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of organizations and individuals that are more inclined to adopt and utilize cardiovascular devices based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, organizational, individual, and technological factors and to identify corresponding implications for HTA. Seven random intercept hurdle models were estimated using the data obtained from 1249 surveys completed by members of the European Society of Cardiology. The major findings were that better manufacturer support increased the adoption probability of ‘new’ devices (i.e. in terms of CE mark approval dates), and that budget pressure increased the adoption probability of ‘old’ devices. Based on our findings, we suggest investigating the role of manufacturer support in more detail to identify diffusion patterns relevant to HTA on system level, to verify whether it functions as a substitute for medical evidence of new devices, and to receive new insights about its relationship with clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness. © 2017 The Authors.

The risk factors causing delirium and the presence and type of delirium affect the nurse workload and patient care quality adversely.This cross-sectional study was conducted with 133 patients staying at the cardiology ICU of a university hospital between 5 January-31 March 2017.The study data were collected using the Patient Information Form, Delirium Risk Factors' Form and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28 (TISS-28) scale to identify the nurse workload. The statistical analysis of the data was performed using frequency, chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, correlation and regression analyses.It was found that patients who developed delirium were 65 years or older, they had more nasogastric/total parenteral nutrition (NG/TPN), benzodiazepine and physical restraints in comparison with those with no delirium development, and that the prevalence of hypoxia and hypoalbuminemia were higher in these patients. The mean TISS-28 score was higher in patients with delirium, compared with those without delirium. There was a positive correlation between the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores and the mean TISS-28 score of the patients. The mean TISS-28 score was found to significantly increase with being at the age of 65 and above and the administration of mechanical ventilation. The patients with delirium required a mean of 60-min additional care.Our study results suggest that the presence of delirium and the delirium risk factors, irrespective of delirium, increase the nurse workload.An effective management of delirium risk factors can improve the patient care quality by reducing delirium occurrence and nurse workload.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.14365", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2794543685", "source": "openalex"}

This has led to overcrowding of telemetry beds, increased wait times in the emergency department, and inefficient allocation of hospital resources. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines exist to guide appropriate utilization of cardiac monitoring. We sought to investigate the effect of the institution of an electronic ordering system (EOS) on adherence to guideline-based telemetry use.Telemetry bed utilization was followed prospectively before and after institution of the EOS. Patient records were reviewed and assessed for indication for telemetry monitoring at admission and at 48 hours, as well as telemetry events. The online order form was based on the ACC/AHA guidelines for in-hospital cardiac monitoring. The EOS mandates physicians to check the specific indication for monitoring. Initial telemetry order expires after 48 hours, and if continued monitoring is necessary, it must be reordered.One hundred ninety-six patients before EOS and 156 patients after institution of EOS were assessed. Before EOS, 65% of patients placed on telemetry met guidelines for monitoring. Institution of EOS resulted in a significant improvement in compliance to 81% (P < 0.001). However, at 48 hours, compliance dropped with EOS from 31% to 13% (P < 0.001). All dysrhythmias observed occurred in patients who met guidelines for monitoring. There were no clinically significant events in patients who did not meet guidelines for telemetry monitoring.The institution of an EOS significantly improved compliance with ACC/AHA guidelines for cardiac monitoring at the time of admission. However, compliance worsened after the initial 48 hours, which may have been due to the ease of online reordering with our EOS. Clinically significant events were only observed in patients who met criteria for monitoring. EOS can be a useful tool to improve adherence to guideline-based utilization of hospital resources.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/hpc.0b013e318270787c", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981674549", "source": "openalex"}

However, 2/3 of women and 1/3 of men with angina and 10% of patients with acute myocardial infarction have no evidence of epicardial coronary artery stenosis in X-ray coronary angiography. In these cases, coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is the main causative factor.To present the pathophysiology of CMD in Cardiology, Rheumatology and Endocrinology.The pathophysiology of CMD in Cardiology, Rheumatology and Endocrinology was evaluated. It includes impaired microvascular vasodilatation, which leads to inability of the organism to deal with myocardial oxygen needs and, hence, development of ischemic pain. CMD, observed in inflammatory autoimmune rheumatic and endocrine/metabolic disorders, brings together Cardiology, Rheumatology and Endocrinology. Causative factors include persistent systemic inflammation and endocrine/metabolic abnormalities influencing directly the coronary microvasculature. In the past, the evaluation of microcirculation was feasible only with the use of invasive techniques, such as coronary flow reserve assessment. Currently, the application of advanced imaging modalities, such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), can evaluate CMD non-invasively and without ionizing radiation.CMD may present with a variety of symptoms with 1/3 to 2/3 of them expressed as typical chest pain in effort, more commonly found in women during menopause than in men. Atypical presentation includes chest pain at rest or exertional dyspnea,but post exercise symptoms are not uncommon. The treatment with nitrates is less effective in CMD, because their vasodilator action in coronary micro-circulation is less pronounced than in the epicardial coronary arteries.Although both classic and new medications have been used in the treatment of CMD, there are still many questions regarding both the pathophysiology and the treatment of this disorder. The potential effects of anti-rheumatic and endocrine medications on the evolution of CMD need further evaluation.CMD is a multifactorial disease leading to myocardial ischemia/fibrosis alone or in combination with epicardial coronary artery disease. Endothelial dysfunction/vasospasm, systemic inflammation, and/or neuroendocrine activation may act as causative factors and bring Cardiology, Rheumatology and Endocrinology together. Currently, the application of advanced imaging modalities, and specifically CMR, allows reliable assessment of the extent and severity of CMD. These measurements should not be limited to \"pure cardiac patients\", as it is known that CMD affects the majority of patients with autoimmune rheumatic and endocrine/metabolic disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13737", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200501437", "source": "openalex"}

In these lean times, there is a growing need for cost-effective therapeutic options that supply superior support and in addition shorten the length of stay in hospital and reduce re-hospitalization rates. The inodilator levosimendan represents the latest addition to the vasoactive treatments of acute heart failure patients, and it appears to meet these expectations. Our aim was to answer the question whether the treatment efficacy of levosimendan - when selected as therapy for patients hospitalized for acute heart failure - brings savings to hospitals in various European countries representing different economies.We took a conservative approach and selected some a fortiori arguments to simplify the calculations. We selected seven European countries to represent different economies: Italy, Spain, Greece, Germany, Sweden, Finland and Israel. Data on the costs of medications and on the cost per day were collected and fed in a simple algorithm to detect savings. These saving varied from country to country, from a minimum of €0.50 in Germany to a maximum of €354.64 in Sweden.The use of levosimendan as a therapy for patients hospitalized for acute heart failure provides a net saving to hospitals driven by a reduction in the length of hospital stay.

With the increasing complexities of bifurcation stenting, corresponding analytical tools for bifurcation analysis have been developed with extensive reporting schemes. Although intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been around for a long time as well, more recent radiofrequency analysis provides additional information about the vessel wall composition; likewise optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides detailed information about the positions of the stent struts and the quality of the stent placement. Combining the information from the X-ray lumenogram and the intravascular imaging devices is mentally a challenging task for the interventionalist. To support the registration of these intravascular images with the X-ray images, 3D QCA has been developed and registered with the IVUS or OCT images, so that at every position along the vessel of interest the luminal data and the vessel wall data by IVUS or the stent strut data by OCT can be combined.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study of all paediatric cardiac deaths occurring over four years in a tertiary referral centre. Data were obtained from reviewing the hospital files, available necropsy records and specimens, and audit reports. PATIENTS: Paediatric patients with congenital or acquired heart disease, who died of a cardiac cause between January 1992 and July 1995. Inclusion criteria were that the diagnosis of heart disease was made before death, and that patients were managed thereafter medically and/or surgically at the referral centre. The value of necropsy was assessed according to its contribution in establishing the cause of death (confirmed, clarified, precise cause of death uncertain) and the anatomy (simple confirmation or additional information provided). For cases not submitted to necropsy the clinical information relating to the cause of death was assessed and the case assigned as cause of death firm, uncertain, or unknown. RESULTS: One hundred and six deaths were identified (61 males, age at death: one day to 20 years). Seventy occurred early (a month or less) after surgery and were graded as postoperative deaths. The rest were considered to be either medical or late surgical deaths. Necropsy was performed in 59 (55.6%). The precise cause of death was confirmed in 33 (55.9%), clarified in 22 (37.3%), and remained uncertain in four (7.8%). Additional information regarding the anatomy was found in eight (13.6%) cases. In five cases (8.5%) the necropsy detected findings which, if known before death, would probably have improved outcome. For the patients dying without a necropsy, the cause of death remained uncertain in 10 (21.3%) and unknown in seven (14.9%). In 36% of cases, therefore, a firm cause of death that might have been provided by a necropsy was missing. CONCLUSION: In paediatric cardiology necropsy continues to provide clinically relevant information at a high level. It remains vital for ensuring quality of medical care, in instigating improvements in future management, and increasing understanding of congenital heart disease.

These changing demographics of care may require greater clinical expertise among physician providers. Despite these changes, little is known about present-day staffing practices in US CICUs.We conducted a survey of 178 medical directors of ICUs caring for cardiac patients to assess unit structure and physician staffing practices. Data were obtained from 123 CICUs (69% response rate) that were mostly from academic medical centres. A majority of hospitals utilized a dedicated CICU (68%) and approximately half of those hospitals employed a 'closed' unit model. In 46% of CICUs, an intensivist consult was available, but not routinely involved in care of critically ill cardiovascular patients, while 11% did not have a board-certified intensivist available for consultation. Most CICU directors (87%) surveyed agreed that a closed ICU structure provided better care than an open ICU and 81% of respondents identified an unmet need for cardiologists with critical care training.We report contemporary structural models and staffing practices in a sample of US ICUs caring for critically ill cardiovascular patients. Although most hospitals surveyed had dedicated CICUs, a minority of CICUs employed a 'closed' CICU model and few had routine intensivist staffing. Most CICU directors agree that there is a need for cardiologists with intensivist training and expertise. These survey data reveal potential areas for continued improvement in US CICU organizational structure and physician staffing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2048872612472063", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142463405", "source": "openalex"}

In the present study, we tested this hypothesis throughout the use of direct and indirect sympathetic markers. In 193 untreated moderate essential hypertensives aged 50.4±0.6 years (mean±SEM), we measured clinic and ambulatory blood pressure and corresponding HR, venous plasma norepinephrine (high performance liquid chromatography), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (microneurography). We then subdivided the study population into 2 groups according to HR &lt; or &gt;80 bpm. Eighty-four patients displayed resting HR &gt;80 bpm, which was this cutoff value in the remaining 109 patients, the 2 groups showing superimposable age, and sex distribution. Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure were similar in the 2 groups, whereas left ventricular mass index was significantly greater in the group with HR &gt;80 bpm. Muscle sympathetic nerve traffic values were also significantly greater in this latter group (72.77±0.9 versus vs 36.83±1.3 bursts/min, P &lt;0.0001); this being the case also for norepinephrine (293.0±8.7 versus 254.1±8.9 pg/mL, P &lt;0.002). In the whole population, there was a significant direct relationship between muscle sympathetic nerve traffic, norepinephrine, left ventricular mass index, and HR values. Similar results were obtained when 24-hour HR values were analyzed. Thus patients with hypertension displaying HR &gt;80 bpm are characterized by a marked sympathetic overdrive, particularly when direct adrenergic markers are used. This finding suggests that cardiac and peripheral sympathetic activation are involved in the increased cardiovascular risk detected in this group of patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.14804", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3037977599", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, an interaction toward an enhanced risk of thrombotic events and consequent mortality might be expected in patients with both factors elevated. To determine whether patients exposed jointly to high Fib and high tHcy were at increased risk of mortality, we compared them with those with only one or neither risk factors elevated. Prevalence of coronary artery disease (cross-section) and short-term mortality (30±14 months) were assessed in 2084 patients with available baseline tHcy and Fib. Upper quartiles were used to define high tHcy (&gt;14.2 μmol/L) and high Fib (&gt;382 mg/dL). Cox models adjusting for Framingham risk score, creatinine, and coronary artery disease status were used to estimate the risk of high tHcy and high Fib and their combinations. Mean age of the patients was 56±12 years (35% women) with 71 (3.4%) recorded deaths. Risk-adjusted longitudinal models showed a hazard ratio of 2.14 ( P =0.03) for isolated high tHcy, 2.28 ( P =0.02) for isolated high Fib, and 3.29 ( P &lt;0.001) for both high tHcy and high Fib in comparison with neither risk factor high. Independence of each parameter and lack of synergism was found on longitudinal as well as cross-sectional analyses. Conjoint elevation of Fib and tHcy increased the risk of death by approximately 3-fold in three years. Although no significant interaction between Fib and tHcy was demonstrated, both provided independent information after adjustment for traditional risk factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.atv.0000020007.25154.62", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2164864729", "source": "openalex"}

Use of mosaics made from squares held in cling film has allowed doses to the head to be mapped successfully.

Results linking PSD to CESD for interventional cardiology were variable, but CAK is still considered to provide the best option for use as an indicator of potential radiation-induced effects. A CESD exceeding 3 Gy is considered a suitable action level for triggering follow-up of patients in neuroradiology and cardiology for possible skin effects. Application of dose action levels defined in this way would affect 8% of neurological embolisation procedures and 5% of cardiology ablation and multiple stent procedures at the hospitals where the investigations were carried out. A close relationship was observed between CESD and dose-area product (DAP) for particular types of procedure, and DAPs of 200-300 Gy cm(2) could be used as trigger levels where CAK readings were not available.

Methods We conducted a web‐based survey sent electronically to 21 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited IC fellowship program directors (PDs) and their respective fellows. Results Fourteen programs (67%) responded to the survey and all acknowledged a significant decrease in CCL procedural volumes. More than half of the PDs reported part of their CCL being converted to inpatient units and IC fellows being redeployed to COVID‐19 related duties. More than two‐thirds of PDs believed that the COVID‐19 pandemic would have a moderate (57%) or severe (14%) adverse impact on IC fellowship training, and 21% of the PDs expected their current fellows' average percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume to be below 250. Of 25 IC fellow respondents, 95% expressed concern that the pandemic would have a moderate (72%) or severe (24%) adverse impact on their fellowship training, and nearly one‐fourth of fellows reported performing fewer than 250 PCIs as of March 1st. Finally, roughly one‐third of PDs and IC fellows felt that there should be consideration of an extension of fellowship training or a period of early career mentorship after fellowship. Conclusions The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in CCL procedural volumes that is impacting IC fellowship training in the NY metropolitan area. These results should inform professional societies and accreditation bodies to offer tailored opportunities for remediation of affected trainees.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28977", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3025289946", "source": "openalex"}

It remains unclear how this change in guidelines is perceived by practicing cardiologists versus heart failure (HF) specialists. Methods and results: An independent academic web-based survey was designed by a group of HF specialists and posted by email and through various social networks to a broad community of cardiologists worldwide 1 year after the publication of the latest European HF guidelines. Overall, 615 cardiologists (38 [32–47] years old, 63% male) completed the survey, of which 58% were working in a university hospital and 26% were HF specialists. The threshold to define HFrEF was ≤40% for 61% of the physicians. Preferred drug prescription for the sequential approach was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors first (74%), beta-blockers second (55%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists third (52%), and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (53%) fourth. Eighty-four percent of participants felt that starting all four classes was feasible within the initial hospitalization, and 58% felt that titration is less important than introducing a new class. Age, status in training, and specialization in HF field were the principal characteristics that significantly impacted the answers. Conclusion: In a broad international cardiology community, the ‘historical approach’ to HFrEF therapies remains the preferred sequencing approach.

A multicenter consortium combined simulation and multimedia computer-assisted instruction (MCAI) to develop unique interactive teaching programs that can address a number of these problems. We describe the consortium, the MCAI system, the programs, and a multicenter evaluation of technical and educational performance. <h3>Methods:</h3> The MCAI system uses computer-controlled access to full-screen, full-motion, and full-color laser disc video in combination with digitized sound, images, and graphics stored on removable media. The Socratic teaching method enhances interaction and guides learners through the patient's history, cardiovascular physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and therapy. Self-instruction and instructor-led modes of function are possible. The first five programs, based on simulations of specific cardiology problems, were distributed to four medical centers. Questionnaires evaluated technical function and medical student opinions, while behaviors and scores were automatically tracked and tabulated by program administration software. <h3>Results:</h3> The MCAI system functioned reliably and accurately in all modes and at all sites. The programs were highly rated. Student ratings, scores, and behaviors were independent of institution and mode of use. <h3>Conclusion:</h3> A multicenter educational consortium developed a system to produce unique, sophisticated MCAI programs in cardiology. Both system and programs functioned reliably at four institutions and were highly rated by fourth-year medical students. With this enthusiastic reception, the economies and strengths associated with MCAI make it an attractive solution to a number of problem areas, and it will likely play an increasingly important role.

Simultaneous improvements in computing power, data storage, and data analytics have led to the development of new techniques to address these challenges. One powerful tool to this end is machine learning (ML), which aims to algorithmically identify and represent structure within data. Machine learning’s ability to efficiently analyze large and highly complex data sets make it a desirable investigative approach in modern biomedical research. Despite this potential and enormous public and private sector investment, few prospective studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes from this technology. This is particularly true in cardiology, despite its emphasis on objective, data-driven results. This threatens to stifle ML’s growth and use in mainstream medicine. We outline the current state of ML in cardiology and outline methods through which impactful and sustainable ML research can occur. Following these steps can ensure ML reaches its potential as a transformative technology in medicine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248420928651", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3029478107", "source": "openalex"}

Previous studies have shown that prolonged SW is associated with endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that this abnormality may contribute to the SW-related increase in cardiovascular risk. The immediate effect of SW on endothelial function in healthy subjects, however, is unknown. We studied endothelial function and endothelium-independent function in 20 healthy specialty trainees in cardiology at our Institute, without any cardiovascular risk factor (27.3±1.9 years, nine males), at two different times: (1) after a working night (WN), and (2) after a restful night (RN). The two test sessions were performed in a random sequence. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring brachial artery dilation during post-ischaemic forearm hyperaemia (flow-mediated dilation, FMD). Endothelium-independent function in response to 25 µg of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (nitrate-mediated dilation, NMD) was also assessed. FMD was 8.02 ± 1.4% and 8.56 ± 1.7% after WN and RN, respectively (p = 0.025), whereas NMD was 10.5 ± 2.1% and 10.4 ± 2.0% after WN and RN, respectively (p = 0.48). The difference in FMD between WN and RN was not influenced by the numbers of hours slept during WN (<4 vs >4 hours) and by the duration of involvement of specialty trainees in nocturnal work (<12 vs >12 months). Our study shows that in healthy medical residents, without any cardiovascular risk factor, FMD is slightly impaired after WN compared to RN.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed data for U.S. adults with diabetes in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011–2016 (n = 2,266). Diabetes was defined by treatment with glucose-lowering medication, glycosylated hemoglobin ≥6.5%, fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or nonfasting serum glucose ≥200 mg/dL. BP was measured three times and antihypertensive medication use was self-reported. RESULTS The prevalence (95% CI) of hypertension among U.S. adults with diabetes was 77.1% (73.9, 80.0) and 66.3% (63.4, 69.1) according to the ACC/AHA and ADA definitions, respectively. Also, 22.9% (20.0, 26.1) did not have hypertension according to either definition, and the concordance in hypertension status was 89.2% (87.2, 91.0). Among U.S. adults with diabetes not taking antihypertensive medication, 52.8% (47.7, 57.8) were not recommended to initiate antihypertensive medication by either the ACC/AHA or the ADA document and 22.4% (19.2, 25.9) were recommended to initiate it by both documents (overall concordance 75.2% [70.4, 79.4]). Among those taking antihypertensive medication, 45.3% (41.3, 49.4) and 50.4% (46.5, 54.2) had BP above the goal in neither and both documents, respectively (overall concordance 95.7% [93.4, 97.2]).

In the last few years, there has been concern about the dissemination of false health information on social media. It is therefore important that we assess the influencers of this health information in the field of cardiology.We sought to identify the top 100 Twitter influencers within cardiology, characterize them, and examine the relationship between their social media activity and academic influence.Twitter topic scores for the topic search \"cardiology\" were queried on May 01, 2020 using the Right Relevance application programming interface (API). Based on their scores, the top 100 influencers were identified. Among the cardiologists, their academic h-indices were acquired from Scopus and these scores were compared to the Twitter topic scores.We found out that 88/100 (88%) of the top 100 social media influencers on Twitter were cardiologists. Of these, 63/88 (72%) were males and they practiced mostly in the United States with 50/87 (57%) practicing primarily in an academic hospital. There was a moderately positive correlation between the h-index and the Twitter topic score, r = +0.32 (p-value 0.002).Our study highlights that the top ranked cardiology social media influencers on Twitter are board-certified male cardiologists practicing in academic settings in the US.

Methods: A prospective observational study followed two groups of patients over a 3-month period in a UK district general hospital. Group one: all admissions with suspected ACS ( n = 576); group two: non-cardiac in-patients who were suspected of developing ACS ( n = 87). Both were investigated by full clinical history, examination and serial electrocardiographs (ECGs). Conventional World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for myocardial damage were compared with diagnosis based on cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Clinical discharge diagnosis based on conventional WHO criteria was compared with the review diagnosis based on measurement of cTnT. Results: Diagnosis based on WHO criteria missed 58 patients (8·7%) admitted with suspected ACS who had high risk unstable angina. Thirty-three patients (5% of all admissions) who were diagnosed as non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were found to have normal troponin values and to have been incorrectly classified as AMI. Conclusions: Diagnostic strategies based on WHO criteria are inaccurate. The measurement of cTnT in all patients with suspected ACS would have increased the number of those with a diagnosis of AMI by 58 (8·7%), while avoiding inaccurate diagnosis in 33 (5%), therefore producing an absolute increase of 25/663 (3·8%) but a relative increase of 58/138 (42%).

Top 10 Lessons We Learned in Congenital Heart Defects and Cardiology", "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings.

Methods: Prescriptions written by 13 doctors for 320 established hypertensive patients with cardiovascular diseases (25 patients per doctor) were noted on first visit. Two hundred and sixty (81%) of the enrolled 320 patients (20 patients per doctor) were followed up until the second visit. Blood pressure (BP) noted on the second visit was related to the prescription written on the first visit. Results: One hundred and ninety one (73.5%) patients received guidelines-compliant pharmacotherapy. CPG adherence had statistically significant association with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (Ф =-0.241, p < 0.01) and diabetes (Ф =-0.228, p < 0.01). One hundred and fifty four (59.2 %) patients were on goal BP. Hypertension control had statistically significant association with guidelines compliance (Ф = 0.175, p < 0.01), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (Ф = 0.195, p < 0.01), diabetes (Ф = -0.148, p = 0.017), LVH (Ф = -0.153, p = 0.017) and monotherapy (Ф = - 0.168, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Prescribing practices were fairly compliant with guidelines. Doctors poorly adhered to guidelines in hypertensive patients with diabetes and LVH.

We present the contemporary distribution of women leaders in cardiology departments in the World Health Organization European region. Methods and results Between August and December 2020, we applied purposive sampling to collect data and analyse gender distribution of heads of cardiology department in university/third level hospitals in 23 countries: Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, North Macedonia, Morocco, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the UK. Age, cardiology subspecialty, and number of scientific publications were recorded for a subgroup of cardiology leaders for whom data were available. A total of 849 cardiology departments were analysed. Women leaders were only 30% (254/849) and were younger than their men counterpart (♀ 52.2 ± 7.7 years old vs. ♂ 58.1 ± 7.6 years old, P = 0.00001). Most women leaders were non-interventional experts (♀ 82% vs. ♂ 46%, P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and had significantly fewer scientific publications than men {♀ 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 2–41] publications vs. ♂ 44 (IQR 9–175) publications, P &amp;lt; 0.00001}.

Methods: We conducted an online national survey of cardiology fellows during the 2015 to 2016 academic year. Survey questions aimed to assess perceived importance of palliative care education, level of palliative care education during fellowship, and the structure of palliative care support at respondent institutions. Responses were collected anonymously. A total of 519 programs, including subspecialty programs, were contacted. Results: We received 365 responses, a number that represents roughly 14% of all cardiology fellows nationwide during the 2015 to 2016 academic year. Fellows reported discordance in the quality of education between general cardiology and palliative care principles as it relates to care of the patient approaching the end of life. Fellows infrequently received explicit training nor were observed or mentored in delivering end-of-life discussions. Respondents reported an underutilization of palliative care and hospice resources during fellowship training and also a perception that attending faculty were not routinely addressing goals of care. Conclusions: Our survey results highlight a need for enhanced palliative care and end-of-life training experiences for cardiology fellows and also suggest underutilization of hospice and palliative care resources for patients with advanced cardiac diseases. These findings create a platform for future work that might: (1) confirm this training deficit, (2) lead to exploration of educational models that could reconcile this deficit, and (3) potentially help improve palliative care support for patients and families facing advanced heart disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909117703728", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606059110", "source": "openalex"}

This legislation incorporates a requirement for new equipment to provide a means of displaying a measure of patient exposure and introduces the concept of diagnostic reference levels. It is normally assumed that patient dose is governed largely by patient size; however, in cardiology, where procedures are often very complex, the significance of patient size is less well understood. This study considers over 9000 cardiology procedures, undertaken throughout the north of England, and investigates the relationship between patient size and dose. It uses simple linear regression to calculate both correlation coefficients and significance levels for data sorted by both room and individual clinician for the four most common examinations, left ventrical and/or coronary angiography, single vessel stent insertion and single vessel angioplasty. This paper concludes that the correlation between patient size and dose is weak for the procedures considered. It also illustrates the use of an existing method for removing the effect of patient size from dose survey data.

The aim of this study was to describe the use of nursing terminologies in the care plans made for patients in a cardiology rehabilitation unit. METHODS. We retrospectively examined the clinical documentation for all patients admitted to a cardiology program in a small hospital in the northeast of Italy in 2008. FINDINGS. The sample included 76 patients (87% male) with an average age of 60 years. Care plans included 21 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses and three collaborative problems, 45 Nursing Outcomes Classifications (NOC) and 46 Nursing Intervention Classifications (NIC). The most frequent diagnoses were the following: decreased cardiac output, activity intolerance, and risk for or presence of imbalanced nutrition (more than body requirements). The prevalent outcomes were related to cardiopulmonary physiological health and knowledge about cardiac disease management and diet. The most frequent nursing interventions were the following: exercise promotion, energy management, weight management, medication management, cardiac precautions, cardiac care (rehabilitative), teaching (prescribed activity/exercise and diet), and vital signs monitoring. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE. Nurses in rehabilitative cardiology care are aware of patients' problems, but projects can improve the coherence between concepts, the attention to psychological problems, and self-care. SCOPO. Lo scopo di questo studio era descrivere l'uso di terminologie infermieristiche nei piani di assistenza prodotti per i pazienti assistiti un un'unità operativa di cardiologia riabilitativa. METODI. Sono state esaminate in modo retrospettivo le cartelle cliniche di tutti i pazienti trattati in un programma di cardiologia, in un piccolo ospedale del Nord-Est dell'Italia nel 2008. RISULTATI. Il campione includeva 76 pazienti (87% maschi) con età media di 60 anni. I piani di assistenza includevano 21 diagnosi infermieristiche NANDA e tre problemi collaborativi, 45 esiti NOC e 46 interventi NIC.

The first measurement of cardiac markers was performed at the point-of-care in the Emergency Cardiology Department, using Stratus CS. The lowest cardiac troponin I concentration with a CV<or=10% (cardiac troponin I concentration=0.07 microg/l) was used to perform an early diagnosis of cardiac damage and to admit non-ST-elevation patients to the Intensive Cardiac Unit. Final diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was assessed according to European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology diagnostic criteria: cardiac marker follow-up after hospital admission was performed in central laboratory. We retrospectively assessed how the diagnostic accuracy of an early diagnosis of myocardiac damage in the same population might have changed if different lower cardiac troponin I cut-offs had been used upon admitting patients in the Emergency Cardiology Department, independently from the analytical imprecision of the method.A diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was performed on 110 (21.3%) of 516 non-ST-elevation-patients admitted to hospital. Seventy (13.6%) patients had cardiac troponin I >0.07 microg/l in the Emergency Cardiology Department (P>0.05).

Relative operating characteristic analysis confirmed that the best clinical cut-off was related to the cardiac troponin I concentration that meets the 99th percentile upper reference limit. The diagnostic accuracy of myoglobin in detecting the minimum cardiac damage was significantly lower, independently from the cut-offs considered.The diagnostic accuracy in detecting myocardial damage early in the Emergency Cardiology Department improves when the 99th percentile is used as a decisional value of cardiac troponin I; the use of this cut-off makes the measurement of myoglobin unnecessary.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mca.0b013e32801682b6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020160701", "source": "openalex"}

Our study seeks to characterize the current Women in Cardiology Twitter network. Methods and Results Six women-specific cardiology Twitter hashtags were analyzed: #ACCWIC (American College of Cardiology Women in Cardiology), #AHAWIC (American Heart Association Women in Cardiology), #ilooklikeacardiologist, #SCAIWIN (Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Women in Innovations), #WomeninCardiology, and #WomeninEP (Women in Electrophysiology). Twitter data from 2016 to 2019 were obtained from Symplur Signals. Quantitative and descriptive content analyses were performed. The Women in Cardiology Twitter network generated 48 236 tweets, 266 180 903 impressions, and 12 485 users. Tweets increased by 706% (from 2083 to 16 780), impressions by 207% (from 26 755 476 to 82 080 472), and users by 440% (from 796 to 4300), including a 471% user increase internationally. The network generated 6530 (13%) original tweets and 43 103 (86%) amplification tweets. Most original and amplification tweets were authored by women (81% and 62%, respectively) and women physicians (76% and 52%, respectively), with an increase in original and amplification tweets authored by academic women physicians (98% and 109%, respectively) and trainees (390% and 249%, respectively) over time. Community building, professional development, and gender advocacy were the most common tweet contents over the study period. Community building was the most common tweet category for #ACCWIC, #AHAWIC, #ilooklikeacardiologist, #SCAIWIN, and #WomeninCardiology, whereas professional development was most common for #WomeninEP. Conclusions The Women in Cardiology Twitter network has grown immensely from 2016 to 2019, with women physicians as the driving contributors.

Furthermore, there are concerns that overused cardiology consultations can lead to unnecessary investigations, prolonged hospital stays, and even cancellation of necessary surgery. In this retrospective study, we investigated: (i) the potential impact of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology algorithm and (ii) the potential of this algorithm for preventing unnecessary evaluation.Methods We examined the cardiology consultation requests for 712 patients scheduled for elective surgery. Our analysis included: (i) patient characteristics, (ii) abnormalities revealed by the consultant, (iii) impact of these abnormalities on clinical decision making and therapy modifi cation.Results The most common reason for consultation was 'pre-operative evaluation' (80.9%). Although our cardiologists revealed an abnormality in 67.8% and recommended further work up in 58.7% of our patients, they contributed to the clinical course in only 36.9%. Moreover, when the algorithm was applied to 'routine pre-operative evaluation' requests lacking a specifi c question, only 7.6% of these consultation requests required further investigation.Conclusion Preoperative cardiology consultation seems to be overused. Although the fear of missing important issues leads surgeons to use a decreased threshold for pre-operative consultation requests, such a non-specifi c manner of pre-operative consultation request causes unnecessary investigations and decreased cost-eff ectiveness. Furthermore, the detection of any clinical abnormality by cardiologists surprisingly adds little to clinical decision making.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/ac.66.4.2126592", "url": "https://openalex.org/W34380692", "source": "openalex"}

While coronary artery stents prevent constrictive arterial remodeling and elastic recoil, the implantation is associated with more severe arterial vascular injury than balloon angioplasty alone. The arterial injury initiates a vasculoproliferative response with smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration as well as extracellular matrix formation, which may lead to severe neointimal hyperplasia with in-stent restenosis in 10-30% of cases. Sirolimus, a naturally occurring macrocyclic lactone, has been identified as a pharmacological cell cycle inhibitor with potent antiproliferative and antimigratory effects on vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. The systemic administration of sirolimus has been shown to effectively reduce neointimal hyperplasia in experimental restenosis models. Subsequently, sirolimus has been incorporated at therapeutically important doses into biocompatible polymers, which made it suitable for stent-based drug elution. Investigation of sirolimus eluting stents in both experimental and clinical restenosis studies have demonstrated dramatic reductions in neointimal hyperplasia. Accordingly, sirolimus eluting stents offer an attractive mode of local drug delivery by minimizing systemic toxicity and maximizing local dose requirements. In addition, sirolimus eluting stents hold great promise to effectively prevent restenosis.

This article summarizes a comparative study of patient/family satisfaction and appointment wait times in physician managed vs. paediatric nurse practitioner managed cardiology clinics. Background. Appointment wait times exceeded 40 days in the outpatient cardiology department at a children’s hospital. To address the gap in available appointments, paediatric nurse practitioner managed cardiology clinics were implemented. Methods. A sample of 128 patients who presented concurrently in physician or paediatric nurse practitioner managed cardiology clinics from December 2009 through February 2010 was recruited for participation. The hospital’s ambulatory patient satisfaction survey was utilized to measure level of patient satisfaction with care. Survey responses were evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. Appointment wait times were compared pre and post implementation of paediatric nurse practitioner managed clinics. Results. Sixty‐five physician families and 63 paediatric nurse practitioner families completed the satisfaction survey. There was no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction between clinic types. Appointment wait time decreased from 46 to 43 days, which was not statistically significant. Paediatric nurse practitioner clinics included a statistically higher percentage total of urgent appointments compared to that in physician clinics. Conclusions. Paediatric nurse practitioner managed cardiology clinics are a strategic solution for improving patient access and facilitating high quality patient care while earning high levels of patient satisfaction. This healthcare delivery model illustrates the potential for expanded utilization of advanced practice nurses.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05901.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1513762543", "source": "openalex"}

The current study aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction with the quality of healthcare. Methods: The study was carried out by a cross-sectional method for evaluation of hospitalized patient satisfaction with provided services. Participants of this research include patients who have been hospitalized during the last 5 years (2012-2016). Research tools were prepared on the basis of specially developed “Medical Outcomes Study, Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire” (MOS PSQ-III). Results: Most of the patients positively evaluated financial accessibility and quality of health services, even though some aspects of health care need improvement. This may be related to the introduction of the Universal Health Care Program in 2013, which increased population coverage. The international quality accreditation of the Emergency Cardiology Center has also played an important role in raising patient's satisfaction levels and in achieving higher standards in the sectors of patient safety and quality management. However, the study indicated, that there was a moderate level of satisfaction with the accessibility of healthcare services. So the further revisions and actions are needed to expand and refine the Universal Health Care Program. We also found an evidence that gender, age and education act as the socioeconomic determinants of satisfaction with healthcare quality. Conclusion: The patient satisfaction study, as one of the most important quality indicators, should be developed throughout the country. It will promote the development of healthy competitive environment among medical organizations and will improve the quality of medical services.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2174/1874944501811010201", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2804603395", "source": "openalex"}

Procedural data did not differ between the XPF and standard groups. Mean standard, XPF 0.3 mm, and XPF 0.5 mm cap weights were 12.5 g, 118.4 g, and 123.7 g, respectively. VAS comfort ratings of the standard and XPF caps did not differ significantly (p=0.272). The mean radiation protection was 12.0%, 95% CI: 4.9-19.1% (standard caps, n=35), 91.5%, 95% CI: 87.4-95.6% (XPF 0.3 mm caps, n=45) and 97.1%, 95% CI: 92.5-100% (XPF 0.5 mm caps, n=44) (p≤0.001 for all group comparisons). Using the XPF caps, a cumulative total radiation dose reduction by almost factor 10 was evident (272 procedures, 22,310 μSv outside the XPF caps, 2,770 μSv inside the caps).Lightweight XPF caps show comparable comfort to standard fabric caps, but provide substantial radiation protection during fluoroscopy-guided cardiac interventions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4244/eijv11i1a9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2465453560", "source": "openalex"}

A specific template was completed by physicians, and additional information obtained from industry. Information on health care systems, demographics, economics, procedure rates, and specific training programs was collected. Considerable heterogeneity in the access to arrhythmia care was observed across Africa. Eight of the 31 countries surveyed (26%) did not perform pacemaker implantations. The median pacemaker implantation rate was 2.66 per million population per country (range: 0.14-233 per million population). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy were performed in 12/31 (39%) and 15/31 (48%) countries respectively, mostly by visiting teams. Electrophysiological studies, including complex catheter ablations were performed in all countries from Maghreb, but only one sub-Saharan African country (South Africa). Marked variation in cost (up to 1000-fold) was observed across countries with an inverse correlation between implant rates and the procedure fees standardized to the gross domestic product per capita. Lack of economic resources and facilities, high cost of procedures, deficiency of trained physicians, and non-existent fellowship programs were the main drivers of under-utilization of interventional cardiac arrhythmia care.There is limited access to CIED and ablation procedures in Africa. A quarter of countries did not have pacemaker implantation services, and catheter ablations were only available in one country in sub-Saharan Africa.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/eux353", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2776693613", "source": "openalex"}

Quantitative gated single positron emission computed tomography (QGS) is used to assess quantitatively cardiac volume, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), stroke volume, and cardiac diastolic function. Resting and stress myocardial perfusion imaging, with exercise or pharmacologic stress, plays a fundamental role in distinguishing ischemic from non-ischemic etiology of heart failure, and in demonstrating myocardial viability. Diastolic heart failure also termed as heart failure with a preserved LVEF is readily identified by nuclear cardiology techniques and can accurately be estimated by peak filling rate (PFR) and time to PFR. Movement of the left ventricle can also be readily assessed by QGS, with newer techniques such as three-dimensional, wall thickening evaluation aiding its assessment. Myocardial perfusion imaging is also commonly used to identify candidates for implantable cardiac defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapies. Neurotransmitter imaging using (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine offers prognostic information in patients with heart failure. Metabolism and function in the heart are closely related, and energy substrate metabolism is a potential target of medical therapies to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Cardiac metabolic imaging using (123)I-15-(p-iodophenyl)3-R, S-methylpentadecacoic acid is a commonly used tracer in clinical studies to diagnose metabolic heart failure. Nuclear cardiology tests, including neurotransmitter imaging and metabolic imaging, are now easily preformed with new tracers to refine heart failure diagnosis. Nuclear cardiology studies contribute significantly to guiding management decisions for identifying cardiac risk in patients with heart failure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v2.i10.344", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2036394184", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2398690305", "title": "Noninvasive methods in space cardiology.", "text": "The development and application of noninvasive methods in space cardiology is discussed. These methods are used in astronautics both to gain new insights into the impact of weightlessness conditions on the human organism and to help solve problems involved in the medical monitoring of space crew members. The cardiovascular system is a major target for the action of microgravity. Noninvasive methods used to examine the cardiovascular system during space flights over the past 30 years are listed. Special attention is given to methods for studying heart rate variability and contactless recording of physiologic functions during night sleep. Analysis of heart rate variability highlights an important principle of space cardiology-gaining the maximum amount of information while recording as little data as possible. With this method, the degree of strain experienced by the systems of autonomic regulation and the adaptational capabilities of the body can be assessed at various stages of a space flight. Discriminant analysis of heart rate variability data enables the psycho-emotional component of stress to be separated from the component associated with the impact of weightlessness. A major advance in space medicine has been the development of techniques for contactless recording of pulse rates, breathing frequency, myocardial contractility, and motor activity during sleep using a sensor installed on the cosmonaut's sleeping bag. The data obtained can be used to study ultradian rhythms, which reflect the activity of higher autonomic centers. An important role of these centers in mobilizing functional reserves of the body to ensure its relatively stable adaptation to weightless conditions is shown.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2398690305", "source": "openalex"}

Studies on patients with connective tissue diseases were not considered. Our aim was to assess the impact of this definition on atherosclerotic vascular events (AVEs) in systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients methods Individuals from the Toronto Lupus Clinic with at least 2 years of follow-up and no prior AVE were divided in three groups according to their mean blood pressure (BP) over that period (≥140/90 mm Hg, 130-139/80-89 mm Hg and &lt;130/80 mm Hg). They were followed until the first occurrence of an AVE (fatal or non-fatal coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease) or last visit. Groups were compared as per the baseline atherosclerotic risk factors. A multivariable time-dependent analysis was performed to adjust for the presence of other risk factors. Results Of 1532 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria, 155 (10.1%) had a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg, 316 (20.6%) 130–139/80–89 mm Hg and 1061 (69.3%) were normotensives. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 years, 124 AVEs were documented. The incidence rates were 18.9, 11.5 and 4.5 per 1000 patient-years for the three groups, respectively (p=0.0007 between the 130–139/80–89 mm Hg group and the normotensives). A mean BP of 130–139/80–89 mm Hg over the first 2 years was independently associated with the occurrence of AVEs (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.65, p=0.011). Conclusion Patients with lupus with a sustained mean BP of 130–139/80–89 mm Hg over 2 years had a significantly higher incidence of AVEs compared with normotensive individuals. This BP level should be the target for antihypertensive therapy to minimise their cardiovascular risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2019-216764", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3011433190", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2103926864", "title": "Hand-carried ultrasound performed at bedside in cardiology inpatient setting – a comparative study with comprehensive echocardiography", "text": "Abstract Background Hand-carried ultrasound (HCU) devices have been demonstrated to improve the diagnosis of cardiac diseases over physical examination, and have the potential to broaden the versatility in ultrasound application. The role of these devices in the assessment of hospitalized patients is not completely established. In this study we sought to perform a direct comparison between bedside evaluation using HCU and comprehensive echocardiography (CE), in cardiology inpatient setting. Methods We studied 44 consecutive patients (mean age 54 ± 18 years, 25 men) who underwent bedside echocardiography using HCU and CE. HCU was performed by a cardiologist with level-2 training in the performance and interpretation of echocardiography, using two-dimensional imaging, color Doppler, and simple calliper measurements. CE was performed by an experienced echocardiographer (level-3 training) and considered as the gold standard. Results There were no significant differences in cardiac chamber dimensions and left ventricular ejection fraction determined by the two techniques. The agreement between HCU and CE for the detection of segmental wall motion abnormalities was 83% (Kappa = 0.58). There was good agreement for detecting significant mitral valve regurgitation (Kappa = 0.85), aortic regurgitation (kappa = 0.89), and tricuspid regurgitation (Kappa = 0.74). A complete evaluation of patients with stenotic and prosthetic dysfunctional valves, as well as pulmonary hypertension, was not possible using HCU due to its technical limitations in determining hemodynamic parameters. Conclusion Bedside evaluation using HCU is helpful for assessing cardiac chamber dimensions, left ventricular global and segmental function, and significant valvular regurgitation. However, it has limitations regarding hemodynamic assessment, an important issue in the cardiology inpatient setting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-7120-2-24", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103926864", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment differences were assessed. We used a database of US physicians to compare interventional cardiologists who practiced and did not practice during meeting dates (\"stayers\" and \"attendees,\" respectively) in terms of demographic characteristics and clinical and research productivity. Unadjusted and adjusted 30-day mortality rates were lower among patients admitted during meeting versus nonmeeting dates (unadjusted, 15.3% [482/3153] versus 16.7% [5208/31 556] [P=0.04]; adjusted, 15.4% versus 16.7%; difference -1.3% [95% confidence interval, -2.7% to -0.1%] [P=0.05]). Rates of interventional cardiologist involvement were similar between dates (59.5% versus 59.8% of hospitalizations; P=0.88), as were percutaneous coronary intervention rates (30.2% versus 29.1%; P=0.20). Mortality reductions were largest among patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction not receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (16.9% versus 19.5% adjusted 30-day mortality; P=0.008). Compared with stayers, attendees were of similar age and sex, but had greater publications (18.9 versus 6.3; P<0.001), probability of National Institutes of Health funding (5.3% versus 0.4%; P<0.001), and clinical trial leadership (10.3% versus 3.9%; P<0.001), and they performed more percutaneous coronary interventions annually (85.6 versus 63.3; P<0.001).Hospitalization with acute myocardial infarction during Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting dates was associated with lower 30-day mortality, predominantly among patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction who were medically managed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.117.008230", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2792299891", "source": "openalex"}

There is compelling evidence that interventions to improve diet are effective in cardiovascular disease prevention. This clinical practice statement emphasizes the importance of evidence-based dietary patterns in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and ASCVD risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. A diet consisting predominantly of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, plant protein and fatty fish is optimal for the prevention of ASCVD. Consuming more of these foods, while reducing consumption of foods with saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, salt, refined grain, and ultra-processed food intake are the common components of a healthful dietary pattern. Dietary recommendations for special populations including pediatrics, older persons, and nutrition and social determinants of health for ASCVD prevention are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100323", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4214934755", "source": "openalex"}

Patients admitted to hospitals with departments of cardiology were compared to hospitals without such departments. A total of 24 814 acute myocardial infarction patients were included, 9020 (36%) patients at 91 (29.8%) hospitals with departments of cardiology and 15 794 (64%) at 214 (70.2%) hospitals without cardiology departments. There were only minor differences in patient characteristics and prevalence of concomitant diseases between the two types of hospital. The first electrocardiogram was more often diagnostic at hospitals with cardiology departments (71.8% vs 66.5%, P<0.001). Reperfusion therapy and adjunctive medical therapy, such as aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors were used more often at cardiology departments (all P -values <0.001), even after adjustment for confounding parameters. Treatment improved at both types of hospital over time. Admission to a hospital with a department of cardiology was independently associated with a lower hospital mortality (14.2% vs 15.4%, adjusted OR=0.91; 95%CI: 0.83-0.99). Additional logistic regression models showed that the higher use of reperfusion therapy and recommended concomitant medical therapy was responsible for most of the survival benefit at such hospitals.Treatment of acute myocardial infarction patients at hospitals with departments of cardiology was independently associated with a higher use of recommended therapy and a lower hospital mortality compared to hospitals without such departments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1053/euhj.2001.2630", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120824364", "source": "openalex"}

We sought to evaluate the outcomes of ACS patients admitted to non-cardiology services in Southern Alberta. Retrospective chart review performed on all troponin-positive patients in the Calgary Health Region identified those diagnosed with ACS by their attending team. Patients admitted to non-cardiology and cardiology services were compared, using linked data from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcomes Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) registry and the Strategic Clinical Network for Cardiovascular Health and Stroke. From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008, 2105 ACS patients were identified, with 1636 (77.7%) admitted to cardiology and 469 (22.3%) to non-cardiology services. Patients admitted to non-cardiology services were older, had more comorbidities, and rarely received cardiology consultation (5.1%). Cardiac catheterization was underutilized (5.1% vs 86.4% in cardiology patients (p < 0.0001)), as was evidence-based pharmacotherapy (p < 0.0001). Following adjustment for baseline comorbidities, 30-day through 4-year mortality was significantly higher on non-cardiology vs. cardiology services (49.1% vs. 11.0% respectively at 4-years, p < 0.0001). In a large ACS population in the Calgary Health Region, 25% were admitted to non-cardiology services. These patients had worse outcomes, despite adjustment for baseline risk factor differences. Although many patients were appropriately admitted to non-cardiology services, the low use of investigations and secondary prevention medications may contribute to poorer patient outcome. Further research is required to identify process of care strategies to improve outcomes and lessen the burden of illness for patients and the health care system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-017-2294-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2616321416", "source": "openalex"}

The present analysis evaluates whether lipoprotein particle measures convey risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 4679 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants.Cox regression analysis was performed to determine associations between lipids or lipoproteins and primary CHD events. After adjustment for nonlipid variables, lipoprotein particle levels in fourth quartiles were found to convey significantly greater risk of incident CHD when compared to first quartile levels (hazard ratio [HR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]): ApoB (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.25-2.69), ApoB/ApoA-I (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.32-2.76), total low-density lipoprotein-particles (LDL-P; HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21-2.58), and the LDL-P/HDL-P (high-density lipoprotein-P) ratio (HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54-3.37). Associations between lipoprotein particle measures and CHD were attenuated after adjustment for standard lipid panel variables. Using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology risk calculator as a baseline model for CHD risk assessment, significant net reclassification improvement scores were found for ApoB/ApoA-I (0.18; P=0.007) and LDL-P/high-density lipoprotein-P (0.15; P<0.001). C-statistics revealed no significant increase in CHD event discrimination for any lipoprotein measure.Lipoprotein particle measures ApoB/ApoA-I and LDL-P/high-density lipoprotein-P marginally improved net reclassification improvement scores, but null findings for corresponding c-statistic are not supportive of lipoprotein testing. The attenuated associations of lipoprotein particle measures with CHD after the adjustment for lipids indicate that their measurement does not detect risk that is unaccounted for by the standard lipid panel. However, the possibility that lipoprotein measures may identify CHD risk in a subpopulation of individuals with normal cholesterol, but elevated lipoprotein particle numbers cannot be ruled out.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.114.304349", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2523748108", "source": "openalex"}

Intraoperative support techniques, including cardiopulmonary bypass, can precipitate a complex, systemic inflammatory response that impairs the function of multiple organs and results in more hemodynamic instability and early morbidity in newborns than in older infants and children. Vasoactive agents are routinely used in the postoperative management of these patients either to treat or prevent hemodynamic instability and low cardiac output. However, the effectiveness of vasoactive agents used either individually or in combination in achieving specific therapeutic goals such as maintenance of a minimum cardiac index or arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference has not been systematically evaluated in preterm and term neonates. In addition, there are insufficient safety data for these agents in preterm and term neonates, both as individual agents and in combination. This article proposes a framework for developing prospective clinical studies to determine the efficacy of different vasoactive agents to promote adequate cardiac output and hemodynamic stability after neonatal cardiac surgery. The framework provides an overview of the issues relevant to the design of prospective clinical studies of vasoactive agents in the newborn patient population undergoing cardiac surgery. The issues identified by the cardiology group illustrate the difficulty of designing and executing clinical trials in vulnerable pediatric populations with limited numbers of patients, especially when standard practice is widely believed to be beneficial despite the lack of rigorous data to support such practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2005-0620g", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1852397800", "source": "openalex"}

Many patients with undifferentiated low‐ to intermediate‐risk chest pain are admitted to hospital. Rapid‐access cardiology ( RAC ) services are hospital co‐located, cardiologist‐led outpatient clinics that provide rapid assessment and immediate management but not long‐term management. This service model is described as part of chest pain management and the National Service Framework for coronary heart disease in the United Kingdom ( UK ). We review the evidence on the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of RAC services. Our review finds that early assessment in RAC outpatient services of patients with suspected angina, without high‐risk features suspicious of an acute coronary syndrome, is safe, can reduce hospitalisations, is cost effective and has good medical practitioner and patient acceptability. However, the literature is limited in that the evaluation of this model of care has been only in the UK .

Lack of referral and lack of physician endorsement are well-known barriers to participation. Physicians who lack insights regarding CR are less likely to refer patients and recommend it. Cardiology fellows are early career physicians who spend a significant amount of time treating patients eligible for CR. At one institution's cardiology fellowship program, we sought to assess fellow attitudes and knowledge base regarding CR and to determine their facilitators and barriers to CR endorsement and referral. Methods: University of Pittsburgh Department of Medicine Cardiology fellows were surveyed and interviewed to assess CR knowledge, attitudes, and perceived facilitators and barriers to CR endorsement and referral. Results: The cardiology fellows at this institution had strong belief in the benefits and cost-effectiveness of CR. Despite their support of CR, they had low CR knowledge scores. Perceived impediments to CR included complicated logistics of CR operations, limited communication between CR staff and fellows, limited time with patients, presumed patient barriers, perceived self-barriers, and poor understanding of referral processes (particularly as they varied in each hospital in which they rotated). Perceived supports to CR included greater awareness of evidence-based outcomes, awareness of patient-centered outcomes, pre-arranged order sets, and reminders for referral. Conclusion: This study revealed perceptions of cardiology fellows at one institution regarding CR that have not been considered previously. Key barriers to endorsement and referral to CR were exposed as well as opportunities to overcome them. Fellowship training affords an important opportunity to improve CR education, and to potentially improve participation of eligible patients for this important aspect of care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/hcr.0000000000000532", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2999487803", "source": "openalex"}

Background Little is known about the prevalence, volume, case mix, and outcomes of PCI procedures performed by female interventional cardiologists. Methods Using data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ® , we performed a retrospective study of 2,465,685 PCI procedures performed at 1,431 U.S. hospitals between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2013. Interventionalist sex was ascertained from the National Provider Identifier number of each operator. Results Women accounted for only 4% (412/9,179) of interventional cardiologists in the U.S., and performed 3% ( n = 70,009) of all PCI procedures during the time period studied. Forty‐one percent of female interventionalists operated at an institution with no other female operators. Female interventionalists performed a median of 48 PCI procedures per year (interquartile range: 22–87). Of the cases performed by female interventionalists, 77% were performed on patients with acute coronary syndrome, 3% on patients with cardiogenic shock, and 16% on call. In‐hospital mortality was low (1.8%), and was not significantly different between female operators with high (≥50 cases/year) versus low (1.95% vs. 1.75%, unadjusted P = 0.12, adjusted OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.84–1.27) annual procedure volume. Conclusions Female interventional cardiologists remain uncommon in contemporary U.S. practice. Performing only a very small proportion of PCI cases, female interventionalists are often low‐volume operators, yet no significant differences in patient mortality were observed in low‐ versus high‐volume operators. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26118", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1944438776", "source": "openalex"}

Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Germany Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is established in clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, current guidelines for when this technique should be employed in clinical practice have not been revised since a Task Force report of 1998.1 Considerable technical and practice advances have been made in the intervening years and the level of interest from clinicians in this field is at an unprecedented level. Therefore the aim of this report from a Consensus Panel of established experts in the field of CMR is to update these guidelines. As CMR is a multi-disciplinary technique with international interest, the Consensus Panel was composed of European and American cardiologists and radiologists with major input from members with additional established expertise in paediatric cardiology, nuclear cardiology, magnetic resonance physics and spectroscopy, as well as health economics. The Consensus Panel was originated, approved and funded in its activities by the Working Group on CMR of the European Society of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. The Consensus Panel recommendations are based on evidence compiled from the literature and expert experience. If there is insufficient evidence in the literature, this is indicated in the report but usually no recommendations are made under these circumstances. The appropriateness of using CMR is described for the frequent disease entities where imaging information may be warranted. The diagnostic use of CMR will be described in the context of other, competing imaging techniques, with particular emphasis on the differential indications with respect to echocardiography. The usefulness of CMR in specific diseases is summarized by means of the following classification:", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehj.2004.06.040", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2148768265", "source": "openalex"}

With regard to early diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) ESC guidelines, for the first time, give a 1B recommendation for a rapid rule-out and rule-in protocol at 0 and 1 h if a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test with a validated 0/1 h algorithm is available, with additional testing after 3–6 h if the first two troponin measurements are not conclusive and the clinical condition is still suggestive of ACS, while ACC/AHA recommend to measure troponin at presentation and 3–6 h after symptom onset. Both guidelines recommend an immediate invasive strategy within 2 hours of presentation in very high-risk patients, an early invasive strategy within 24 h in high-risk patients and an invasive strategy within 72 h in intermediate risk patients. Finally, ESC guidelines give 1A recommendation for the radial approach in experienced centres and provide a new flow chart for the management of antithrombotic drugs in patients with concomitant non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( Figure 1 ). They also give for the first time 3B recommendation for not to preloading patients in whom …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv686", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2226607521", "source": "openalex"}

Background Transradial access for catheterization has been shown to increase occupational radiation dose. Current shielding techniques are primarily based on the femoral access. This article looks at the clinical occupational combined dose reduction effect of a commercially available shield and drape which is specific to access type. Methods The evaluation took place in a busy interventional cardiology laboratory, with a single plane 30 × 40 cm flat panel detector (Siemens Artis Zee, Germany). Radiation exposure to staff was measured using electronic personal dosimeters (Unfors RaysafeAB, Sweden) placed at the collar. Patient radiation exposure was assessed using screening time and dose area product per case. Both staff and patient radiation exposure were monitored for a number of case types and operators before, during, and after deployment of the new shield and drapes. Results The cardiologists' overall median collar badge reading per case reduced from 15.4 μSv per case without the shield/drape combination to 7.3 μSv per case with the shield drape combination in situ ( P &lt; 0.001). The radiographers badge reading was reduced from 4.2 μSv per case without to 2.5 μSv per case with the shield drape combination in situ ( P &lt; 0.001). There was no statistical difference in the cardiac technician's badge reading. Patient's dose area product was not significantly affected by the placement of the shield and drape combination. Conclusions The shield/drape combination can significantly reduce operator exposure in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1942620245", "source": "openalex"}

By comparing mortality that was observed following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients who were allotted a low versus a high score, we aimed to systematically investigate mortality prediction using the SYNTAX Score II in Interventional Cardiology. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for relevant publications using the terms “SYNTAX Score II and percutaneous coronary intervention.” The main outcome was all-cause mortality. This analysis was carried out by the RevMan 5.3 software [risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated]. Results: A total number of 9443 participants were enrolled for this analysis. As different studies reported different range of SYNTAX Score II, we further classified these scores range into 4 different groups: 17 &lt; SS &gt; 17, 20 &lt; SS &gt; 20, 22 &lt; SS &gt; 22, and 26 &lt; SS &gt; 26 appropriately. Results of this analysis showed that the risk of mortality in patients with a high SYNTAX Score II (SS &gt; 17) was significantly higher (RR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.05–6.73; P = .04) than patients with a low SYNTAX Score II (SS &lt; 17). Even when participants with a low SYNTAX Score II (SS &lt; 20) were compared with patients who were assigned to a higher SYNTAX Score II (SS &gt; 20), a significantly higher risk of mortality was associated with a high SYNTAX Score II (RR: 3.73, 95% CI: 1.99 – 6.96; P = .0001). Conclusion: Following PCI, the risk of mortality was higher in those patients with a high SYNTAX Score II. The SYNTAX Score II might be considered as an important tool to predict mortality in Interventional Cardiology. Future research should further explore the benefits of this tool.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000014043", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2912992636", "source": "openalex"}

With an ever-increasing emphasis on cost containment, outcome assessment forms the basis of preserving the quality of patient care. Today, outcomes assessment encompasses a wide array of subjects including clinical, economic, and humanistic (i.e., quality of life) outcomes. For nuclear cardiology, evidence-based medicine would require a threshold level of evidence in order to justify the added cost of any test in a patient's work-up. This evidence would include large multicenter, observational series as well as randomized trial data in sufficiently large and diverse patient populations. The new movement in evidence-based medicine is also being applied to the introduction of new technologies, in particular when comparative modalities exist. In the past 5 years, we have seen a dramatic shift in the quality of outcomes data published in nuclear cardiology. This includes the use of statistically rigorous risk-adjusted techniques as well as large populations (i.e., > 500 patients) representing multiple diverse medical care settings. This has been the direct result of the development of multiple outcomes databases that have now amassed thousands of patients worth of data. One of the benefits of examining outcomes in large patient datasets is the ability to assess individual endpoints (e.g., cardiac death) as compared with smaller datasets that often assess combined endpoints (e.g., death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina). New technologies for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease have contributed to the rising costs of care. In the United States and in Europe, costs of care have risen dramatically, consuming an ever-increasing amount of available resources. The overuse of diagnostic angiography often leads to unnecessary revascularization that does not lead to improvement in outcome. Thus, the potential exists that stress SPECT imaging, a highly effective diagnostic tool, could effect substantial change in reducing inappropriate use of an invasive procedure resulting in cost effective cardiac care. A synthesis of current economic evidence in gated SPECT imaging will be presented. In conclusion, a current state of the evidence review is presented on the clinical and economic data using nuclear cardiology imaging.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2395689221", "source": "openalex"}

Importantly, a pattern of risk heterogeneity has emerged, showing that not all diabetic patients are at high or very high risk. In fact, most younger patients who have no overt cardiovascular risk factors may be more adequately classified as being at intermediate or even low cardiovascular risk. Thus, there is a need for cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with diabetes. The present panel reviews the best current evidence and proposes a practical risk-based approach on treatment for patients with diabetes. The Brazilian Diabetes Society, the Brazilian Society of Cardiology, and the Brazilian Endocrinology and Metabolism Society gathered to form an expert panel including 28 cardiologists and endocrinologists to review the best available evidence and to draft up-to-date an evidence-based guideline with practical recommendations for risk stratification and prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetes. The guideline includes 59 recommendations covering: (1) the impact of new anti-hyperglycemic drugs and new lipid lowering drugs on cardiovascular risk; (2) a guide to statin use, including new definitions of LDL-cholesterol and in non-HDL-cholesterol targets; (3) evaluation of silent myocardial ischemia and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes; (4) hypertension treatment; and (5) the use of antiplatelet therapy. Diabetes is a heterogeneous disease. Although cardiovascular risk is increased in most patients, those without risk factors or evidence of sub-clinical atherosclerosis are at a lower risk. Optimal management must rely on an approach that will cover both cardiovascular disease prevention in individuals in the highest risk as well as protection from overtreatment in those at lower risk.

We review issues concerning the prophylactic use of vancomycin in adult cardiology and cardiac surgery with special attention to dosing and indications. There is no indication for the routine use of prophylactic vancomycin in pacemaker implantations, cardiac catheterization, and transesophageal echocardiography. In institutions with a high incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis, vancomycin may be used for antibiotic prophylaxis in place of cephalosporins for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation. The strongest evidence in support of the prophylactic use of vancomycin is during cardiac surgeries, particularly valvular surgeries in institutions with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis. When vancomycin is used prior to open heart surgery, the dose should be 15 mg/kg rather than the standard 1 g dose that is often recommended in the literature and used by 85% of institutional pharmacists who responded to our survey. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons should assume leadership roles in promoting its responsible use.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/107424840400900i103", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1985156797", "source": "openalex"}

In this Consensus Statement as well as recent international guidelines for management of arterial hypertension, HBP monitoring has been implemented in diagnostic confirmation of hypertension, identification of hypertension phenotypes, guidance of anti-hypertensive treatment, and detection of hypotensive events. HBP should be obtained by repetitive measurements based on the \" 722 \" principle, which is referred to duplicate blood pressure readings taken per occasion, twice daily, over seven consecutive days. The \" 722\" principle of HBP monitoring should be applied in clinical settings, including confirmation of hypertension diagnosis, 2 weeks after adjustment of antihypertensive medications, and at least every 3 months in well-controlled hypertensive patients. A good reproducibility of HBP monitoring could be achieved by individuals carefully following the instructions before and during HBP measurement, by using validated BP devices with an upper arm cuff. Corresponding to office BP thresholds of 140/90 and 130/80 mmHg, the thresholds (or targets) of HBP are 135/85 and 130/80 mmHg, respectively. HBP-based hypertension management strategies including bedtime dosing (for uncontrolled morning hypertension), shifting to drugs with longer-acting antihypertensive effect (for uncontrolled evening hypertension), and adding another antihypertensive drug (for uncontrolled morning and evening hypertension) should be considered. Only with the support from medical caregivers, paramedical team, or tele- monitoring, HBP monitoring could reliably improve the control of hypertension.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.6515/acs.202011_36(6).20201106a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3109430177", "source": "openalex"}

These advances in molecular biology have enhanced our understanding of the primary defects and basic mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of these conditions and their phenotypic expression, and in the process, new perspectives on cardiac diagnosis have been formulated. In the course of this scientific evolution, a certain measure of uncertainty has also arisen regarding the implications of genetic analysis for clinical diagnostic criteria. New subgroups of genetically affected individuals without conventional clinical diagnostic findings have been identified solely by virtue of access to molecular laboratory techniques, creating a number of medical and ethical concerns regarding the possible clinical implications. Indeed, the extent to which such individuals should receive sequential evaluations and/or therapy or be subjected to employment or insurance discrimination, psychological harm, loss of privacy, or unnecessary withdrawal from competitive athletics is uncertain but remains a legitimate source of concern. It is therefore particularly timely and appropriate to analyze these issues in detail, specifically the extent to which molecular biology has revised traditional diagnostic criteria. The role of genetic testing in assessing prognosis and identifying high-risk subgroups or in defining basic disease mechanisms and pathophysiology is, however, largely beyond the scope of this scientific statement. As models for the present critique, we selected the 3 most common familial cardiovascular diseases for which gene defects have been identified, each of which is associated with autosomal dominant inheritance and a risk for sudden cardiac death: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long-QT syndrome (LQTS), and Marfan syndrome (MFS).", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2043812550", "source": "openalex"}

A review by the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy", "text": "Population ageing has resulted in an increasing number of older people living with chronic diseases (multimorbidity) requiring five or more medications daily (polypharmacy). Ageing produces important changes in the cardiovascular system and represents the most potent single cardiovascular risk factor. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) constitute the greatest burden for older people, their caregivers, and healthcare systems. Cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in older people is complex because age-related changes in body composition, organ function, homeostatic mechanisms, and comorbidities modify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of many commonly used cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular drugs. Additionally, polypharmacy increases the risk of adverse drug reactions and drug interactions, which in turn can lead to increased morbi-mortality and healthcare costs. Unfortunately, evidence of drug efficacy and safety in older people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy is limited because these individuals are frequently underrepresented/excluded from clinical trials. Moreover, clinical guidelines are largely written with a single-disease focus and only occasionally address the issue of coordination of care, when and how to discontinue treatments, if required, or how to prioritize recommendations for patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. This review analyses the main challenges confronting healthcare professionals when prescribing in older people with CVD, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy. Our goal is to provide information that can contribute to improving drug prescribing, efficacy, and safety, as well as drug adherence and clinical outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcvp/pvac005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210669551", "source": "openalex"}

A Keystone of Cardiology.", "text": "Wall stress has been used as one of the parameters of myocardial mechanics. The present review focuses on recently developed data on ventricular wall stress, especially in relation to other newly developed areas in cardiology. In hypertensive hearts, there is a broad continuous spectrum in the structural and functional changes: those with low wall stress (inappropriate hypertrophy), those with normal wall stress (appropriate hypertrophy) and those with high wall stress (inadequate hypertrophy). Among them, the responses to neurohumoral stimuli are various, and their clinical features and courses also varied. These differences in wall stress among the different categories of hypertensive hearts may be caused by the variable influences of non-mechanical factors, such as molecular, metabolic and neurohumoral ones. Wall stress is an essential determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption, and is also an important determinant of the myocardial contractile state and diastolic function. In contrast to excitation-contraction coupling, contraction-excitation feedback has been studied, suggesting the importance of wall stress regulating electrical phenomena. The interrelationship between mechanical factors (including wall stress) and non-mechanical factors (including molecular, metabolic, neurohumoral and genetic ones) has been investigated intensively. In conclusion, wall stress (or force on the myocardial cell) may be a keystone in cardiology, relating to each of the cardiac phenomena. If wall stress deviates from the normal range, even with compensatory mechanisms, severe cardiac events occur. The compensatory mechanisms for wall stress may act as a risk factor on the heart, especially when the wall stress remains outside the normal range.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1536/ihj.35.577", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2324681181", "source": "openalex"}

The three International Anatomical Terminologies have been critical as the basis of our study. Exclusion criteria were syndromes, diseases, signs, anomalies, surgical procedures, indexes, tests, grading, and the methods, which are used as eponyms in Cardiology, once they are not considered Anatomical Terms. It has been our intent to show that different eponyms characterize the same anatomical structure.A list with the 25 most common eponyms listed by the three International Anatomical Terminologies is listed in Table1.Should eponyms be abandoned? Of course not, once they remain a useful reflection of medical history. We could prove to our journey from 1960 to 2011, that the best well-known Atlas and Textbooks available do not use so many anatomical eponyms in Cardiology. They are only 25 (without including arteries, veins, and nerves of the cardiovascular system) and all the authors use no more than 9 or 12 of them.

Although generally very safe, post-vaccine myocarditis can result from adaptive humoral and cellular, cardiac-specific inflammation within days and weeks of vaccination. Rates of vaccine-associated myocarditis vary by age and sex with the highest rates in males between 12 and 39 years. The clinical course is generally mild with rare cases of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and arrhythmias. Mild cases are likely underdiagnosed as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is not commonly performed even in suspected cases and not at all in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. Hospitalization of symptomatic patients with electrocardiographic changes and increased plasma troponin levels is considered necessary in the acute phase to monitor for arrhythmias and potential decline in left ventricular function. In addition to evaluation for symptoms, electrocardiographic changes and elevated troponin levels, CMR is the best non-invasive diagnostic tool with endomyocardial biopsy being restricted to severe cases with heart failure and/or arrhythmias. The management beyond guideline-directed treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias includes non-specific measures to control pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids have been used in more severe cases, with only anecdotal evidence for their effectiveness. In all age groups studied, the overall risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospitalization and death are hugely greater than the risks from post-vaccine myocarditis.

Data extraction was performed by one of the authors.Data SynthesisDiabetes mellitus markedly increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, and death. The metabolic abnormalities caused by diabetes induce vascular dysfunction that predisposes this patient population to atherosclerosis. Blood pressure control, lipid-lowering therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and antiplatelet drugs significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

For femoral access, a micropuncture needle was used regularly by 89% and ultrasound-guided puncture by 81%, and 43% used vascular closure devices in most cases (>80%). Intravascular ultrasound was performed and interpreted very comfortably by 62% and optical coherence tomography (OCT) by 32%, and 20% did not have access to OCT. Approximately one-third felt very comfortable performing various atherectomy techniques. Covered stents, fat embolization, and coil embolization were used very comfortably by 14%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. Embolic protection devices were used very comfortably by 11% to 24% of IC fellows. Almost one-quarter of fellows (24%) were warned about their high radiation exposure. Eighty-four percent considered IC fellowship somewhat or very stressful, and 16% reported inadequate psychological support. This survey highlights opportunities for improvement with regard to the use of intravascular imaging, atherectomy techniques, complication prevention and management strategies, radiation awareness and mitigation, and psychological support.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcin.2022.11.034", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4320489944", "source": "openalex"}

A ‘call to action’ from the Section on Secondary Prevention and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology", "text": "The benefit of regular physical activity and exercise training for the prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is undisputed. Many molecular mechanisms mediating exercise effects have been deciphered. Personalised exercise prescription can help patients in achieving their individual greatest benefit from an exercise-based cardiovascular rehabilitation programme. Yet, we still struggle to provide truly personalised exercise prescriptions to our patients. In this position paper, we address novel basic and translational research concepts that can help us understand the principles underlying the inter-individual differences in the response to exercise, and identify early on who would most likely benefit from which exercise intervention. This includes hereditary, non-hereditary and sex-specific concepts. Recent insights have helped us to take on a more holistic view, integrating exercise-mediated molecular mechanisms with those influenced by metabolism and immunity. Unfortunately, while the outline is recognisable, many details are still lacking to turn the understanding of a concept into a roadmap ready to be used in clinical routine. This position paper therefore also investigates perspectives on how the advent of ‘big data’ and the use of animal models could help unravel inter-individual responses to exercise parameters and thus influence hypothesis-building for translational research in exercise-based cardiovascular rehabilitation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319877716", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2979043067", "source": "openalex"}

We evaluated changes in the evidence underlying guidelines published over a 10‐year period. Methods and Results Thirty‐five American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines were divided into 2 time periods: 2008 to 2012 and 2013 to 2017. Guidelines were categorized into the following topic areas: arrhythmias, prevention, acute and stable ischemia, heart failure, valvular heart disease, and vascular medicine. Changes in recommendations were assessed for each topic area. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association designated class of recommendation as level I, II , or III (I represented “strongly recommended”) and levels of evidence ( LOE ) as A, C, or C (A represented “highest quality”). The median number of recommendations per each topic area was 281 (198–536, interquartile range) in 2008 to 2012 versus 247 (190–451.3, interquartile range) in 2013 to 2017. The median proportion of class of recommendation I was 49.3% and 44.4% in the 2 time periods, 38.0% and 44.5% for class of recommendation II , and 12.5% and 11.2% for class of recommendation III . Median proportions for LOE A were 15.7% and 14.1%, 41.0% and 52.8% for LOE B, and 46.9% and 32.5% for LOE C. The decrease in the proportion of LOE C was highest in heart failure (24.8%), valvular heart disease (22.3%), and arrhythmia (19.2%). An increase in the proportion of LOE B was observed for these same areas: 31.8%, 23.8%, and 19.2%, respectively.

So far, the analysis of trials, registries, and observational studies have demonstrated that patients with mid-range LVEF belong to a patient cohort with generally intermediate clinical profile as compared with other groups but with a remarkable variety of intrinsic phenotypes. This is due to the limitations of LVEF as the sole criterion to categorize patients with HF and characterize their prognosis, above all when it is >40%. To better define the HFmrEF phenotype, it is reasonable to consider other parameters, such as LVEF changes over time, HF aetiology, co-morbidities, and other imaging parameters.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the level of bullying of trainees within medical specialties.An annual survey of UK cardiology trainees was conducted through the British Junior Cardiologists' Association between 2017 and 2020 and asked questions about experiencing and witnessing bullying, and exposure to inappropriate language/behaviour in cardiology departments. Fisher's exact tests and univariable logistic regression models were used to describe associations between trainee characteristics, and reports of bullying and inappropriate language/behaviour.Of 1358 trainees, bullying was reported by 152 (11%). Women had 55% higher odds of reporting being bullied (OR: 1.55 95% CI (1.08 to 2.21)). Non-UK medical school graduates were substantially more likely to be bullied (European Economic Area (EEA) OR: 2.22 (1.31 to 3.76), non-EEA/UK OR: 3.16 (2.13 to 4.68)) compared with those graduating from UK-based medical schools.

Hypothesis Patients with ADHF and low socioeconomic status have better postdischarge mortality and readmission outcomes when cardiologists are involved in their in‐hospital care. Methods We retrospectively searched the electronic medical record for patients hospitalized for ADHF from 2001 to 2010 in 3 urban hospitals within a large university‐based health system. These patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether a cardiologist was involved in their care or not. Measured outcomes were 30‐ and 60‐day postdischarge mortality and readmission rates. Results Out of the 7516 ADHF patients, 1434 patients were seen by a cardiologist (19%). These patients had lower 60‐day mortality (5.4% vs 7.0%; hazard ratio [ HR ]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [ CI ]: 0.52‐0.96, P = 0.034) and lower 30‐ and 60‐day readmission rates (16.7% vs 20.6%; HR : 0.76, 95% CI : 0.66‐0.89, P = 0.002, and 26.1% vs 30.2%; HR : 0.81, 95% CI : 0.72‐0.92, P = 0.003, respectively). There was no significant difference in the in‐hospital mortality between the 2 groups. Compared with other races, whites with systolic HF have marginally lower HF ‐related readmission rates when treated by cardiologists.

Although clearly useful, the Homeostasis Model Assessment index (an insulin resistance measurement) has not been systematically applied in clinical practice. One of the main reasons is the discrepancy in cut-off values reported in different populations. We sought to evaluate in a Portuguese population the ideal cut-off for Homeostasis Model Assessment index and assess its relationship with metabolic syndrome.We selected a cohort of individuals admitted electively in a Cardiology ward with a BMI < 25 Kg/m2 and no abnormalities in glucose metabolism (fasting plasma glucose < 100 mg/dL and no diabetes). The 90th percentile of the Homeostasis Model Assessment index distribution was used to obtain the ideal cut-off for insulin resistance. We also selected a validation cohort of 300 individuals (no exclusion criteria applied).From 7 000 individuals, and after the exclusion criteria, there were left 1 784 individuals. The 90th percentile for Homeostasis Model Assessment index was 2.33. In the validation cohort, applying that cut-off, we have 49.3% of individuals with insulin resistance. However, only 69.9% of the metabolic syndrome patients had insulin resistance according to that cut-off. By ROC curve analysis, the ideal cut-off for metabolic syndrome is 2.41. Homeostasis Model Assessment index correlated with BMI (r = 0.371, p < 0.001) and is an independent predictor of the presence of metabolic syndrome (OR 19.4, 95% CI 6.6 - 57.2, p < 0.001).Our study showed that in a Portuguese population of patients admitted electively in a Cardiology ward, 2.33 is the Homeostasis Model Assessment index cut-off for insulin resistance and 2.41 for metabolic syndrome.Homeostasis Model Assessment index is directly correlated with BMI and is an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome.Introdução: A resistência à insulina é a chave fisiopatológica de explicação da Síndrome Metabólica. Apesar de claramente útil, o índice Homeostasis Model Assessment (uma medição da resistência à insulina) não tem sido aplicado sistematicamente na prática clínica. Uma das principais razões relaciona-se com a discrepância de valores limiares reportados em diferentes populações. Procurámos avaliar uma população portuguesa o valor limiar ideal e avaliar a sua relação com a Síndrome Metabólica. Material e Métodos: Selecionámos uma coorte de indivíduos admitidos eletivamente numa enfermaria de cardiologia com um IMC < 25 Kg/m2 e sem anomalias do metabolismo da glicose (glicémia em jejum < 100 mg/dL e sem diabetes). Utilizámos o percentil 90 da distribuição do índice Homeostasis Model Assessment para seleção do limiar adequado para resistência à insulina. Selecionouse também uma coorte de validação composta por 300 indivíduos, sem aplicação dos critérios de exclusão referidos anteriormente. Resultados: De uma população de 7 000 indivíduos e após aplicação dos critérios de exclusão, ficámos com 1 784 indivíduos para análise. O percentil 90 do índice foi 2,33. Na coorte de validação, aplicando esse limiar, 49,3% dos indivíduos apresentam resistência à insulina. Contudo, apenas 69,9% dos doentes com síndrome metabólica apresentam resistência à insulina com esse limiar. Por análise das curvas ROC, o limiar ideal para síndrome metabólica é 2,41. O índice Homeostasis Model Assessment correlacionou-se com o IMC (r = 0,371, p < 0,001) e é um preditor independente de presença de síndrome metabólica (OR 19,4, IC 95% 6,6 – 57,2, p < 0,001).

An international classification has been developed regarding arrhythmias and the benefits of pacemakers. In class I conditions, the benefits of pacemakers are well established, decreasing symptoms and improving prognosis. The most common indications are for patients with symptomatic bradycardia associated with sick sinus syndrome and heart block.

The analytical performance of the i-STAT troponin I (cTnI) method was assessed. A total of 53 NSTE ambulance ECG patients admitted to hospital were followed. The ambulance had experimental software able to receive data from the i-STAT device and transmit it to a protected address and server. cTnI mean values from 2.0 to 34 microg/L showed a total CV of 3.0-5.6%. The detection limit was 0.016 microg/L. A mean cTnI concentration of 0.09 microg/L was associated with a CV of 8.0% (decision limit). The i-STAT cTnI method was linear for concentrations from 0 to 35 microg/L. There was no effect (p<0.05) of interfering substances. For point-of-care testing (POCT), cTnI was >0.09 microg/L in 20 AMI patients (91%). The median ambulance turnaround time (TAT) was 12 min and median hospital TAT was 40 min, a difference of 28 min. The high sensitivity of the i-STAT cTnI method integrated with tele-medicine procedures could play an important role in the management of acute coronary syndrome patients related to the pre-hospital phase (early diagnosis and treatment in the ambulance). These approaches may allow improvements in patient outcomes and continuous monitoring of the POCT network in the central laboratory, thus meeting quality requirements.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm.2006.125", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2089425821", "source": "openalex"}

Typically, these patients are admitted to exclude myocardial infarction despite a very low incidence of coronary artery disease. However, missed myocardial infarctions in patients who are inadvertently sent home from the ED have significant adverse outcomes and associated legal consequences. This leads to a liberal policy to admit patients with chest pain, presenting a substantial burden in terms of cost and resources. Many centers have developed chest pain centers, using a wide range of diagnostic modalities to deal with this dilemma. We discuss the methods currently available to exclude myocardial ischemia and infarction in the ED, focusing on the use of myocardial perfusion imaging as both an adjunct and an alternative to routine testing.

Interpretation of the calculated indicators presented in the form of ratios and differences is difficult, since they can be associated with several combinations of primary data giving the same value. Aim. To find a way to overcome this limitation and take a more comprehensive approach. Material and methods. We analyzed the data on left ventricular volume and blood pressure (BP) in 275 patients (women — 207), obtained using echocardiography and BP monitor. To calculate a lost companion (c) value based on a difference or dimensionless ratio, we applied the Pythagorean theorem. The lost companion is defined as the hypotenuse in each study area. To calculate the pulse pressure companion (PP), the following formula was used: PP(c)=Ö(SBP 2 +SBP 2 ). Similar methods were applied to ejection fraction (EF), augmentation pressure (AG) and AG/PP ratio, resulting in the ratio called augmentation index (AIx). Results. 1. Mean blood pressure (MBP) acts as a surrogate for the PP companion (PPc) values (R=0,970, N=257). 2. We have identified correlations between PPc and pulse wave velocity (R=0,397, N=193), and AGc with AIx (75) (R=0,662, N=198). 3. EF has an inverse relationship with the end diastolic volume (EDV) (R=-0,559, N=187), and the ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC) correlates with ESV (r=-0,627, N=180). 4. Comparison of EDV and VACc revealed R of 0,949. Conclusion. Companions calculated from the available data can have significant additional diagnostic value without the need for additional measurements. It is important to note that the combination of traditional ratio-based and suggested companions allows for more accurate data on individual patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15829/1560-4071-2020-3929", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3102658800", "source": "openalex"}

There is no comprehensive review on the molecular signaling pathways of these active components. In this review, we investigated the molecular targets of bioactive Salvia diterpenes responsible for the treatment of nervous and cardiovascular diseases. The effects on different pathways, including apoptosis signaling, oxidative stress phenomena, the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques, and tau phosphorylation, have all been considered to be mechanisms of the anti-Alzheimer properties of Salvia diterpenes. Additionally, effects on the benzodiazepine and kappa opioid receptors and neuroprotective effects are noted as neuropharmacological properties of Salvia diterpenes, including tanshinone IIA, salvinorin A, cryptotanshinone, and miltirone. Tanshinone IIA, as the primary diterpene of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has beneficial activities in heart diseases because of its ability to scavenge free radicals and its effects on transcription factors, such as nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Additionally, tanshinone IIA has also been proposed to have cardioprotective properties including antiarrhythmic activities and effects on myocardial infarction. With respect to the potential therapeutic effects of Salvia diterpenes, comprehensive clinical trials are warranted to evaluate these valuable molecules as lead compounds.

Ozsu concerns several issues. The first issue is the identification of low-risk patients with acute pulmonary embolism. According to the 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, a Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) score of zero efficiently identifies patients at low risk for death; assessment of right ventricle dysfunction by imaging or biomarkers is optional in patients with sPESI 0 [1]. Our study reports a simulation of what would happen in clinical practice by adopting the risk stratification model proposed by the 2014 ESC guidelines (see table 2 of our article) [2]. Patients at low risk (sPESI 0) would not undergo assessment of right ventricle dysfunction by imaging or biomarkers. The warning here is that ∼40% of these patients have right ventricle dysfunction at imaging and ∼30% of them have increased troponin levels [2]. Are these abnormalities of clinical value? It depends on the clinical relevance of the 0.5% observed 30-day mortality. In our opinion, 0.5% mortality at 30 days does not justify the mandatory assessment of right ventricle dysfunction and biomarkers in all patients with sPESI 0. However, we believe that right to left ventricle dimension ratio should be evaluated and reported for all patients who have computed tomography angiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [3]. This assessment will help clinicians to properly select low-risk patients (sPESI 0 and no right ventricle dilation) without performing any additional test.

METHODS: RVU was determined by matching RVU values to Current Procedural Terminology codes generated for cases performed at a single institution. Differences in median case duration, radiation exposure, adverse events, and RVU values by risk category and cases were assessed. Interventional case types were ranked from lowest to highest median RVU value, and correlations with case duration, radiation dose, and a cases-predicted probability of an adverse event were quantified with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Between January 2008 and December 2010, 3557 of 4011 cases were identified with an RVU and risk category designation, of which 2982 were assigned a case type. Median RVU values, radiation dose, and case duration increased with procedure risk category. Although all diagnostic cases had similar RVU values (median 10), adverse event rates ranged from 6% to 21% by age group (P &amp;lt; .001). Median RVU values ranged from 9 to 54 with the lowest in diagnostic and biopsy cases and increasing with isolated and then multiple interventions. Among interventional cases, no correlation existed between ranked RVU value and case duration, radiation dose, or adverse event probability (P = .13, P = .62, and P = .43, respectively).

The role of pharmacy technicians in obtaining best possible medication histories (BPMHs) and performing reconciliation at the admission and transfer interfaces of care for pediatric patients has not been described.Objectives: To compare the completeness and accuracy of BPMHs and reconciliation conducted by a pharmacy technician (pilot study) and by nurses and/or pharmacists (baseline). The severity of identified unintentional discrepancies was rated to determine their clinical importance.Methods: This prospective cohort comparison study involved patients up to 18 years of age admitted to and/or transferred between the Cardiology ward and the Cardiac Critical Care Unit of a pediatric tertiary care teaching hospital. A pharmacy resident conducted two 3-week audits: the first to assess the completeness and accuracy of BPMHs and reconciliation performed by nurses and/or pharmacists and the second to assess the completeness and accuracy of BPMHs and reconciliation performed by a pharmacy technician.Results: The total number of patients was 38 in the baseline phase and 46 in the pilot period. There were no statistically significant differences between the baseline and pilot audits in terms of completion of BPMH (82% [28/34] versus 78% [21/27], p = 0.75) or completion of reconciliation (70% [23/33] versus 75% [15/20], p = 0.76) within 24 h of admission. Completeness of transfer reconciliation was significantly higher during the pilot study than at baseline (91% [31/34] versus 61% [11/18], p = 0.022). No significant differences between the baseline and pilot audits were found in the proportions of patients with at least one BPMH discrepancy (38% [13/34] versus 22% [6/27], p = 0.27), at least one unintentional discrepancy upon admission (21% [7/33] versus 10% [2/20], p = 0.46), or at least one unintentional discrepancy at the transfer interface (6% [1/18] versus 3% [1/34], p = 0.58).

Future studies should explore the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of this practice model.RÉSUMÉContexte : Le bilan comparatif des médicaments permet de réduire les possibles divergences au chapitre des médicaments ainsi que les éventuels événements indésirables liés aux médicaments. Le rôle des techniciens en pharmacie en ce qui a trait à l'obtention des meilleurs schémas thérapeutiques possibles (MSTP) et à la réalisation du bilan comparatif des médicaments au moment de l'admission et du transfert n'a pas encore été exposé chez l'enfant.Objectifs : Comparer l'exhaustivité ainsi que l'exactitude des MSTP et des bilans comparatifs réalisés par une technicienne en pharmacie (étude pilote) à ceux réalisés par du personnel infirmier ou des pharmaciens (référence). Les divergences non intentionnelles observées ont été notées selon leur degré de gravité afin d'en établir l'importance clinique.Méthodes : Cette étude de cohorte prospective comparative a été menée auprès de patients de 18 ans et moins ayant été admis à l'unité des soins intensifs coronariens ou au service de cardiologie, ou ayant été transférés de l'un à l'autre de ces deux services, dans un hôpital d'enseignement de soins tertiaires pour enfants. Une résidente en pharmacie a procédé à deux vérifications de trois semaines chacune. Celles-ci avaient pour but d'évaluer l'exhaustivité et l'exactitude des MSTP ainsi que des bilans comparatifs : la première évaluation portant sur le travail effectué par du personnel infirmier ou des pharmaciens et la seconde portant sur celui réalisé par une technicienne en pharmacie.Résultats : Au total, la vérification a porté sur 38 patients au cours de la période de référence et 46 pour l'étude pilote. Aucune différence statistiquement significative n'a été notée entre les deux vérifications en ce qui a trait à l'obtention des MSTP (82 % [28/34] contre 78 % [21/27], p = 0,75) ou à la réalisation des bilans comparatifs (70 % [23/33] contre 75 % [15/20], p = 0,76) dans les 24 heures suivant l'admission. L'exhaustivité dans la réalisation des bilans comparatifs au moment des transferts était nettement plus élevée dans l'étude pilote que durant la période de référence (91 % [31/34] contre 61 % [11/18], p = 0,022). Aucune différence notable n'a été relevée entre les deux vérifications quant à la proportion de patients chez qui l'on a noté au moins une divergence dans le MSTP (38 % [13/34] contre 22 % [6/27], p = 0,27), au moins une divergence non intentionnelle au moment de l'admission (21 % [7/33] contre 10 % [2/20], p = 0,46) et au moins une divergence non intentionnelle au moment du transfert (6 % [1/18] contre 3 % [1/34], p = 0,58). Aucune des 16 divergences non intentionnelles n'a été classée comme cause de gêne importante pour le patient ou d'une détérioration clinique de ce dernier.Conclusions : Un technicien en pharmacie formé réalise des bilans comparatifs des médicaments, au moment de l'admission ou du transfert d'un enfant, d'une qualité comparable à celle du personnel infirmier ou des pharmaciens en ce qui a trait à l'exhaustivité et à l'exactitude. Les études ultérieures devraient porter sur la viabilité et le rapport coût-efficacité de ce modèle de pratique.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4212/cjhp.v68i1.1419", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2105192915", "source": "openalex"}

The initiatives formed the foundation of the Japanese national strategy and have been continuously refined, resulting in the current environment of digital health and digital medicine. Digital health–related terminologies are organized, such as “digital health,” “digital medicine,” and “digital therapeutics” (DTx), as well as several common digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mobile health (mHealth). DTx is included in mHealth and is a novel disease treatment option. Also, this article thoroughly describes DTx in Japan and compares it with those in the US and Germany, the leading countries in digital health–related policies, regulations, and their development status. In Japan, two of three DTx applications that have been approved and reimbursed by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare are explained in detail in relation to cardiovascular medicine. When added to a standard smoking cessation program, the DTx system for nicotine dependence significantly improved the continuous abstinence rate. Moreover, the DTx for hypertension together with the guideline-based hypertension management was effective in patients aged 65 years or younger who were diagnosed with essential hypertension without antihypertensive agents, and it was also found to be cost-effective. DTx in cardiovascular medicine, with consideration on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, could be widely used not only through basic experiments and clinical studies but also through social implementation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41440-023-01317-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4378902463", "source": "openalex"}

The high operating costs of established systems with a sufficient limit of detection, mainly based on superconducting quantum interference devices, prevent the spread of magnetic diagnostic procedures. Consequently, the demand for alternative low-cost magnetic sensor systems is large. Several suitable, uncooled sensor concepts exist, but their usability-especially, when operated outside magnetically shielded chambers-requires improvement. This paper highlights basic, real-time signal processing concepts, and implementations to improve the signal quality for different biomedical applications with a focus on cardiology in unshielded measurement environments. Several processing steps in the digital domain are described, such as noise reduction (by means of cancellation and suppression), adaptive sensor signal combination, and adaptive signal averaging. Finally, basic cardiologic feature extraction methods are performed using uncooled magnetometers in combination with the described signal enhancement stages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/jsen.2019.2893236", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2911190803", "source": "openalex"}

This phenomenon usually occurs during the peripartum period. SCAD associated with exercise and heavy weight lifting is even rarer and has been reported in less than 10 cases in the literature. We describe a case of SCAD associated with heavy weight lifting and exercise in a 29‐year‐old male who presented with exertional chest pain. The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization that showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a dissection in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery after the first diagonal/septal branch with extension to the distal LAD that wrapped around the apex. He was effectively managed with the combination of medical therapy followed by a few days later with stenting. In summary, diagnosis and treatment of this rare phenomenon is a challenge, but early diagnosis and appropriate management can lead to a successful outcome. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.22904", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2041162142", "source": "openalex"}

Fye sees the discipline of cardiology as achieving definition during the period 1900 to 1920. He categorizes the physicians driving this development as physiologists, practitioners, academics, and public health enthusiasts. The introduction of the electrocardiograph stands out as a dominant factor in defining and promoting the new specialty. The first electrocardiograph in the United States was installed at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1909. By 1925, 450 Cambridge instruments were in place in the country, more than one third in physicians' offices.

Methods and results Analyses were based on the cross-sectional ESC (European Society of Cardiology) EORP (EurObservational Research Programme) EUROASPIRE V (European Survey of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Diabetes) survey including data on CHD patients across 27 European countries. Men and women between 18 and 80 years old, hospitalized for a first or recurrent coronary event were included in the study. Data were available for 8261 patients of which 25.8% women. Overall, women had a worse risk factor control compared with men. Whereas women were more likely to be non-smokers (79.3% vs. 87.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001), they were less likely to reach recommended levels of physical activity (36.8% vs. 27.5%; P &amp;lt; 0.001), and they were less likely to be non-obese (65.1% vs. 54.3%; P &amp;lt; 0.001). There is indication that risk factors such as smoking behaviour and obesity differed depending on country income level. No gender differences could be observed in blood pressure on target (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Moreover, a lower proportion of women reached low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels (31.4% vs. 22.1%; P &amp;lt; 0.001), and they were less likely to reach glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) targets if having self-reported diabetes (56.7% vs. 48.6%; P &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion The risk factor control of CHD women is substantial worse compared with men despite little gender differences in cardiovascular medication intake. Further actions are needed to increase the awareness of the worse risk factor control in female CHD patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaa144", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3124792135", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this article is to report on the experience with the development and implementation of an electronic stethoscope and a virtual library of cardiac sounds. There were four stages to this project: (1) the building of the prototype to acquire, filter and amplify the cardiac sounds, (2) the development of a software program to record, reproduce and visualize them, (3) the testing of the prototype in a clinical scenario, and (4) the development of an internet site, to store and display the sounds collected. The first two stages are now complete. The prototype underwent an initial evaluation in a clinical scenario within the Unit and during virtual out-patient clinical sessions. One hundred auscultations were recorded during these tests. They were reviewed and discussed on-line by a panel of experience cardiologists during the sessions. Although the sounds were considered \"satisfactory\" for diagnostic purposes by the cardiology team, they identified some qualitative differences in the electronic recorded auscultations, such as a higher pitch of the recorded sounds. Prospective clinical studies are now being conducted to further evaluate the interference of the electronic device in the physicians' capability to diagnose different cardiac conditions. An internet site (www.caduceusvirtual.com.br/ auscultaped) was developed to host these cardiac auscultations. It is set as a library of cardiac sounds, catalogued by pathologies and already contains examples from auscultations of the majority of common congenital heart lesions, such as septal defects and valvar lesions.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W127842464", "source": "openalex"}

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2016.2535302", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2346062110", "source": "openalex"}

Recording and processing techniques for assessment of electrical activity during AF essential for diagnosis and guiding ablative therapy including body surface electrocardiograms (ECG) and endo- or epicardial electrograms (EGM) are evaluated. Discussion of (i) differences in uni-, bi-, and multi-polar (omnipolar/Laplacian) recording modes, (ii) impact of recording technologies on EGM morphology, (iii) global or local mapping using various types of EGM involving signal processing techniques including isochronal-, voltage- fractionation-, dipole density-, and rotor mapping, enabling derivation of parameters like atrial rate, entropy, conduction velocity/direction, (iv) value of epicardial and optical mapping, (v) AF detection by cardiac implantable electronic devices containing various detection algorithms applicable to stored EGMs, (vi) contribution of machine learning (ML) to further improvement of signals processing technologies. Recording and processing of EGM (or ECG) are the cornerstones of (body surface) mapping of AF. Currently available AF recording and processing technologies are mainly restricted to specific applications or have technological limitations. Improvements in AF mapping by obtaining highest fidelity source signals (e.g. catheter-electrode combinations) for signal processing (e.g. filtering, digitization, and noise elimination) is of utmost importance. Novel acquisition instruments (multi-polar catheters combined with improved physical modelling and ML techniques) will enable enhanced and automated interpretation of EGM recordings in the near future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab254", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200003425", "source": "openalex"}

Those are the Hirsch index (h-index) based on all papers, the h-index based on first authored papers, the number of papers, the number of citations and the citations per paper. A top 10 for each of the five parameters was compiled. In theory, the same 10 professors might appear in each of these top 10s. Alternatively, each of the 37 professors under assessment could appear one or more times. In practice, we found 22 out of these 37 professors in the 5 top 10s. Thus, there is no golden parameter. In addition, there is too much inhomogeneity in citation characteristics even within a relatively homogeneous group of clinical cardiologists. Therefore, citation analysis should be applied with great care in science policy. This is even more important when different fields of medicine are compared in university medical centres. It may be possible to develop better parameters in the future, but the present ones are simply not good enough. Also, we observed a quite remarkable explosion of publications per author which can, paradoxical as it may sound, probably not be interpreted as an increase in productivity of scientists, but as the effect of an increase in the number of co-authors and the strategic effect of networks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-011-0128-y", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2113782152", "source": "openalex"}

The currently available methods can provide useful data on estimates of ventricular function and detection of myocardial ischemia for adequate patient management. Two standard procedures are routinely used: (1) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, eg, with thallium 201; and (2) radionuclide angiocardiography by using technetium 99m-labeled red blood cells. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy provides information on regional viability and estimates regional myocardial perfusion by measuring regional tracer activity. Thallium 201 is the agent used for noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion and for improving the results of exercise electrocardiography. Alternative tests, such as pharmacologic stress testing with dipyridamole, have been proposed as a reliable substitute for exercise testing. Additional quantitative analysis and computed tomography have increased the sensi tivity and specificity of thallium scintigraphy. Radionuclide angiography techniques are used for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiac function, right and left ventricular function, and wall motion abnormalities. As in perfusion scintigraphy, radionuclide angiography has proven its value for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). Abnormal regional wall motion abnormalities are specific for CAD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/000331979504600706", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084572137", "source": "openalex"}

The American Heart Association recognizes mobile health technologies (mHealth) as an emerging strategy in the mitigation of CVD risk factors, with significant potential for improving population health. The purpose of this review is to highlight and summarize the latest available literature on mHealth applications and provide perspective on future directions and barriers to implementation. Recent findings While available randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews tend to support efficacy of mHealth, published literature includes heterogenous approaches to similar problems with inconsistent results. Some of the strongest recent evidence has been focused on the use of wearables in arrhythmia detection. Systematic reviews of mHealth approaches demonstrate benefit when applied to risk factor modification in diabetes, cigarette smoking cessation, and physical activity/weight loss, while also showing promise in multi risk factor modification via cardiac rehabilitation. Summary Evidence supports efficacy of mHealth in a variety of applications for CVD prevention and management, but continued work is needed for further validation and scaling. Future directions will focus on platform optimization, data and sensor consolidation, and clinical workflow integration. Barriers include application heterogeneity, lack of reimbursement structures, and inequitable access to technology. Policies to promote access to technology will be critical to evidence-based mHealth technologies reaching diverse populations and advancing health equity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000891", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3180606000", "source": "openalex"}

Cytochrome P2C19 enzymes play a major role in its metabolism, which determines its varied therapeutic level and its effectiveness. Objectives: To customize clopidogrel therapy and evaluate its efficacy by using CYP2C19 genotypic and phenotypic information to improve clinical outcomes in patients. Methods: A total of 465 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease were selected from our out-patient cardiology clinic. DNA sequences of CYP2C19 were analyzed in 465 patients. Results: Of 465 patients, 183 were wild-type homozygous (*1/*1) and 18.8% gain-of function and 19.8% loss-of-function alleles in our patient population The following changes were made: 1) Switching to prasugrel in patients whose genotype noted them to be \"Slow metabolizers. This medication adjustment improved clinical outcomes in this patient group. 2) Discontinuing or lowering clopidogrel doses in patients whose genotypes noted them to be \"Fast or ultra-fast metabolizes\" to decrease bleeding risk. For those who were not on clopidogrel but carried abnormal allele(s), \"clopidogrel caution\" was documented. These individuals were followed up for 3 years and there has not been any cardiac clinical symptoms, cardiac death or excessive bleeding reported. Conclusions: Given the varied effectiveness of clopidogrel due to its metabolism by CYP2C19 enzyme, and the relatively high frequency of both gain-of-function (18.8%) and loss-of-function (19.8%) alleles in our patient population, we believe that genotyping CYP2C19 is clinically important in order to improve patient outcomes and minimize patient risk.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2017.1347475", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2735960192", "source": "openalex"}

Adults with at least 1 primary care encounter in the previous 2 years (July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015) were included in the study. Those with current hypertension were identified using a validated definition consisting of diagnoses, billing codes, and/or antihypertensive medication from within the primary care electronic medical record. Data analysis was conducted from December 2017 to July 2018. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Proportion of individuals with a diagnosis of hypertension, prescribed antihypertensive medication, and meeting treatment BP targets. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 594 492 Canadian participants included in the study, 144 348 (24.2%) had hypertension (45.6% male; mean [SD] age, 65.5 [14.5] years).

Individuals who were not previously considered to have hypertension but were reclassified as having elevated BP using the lower cutoff of 130/80 mm Hg or greater tended to be younger and were at lower cardiovascular risk. There was a shift toward more individuals requiring antihypertensive treatment, particularly in the lower-risk categories. The crude prevalence of hypertension increased from 13.3% to 32.0% in those aged 18 to 64 years, and of those aged 65 years and older, 16.6% more individuals were reclassified as having hypertension (from 55.2% to 71.8%). Only 12.3% of those who were considered at high risk were reclassified as hypertensive. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Adoption of the ACC/AHA BP guidelines would result in a near doubling in the prevalence of hypertension in Canada.

Cardiology referrals were chosen for this study due to higher rates of premature death and emergency admissions resulting from coronary heart disease for patients living in more deprived areas. Aim To find out how socioeconomic deprivation influences GP referral practice. Design and setting A qualitative study of GPs working in affluent and deprived areas of one large city in the UK. Method The authors used purposive and snowball sampling to recruit 17 GP participants to interviews and a focus group. Participants were asked to reflect on their own experience of making referrals. The authors used a framework approach to the analysis, with differences in themes for GPs working in least and most deprived areas being highlighted. Results The authors identified four main themes by which socioeconomic deprivation influenced GP referral practice: identifying problems; making decisions about referral; navigating the healthcare system; and external pressures. Using a published framework of consultation complexity, the authors then examined the data in relation to a fifth theme of complexity. Referrals from areas of high socioeconomic deprivation involved greater complexity in the majority of the domains of this framework.

However, there have been no studies in the UK looking at the effect of COVID-19 work pattern on the provision of cardiology services. We aim to assess the impact of the pandemic on the cardiology services and clinical activity. Methods We analysed key performance indicators in cardiology services in a single centre in the UK in the intervals prior and during the lockdown to assess for reduction or changes to service provisions. Results There has been more than 50% drop in patients presenting to cardiology and those diagnosed with myocardial infarction. All cardiology service provisions sustained significant reductions which included outpatient clinics, investigations, procedures and cardiology community services such as heart failure and cardiac rehabilitation. Conclusion As ischaemic heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death nationally and globally, cardiology services need to prepare for a significant increase in workload in the recovery phase and develop new pathways to urgently help those adversely affected by the changes in service provisions. Key Questions What is already known about this subject? COVID-19 affected the way healthcare is delivered through restructuring and prioritisation of resources. It is therefore expected that COVID-19 work pattern will have an impact on the delivery of medical and surgical services. Quantifying this effect is necessary to plan on how to deal with COVID-19 sequelae in the recovery phase. What does this study add? As ischaemic heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the world, assessing the direct and indirect effect of COVID-19 on cardiology through COVID-19 related cardiac diseases and through the restriction of cardiology provisions is necessary to plan our services in the post COVID-19 era. How might this impact on clinical practice? The impact of COVID-19 will be felt beyond the direct effect of COVID-19 related cardiac diseases. The provisions of cardiac services were severely restricted due to a shift in the focus in dealing with the surge of patients with COVID-19 and patients’ reluctance to seek medical help during the lockdown period. There was therefore a reduction across all cardiology performance indicators from referrals to investigations, diagnoses and management of cardiology patients. It is therefore expected that there will be another surge of patients seeking cardiology care and that services need to plan to treat these patients early and urgently to prevent any long term complications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.20126458", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3034808269", "source": "openalex"}

HF often has an unpredictable illness trajectory and is a chronic terminal illness with a poor prognosis. Patients living with advanced HF have difficulty in accessing palliative care (PC) supports, which can result in unnecessary suffering as their HF progresses and they near end of life (EOL). This is, in part, due to a lack of research, helping clinicians to identify patients who are approaching EOL. In addition, the unpredictable nature of illness progression often precludes access to most EOL resources in our current prognosis-dependent healthcare system. PC teams focus on optimizing quality of life through symptom management and ensure that care plans are congruent with patient and family preferences. A PC team was embedded into our institution's existing HF team. Findings show that integration of an embedded model of PC delivery for patients living with advanced HF led to overwhelming positive patient and family feedback while providing timely advance care planning discussions that may be associated with beneficial patient, family, and system outcomes. These outcomes can be used to inform public policy and speak to a cost-effective patient and family-centered approach for providing care to individuals and families living with advanced HF.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2016.0317", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2611254259", "source": "openalex"}

These devices can conformally laminate on the epidermis to mitigate motion artifacts and mismatches in mechanical properties created by conventional, rigid electronics while simultaneously providing accurate, non-invasive, long-term, and continuous health monitoring. Recent progress in the design and fabrication of soft sensors with more advanced capabilities and enhanced reliability suggest an impending translation of these devices from the research lab to clinical environments. Regarding these advances, the first part of this manuscript reviews materials, design strategies, and powering systems used in soft electronics. Next, the paper provides an overview of applications of these devices in cardiology, dermatology, electrophysiology, and sweat diagnostics, with an emphasis on how these systems may replace conventional clinical tools. The review concludes with an outlook on current challenges and opportunities for future research directions in wearable health monitoring.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b04898", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2755528635", "source": "openalex"}

It is a powerful process to extract knowledge and discover new patterns embedded in large data sets. Data mining has been increasingly used in medicine, particularly in cardiology. In fact, data mining applications can greatly benefits all parts involved in cardiology such as patients, cardiologists and nurses. This article aims to perform a systematic mapping study so as to analyze and synthesize empirical studies on the application of data mining techniques in cardiology. A total of 142 articles published between 2000 and 2015 were therefore selected, studied and analyzed according to the four following criteria: year and channel of publication, research type, medical task and empirical type.

This paper reviews the current status of training and evolving developments in medical education pertinent to congenital cardiology. The adoption of competency-based medical education has been lauded as a robust framework for contemporary medical education over the last two decades. However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution, but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges. Consequently, this pivot towards a more structured approach to medical education necessitates the widespread availability of appropriately trained medical educationalists, a development that will better inform curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment. Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as \"technology enhanced learning\" may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries. Each of these initiatives will require resources, widespread advocacy and raised awareness, and publication of supporting data, and so it is especially gratifying that Cardiology in the Young has fostered a progressive approach, agreeing to publish one or two articles in each journal issue in this domain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951121001645", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3156508132", "source": "openalex"}

The program includes an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with nine standardized patient (SP) stations. The SPs are trained to use checklists to assess the examinees' clinical skills, and to enter the checklist data directly into computers located within each of the examining rooms. Checklists cover the participants' knowledge of cardiology, and their interviewing, physical-examination, and counseling skills. The computer immediately generates detailed individual reports, which include a skills report, reflecting performance of core skills across all nine stations with group means for comparison, and an omissions report, listing items missed in each case for each participant and, again, comparing the results with group means. Participants review and discuss their performances and then discuss identified learning issues with a cardiologist. The cardiologist also reviews state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment for the cases presented in the OSCE. Participants have reported having a high regard for the program and have indicated that the program has left them better prepared to deal with clinical cardiology issues.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-199608000-00017", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064483583", "source": "openalex"}

We abstracted data on cardiovascular risk factors, and examined whether doctors documented a diagnosis of MetS and its components.Of 511 participants who satisfied our inclusion criteria, the MetS was present in 246 participants (48%). The proportions with which a doctor correctly documented diagnoses were: MetS 9.3% (23/246), obesity 60% (119/197), elevated blood pressure 74% (305/412), elevated fasting glucose 17% (49/291), reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol 10% (18/190) and elevated triglycerides 20% (32/164). This pattern of diagnoses, less frequent with dyslipidaemia and elevated fasting glucose compared with the rest, was persistently observed regardless of sex, age, and presence or absence of MetS. Those diagnosed were more likely to receive a recommendation of weight loss or increase in physical activity than those undiagnosed: 91% (21/23) versus 37% (82/223) for weight loss, and 83% (19/23) versus 26% (58/223) for increase in physical activity (P < 0.001 for both).Our data indicate that MetS and its components are commonly underdiagnosed in cardiology outpatient setting.

This study estimated the life-years-gained by CHD treatments and by changes in cardiovascular risk factor levels.A previously validated Irish IMPACT CHD mortality model was used to integrate large amounts of data on (i) patient numbers, (ii) treatment uptake, (iii) risk factor trends, (iv) effectiveness of cardiology treatments and risk factor reductions, and (v) median survival in patients with and without CHD, all stratified by age and sex. Results were tested in rigorous sensitivity analyses.There were 3763 fewer CHD deaths than expected in 2000 compared with the base year, 1985. This resulted in approximately 44,060 life-years-gained among people aged 25-84. Specific medical and surgical treatments given in 2000 for CHD patients together gained approximately 14,505 life-years. Population changes in cholesterol and smoking levels accounted for some 32,705 life-years-gained, 66% from reductions in cholesterol alone. Adverse changes in obesity and diabetes resulted in a loss of approximately 3670 life-years.Use of modern cardiology treatments in Ireland from 1985 to 2000 gained many thousands of life-years. However, twice as many life-years were generated by relatively modest reductions in major risk factors. Effective policies, such as the promotion of healthy diets, and weight reduction, together with the recent nationwide workplace smoking ban, will be essential to maintain and further enhance health gain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckl090", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2054027405", "source": "openalex"}

Clinical visits have only been facilitated for emergency purposes. Fewer patients have been admitted to the hospital for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) and a profound decrease in heart failure services has been reported. A similar reduction in the patient presentation is seen for ischemic heart disease, decompensated heart failure, and endocarditis. Cardiovascular services, including catheterization, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), cardiac investigations such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), exercise tolerance test (ETT), dobutamine stress test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) have been reported to have declined and performed on a priority basis. The long-term implications of this decline have been discussed with major concerns of severe cardiac complications and vulnerabilities in cardiac patients. The pandemic has also had psychological impacts on patients causing them to avoid seeking medical help. This review discusses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of various cardiology services and aims to provide strategies to restore cardiovascular services including structural changes in the hospital to make up for the reduced staff personnel, the use of personal protective equipment in healthcare workers, and provides alternatives for high-risk cardiac imaging, cardiac interventions, and procedures.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive, individualized, and patient-tailored programme, comprising multidisciplinary interventions. Despite its clinical benefits, cost-effectiveness, and existing guidelines, CR uptake in Europe remains suboptimal and detailed information on its current state is lacking. This centralized pan-European study (Overview of Cardiac Rehabilitation-OCRE) aimed to characterize and advance the knowledge about European Society of Cardiology (ESC) affiliated national CR settings.An online survey about provision and quality indicators from CR was sent to the network of National CVD Prevention Coordinators of ESC member states, whose answers were supported by published evidence and/or national experts. The OCRE study had a high participation rate (82%). Current positive aspects of CR include low dropout rates and short average start time after myocardial infarction, as well as public funding being standard practice. However, the uptake rate and average duration of CR are still suboptimal, and several countries lack CR mandatory rotation in Cardiology training, guidance documents, national accreditation, and electronic database registries. We also found several barriers to CR guideline implementation, at patient, staff, and healthcare levels.This study provides a comprehensive characterization of CR in Europe, generating important insight on the current provision and quality of CR in Europe, highlighting its sucesses and shortcomings, and discussing important strategies to overcome current obstacles.Since cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, this work sought to characterize the current state of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), an important therapeutic tool comprising multidisciplinary interventions to manage cardiovascular risk, in Europe. Current positive aspects of CR in Europe include low dropout rates and short average start time after myocardial infarction, as well as public funding being standard practice. Suboptimal aspects of CR in Europe include low uptake rates and short average duration, a lack of CR mandatory rotation in cardiology training, guidance documents, lack of national accreditation, and electronic database registries. Although provision of CR is at an encouraging level in Europe, it often is of suboptimal quality, signalling the need for improvement in the allocation of human and monetary resources.

Initial heart failure guidelines were published by American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) in 1995, and revised guidelines followed in 2001. Subsequently, there were another two update guidelines for diagnosis and management of heart failure published by ACC/AHA in 2005 and 2009 respectively. In Europe, initial guidelines for the diagnosis of heart failure were announced in 1995. Guidelines for the treatment of heart failure were published in 1997. From then on, several European Society of Cardiology (ESC) update guidelines have been published including guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure in 2001, guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute heart failure in 2005, the ESC guidelines for cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in 2007, the ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure in 2008, and the focused update of ESC guidelines on device therapy in heart failure in 2010. Later on, both Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) launched their guidelines for heart failure in 2010 and 2011, respectively. This paper from the Heart Failure Committee of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology is to provide an updated guideline based on the above guidelines as well as Taiwanese domestic statistics and researches on the diagnosis and management of heart failure.

Reports from the pre-hospital phase from emergency medical services (EMS) in Krakow were also analysed. Long-term follow-up data were collected by retrieving records from other hospitals (for patients transferred after UCA/PCI) and by phone calls to patients or their relatives.In 2000-2011, 405 OHCA patients were admitted for UCA/PCI. Most (78%) had ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) as the primary mechanism of cardiac arrest (asystole: 13%, pulseless electrical activity: 3%, unknown: 6%). The mean patient age was 61 (range 20-85) years, and 81% were males. On admission, about 70% of patients were unconscious and 11% were in cardiogenic shock. The mean resuscitation time (time to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC]) was 26.7 (range 1-126) min. ST-T changes seen in an electrocardiogram recorded after ROSC included ST elevation and depression in 52% of cases, only ST depression in 21% of cases, only ST elevation in 17% of cases, unspecific changes (due to intraventricular conduction disturbances) in 7% of cases, negative T waves in 3% of cases, and no changes in 0.5% of cases. Coronary angiography revealed acute coronary occlusion in 48% of cases, critical coronary stenosis (> 90%) in 26% of cases, other significant coronary lesions (> 50% stenosis) in 15% of cases, and non-significant lesions in 11% of cases. An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was diagnosed in 82% of patients (75% STEMI, 25% NSTEMI), and other cardiac cause (mostly ischaemic cardiomyopathy) was identified in 13% of patients. Among OHCA patients diagnosed with ACS, PCI was performed in 90% and additional 4% underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Overall success rate of PCI, defined as TIMI 3 flow plus residual stenosis < 50% and resolution of ST elevation after PCI by > 30%, was 70%. Survival to hospital discharge in the entire group of OHCA patients was 63% and 30-day survival with good neurological outcomes (defined as Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) was 49%. Among patients who were initially unconscious, those figures were 52% and 33%, respectively. During long-term follow-up (up to 12 years), 49% of patients were alive and 42% had good neurological function (87% of those who survived). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival with good neurological outcomes were preserved consciousness on admission, absence of shock, cardiac arrest witnessed by medical personnel, VF/VT as a primary mechanism of cardiac arrest, and preserved renal function. Successful PCI predicted survival until hospital discharge only when the neurological status of the patients was not taken into account.The most important cause of OHCA is coronary artery disease, in particular ACS. UCA and PCI seem to be important elements of appropriate post-resuscitation care because such treatment could improve survival but it is still unclear whether PCI might influence neurological outcomes as well.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5603/kp.a2014.0088", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2253575987", "source": "openalex"}

Balloons, stents, and debulking devices have been the mainstay tools of the interventionalist. However, as engineering skills have developed and clinical techniques have improved, new clinical avenues for the interventionalist beyond the coronary vessels are starting to evolve. One of the most opportunistic areas in cardiology for the interventionalist is the left atrium where treatment of clinically important issues such as mitral regurgitation, left atrial thrombus, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, and atrial septal defect may be approached. Additionally, the left atrium is a source of important hemodynamic information that can be captured with new implantable devices. While in the past the trans-septal puncture has been infrequently used, the future may hold this technique as one of the most common.

The total diabetic population is expected to increase from 415 million in 2015 to 642 million by 2040. Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). About two-thirds of patients with type 2 diabetes died of ASCVD. The association between hyperglycemia and elevated cardiovascular (CV) risk has been demonstrated in multiple cohort studies. However, clinical trials of intensive glucose reduction by conventional antidiabetic agents did not significantly reduce macrovascular outcomes.In December 2008, U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a mandate that every new antidiabetic agent requires rigorous assessments of its CV safety. Thereafter, more than 200,000 patients have been enrolled in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These trials were initially designed to prove noninferiority. It turned out that some of these trials demonstrated superiority of some new antidiabetic agents versus placebo in reducing CV endpoints, including macrovascular events, renal events, and heart failure. These results are important in clinical practice and also provide an opportunity for academic society to formulate treatment guidelines or consensus to provide specific recommendations for glucose control in various CV diseases.In 2018, the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC) and the Diabetes Association of Republic of China (DAROC) published the first joint consensus on the \"Pharmacological Management of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases.\" In 2020, TSOC appointed a new consensus group to revise the previous version. The updated 2020 consensus was comprised of 5 major parts: (1) treatment of diabetes in patients with multiple risk factors, (2) treatment of diabetes in patients with coronary heart disease, (3) treatment of diabetes in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, (4) treatment of diabetes in patients with a history of stroke, and (5) treatment of diabetes in patients with heart failure. The members of the consensus group thoroughly reviewed all the evidence, mainly RCTs, and also included meta-analyses and real-world evidence. The treatment targets of HbA1c were finalized. The antidiabetic agents were ranked according to their clinical evidence. The consensus is not mandatory. The final decision may need to be individualized and based on clinicians' discretion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000359", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3034908645", "source": "openalex"}

The Million Hearts Initiative is an effort by the Centers for Disease Control that aims to prevent 1 million myocardial infarctions and strokes over the next 5 years. As part of this initiative, we present a simply organized \"ABCDE\" approach for guiding a consistent comprehensive approach to managing cardiovascular risk in daily clinical practice. ABCDE stands for assessment of risk, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure management, cholesterol management, cigarette/tobacco cessation, diet and weight management, diabetes prevention and treatment, and exercise, interventions regularly used to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk.

Methods and results: From the Copenhagen General Population Study (2003-2015) 58 547 individuals aged 40-65 and free of ASCVD, diabetes, and statin use at baseline were included. Of these, 14% were definite statin eligible, 7% were not eligible and had triglycerides ≥3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL), and 79% were not statin eligible and had triglycerides <3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL). During 456 057 person-years of follow-up, 1770 individuals experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and 734 experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). The cumulative incidences of MACE at age 70 were 8.1% (95% confidence interval 7.3-8.9%) and 14.6% (12.6-16.8%) in statin non-eligible individuals with triglycerides <3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL) and ≥3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL), and 16.5% (14.0-19.3%) in statin eligible individuals. Corresponding cumulative incidences of MI were 3.0% (2.7-3.3%), 7.8% (6.4-9.5%), and 7.1% (5.9-8.4%), respectively. The estimated 10-year risks of MACE were 2.8% (2.6-3.0%) and 5.7% (4.9-6.6%) in statin non-eligible individuals with triglycerides <3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL) and ≥3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL), and 7.6% (6.9-8.3%) in statin eligible individuals; the median age in these three groups were 51, 51, and 60 years, respectively. Corresponding risks of MI were 1.0% (0.9-1.1%), 3.0% (2.4-3.7%), and 3.3% (2.8-3.7%), respectively. Conclusion: Statin non-eligible individuals with triglycerides ≥3.0 mmol/L (264 mg/dL) had risk of ASCVD similar to statin eligible individuals, defined according to the 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines. This illustrates an unmet need for primary prevention, calling for expansion of guidelines on statin eligibility, and the potential for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials in individuals with hypertriglyceridaemia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx659", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768478526", "source": "openalex"}

At that time it was apparent that important differences existed within Europe, and it was anticipated that such differences could become even more marked with time in the absence of manpower planning. In comparison with the first survey, this paper examines more extensively the status at thebeginning of the year 2000 and why manpower in cardiology might become of increasing importance in the near future. As in the first survey, the data were obtained by asking presidents and secretaries of the national scientific and professional organizations of the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Area (EU/EFTA), as well as a number of non-EU/EFTA member countries of the European Society of Cardiology and of the UEMS (European Union of Medical Specialists)—Cardiology Section, to answer a detailed questionnaire. Before publication, a summary of the information obtainedfor each country was sent to each respondent for approval, correction and/or completion. All organizations in the EU/EFTA countries replied. Among the non-EU/EFTA countries 9/11 (82%) replied. No information was received from Russia or Ukraine. Small countries such as Luxembourg were notincluded because of their very low number of cardiologists. The data were evaluated separately for the EU/EFTA countries and the associate member countries of the UEMS—Cardiology Section. These data were reviewed and completed if necessary by the national delegates of the UEMS—Cardiology Section. Although we obtained much more concise information than during our first survey, we recognize that for some countries the data are still incomplete.

This process of cascade screening of family members ensures adequate clinical surveillance of mutation carriers and allows non-carriers to be discharged from clinical follow-up. A number of studies have reported a greater cost-effectiveness combining molecular screening with clinical screening compared with isolated clinical investigations.3 Previously, genetic testing was based on conventional techniques like Sanger sequencing analysing genes one by one, but recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have made it possible to investigate large numbers of disease genes simultaneously, making mutation analysis much faster and cheaper. These new methods are known as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and represent a major advance in the ability to identify causative mutations in families affected by genetic diseases (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1 ).4,5 However, analysis of large numbers of genes may identify a number of sequence variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). As a result, cardiologists and clinical geneticists who counsel and manage families with inherited cardiovascular disorders are facing a major challenge in determining the clinical relevance of NGS results.6,7 This paper gives a brief overview of the principles of NGS, discusses the general strategies for the interpretation of sequencing results, and reviews the implications of NGS for cardio-genetic services.

In patients with known valve disease, most cases are caused by oral viridans streptococci. These organisms are present in vast numbers on the gum margins and in gum pockets. They cause transient bacteraemia during eating and tooth brushing. More substantial, but short-lived bacteraemia can occur during dental treatment such as extraction and scaling. Bacteria may then become attached to abnormal endocardium leading to the development of infective endocarditis. Prophylaxis of endocarditis during dental procedures in patients with known valve disease should thus be aimed at reducing the number of bacteria entering the blood stream and eliminating those that get there. This can be sought first by good oro-dental hygiene and secondly by the use of prophylactic antibiotics. In this paper, we set out simple guidelines for practitioners in those countries that do not already have recommendations of their own.

A survey of the perceptions and barriers to training", "text": "In the UK, there is a difference between the medical specialties and cardiology in recruitment of women. Research, thus far, has concentrated on women already in cardiology. Although invaluable in understanding barriers to training, these studies fail to provide insight into why other trainees chose an alternative. Therefore, we designed a survey aimed at medical personnel, evaluating why higher trainees in other specialties overlooked cardiology. An online survey was distributed via email to non-cardiology higher trainees in Wales. Questions covered previous clinical experiences of cardiology, interactions with cardiologists, and tried to identify deterrent factors. There were 227 responses received over six weeks: 61.7% (n=137) female respondents, 23.5% (n=52) less than full-time. Of these, 49% completed a cardiology placement previously. Bullying was witnessed and experienced equally among genders, females witnessed and experienced sexism, 24% (n=24) and 13% (n=13), respectively. In contrast, male trainees witnessed and experienced sexism 14% (n=7) and 0%. There were 62% (n=133) who felt cardiologists and registrars were unapproachable. Work-life balance ranked first (40%), as the most important factor influencing career choice. The negative attitudes of cardiologists and registrars was ranked top 3 for not pursuing cardiology. In conclusion, many barriers exist to cardiology training including poor worklife balance, sexism and lack of less than full-time opportunities. However, this survey highlights that the behaviour of cardiologists and registrars has the potential to impact negatively on trainees. It is, therefore, our responsibility to be aware of this and encourage change.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5837/bjc.2020.030", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210732178", "source": "openalex"}

We review here how these advances have altered our concepts of and clinical approaches to both the chronic and acute phases of CAD. Previously considered a cholesterol storage disease, we currently view atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disorder. The appreciation of arterial remodeling (compensatory enlargement) has expanded attention beyond stenoses evident by angiography to encompass the biology of nonstenotic plaques. Revascularization effectively relieves ischemia, but we now recognize the need to attend to nonobstructive lesions as well. Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors reduces cardiovascular events and should accompany appropriate revascularization. We now recognize that disruption of plaques that may not produce critical stenoses causes many acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The disrupted plaque represents a “solid-state” stimulus to thrombosis. Alterations in circulating prothrombotic or antifibrinolytic mediators in the “fluid phase” of the blood can also predispose toward ACS. Recent results have established the multiplicity of “high-risk” plaques and the widespread nature of inflammation in patients prone to develop ACS. These findings challenge our traditional view of coronary atherosclerosis as a segmental or localized disease. Thus, treatment of ACS should involve 2 overlapping phases: first, addressing the culprit lesion, and second, aiming at rapid “stabilization” of other plaques that may produce recurrent events. The concept of “interventional cardiology” must expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future events.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.105.537878", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2122450058", "source": "openalex"}

Objective: To compare the perspectives of PPC physicians and pediatric cardiologists regarding palliative care in pediatric heart disease. Design: Cross-sectional web-based surveys. Results: Responses from 183 pediatric cardiologists were compared to those of 49 PPC physicians (response rates 31% [183/589] and 28% [49/175], respectively). Forty-eight percent of PPC physicians and 63% of pediatric cardiologists agreed that availability of PPC is adequate (p = 0.028). The majority of both groups indicated that PPC consultation occurs “too late.” Compared with pediatric cardiologists, PPC physicians reported greater competence in all areas of advance care planning, communication, and symptom management. PPC physicians more often described obstacles to PPC consultation as “many” or “numerous” (42% vs. 7%, p < 0.001). PPC physicians overestimated how much pediatric cardiologists worry about PPC introducing inconsistency in approach (60% vs. 11%, p < 0.001), perceive lack of added value from PPC (30% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), believe that PPC involvement will undermine parental hope (65% vs. 44%, p = 0.003), and perceive that PPC is poorly accepted by parents (53% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: There are significant differences between pediatric cardiologists and PPC physicians in perception of palliative care involvement and perceived barriers to PPC consultation.

The parameters of the image quality evaluated were noise, signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SdNR), high contrast spatial resolution (HCSR) and three figures of merit combining entrance doses and signal-to-noise ratios or HCSR. The comparisons showed a better behaviour of the II-based system in the low contrast region over the whole interval of thicknesses. The FD-based system showed a better performance in HCSR. The FD system evaluated would need around two times more dose than the II system evaluated to reach a given value of SdNR; moreover, a better spatial resolution was measured (and perceived in conventional monitors) for the system equipped with flat detectors. According to the results of this paper, the use of dynamic FD systems does not lead to an automatic reduction in ESAK or to an automatic improvement in image quality by comparison with II systems.

(ii) The ESC should support the harmonization of cardiology training, curriculum development, and professional dialogue and mentorship. (iii) ESC congresses are an essential forum to learn and discuss the latest developments in cardiovascular medicine. (iv) The ESC should create a unified, interactive educational platform for cardiology training and continued cardiovascular education combining Webinars, eLearning Courses, Clinical Cases, and other educational programmes, along with ESC Congress content, Practice Guidelines and the next ESC Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. (v) ESC-delivered online education should be integrated into National and regional cardiology training and CME programmes.These recommendations support the ESC to deliver excellent and comprehensive cardiovascular education for the next generation of specialists. Teamwork between international, national and local partners is essential to achieve this objective.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy058", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2789674995", "source": "openalex"}

To do this we investigated which imaging parameters/protocols are commonly used in IC in different hospitals, to identify if a standard technique is used and illustrate any variation in practice. A questionnaire was sent to all hospitals in the UK and Ireland which perform paediatric IC to obtain information on techniques used in each clinical department and on the range of clinical examinations performed. Ethical and research governance approval was sought from the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland and the individual trusts. A response rate of 79% was achieved, and a wide variation in technique was found between hospitals. The main differences in technique involved variations in the use of an anti-scatter grid and the use of additional filtration to the radiation beam, frame rates for digital acquisition and pre-programmed projections/paediatric specific programming in the equipment. We conclude that there is no standard protocol for carrying out paediatric IC in the UK or Ireland.

Concomitant activation of both the Gq and Gi pathways by ADP is necessary to elicit normal ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Activation of the Gq pathway through P2Y1 leads to platelet shape change and rapidly reversible aggregation, whereas the activation of the Gi pathway through P2Y12 elicits a slow progressive and sustained platelet aggregation not preceded by shape change. In addition to its role in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, P2Y12 mediates the potentiation of platelet secretion induced by strong agonists and the stabilization of thrombin-induced platelet aggregates.1 P2Y12 has a more selective tissue distribution than P2Y1, making it an attractive molecular target for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, P2Y12 is the target of efficacious antithrombotic agents like ticlopidine and clopidogrel, which are already used in clinical practice either alone or in combination with other antithrombotic drugs.2 Ticlopidine and clopidogrel are structurally related compounds, belonging to the thienopyridine family of ADP receptor antagonists; they are pro-drugs that are inactive in vitro and need to be metabolized in vivo by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 1A enzymatic pathway to active metabolites, which have very short half-lives. They irreversibly and specifically inhibit the function of the platelet P2Y12 receptor, reproducing the platelet function abnormalities that are observed in patients who are congenitally deficient in P2Y12 and … *Corresponding author.

Most studies on ECG classification methods have targeted only 1- or 2-lead ECG signals. This limitation results from the unavailability of real clinical 12-lead ECG data, which would help train the classification models. In this study, we propose a new tensor-based scheme, which is motivated by the lack of effective feature extraction methods for direct tensor data input. In this scheme, an ECG signal is represented by third-order tensors in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain after using short-time Fourier transform on the raw ECG data. To overcome the limitations of tensor rank one discriminant analysis (TR1DA) inherited from linear discriminant analysis, we introduced a generalized tensor rank one discriminant analysis (GTR1DA). This approach involves considering the distribution of the data points near the classification boundary to calculate better projection tensors. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves greater classification accuracy than other vector- and tensor-based methods. Finally, GTR1DA features a better convergence property than the original TR1DA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2014-2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2097730779", "source": "openalex"}

We sought to identify the determinants of length of stay and heart failure rehospitalization or death during a 12-month follow-up period. This was a retrospective cohort study including all patients admitted during 2010 with a primary or secondary diagnosis of acute heart failure. Death and readmission were followed through 2011. Of the 924 patients admitted, 201 (21%) had acute heart failure, 107 (53%) of whom had new-onset acute heart failure. The main precipitating factors were acute coronary syndrome (63%) and arrhythmia (14%). The most frequent clinical presentations were heart failure after acute coronary syndrome (63%), chronic decompensated heart failure (47%) and acute pulmonary edema (21%). On admission 73% had left ventricular ejection fraction <50%. Median length of stay was 11 days and in-hospital mortality was 5.5%. The rehospitalization rate was 21% and 24% at six and 12 months, respectively. All-cause mortality was 16% at 12 months. The independent predictors of rehospitalization or death were heart failure hospitalization during the previous year (Hazard ratio − HR − 3.177), serum sodium <135 mmol/l on admission (HR 1.995) and atrial fibrillation (HR 1.791). Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was associated with a lower risk of rehospitalization or death (HR 0.518). Our patients more often presented new-onset acute heart failure, due to an acute coronary syndrome, with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Several predictive factors of death or rehospitalization were identified that may help to select high-risk patients to be followed in a heart failure management program after discharge. Dada a escassa informação relativa aos internamentos por insuficiência cardíaca aguda em serviços de Cardiologia portugueses, procedemos à sua caracterização. Pretendemos identificar os determinantes de maior duração de internamento e de rehospitalização ou morte aos 12 meses. Realizámos um estudo de cohort retrospetivo, incluindo os doentes admitidos em 2010 com diagnóstico primário ou secundário de insuficiência cardíaca aguda. A ocorrência de morte ou rehospitalização foi acompanhada durante 2011. Do total de 924 hospitalizações, 201 (21%) apresentavam insuficiência cardíaca aguda, sendo o primeiro episódio em 107 (53%) das mesmas. Os principais fatores precipitantes foram síndrome coronária aguda (63%) e arritmia (14%). As apresentações clínicas mais comuns foram insuficiência cardíaca no contexto de síndrome coronária aguda (63%), insuficiência cardíaca crónica descompensada (46%) e edema pulmonar agudo (21%). Na admissão, 73% tinham fração de ejeção ventricular esquerda < 0,50. A duração mediana de internamento foi 11 dias e a mortalidade intra-hospitalar foi 5,5%. A taxa de rehospitalização aos 6 e 12 meses foi 21% e 24%, respetivamente. A mortalidade por todas as causas, aos 12 meses, foi 16%. Os factores preditores de rehospitalização ou morte foram hospitalização por insuficiência cardíaca aguda no ano anterior (Hazard ratio – HR – 3,177), sódio sérico < 135 mEq/L na admissão (HR 1,995), fibrilhação auricular (HR 1,791). Fracção de ejecção ventricular esquerda deprimida na admissão associou-se a menor risco de rehospitalização ou morte (HR 0,518). Os nossos doentes apresentavam mais frequentemente insuficiência cardíaca aguda de novo, com fração de ejeção ventricular esquerda deprimida, no contexto de síndrome coronária aguda.

Among these patients, there are an unknown number who can be shown to be suffering from cardiac pain presumed to be ischaemic. Most of these women complain of chest pain and disability for years, and the morbidity is considerable.1 New findings demonstrate that some of these patients may be at an increased risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac death.1 Advanced coronary atheroma can be present despite a normal or near-normal coronary lumen,2 and may provide a link between seemingly normal coronary arteries and increased risk of future cardiac events. Chest pain is the most common symptom of CAD prompting subjects to seek attention from physicians. Women are more likely to have non-specific chest pain symptoms than men, which may contribute to missed diagnoses of coronary heart disease and increased risk of acute events.3 Patients with atypical symptoms profile have approximately twice the delay before hospital admission, are less likely to receive therapy, and suffer higher mortality rates. Research on symptoms and their relationship with outcome has mainly focused on women with obstructive CAD.4 Johnson et al .5 look at women with non-obstructive CAD and demonstrate that different symptoms' profiles are associated with different long-term outcomes. The authors evaluated 412 patients without obstructive CAD. Two hundred and sixty-one women with significant CAD served as controls. Of these 412 patients … *Corresponding author.

Such a \"personalized medicine\" approach has been widely adopted in several medical fields, such as cancer medicine, but the implementation of precision medicine in cardiovascular medicine has not been similarly straightforward. Because pharmacogenomics plays an important role in the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular drug therapy, there has been a great interest in the use of tools aiming at personalizing antiplatelet therapy. Moreover, antiplatelet therapy is essential for the treatment of cardiovascular patients to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications, particularly those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, but it is inevitably associated with increased bleeding risk. In this review, the authors discuss the rationale, summarize the evidence and discuss the current and future directions for the personalization of antiplatelet treatment regimens in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2217/pgs-2022-0057", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4290633377", "source": "openalex"}

Prior research has emphasized the fact that medical experts rely on such perceptual pattern-recognition skills when interpreting medical images, particularly in the field of electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation. Analyzing and modeling cardiology practitioners' visual behavior across different levels of expertise in the health care sector is crucial. Namely, understanding such acquirable visual skills may help train less experienced clinicians to interpret ECGs accurately.This study aims to quantify and analyze through the use of eye-tracking technology differences in the visual behavior and methodological practices for different expertise levels of cardiology practitioners such as medical students, cardiology nurses, technicians, fellows, and consultants when interpreting several types of ECGs.A total of 63 participants with different levels of clinical expertise took part in an eye-tracking study that consisted of interpreting 10 ECGs with different cardiac abnormalities. A counterbalanced within-subjects design was used with one independent variable consisting of the expertise level of the cardiology practitioners and two dependent variables of eye-tracking metrics (fixations count and fixation revisitations). The eye movements data revealed by specific visual behaviors were analyzed according to the accuracy of interpretation and the frequency with which interpreters visited different parts/leads on a standard 12-lead ECG. In addition, the median and SD in the IQR for the fixations count and the mean and SD for the ECG lead revisitations were calculated.Accuracy of interpretation ranged between 98% among consultants, 87% among fellows, 70% among technicians, 63% among nurses, and finally 52% among medical students. The results of the eye fixations count, and eye fixation revisitations indicate that the less experienced cardiology practitioners need to interpret several ECG leads more carefully before making any decision. However, more experienced cardiology practitioners rely on their skills to recognize the visual signal patterns of different cardiac abnormalities, providing an accurate ECG interpretation.The results show that visual expertise for ECG interpretation is linked to the practitioner's role within the health care system and the number of years of practical experience interpreting ECGs. Cardiology practitioners focus on different ECG leads and different waveform abnormalities according to their role in the health care sector and their expertise levels.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2196/34058", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200433049", "source": "openalex"}

CM are classified according to their chemical structure, either ionic or non‐ionic (monomeric or dimeric). Numerous in vitro and in vivo data show that, although all CM have anti‐coagulant properties, ionic molecules are more potent than non‐ionic and, furthermore, do not activate resting platelets, unlike non‐ionic agents. These properties may lead to a decrease in thrombus formation during interventional procedures. Several clinical trials have shown that CM may play a role in the occurrence of acute thrombotic complications but also in delayed ischaemic events during interventional procedures. A recent meta‐analysis showed that, compared to non‐ionic monomers, ionic low‐osmolar CM reduce the rate of coronary artery abrupt closure, but no significant difference was found with respect to ischaemic complications. Ionic CM lead to a lower deposit of thrombotic materials on catheters and guide‐wires. To date, clinical data comparing ionic CM and non‐ionic dimers are scarce, significantly heterogeneous and, unlike experimental data, they do not show differences between both classes of CM. Further studies are required to better understand the precise mechanisms of such interactions and to analyse the effect of CM when new antiplatelet agents or new procedures (stenting) are used, to comply with new clinical strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-8206.1999.tb00372.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076751649", "source": "openalex"}

We estimated lost earnings (productivity losses) associated with premature mortality due to CVD, and separately for its main sub-categories of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, across 54 country members of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Methods and results We used a standardized approach to estimate working years and earnings lost due to premature death resulting from CVD across the 54 ESC member countries in 2018. Our population-based approach was based on national data on the number of deaths, employment rates, and earnings by age group and sex. We discounted future working years and earnings lost to present values using a 3.5% annual rate. In 2018, there were 4.4 million deaths due to CVD across the 54 countries, with 7.1 million working years lost. This represented productivity losses due to premature death of €62 billion in 2018. Deaths due to coronary heart disease accounted for 47% (€29 billion) of all CVD costs, and cerebrovascular disease accounted for 18% (€11 billion). Approximately 60% (€37 billion) of all productivity losses occurred in the 28 European Union member states, despite accounting for only 42% (1.8 million) of deaths and 21% (1.5 million) of working years lost across the 54 countries. Conclusion Our study provides a snapshot of the economic consequences posed by premature mortality due to CVD across 54 countries in 2018. The considerable variation across countries highlights the potential gains from policies targeting prevention and care of cardiovascular diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjqcco/qcad031", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4379600742", "source": "openalex"}

This has important implications for service provision within the National Health Service, and an accurate knowledge of the current level of MPS activity is necessary.A postal questionnaire was sent to 207 nuclear medicine departments in the UK, requesting information about nuclear cardiology facilities, activity, and practice. Non-responding departments were sent a second questionnaire, followed where necessary by a telephone call.A response rate of 61% was achieved; 52% of departments performed MPS, and these tended to have more gamma cameras than those which did not (median (25th-75th centile) 2.0, 1.5-2.5 v 1.0, 0.5-1.5; p = 0.02). The median number of studies performed was 256 (144-460). The estimated rate of MPS in the UK for the year 2000 was 1200 per million population. The median (25th-75th centile) waiting time for MPS was 16 (9-24) weeks. Pharmacological stress was used in 77% of studies, and a technetium-99m based radiopharmaceutical in 60% (two day protocol in 75%).

These challenges are exemplified and reinforced by the lack of consistency and consensus both in the literature and academic presentations. Through the presentation of a series of clinical questions, this debate attempts to ‘cut to the chase’ on cardiovascular issues relevant to the clinician dealing with elite athletes. In so doing, we hope to crystallize some of the most important elements of the complex cardiological management of elite athletes, in a concise, readable format. Frequently over the last 10 years, many of the controversies in this field have been (rightly or wrongly) presented in a Europe versus USA paradigm. We have chosen to test whether there really are polarised views across the Atlantic, by deliberately pitting specialists from the USA against those from the UK. Professors Levine and Thompson are both internationally recognised sports cardiologists, with immense academic and clinical credibility, and who will represent the ‘US approach’. Professor Whyte and Doctor Wilson are cardiac physiologists with a wealth of experience in the testing, evaluation and screening of elite athletes, and who have equally impressive academic credibility and for the purposes of this debate, they will be representing the ‘European approach’. To initiate this process, each team was required to provide a concise answer (circa 200–300 words) to a series of five clinical conundrums. Subsequently, each team had the opportunity to provide a rebuttal to the opposing team's answers, and the following reflects the consolidation of those answers. A popular debate in the literature and the conference podium is the clinical utility of the ECG in the preparticipation screening of athletes. If one assumes that the overall cost:benefit of cardiac screening for athletes remains to be determined, is it now established that the …", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2012-091311", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124221159", "source": "openalex"}

Ample evidence suggests that alterations in the control of arterial blood might negatively affect optic nerve function. However, evidence-based guidelines on the management of arterial blood pressure in glaucoma patients are lacking. Regrettably, intraocular pressure is generally not included as a secondary end-point in clinical trials on arterial hypertension.

However, the ability to be attentive in relational encounters can be challenging for healthcare staff for many reasons, such as time constraints and a high work pace. Research suggests that mindfulness training could increase staff attentiveness and compassion, but only few qualitative studies have explored the subject. The aim of the current study was to explore doctors’ and nurses’ individual experiences of how attending an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course (MBSR) influenced their clinical practice and encounters with colleagues and patients in a cardiology department. Method: Qualitative interviews were held with six doctors and nurses who had completed the 8-week MBSR course. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to explore and understand the meaning of the participants’ accounts. Findings: The MBSR course appeared to have changed the healthcare professionals’ thoughts and actions, especially regarding their ability to stay focused on the task at hand, to prioritise and to stay calm in an unpredictable and busy work environment. This was facilitated by using concrete techniques learned during the course, such as breathing and taking small breaks to clear their heads and help them be attentive in relation to themselves, colleagues and patients. Furthermore, they described an increased acceptance of their own limitations, better understanding of their colleagues and greater awareness of the unique patient. Conclusion: These findings suggest that changing healthcare professionals’ actions, mindset, awareness and understanding of others may result in a more compassionate work environment and more person-centred care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.12906", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3081042128", "source": "openalex"}

Such patients are considered at very high risk (VHR) based on a history of >1 major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event or a single ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions. We investigated the association of US guideline-defined risk categories with the occurrence of ischemic events after acute coronary syndrome and reduction of those events by alirocumab, a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor. Methods: In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab), patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and residual dyslipidemia despite optimal statin therapy were randomly assigned to alirocumab or placebo. The primary trial outcome (major adverse cardiovascular events, ie, coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina) was examined according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk category. Results: Of 18 924 participants followed for a median of 2.8 years, 11 935 (63.1%) were classified as VHR: 4450 (37.3%) had multiple prior ASCVD events and 7485 (62.7%) had 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions. Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 14.4% of placebo-treated patients at VHR versus 5.6% of those not at VHR. In the VHR category, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 20.4% with multiple prior ASCVD events versus 10.7% with 1 ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions. Alirocumab was associated with consistent relative risk reductions in both risk categories (hazard ratio=0.84 for VHR; hazard ratio=0.86 for not VHR; P interaction=0.820) and by stratification within the VHR group (hazard ratio=0.86 for multiple prior ASCVD events; hazard ratio=0.82 for 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions; P interaction=0.672). The absolute risk reduction for major adverse cardiovascular events with alirocumab was numerically greater (but not statistically different) in the VHR group versus those not at VHR (2.1% versus 0.8%; P interaction=0.095) and among patients at VHR with multiple prior ASCVD events versus a single prior ASCVD event (2.4% versus 1.8%; P interaction=0.661). Conclusions: The US guideline criteria identify patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and dyslipidemia who are at VHR for recurrent ischemic events and who may derive a larger absolute benefit from treatment with alirocumab.

This study derives radiation doses to the lens of the eye in cardiac catheterization laboratories from measurements of individual procedures to allow for estimates of such doses for those cases when personal dosimeters have not been used regularly. Using active electronic dosimeters at the C-arm (at 95 cm from the isocenter), scatter radiation doses have been measured for cardiac procedures and estimated radiation doses to the lenses of the cardiologists for different groups of procedures (diagnostic, PTCAs, and valvular). Correlation factors with kerma area product included in the patient dose reports have been derived.

We compared the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2004 Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations in HIV-infected adults and evaluated associations with carotid artery intima-media thickness and plaque. Methods and Results— Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured at baseline and 3 years later in 352 HIV-infected adults without clinical atherosclerotic CVD and not on statins. Plaque was defined as IMT &gt;1.5 mm in any segment. At baseline, the median age was 43 (interquartile range, 39–49), 85% were men, 74% were on antiretroviral medication, and 50% had plaque. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines were more likely to recommend statins compared with the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, both overall (26% versus 14%; P &lt;0.001), in those with plaque (32% versus 17%; P =0.0002), and in those without plaque (16% versus 7%; P =0.025). In multivariable analysis, older age, higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, pack per year of smoking, and history of opportunistic infection were associated with baseline plaque. Baseline IMT (hazard ratio, 1.18 per 10% increment; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.33; P =0.005) and plaque (hazard ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–4.08; P =0.037) were each associated with all-cause mortality, independent of traditional CVD risk factors. Conclusions— Although the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommended statins to a greater number of HIV-infected adults compared with the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, both failed to recommend therapy in the majority of HIV-affected adults with carotid plaque. Baseline carotid atherosclerosis but not atherosclerotic CVD risk scores was an independent predictor of mortality. HIV-specific guidelines that include detection of subclinical atherosclerosis may help to identify HIV-infected adults who are at increased atherosclerotic CVD risk and may be considered for statins.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circimaging.116.005995", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2763527516", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telemedicine use, which has had a positive impact with respect to providers, patients, and their caregivers. Recent data have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine through expediting needed care and reducing healthcare utilization, including unnecessary emergency department visits, transports, and hospitalizations. With increasing complexity of cardiac care, telecardiology allows for establishing a medical home, improving access, and continuity of care. Great potential also exists for telecardiology to permit more consistent preventive care, possibly resulting in improved health equity, reduced morbidity and mortality, and associated costs. Challenges to optimal implementation of telecardiology, which are all surmountable, include the currently unaccounted additional workload and administrative burden, licensing restrictions, disparities in access to care, insurance reimbursement, and potential fraud and abuse. Summary Telecardiology allows for efficient, quality, effective, collaborative care and is foundational to creating innovative, high-value care models. Through integration with accelerating technology and in-person visits, a sustainable hybrid model of optimal care can be achieved.

However, this downgrading may not be justified by available evidence because beta-blockers lower blood pressure as effectively as other major antihypertensive drugs and have solid documentation in preventing cardiovascular complications. Suspected inconveniences of beta-blockers such as increased risk of depression or erectile dysfunction may have been overemphasized, while patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or peripheral artery disease, that is, conditions in which their use was previously restricted, will benefit from beta-blocker therapy. Besides, evidence that from early to late phases, hypertension is accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system makes beta-blockers pathophysiologically an appropriate treatment in hypertension. Beta-blockers have favorable effects on a variety of clinical conditions that may coexist with hypertension, making their use either as specific treatment or as co-treatment potentially common in clinical practice. Guidelines typically limit recommendations on specific beta-blocker use to cardiac conditions including angina pectoris, postmyocardial infarction, or heart failure, with little or no mention of the additional cardiovascular or noncardiovascular conditions in which these drugs may be needed or preferred. In the present narrative review, we focus on multiple additional diseases and conditions that may occur and affect patients with hypertension, often more frequently than people without hypertension, and that may favor the choice of beta-blocker. Notwithstanding, beta-blockers represent an in-homogenous group of drugs and choosing beta-blockers with documented effect in prevention and treatment of disease is important for first choice in guidelines.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.122.19020", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4226270581", "source": "openalex"}

Timely diagnosis affects morbidity, mortality, and disability, and newborn pulse oximetry screening has been studied to enhance detection of CCHD. In this position statement we present an evaluation of the literature for pulse oximetry screening. Current detection strategies including prenatal ultrasound examination and newborn physical examination are limited by low diagnostic sensitivity. Pulse oximetry screening is safe, noninvasive, easy to perform, and widely available with a high specificity (99.9%) and moderately high sensitivity (76.5%). When an abnormal saturation is obtained, the likelihood of having CCHD is 5.5 times greater than when a normal result is obtained. The use of pulse oximetry combined with current strategies has shown sensitivities of up to 92% for detecting CCHD. False positive results can be minimized by screening after 24 hours, and testing the right hand and either foot might further increase sensitivity. Newborns with abnormal screening results should undergo a comprehensive assessment and echocardiography performed if a cardiac cause cannot be excluded. Screening has been studied to be cost neutral to cost effective. We recommend that pulse oximetry screening should be routinely performed in all healthy newborns to enhance the detection of CCHD in Canada.RésuméLa cardiopathie congénitale qui constitue la malformation congénitale la plus fréquente compte environ 3 nouveau-nés sur 1000 atteints d'une cardiopathie congénitale grave (CCG). Son diagnostic précoce influence la morbidité, la mortalité et l'incapacité. De ce fait, le dépistage par oxymétrie de pouls chez le nouveau-né a fait l'objet d'une étude afin d'améliorer la détection de la CCG. Dans le présent énoncé de position, nous présentons une évaluation de la littérature sur le dépistage par oxymétrie de pouls. Les stratégies de détection actuelles, dont l'examen prénatal par échographie et l'examen physique du nouveau-né, sont limitées par leur faible sensibilité diagnostique. Le dépistage par oxymétrie de pouls est sûr, non effractif, facile à réaliser et largement accessible, et montre une spécificité élevée (99,9 %) et une sensibilité modérément élevée (76,5 %). Lorsqu'une saturation anormale est obtenue, la probabilité de CCG est 5,5 fois plus élevée que lorsqu'un résultat normal est obtenu. Il a été démontré que la combinaison de l'utilisation de l'oxymétrie de pouls et des stratégies actuelles avait une sensibilité de détection de la CCG allant jusqu'à 92 %. Le dépistage après 24 heures peut minimiser les résultats faux positifs, et les mesures réalisées à la main droite et à un pied augmenteraient davantage la sensibilité. Les nouveau-nés montrant des résultats anormaux au dépistage devraient subir une évaluation exhaustive et une échographie si une origine cardiaque ne peut être exclue.

The nine most frequently occurring lesions are patency of the arterial duct (ductus arteriosus), atrial septal defect within the oval fossa, atrioventricular septal defect, ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, valvar pulmonary stenosis, valvar aortic stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, and complete transposition. Their natural history is presented and compared with representative results of surgical treatment. Surgery has markedly improved the outcome for all these lesions, although almost no patients have been followed postoperatively for more than 25 years. Because congenital heart lesions are likely to consume an increasing proportion of cardiological resources in future years, the long-term future in this field rests with prevention of these lesions if at all possible. Recent advances in molecular and developmental biology, some of which are discussed, will certainly aid in diagnosis and may well bring the time at which prevention can be achieved closer to reality.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951100011070", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2060496075", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this two-part series is to provide practical knowledge and guidance to aid clinicians in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in association with COVID-19. Methods and results: A narrative literature review of the available evidence has been performed, and the resulting information has been organized into two parts. The first, reported here, focuses on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of cardiovascular (CV) conditions that may be manifest in patients with COVID-19. The second part, which will follow in a later edition of the journal, addresses the topics of care pathways, treatment, and follow-up of CV conditions in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: This comprehensive review is not a formal guideline but rather a document that provides a summary of current knowledge and guidance to practicing clinicians managing patients with CVD and COVID-19. The recommendations are mainly the result of observations and personal experience from healthcare providers. Therefore, the information provided here may be subject to change with increasing knowledge, evidence from prospective studies, and changes in the pandemic.

Cardiological conditions such as myocardial infarction, ischemic injury and chronic cardiomyopathy result in permanent cardiac tissue damage followed by heart failure. Current therapies primarily aim to trigger the pathological remodeling that occurs after cardiac injury and also to reduce risk factors involved in cardiovascular diseases. Animal model studies over the last decade indicate that the systematic administration of autologous and allogeneic stem cells possesses therapeutic potential to improve overall cardiac functions. This evidence robustly indicates that cardiac tissue has the potential to undergo a systematic repair process. The past few years have also witnessed a splurge in clinical research that particularly aims to explore the regenerative properties of the naive stem cells to restore cardiac functions. The mechanisms involved in stem cell therapy remain unclear. The magnitude of benefit demonstrated in animal models is yet to be completely translated into humans. The future of cardiac research will require tangible synchrony between clinicians and basic scientists to unravel the precise mechanism of stem cell therapy. It is also pivotal to define an ideal cell type and a suitable cell delivery technique that provide maximum benefit, while eliminating the grey areas in translational cardiology research.

Indeed, Mensah and colleagues have shown that in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there has been a rise in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality since 1990, mainly due to population growth and an increase in the proportion of people older than 65 years.1 Despite the increasing prevalence of CVD in developing countries including SSA, many patients in these countries do not have access to treatment modalities like pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) that are associated with substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality due to CVD in industrialised nations. For example, in a 2009 global review of pacemaker implantation in 61 countries, there was a large gap between the developed and developing nations in the number of implants; for example, there were 782 implants per million people in France compared with four implants per million in Pakistan.2 Although the statistics on pacemaker implantation rates are not readily available in most SSA countries, cardiac pacemaker use remains dismally low at <10 implants per million population (with the exception of South Africa with 39 per million population, most for those with private health insurance).3 This disparity is believed to be due to the high cost of new cardiac devices. The price of the pacemaker generator without accessories is between US$2500 and US$3000, while that of the leads is US$800–1000.

The technical development of this ultrasound based diagnostic tool, as well as its clinical application in a large variety of important cardiovascular diseases, has been cultivated scientifically mainly by European cardiologists within the last 15 years. Miniaturised electronic phased array transducer technology incorporated in a gastroscope-like instrument formed the basis for the breakthrough of TOE in clinical cardiology.1 The wide clinical application of TOE in the past has without doubt significantly improved our diagnostic possibilities and contributed much to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of many diseases such as aortic dissection or cardiogenic stroke. Both factors influenced significantly the therapeutic management and led to a better outcome of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. This review will focus on the clinical application of TOE. There is general agreement that a TOE examination is indicated in all patients where conventional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) fails to provide conclusive diagnostic information (for example, emphysema) or where TTE is impossible (during surgery). Beyond that TOE is generally performed when it is expected to add important information to the data first obtained by TTE, because of the higher image resolution or the potential to acquire images of cardiac or vascular structures that usually are not accessible by the transthoracic approach.

There was no maternal mortality, heart failure occurred in 5 pregnancies (4.8%). Of the 104 women with preexisting IHD, 11 women suffered from acute coronary syndrome during pregnancy. ST‐segment‒elevation myocardial infarction were more common than non‒ST‐segment‒elevation myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis was the most common etiology. Women who had undergone revascularization before pregnancy did not have less events than women who had not. There were 13 women with pregnancy‐onset IHD, in whom non‒ST‐segment‒elevation myocardial infarction was the most common. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with acute coronary syndrome. Caesarean section was the primary mode of delivery (55.8% in preexisting IHD, 84.6% in pregnancy‐onset IHD) and there were high rates of preterm births (20.2% and 38.5%, respectively). Conclusions Women with IHD tolerate pregnancy relatively well, however there is a high rate of ischemic events and these women should therefore be considered moderate‐ to high‐risk. Ongoing cigarette smoking is associated with acute coronary syndrome during pregnancy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.015490", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3046091378", "source": "openalex"}

Whereas cognitive knowledge can be quantified, psychomotor skills are implied after repetitive task performance. We applied motion analyses to evaluate psychomotor skill acquisition during simulator-based TTE training. <b>Methods and Results:</b> During the first month of their fellowship training, 16 cardiology fellows underwent a multimodal TTE training program for 4 weeks (8 sessions). The program consisted of online and live didactics as well as simulator training. Kinematic metrics (path length, time, probe accelerations) were obtained at the start and end of the course for 8 standard TTE views using a simulator. At the end of the course TTE image acquisition skills were tested on human models. After completion of the training program the trainees reported improved self-perceived comfort with TTE imaging. There was also an increase of 8.7% in post-test knowledge scores. There was a reduction in the number of probe accelerations [median decrease 49.5, 95% CI = 29-73, adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.01], total time [median decrease 10.6 s, 95% CI = 6.6-15.5, adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.01] and path length [median decrease 8.8 cm, 95% CI = 2.2-17.7, adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.01] from the start to the end of the course.

In this review, we discuss how CMR can be used in athletes with suspected cardiomyopathy with particular reference to volumetric analysis and tissue characterization. We also discuss the finding of non-ischaemic fibrosis in athletes describing its prevalence, distribution and clinical importance. The strengths of CMR include high spatial resolution, unrestricted imaging planes and lack of ionizing radiation. Regular physical exercise leads to cardiac remodeling that in certain situations can be clinically challenging to differentiate from various cardiomyopathies. Thorough morphological assessment by CMR is fundamental to ensuring accurate diagnosis. Developments in tissue characterization by late gadolinium enhancement and T1 mapping have the potential to be powerful additional tools in this challenging clinical situation. Using late gadolinium enhancement, it is also possible to detect non-ischaemic fibrosis in athletes who do not have overt cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms of this fibrosis are unclear; however, it does appear to be clinically important. We also review data on the prevalence of non-ischaemic fibrosis in athletes.

Furthermore, the role of cTns is growing in the routine evaluation of cardioxicity and in determining the efficacy/safety ratio of novel cardioprotective strategies in clinical settings. cTns can detect myocardial injury not only in a wide spectrum of laboratory animals in experimental studies in vivo , but also in isolated heart models or cardiomyocytes in vitro . The crucial issue regarding the cross‐species usage of cardiac troponin investigation remains the choice of cardiac troponin testing. This review summarizes the recent proteomic data on aminoacid sequences of cTnT and cTnI in various species, as well as selected analytical characteristics of human cardiac troponin high‐sensitivity assays. Due to the highly phylogenetically conserved structure of troponins, the same bioindicator can be investigated using the same method in both clinical and experimental cardiology, thus contributing to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases as well as to increased effectiveness of troponin use in clinical practice. Measuring cardiac troponins using commercially available human high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin tests with convenient antibodies selected on the basis of adequate proteomic knowledge can solve many issues which would otherwise be difficult to address in clinical settings for various ethical and practical reasons. Our survey could help elaborate the practical guidelines for optimizing the choice of cTns assay in cardiology. © 2016 BioFactors, 42(2):133–148, 2016", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/biof.1261", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2276178488", "source": "openalex"}

The fee-for-service payment model has contributed to inefficiency, and new payment methods are a promising approach to improving value. Health reforms are needed to increase patient access, reduce costs, and improve health care quality, and the landmark Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act presents a roadmap for reform. The product of a collaboration between primary care and cardiology clinicians, this review describes a conceptual approach to delivery and payment reforms that aim to better support primary care-cardiology comanagement of chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD).Few existing alternative payment models specifically address long-term management of CVD. Primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations come closest, but both emphasize primary care, and cardiologists have often not been well engaged. A collaborative care framework should articulate distinct roles and responsibilities for primary care and cardiology in CVD comanagement. Finally, a series of payment models aim to better support clinicians in providing accountable, seamless, and patient-centered cardiac care.Clinical leadership is essential during this time of change in the health care system. Patients often struggle to navigate a fragmented and expensive system, whereas clinicians often practice with incomplete information about tests, treatments, and recommendations by their colleagues. The payment models described in this review offer an opportunity to create more satisfying approaches to patient care while improving value.

Challenges related to detection, management, and prevention of disability and dysfunction secondary to AF are increasingly apparent. The subspecialty of cardiology, cardiac electrophysiology, is primarily tasked with the treatment of AF. Patients with AF are often ambushed by the condition with approximately 28% to 38% of patients experiencing significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. Behavioral risk reduction can be targeted by achieving and maintaining a healthy BMI, abstaining from smoking, avoiding alcohol consumption, and sustaining regular physical activity. AF patients are also tasked with considering possible treatment options, adhering to medication regiments & lifestyle changes, utilizing wearable technologies, and managing emotional distress, to minimize health risks and optimize quality of life. Major medical organizations have called for integrated, multidisciplinary management as the treatment of choice for AF patients. Health psychologists bring valuable expertise but are not uniformly involved in the care of AF patients. The purposes of this article are to (a) review the existing research on the medical, psychological, and behavioral aspects of contemporary management of AF, (b) highlight the intersections between cardiac electrophysiology and clinical health psychology in managing AF, and (c) call for more health psychologists in this specialized area of cardiac electrophysiology.

Strengths of this meta-analysis are the large amount of individual patient data from 22 trials and the rigorous statistical methodologies. The conclusions support and update prior analyses that suggest that ‘all things being equal,’ PPCI is the superior reperfusion strategy,2 provided this is carried out in the right institution, by the right operator; in some centres, the day of the week and the time of day may also be relevant.3 The authors argue (and this is a very controversial point) that irrespective of the delay between symptoms and presentation, PPCI is superior to fibrinolysis, although the absolute reduction in mortality by PPCI widens over time, consistent with the hypothesis that older thrombi become more resistant to FT drugs. With regard to hospital-specific PCI-related delay, when this was <35 min, the relative and absolute mortality reduction was significantly higher than in patients with longer delays, although the point estimate suggesting a benefit from PPCI is noted in each time interval. The title of the article poses the question whether time matters. The authors suggest that a benefit for PPCI is present during all time periods analysed, although the magnitude of the benefit is dependent upon the duration of symptoms prior to presentation and the extent of PCI-related delay, calculated from the time of randomization.

This study investigates the impact of different educational activities on students' academic performance in a problem-based learning curriculum. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on the cardiology block at the College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All students who undertook the cardiology block during the academic year 2011–2012 were included. The students' attendance was measured using their overall attendance percentage. This percentage is a product of their attendance of many activities throughout the block. The students' performance was assessed by the final mark obtained, which is a product of many assessment elements. Statistical correlation between students' attendance and performance was established. Results: A total of 127 students were included. The average lecture attendance rate for the medical students in this study was found to be 86%. A significant positive correlation was noted between the overall attendance and the accumulated students' block mark ( r =0.52; P <0.001). Students' attendance to different education activities was correlated to their final mark. Lecture attendance was the most significant predictor ( P <0.001), that is, 1.0% increase in lecture attendance has predicted a 0.27 increase in students' final block mark. Conclusion: Class attendance has a positive effect on students' academic performance with stronger effect for lecture attendance compared to attendance in other teaching modalities.

This document presents an expert opinion from the Working Group on Cardiac Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology of the Polish Cardiac Society concerning the indications, performance technique, and interpretation of results for CPET in adult cardiology. CPET is an electrocardiographic exercise test expanded with exercise evaluation of ventilatory and gas exchange parameters. It allows for a global assessment of the exercise performance including the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, neuropsychological, and musculoskeletal systems. It provides a noninvasive dynamic evaluation during exercise and is a reference modality for exercise capacity assessment. Moreover, it allows the measurement of numerous prognostic parameters. It is useful in cardiology, pulmonology, oncology, perioperative assessment, rehabilitation as well as in sports medicine and in the evaluation of healthy people. This test not only helps to diagnose the causes of exercise intolerance but also supports the evaluation of the treatment. New opportunities are offered by combining CPET with imaging such as exercise stress echocardiography.

Methods/Design One hundred and fifty-nine patients with histologically confirmed HER2+ breast cancer will be enrolled in a parallel 3-arm, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind design. After baseline assessments, participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril), beta-blocker (bisoprolol), or placebo. Participants will receive drug or placebo for 1 year beginning 7 days before trastuzumab therapy. Dosages for all groups will be systematically up-titrated, as tolerated, at 1 week intervals for a total of 3 weeks. The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if conventional heart failure pharmacotherapy can prevent trastuzumab-mediated left ventricular remodeling among patients with HER2+ early breast cancer, as measured by 12 month change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume using cardiac MRI. Secondary objectives include 1) determine the evolution of left ventricular remodeling on cardiac MRI in patients with HER2+ early breast cancer, 2) understand the mechanism of trastuzumab mediated cardiac toxicity by assessing for the presence of myocardial injury and apoptosis on serum biomarkers and cardiac MRI, and 3) correlate cardiac biomarkers of myocyte injury and extra-cellular matrix remodeling with left ventricular remodeling on cardiac MRI in patients with HER2+ early breast cancer. Discussion Cardiac toxicity as a result of cancer therapies is now recognized as a significant health problem of increasing prevalence. To our knowledge, MANTICORE will be the first randomized trial testing proven heart failure pharmacotherapy in the prevention of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity. We expect the findings of this trial to provide important evidence in the development of guidelines for preventive therapy.

Pacing the heart is an effective treatment for people suffering from bradycardia caused by sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) block, and electronic pacing has saved countless lives since its introduction into clinical practice. AV synchronization is the typical cycle of atrial depolarization and contraction followed by ventricular depolarization and contraction. The continuation of this cycle leads to appropriate ventricular filling and cardiac output. By contrast, the failure of the cycle results in AV asynchrony, which may result in heart failure. Cardiac resynchronization treatment (CRT) involves using customized pacemakers with or without implantable cardioverter defibrillators and tries to resynchronize the failing heart by enhancing myocardial contraction without increasing energy consumption.

The potential detection of subclinical atrial disease with imaging, biomarkers and other modalities offers a window opportunity for interventions that would prevent deterioration to clinical disease and could potentially allow reversal of subclinical disease.

This shift in recent years has been fueled by the introduction of 18F-labeled PET radiotracers. Due to physical and chemical key properties, these imaging agents allow for more flexibility of imaging protocols and a better employment in the clinic. Potentially rendering perfusion, viability, innervation and inflammation, 18F-labeled PET radiotracers may truly pave the way for a global assessment of the current metabolic and functional status of the heart, e.g. after acute myocardial infarction or for progressed heart failure.

The cardiovascular impact of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) under the new definition remains unclear. Methods: We used data from the UK Biobank study, which is a prospective population-based cohort study. Participants were categorized into five groups: normal BP, normal high BP, ISH, IDH and systolic and diastolic hypertension. The primary endpoint for this study was the composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal ischaemic stroke, nonfatal haemorrhagic stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) death. We also explored the results for the above-mentioned CVD outcomes separately. Baseline BP measurements were obtained twice after the participant had been at rest for at least 5 min in a seated position. Results: We included 385 955 participants who were not taking antihypertensive medications, were free of CVD at baseline and had available data on BP measurements. During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 8959 CVD events were recorded, including 4729 nonfatal MIs, 2287 nonfatal ischaemic strokes, 813 nonfatal haemorrhagic strokes, and 1826 CVD deaths. According to the hypertension threshold of at least 130/80 mmHg by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, both ISH (hazard ratio 1.39; 95% confidence interval 1.27, 1.15) and IDH (hazard ratio 1.28; 95% confidence interval 1.15, 1.43) were significantly associated with a higher overall CVD risk than normal BP. ISH was associated with most CVD risk, except for ischaemic stroke, while the excess CVD risk associated with IDH appeared to be driven mainly by MI and CVD death. We found heterogeneity by sex and age regarding the effects of IDH on overall CVD risk, with significant associations in younger adults (age &lt;60 years) and women and null associations in men and older adults (age ≥60 years). Conclusion: ISH was associated with the risk of most CVD events, while the association between IDH and CVD risk was mainly driven by MI incidence and CVD death.

These affirmative action programs were traditionally voluntary, created and implemented at the state or institutional level, limited to the premedical and medical school stages, and intended to be temporary. Despite these efforts, numerical targets for underrepresented minorities set by the Association of American Medical Colleges have consistently fallen short. Failures have largely been attributable to the limited qualified applicant pool and legal challenges to the use of race and ethnicity in admissions to institutions of higher education.

Vitamin D deficiency appears to be related to an increase in parathyroid hormone levels and can predispose to essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, increased insulin resistance, and eventually to atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events. Randomized prospective clinical trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D and omega-3 FA supplementation therapy should be recommended as a routine therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/729670", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011281133", "source": "openalex"}

Methods and results The CCCTN was founded in 2017 with 16 centres and has grown to a research network of over 40 academic and clinical centres in the United States and Canada. Each centre enters data for consecutive cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) admissions for at least 2 months of each calendar year. More than 20 000 unique CICU admissions are now included in the CCCTN Registry. To date, scientific observations from the CCCTN Registry include description of variations in care, the epidemiology and outcomes of all CICU patients, as well as subsets of patients with specific disease states, such as shock, heart failure, renal dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The CCCTN has also characterised utilization patterns, including use of mechanical circulatory support in response to changes in the heart transplantation allocation system, and the use and impact of multidisciplinary shock teams. Over years of multicentre collaboration, the CCCTN has established a robust research network to facilitate multicentre registry-based randomised trials in patients with cardiac critical illness. Conclusion The CCCTN is a large, prospective registry dedicated to describing processes-of-care and expanding clinical knowledge in cardiac critical illness. The CCCTN will serve as an investigational platform from which to conduct randomised controlled trials in this important patient population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjqcco/qcac055", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4293348977", "source": "openalex"}

The greater connectivity to existing IT networks has in fact exposed Administrations to new IT security vulnerabilities, as healthcare is an extremely interesting target for cybercrime for two fundamental reasons: on the one hand, it is a source rich in valuable data and on the other, very often, the defenses are weak.Methods: The general purpose of the study was to investigate the cybersecurity in cardiology, a strategic field of the health care. The specific purpose of the study was: (I) to perform a first overview in this field; and (II) to investigate the opinion on the cyber-risk in cardiology directly interviewing the actors working in this field, using a properly designed questionnaire submitted using mobile technology.Results: Fifty seven cardiologists participated in the study and filled the proposed questionnaire on their smartphone/tablet.

While in the majority of cases no underlying heart disease is present, in others PVBs may be the sign of a condition at risk of sudden cardiac death, including cardiomyopathies, congenital, coronary artery, heart valves and ion channels diseases. In this expert opinion document of the Italian Society of Sports Cardiology, we propose a multiparametric interpretation approach to PVBs in athletes and a stepwise diagnostic algorithm. The clinical work-up should include the assessment of the probable site of origin based on the ECG pattern of the ectopic QRS and of the arrhythmia behavior (including the number of different PVB morphologies, complexity, response to exercise and reproducibility), as well as first-line tests such as echocardiography. Based on this initial evaluation, most athletes can be reassured of the benign nature of PVBs and cleared for competition under periodical follow-up. However, when the clinical suspicion is high, further investigations with non-invasive (e.g. cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiac computed tomography, genetic testing) and, in very selected cases, invasive (e.g. endocardial voltage mapping and endomyocardial biopsy) tests should be carried out to rule out a high-risk condition.

He felt ‘fixed’ by his treatment and was shocked but relieved to be discharged home after 3 days. He lives alone and has returned to his work as a self-employed builder. Mr B has continued to smoke after his acute myocardial infarction. He is also anxious about his risk of future recurrence and has had to question his assumptions about his physical health and expectations about his health in future years. He is obese and not undertaking any structured exercise. His blood pressure is elevated and he admits that the way in which he takes his cardioprotective medication is a ‘bit hit and miss’. This clinical scenario illustrates common psychosocial factors that can impact negatively on a patient’s recovery and clinical outcomes following treatment for STEMI. These factors will be described and strategies that can be applied to Mr B’ care summarised. Behavioural cardiology is defined as ‘the study and application of psychosocial factors in the assessment and reduction of cardiovascular risk’.1 Over the last 15 years, there has been a growing recognition that psychosocial risk factors make a significant contribution to the atherosclerotic process leading to cardiovascular disease (CVD) through biological and behavioural mechanisms.2 It is recognised that psychosocial risk factors, such as depression and social isolation, are as potent as many biological and behavioural coronary risk factors.

We utilized a review of electronic medical records (NotesMD) and the electronic practice management system (Megawest) encompassing a 4-year period from 2004 to 2007 to determine the number of exercise treadmill (TME), supine bicycle exercise echocardiography (SBE), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion stress imaging (MPI), coronary calcium score (CCS), CCTA, ICA, and PCI procedures performed annually. Test utilization in the 2 years prior to and 2 years following availability of CCTA were compared. Over the 4-year period reviewed, the annual utilization of ICA decreased 45% (2,083 procedures in 2004 vs. 1,150 procedures in 2007, P < 0.01) and the percentage of ICA cases requiring PCI increased (19% in 2004 vs. 28% in 2007, P < 0.001). SPECT MPI decreased 19% (3,223 in 2004 vs. 2,614 in 2007 P < 0.02) and exercise stress treadmill testing decreased 49% (471 in 2004 vs. 241 in 2007 P < 0.02). Over the same period, there were no significant changes in measures of practice volume (office and hospital) or the annual incidence of PCI (405 cases in 2004 vs. 326 cases in 2007) but a higher percentage of patients with significant disease undergoing PCI 19% in 2004 vs. 29% in 2007 P < 0.01. Implementation of CCTA resulted in a significant decrease in ICA and a corresponding significant increase in the percentage of ICA cases requiring PCI, indicating that CCTA resulted in more accurate referral for ICA.

Recent findings Elevated levels of Lp(a) are strongly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, calcific aortic valve stenosis, and ischemic stroke. With circulating levels almost exclusively genetically mediated, increased levels of Lp(a) contribute significantly to the residual cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with otherwise well controlled risk factors. The unique structure of Lp(a) – comprised of a genetically heterogeneous apolipoprotein(a) molecule bound to an LDL-like moiety – provides insight into its pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease and also complicates its accurate measurement. Emerging therapies targeting the apolipoprotein(a) component of Lp(a) have the potential to revolutionize the management of individuals with elevated Lp(a). Summary With promising therapies on the horizon, there has been a renewed focus on the role of Lp(a) in ASCVD.

Respondents (ie, internal medicine residents) rated 38 professional development preferences and 20 cardiology perceptions. Data were collected in 2020 and compared with survey results from the prior 2010 study. Multivariable models were created for specialty choice using scaled independent variables dichotomized using the top 2 options; categorical variables were recoded into binary variables for analysis.Multivariable models were used to determine the association of demographic characterisitcs and survey responses with prospective career choice. Responses were examined by total group, by gender, by self-reported consideration of entering cardiology as a profession, and by comparison with a decade prior both as a group and by gender.A total of 840 residents (mean [SD] age, 29.24 [2.82] years; 49.8% male; 55.4% White) completed the survey. The survey incorporated a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important) for some of the questions, with additional questions on demographic characteristics. The most important professional development preferences by descending Likert score were as follows: positive role models (4.56), stimulating career (3.81), and family friendly (3.78). The cardiology perception statements with the highest agreement were as follows: interferes with family life during training (3.93) and having met positive role models or having positive views of cardiovascular disease as a topic (3.85). Multivariable analysis yielded a 22-element model predicting cardiology as career choice. Compared with the 2010 survey, the findings of this survey indicated increased importance of work-life balance components for both male and female residents, with a greater change in male residents. Contemporary residents were more likely than their predecessors to agree with negative perceptions of cardiology.This survey study found that both male and female residents place a high value on support for optimal work-life balance; these preferences have intensified over the past decade and factor into career choice.

Health authorities and the general population have started to recognize that the fight against these diseases can only be won if their burden is faced by increasing our investment on interventions in lifestyle changes and prevention. There is an overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of secondary prevention initiatives including cardiac rehabilitation in terms of reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, secondary prevention is still too poorly implemented in clinical practice, often only on selected populations and over a limited period of time. The development of systematic and full comprehensive preventive programmes is warranted, integrated in the organization of national health systems. Furthermore, systematic monitoring of the process of delivery and outcomes is a necessity. Cardiology and secondary prevention, including cardiac rehabilitation, have evolved almost independently of each other and although each makes a unique contribution it is now time to join forces under the banner of preventive cardiology and create a comprehensive model that optimizes long term outcomes for patients and reduces the future burden on health care services.

However, some paediatric cardiologists continue to provide care for their patients into adult life. Little is known about the perspectives of young adult patients who have been transferred to ACHD clinics versus those who continue to receive their cardiology care in paediatric settings. Methods Content and thematic analysis of structured telephone interviews with 21 young adults age 18–25 (13 transferred to ACHD clinic and 8 who had not transferred) was conducted to identify similarities and differences in patient characteristics of those in ACHD versus paediatric settings. Results There were no appreciable differences in gender, age, heart disease type, and independence between those transferred to ACHD care versus those not transferred. Participants in both groups were aware of differences between the paediatric and ACHD care settings and providers, with some favouring the familiarity offered by the paediatric setting and providers. Participants had varying views on parental involvement in their care; most of them had attended clinic appointments on their own. Those who had transferred to ACHD care acknowledged that it would take time to adjust to new relationships. Positive perspectives on actual or anticipated transfer to ACHD care included a growing sense of autonomy and responsibility, as well as access to reproductive information relevant to ACHD patients.

Conventional care for CHF is ineffective and results in a cycle of \"crisis management\" that includes repeated emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and physician visits. Recently, a number of outpatient coronary care centers that provide consistent, aggressive outpatient therapies and extensive patient education have emerged and are successfully breaking this cycle of dependence on hospital services. One such effort is the Heart Institute's Heart Failure Center, the result of a partnership between a private-practice cardiology group and our tertiary-care medical center. Our program includes not only patient education and outpatient infusions of inotropic agents, but an electronic linkage to the emergency department and home healthcare services. Preliminary data show that 16 months after the program was initiated, hospital admissions decreased by 30%, hospital days by 42% and average length of stay by 17%. An effective outpatient heart failure program can alleviate the economic burden of CHF and improve the quality of patient care.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2396492346", "source": "openalex"}

The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was successfully inserted in 298 cases (93%). Indications for an IABP included: cardiogenic shock (84 cases), preoperative hemodynamic coverage (15 cases), low-output syndrome (73 cases), pre- and postinfarction angina (75 cases), intractable congestive heart failure (12 cases), refractory ventricular arrhythmia (9 cases), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (14 cases), cardiac arrest (7 cases), and a miscellaneous group (9 cases). The overall major complication rate was 9%. The data from this experience support aggressive management of cardiogenic shock, i.e., early balloon insertion, angiography, and cardiac surgery, which significantly increases the survival rate (83%) over medical therapy combined with balloon counterpulsation alone. The IABP was also extremely effective in managing other high-risk categories when combined with some form of definitive mechanical correction, e.g., coronary revascularization, valve replacement, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Left ventricular (LV) function was a significant indicator of long-term survival in our series.

In the present study, we aimed to assess the quality of published systematic reviews in high impact cardiology journals. Methods: We searched PubMed for systematic reviews published between 2010 and 2019 in five general cardiology journals with the highest impact factor (according to Clarivate Analytics 2019). We extracted data on eligibility criteria, methodological characteristics, bias assessments, and sources of funding. Further, we assessed the quality of retrieved reviews using the AMSTAR tool. Results: A total of 352 systematic reviews were assessed. The AMSTAR quality score was low or critically low in 71% (95% CI: 65.7–75.4) of the assessed reviews. Sixty-four reviews (18.2%, 95% CI: 14.5–22.6) registered/published their protocol. Only 221 reviews (62.8%, 95% CI: 57.6–67.7) reported adherence to the EQUATOR checklists, 208 reviews (58.4%, 95% CI: 53.9–64.1) assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and 177 reviews (52.3%, 95% CI: 45.1–55.5) assessed the risk of publication bias in their primary outcome analysis. The primary outcome was statistically significant in 274 (79.6%, 95% CI: 75.1–83.6) and had statistical heterogeneity in 167 (48.5%, 95% CI: 43.3–53.8) reviews. The use and sources of external funding was not disclosed in 87 reviews (24.7%, 95% CI: 20.5–29.5). Data analysis showed that the existence of publication bias was significantly associated with statistical heterogeneity of the primary outcome and that complex design, larger sample size, and higher AMSTAR quality score were associated with higher citation metrics. Conclusion: Our analysis uncovered widespread gaps in conducting and reporting systematic reviews in cardiology. These findings highlight the importance of rigorous editorial and peer review policies in systematic review publishing, as well as education of the investigators and clinicians on the synthesis and interpretation of evidence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.671569", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3166389790", "source": "openalex"}

It was the first test used to localise and quantify myocardial ischaemia. The wealth of evidence related to diagnosis and long-term prognosis in varying subgroups is unparalleled.1 Radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) provides a geometrically independent assessment of ventricular function which remains the gold standard. Nuclear techniques can be used in patients with renal dysfunction, obesity, dysrhythmias and claustrophobia. Up until a few years ago, gamma camera hardware relied on the inexpensive technology of the 1960s, which has only recently undergone a revolution in response to improvements to complementary modalities. Radiation doses continue to fall. Exciting developments in positron emission tomography (PET) and hybrid imaging are promising a bright future with a potential resurgence in popularity for this ‘workhorse’. The mainstay of Nuclear Cardiology, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), is performed using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) via a gamma camera. Worldwide, there is significant interest and investment in the role of PET in the assessment of myocardial disease. Gamma cameras have used the scintillation properties of sodium iodide (NaI) since the 1960s. Solid-state detectors using cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) are available on modern systems which allow for a significant improvement in sensitivity, additional radiation dose reductions or reduced scanning time.2 On a new CZT system, a scan time of 4–6 min is achievable with a much lower injected dose than that used for a NaI gamma camera.

When patients have inducible myocardial ischemia and sufficient viable myocardium, coronary revascularization treatment should be performed. Both stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and viability imaging provide important information. Another important aspect of stress perfusion imaging is that normal stress perfusion is associated with low risk for future cardiac events.

A pediatric cardiologist, along with the patient's primary physician, should provide a continuing care program. In some centers, pediatric cardiologists who have expertise in the management of patients with congenital heart disease may provide new or continuing care for adults with congenital heart defects; in others, an orderly transfer of medical management between pediatric and adult cardiologists will provide the best care for older patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.87.4.576", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4239901258", "source": "openalex"}

Following the fundamental establishment of the heart as an endocrine organ in the early 1980's, the cardiac natriuretic peptides have today been identified as potent biochemical tools in diverse aspects of clinical cardiology including as diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic markers of cardiac dysfunction as well as potential drug targets. In man, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) are mainly synthesised and secreted by the failing heart, whereas the closely related C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) appears to be a local factor secreted by the endothelium and hence is not considered as a cardiac natriuretic peptide. With the ongoing development of sensitive immunoassays, increased plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP peptides have been associated to a variety of cardiac diseases--but their clinical usefulness as biochemical markers in congestive heart failure is the most promising. In contrast to the large quantity of clinical research on cardiac-derived peptides, the basic understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of these peptides is however still insufficient.

Background Radiation exposure to the operator remains an occupational health hazard in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Methods An anthropomorphic mannequin simulating an operator was placed near a phantom, simulating a patient. To measure the operator dose reduction, thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) were inserted into the head and into the eye bulbs of the mannequin, while electronic dosimeters were positioned on the temple and at the level of the thyroid. Measurements were performed without and with the ZG system in place. Physician exposure was subsequently prospectively measured on the torso, on the left eye and on upper arm using the same electronic dosimeters, during clinical procedures (coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)). The physicians dose reduction was assessed by comparing operator dose when using traditional radioprotection garments (Phase 0) versus using the ZG system (Phase 1). Results Dose reductions as measured on the mannequin ranged from 66% to the head, to 100% to the torso. No dose was detected at the level of the torso and thyroid with ZG. When comparing CA and PCI procedures between Phase 0 and Phase 1, a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001) was found for the left eye and the left wrist.

Using this new approach throughout the course of 404 consecutive cardiac catheterizations, we reduced patient radiation exposures down to 11 to 16% of currently typical values: i.e., mean dose area products of 5.97 Gy cm2 (n = 91), 6.73 (n = 113), 8.11 (n = 91), and 8.90 (n = 109); cinegraphic dose area products of 2.34, 3.64, 4.56, and 5.49; and cinegraphic dose area products frame(-1) of 13.3, 19.8, 27.0, and 30.2 mGy cm2, for levels A, B, C, and D, respectively. The number of cinegraphic frames ranged within 168 to 182 per case. Our results show that during catheterization interventionalists should vary image intensifier entrance dose levels in accordance with documented structure, angulation, and body mass index.

Quality control is a mainstay to reduce variability among institutions and operators and must be obtained by using appropriate procedures for data acquisition, storage and interpretation of echo-Doppler data. This goal can be achieved by employing an echo core laboratory (ECL), with the responsibility for standardizing image acquisition processes (performed at the peripheral echo-labs) and analysis (by monitoring and optimizing the internal intra- and inter-reader variability of measurements). Accordingly, the Working Group of Echocardiography of the Italian Society of Cardiology decided to design standardized procedures for imaging acquisition in peripheral laboratories and reading procedures and to propose a methodological approach to assess the reproducibility of echo-Doppler parameters of cardiac structure and function by using both standard and advanced technologies. A number of cardiologists experienced in cardiac ultrasound was involved to set up an ECL available for future studies involving complex imaging or including echo-Doppler measures as primary or secondary efficacy or safety end-points. The present manuscript describes the methodology of the procedures (imaging acquisition and measurement reading) and provides the documentation of the work done so far to test the reproducibility of the different echo-Doppler modalities (standard and advanced). These procedures can be suggested for utilization also in non referall echocardiographic laboratories as an \"inside\" quality check, with the aim at optimizing clinical consistency of echo-Doppler data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-7120-9-26", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984961493", "source": "openalex"}

Fifty-three guidelines on 22 topics, including a total of 7196 recommendations, were abstracted.The number of recommendations and the distribution of classes of recommendation (I, II, and III) and levels of evidence (A, B, and C) were determined. The subset of guidelines that were current as of September 2008 was evaluated to describe changes in recommendations between the first and current versions as well as patterns in levels of evidence used in the current versions.Among guidelines with at least 1 revision or update by September 2008, the number of recommendations increased from 1330 to 1973 (+48%) from the first to the current version, with the largest increase observed in use of class II recommendations. Considering the 16 current guidelines reporting levels of evidence, only 314 recommendations of 2711 total are classified as level of evidence A (median, 11%), whereas 1246 (median, 48%) are level of evidence C. Level of evidence significantly varies across categories of guidelines (disease, intervention, or diagnostic) and across individual guidelines. Recommendations with level of evidence A are mostly concentrated in class I, but only 245 of 1305 class I recommendations have level of evidence A (median, 19%).Recommendations issued in current ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines are largely developed from lower levels of evidence or expert opinion.

We used multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models to determine provider-, practice-, and patient-level predictors of cessation assistance. We measured provider variation in cessation assistance using median rate ratio (the likelihood that the same patient would receive the same assistance at by any given provider; >1.2 suggests significant variation). Smoking cessation assistance was documented in only 34% of encounters. Despite adjustment of provider, practice, and patient characteristics, there was large provider-level variation in cessation assistance (median rate ratio, 6 [95% CI , 5.76-6.32]). Practice location in the South region (odds ratio [OR], 0.48 [0.37-0.63] versus West region) and rural or suburban location (OR, 0.92 [0.88-0.95] for rural; OR, 0.94 [0.91-0.97] for suburban versus urban) were associated with lower rates of cessation assistance.

Common comorbidities are Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity/overweight, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic liver disease. The cardiovascular system, kidneys, and liver are linked to many of the same risk factors (e.g. dyslipidaemia, hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes, and central/truncal obesity), and shared metabolic and functional abnormalities lead to damage throughout these organs via overlapping pathophysiological pathways. The COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the management of cardiometabolic diseases. Obesity, T2DM, CKD, and liver disease are associated with increased risk of poor outcomes of COVID-19 infection, and conversely, COVID-19 can lead to worsening of pre-existing ASCVD. The high rates of these comorbidities highlight the need to improve recognition and treatment of ASCVD in patients with obesity, insulin resistance or T2DM, chronic liver diseases, and CKD and equally, to improve recognition and treatment of these diseases in patients with ASCVD. Strategies to prevent and manage cardiometabolic diseases include lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. There is a need for more programmes at the societal level to encourage a healthy diet and physical activity. Many pharmacotherapies offer mechanism-based approaches that can target multiple pathophysiological pathways across diseases. These include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and combined glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Non-surgical and surgical weight loss strategies can improve cardiometabolic disorders in individuals living with obesity. New biomarkers under investigation may help in the early identification of individuals at risk and reveal new treatment targets.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad445", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4384264234", "source": "openalex"}

Methods and results Main changes of the version 2.0 concerned exclusion criteria, registry duration, and clarification of the population characteristics. Breast cancer radiotherapy has been removed as an exclusion criterion, which involves now only history of a pre-chemotherapy left ventricular dysfunction. The period for long-term registry recruitment has been reduced (December 2017), but the target study population was extended to 3000 patients. The characteristics of the population are now better defined: patients seen in an imaging lab, which will include patients undergoing chemotherapy with associated targeted therapy or no targeted therapy, at increased risk of ADRC. In total, 1294 breast cancer patients have been enrolled, and 783 case report forms locked from October 2014 to November 2016. Of these, 481 (61.4%) were seen at first evaluation and 302 (38.6%) while on oncologic treatment with anticancer drugs. Fifty-two patients (17.2%) were not in targeted therapies, 191 (63.3%) were ongoing targeted therapy, and 59 (19.5%) had completed it. Twenty-three (2.9%) patients had a suspected diagnosis and 35 (4.5%) a confirmed diagnosis of ADRC. Arterial hypertension was the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor (29.2%) followed by diabetes (6.1%). Previous history of heart failure accounted for 0.5%, whereas previous cardiac disease was identified in 6.3% of population. Conclusion The changes of the original protocol of the COT Registry and first update allow a first glance to the panorama of cardiovascular characteristics of breast cancer patients enrolled.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12162", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2610740768", "source": "openalex"}

A geometry representative of an interventional cardiology setup was modelled and several configurations, including beam projections and staff distance from the source, were investigated. In addition, measurements on phantoms were performed for masks and drapes.ResultsAn average dose reduction of 65% and 25% to the eyes and the brain respectively was obtained for the masks by MC simulations but a strong influence of the design was observed. The cap effectiveness for the brain ranges on average between 13% and 37%. Nevertheless, it was shown that only some upper parts of the brain were protected. There was no significant difference between the effectiveness of lead and lead-free aprons. Of all the devices, the ZG system offered the highest protection to the brain and eye lens and a protection level comparable to the apron for the organs normally covered.ConclusionAll investigated devices showed potential for dose reduction to specific organs. However, for masks, caps and drapes, it strongly depends on the design, exposure conditions and staff position. Therefore, for a clinical use, it is recommended to evaluate their effectiveness in the planned conditions of use.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2023.102543", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4320085783", "source": "openalex"}

Although only two intracoronary stents have been approved by the FDA, the relatively limited approved indications do not account for the dramatic increase in stent implantation. This increase has important implications for patient health care delivery. This study of stent usage in a single center over a 36-mo period included all patients treated with coronary stents at the Mayo Clinic from January 1993-December 1995, and evaluated the relative difference in frequency between \"off-label\" and FDA-approved indications for implantation. During the 36-mo period of study, 3,614 interventional procedures were done and one or more stents were placed in 25.4% of patients. The proportion of patients receiving stents increased throughout this time: during the first 6-mo period, stents were placed in 6.2% of procedures; during the last 6-mo period, stents were placed in 46.3% of procedures, an eightfold increase. During the final 6 mo, an unapproved device or an unapproved indication for an approved device constituted 59.4% of all stent procedures. In addition, use of the non-FDA-approved adjunctive treatment regimen without warfarin increased from 2.9% in the first 6-mo period of observation to 82.7% in the last 6 mo.

A nationwide survey was conducted from October 2012 to December 2015 to assess the prevalence of HTN in China. Methods: A stratified multistage random sampling method was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of 451 755 residents ≥18 years of age from 31 provinces in mainland China from October 2012 to December 2015. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after resting for 5 minutes by trained staff using a validated oscillometric BP monitor. HTN was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication within 2 weeks. Pre-HTN was defined as SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg and DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication. HTN control was defined as SBP &lt;140 mm Hg and DBP&lt;90 mm Hg. In addition, the prevalence of HTN (SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80 mm Hg) and control rate (SBP &lt;130 and DBP &lt;80 mm Hg) of HTN were also estimated according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline. Results: Overall, 23.2% (≈244.5 million) of the Chinese adult population ≥18 years of age had HTN, and another 41.3% (≈435.3 million) had pre-HTN according to the Chinese guideline. There were no significant differences of HTN prevalence between urban and rural residents (23.4% versus 23.1%, P =0.819). Among individuals with HTN, 46.9% were aware of their condition, 40.7% were taking prescribed antihypertensive medications, and 15.3% had controlled HTN. Calcium channel blockers were the most commonly used antihypertensive medication (46.5%) as monotherapy, and 31.7% of treated hypertensive patients used ≥2 medications. The prevalence of HTN based on the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline was twice as high as that based on 2010 Chinese guideline (46.4%), whereas the control rate fell to 3.0%. Conclusions: In China, there is a high prevalence of HTN and pre-HTN, and awareness, treatment, and control of HTN were low.

Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases cause about a third of the total global deaths. Does ML work in the cardiology domain and what is the current progress in this regard? To answer this question, we present a systematic review aiming at 1) identifying studies where machine learning algorithms were applied in the domain of cardiology; 2) providing an overview based on the existing literature about the state-of-the-art ML algorithms applied in cardiology. Methods: For organizing this review, we adopted the PRISMA statement. We used PubMed as the search engine and identified the search keywords as “Machine Learning”, “Data Mining”, “Cardiology”, and “Cardiovascular” in combinations. Scientific articles and conference papers published between 2013-2017 reporting about implementations of ML algorithms in the domain of cardiology have been included in this review. Results: In total, 27 relevant papers were included. We examined four aspects: the aims of ML systems, the methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The major part of the paper was aimed at predicting the risk of mortality. A promising branch of Machine Learning, the ‘Reinforcement Learning’, was also never proposed in the observed papers. Tree-based ensembles are common and show good results, whereas deep neural networks are poorly represented. Most papers (20 of 27) have used datasets that are hardly available for other researchers, e.g . unpublished local registries. We also identified 28 different metrics for model evaluation. This variety of metrics makes it difficult to compare the results of different researches.

Theauthors collected the information given during the presentations of the studies, as well as from press releases prepared by most of the speakers. This report only shows preliminary results. During the first Hotline Session, studies on early treatment of acute coronary syndromes werepresented. Professor Francisco Fernandez-Aviles fromValladolid, Spain, presented the GRACIA study. To 500 patients with ST-segment elevation acutemyocardial infarction, front-loaded rt-PA wasadministered within 12h of symptom onset. About 3h following thrombolytic therapy, patients were randomised to early angiography and subsequent percutaneous intervention to be performed within 24h, or to an ischaemia-guided conservativestrategy. The average time to percutaneous intervention in the invasive group was 17h afterfibrinolysis. In the conservative arm 19% of patients underwent revascularisation during hospital stay, but this was not considered an endpoint in this study. The primary endpoint of 30-day death,reinfarction and (re-) revascularisation wasreduced by 20%, from 6.0% in the alteplase groupto 4.8% in the alteplase plus intervention group \\batchmode \\documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\pagestyle{empty} \\begin{document} \\((p=0.55)\\) \\end{document}.

Background: Randomized clinical trials often focus on short-term efficacy and safety in a controlled environment. Trial follow-up may be linked with study-related investigations and differ from routine clinical practice. Because treatment and control in randomized trials differ from daily practice, trial results may have reduced general applicability and may be of limited value in clinical decision-making. Further, it is economically very costly to conduct randomized clinical trials. Methods and results: Population-based health care databases collect data continuously and prospectively, and make it possible to monitor lifelong outcomes of cardiac interventions in large numbers of patients. This strengthens external validity by eliminating the effects of study-related monitoring or diagnostic tests. Further, follow-up data can be obtained at low expense. Importantly, data sources encompassing a complete population are likely to reflect clinical practice. Because population-based health care databases collect data for quality-control and administrative purposes unrelated to scientific investigations, certain biases, such as nonresponse bias, recall bias, and bias from losses to follow-up, can be avoided. Conclusion: Event detection using population-based health care databases is a new research tool in interventional cardiology that may allow large, low-cost, randomized clinical trials to reflect daily clinical practice, covering a broad range of patients and end points with complete lifelong follow-up.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/clep.s44651", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1981436023", "source": "openalex"}

We evaluated the Association of Interventional Cardiology certification with in-hospital outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 2010. Methods and Results— We identified physicians who performed ≥10 PCIs in 2010 in the CathPCI Registry and determined interventional cardiology (ICARD) certification status using American Board of Internal Medicine data. We compared in-hospital outcomes of patients treated by certified and noncertified physicians using hierarchical multivariable models adjusted for differences in patient characteristics and PCI volume. Primary end points were all-cause in-hospital mortality and bleeding complications. Secondary end points included emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, vascular complications, and a composite of any adverse outcome. With 510 708 PCI procedures performed by 5175 physicians, case mix and unadjusted outcomes were similar among certified and noncertified physicians. The adjusted risks of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.19) and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–1.56) were higher in the non–ICARD-certified group, but the risks of bleeding and vascular complications and the composite end point were not statistically significantly different between groups. Conclusions— We did not observe a consistent association between ICARD certification and the outcomes of PCI procedures. Although there was a significantly higher risk of mortality and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting in patients treated by non–ICARD-certified physicians, the risks of vascular complications and bleeding were similar. Our findings suggest that ICARD certification status alone is not a strong predictor of patient outcomes and indicate a need to enhance the value of subspecialty certification.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.115.017523", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2175711386", "source": "openalex"}

In addition to this a literature search identified several other publications eligible for inclusion based on their relevance to clinical cardiology, their potential impact on clinical practice and on future guidelines. A total of 70 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining use of drug-coated balloons in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), interventions following shockable cardiac arrest, mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock complicating MI, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, surgical or percutaneous revascularisation strategies in left main coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation MI, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (dapagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (evolocumab), bempedoic acid, and novel approaches to the management of hypertension. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents and regimes including combination antithrombotic therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril–valsartan in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure but without diabetes. Electrophysiology data included trials examining alcohol in atrial fibrillation and the use of wearable fitness devices for identifying atrial fibrillation.

We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic and more intense antithrombotic therapy on limb outcomes and limb salvage in patients with chronic LEAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study inclusion criteria were: enrolment of patients with LEAD, randomized allocation to more vs. less intense antithrombotic therapy [more vs. less intense single-antiplatelet therapy (SAPT); dual-antiplatelet therapy vs. SAPT; dual antithrombotic therapy vs. SAPT or oral anticoagulant]; enrolment of ≥200 patients; reporting of at least one of following outcomes: limb amputation or revascularization. Seven randomized studies enrolling 30 447 patients were included. Over a median follow-up of 24 months, more vs. less intense antithrombotic therapy or placebo significantly reduced the risk of limb revascularization [relative risk (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.94] and limb amputation (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86), as well as stroke (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.97).

Data were analyzed from March to July 2018.Medicare Advantage enrollment.Medication prescription patterns among eligible patients and intermediate outcomes, including blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Of the 35 563 patients with CAD enrolled in MA, 20 193 (56.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 76.7 (7.6) years; of the 172 732 patients with CAD enrolled in FFS Medicare, 100 025 (57.9%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 77.5 (8.0) years. Patients enrolled in MA were younger, less likely to be white, and more likely to be female and to have heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease compared with those enrolled in FFS Medicare. Compared with FFS Medicare beneficiaries, MA beneficiaries were more likely to receive secondary prevention treatments, including β-blockers (80.6% vs 78.8%; P < .001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (70.7% vs 65.1%; P < .001), and statins (68.4% vs 64.5%; P < .001).

Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies. Objective: The presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics. Methods: The work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Results and Discussion: An overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included.. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient. Conclusion: The results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations.

For the study, areas were selected which are known to have relatively high radiation exposure along with good conditions for radiological protection-interventional cardiology, radiology and vascular surgery. The study was advertised with the aid of an information flyer which was distributed via organisations including the German Cardiac Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kardiologie- Herz- und Kreislaufforschung e.

The results were compared with international recommendations, especially those of the ICRP, based on state-of-the-art equipment. A total of 104 respondents from eight German clinics took part in the survey. Four participants had been medically diagnosed with cataracts. None of the participants had previously worn an additional dosimeter over their apron to determine partial-body doses.

Deep learning is currently judged as non-transparent due to the model’s complex non-linear structure, and thus, it is considered a «black box», making it hard to gain a comprehensive understanding of its internal processes and explain its behavior. Existing explainable artificial intelligence tools can provide insights into the internal functionality of deep learning and especially of convolutional neural networks, allowing transparency and interpretation. Methods: This study seeks to address the identification of patients’ CAD status (infarction, ischemia or normal) by developing an explainable deep learning pipeline in the form of a handcrafted convolutional neural network. The proposed RGB-CNN model utilizes various pre- and post-processing tools and deploys a state-of-the-art explainability tool to produce more interpretable predictions in decision making. The dataset includes cases from 625 patients as stress and rest representations, comprising 127 infarction, 241 ischemic, and 257 normal cases previously classified by a doctor. The imaging dataset was split into 20% for testing and 80% for training, of which 15% was further used for validation purposes. Data augmentation was employed to increase generalization. The efficacy of the well-known Grad-CAM-based color visualization approach was also evaluated in this research to provide predictions with interpretability in the detection of infarction and ischemia in SPECT MPI images, counterbalancing any lack of rationale in the results extracted by the CNNs. Results: The proposed model achieved 93.3% accuracy and 94.58% AUC, demonstrating efficient performance and stability. Grad-CAM has shown to be a valuable tool for explaining CNN-based judgments in SPECT MPI images, allowing nuclear physicians to make fast and confident judgments by using the visual explanations offered. Conclusions: Prediction results indicate a robust and efficient model based on the deep learning methodology which is proposed for CAD diagnosis in nuclear medicine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/app12157592", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4288442909", "source": "openalex"}

Many physicians are not trained to look at heart disease in terms of cellular biochemistry; therefore, the challenge in any metabolic cardiology discussion is in taking the conversation from the \"bench to the bedside.\" An understanding of the vital role that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays in the heart is critical for any physician or clinician considering therapeutic options that support ATP production and turnover in jeopardized cardiac muscle cells. Metabolic therapies that help cardiomyocytes meet their absolute need for ATP fulfill a major clinical challenge of preserving pulsatile cardiac function while maintaining cell and tissue viability. D-ribose, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10 work in synergy to help the ischemic or hypoxic heart preserve its energy charge. This article introduces how ATP, diastolic heart function, and metabolic support help maintain cardiac energy by preserving ATP substrates. Part 2 will investigate an in-depth biochemical discussion of congestive heart failure with physiologic, pathophysiologic, and treatment considerations.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2149935141", "source": "openalex"}

The bidomain model is quite popular for its physiological foundation and relevance whereas the monodomain model simply is a heuristic approximation of the previous one, lacking this physiological foundation but providing computational facilities. The purpose of the present article is to numerically compare these two models using a method of (numerical) convergence analysis. This method enables to reach two different objectives of first importance in biomedical engineering. Firstly it provides the discrepancy between the models at the continuous level (and not between the discretised equations only) by getting rid of the discretisation errors. Secondly, it allows to estimate the discretisation error so providing necessary grid resolution in order to run accurate enough simulation. The comparison is held in terms of activation times, a quantity of major physiological importance. Two test cases are considered, both including enhanced cell membrane kinetic description, tissue anisotropy and realistic macroscopic tissue parameters. The first test case is based on an academic (a unit square) geometry. The second one involves a 2d cut of a segmented human heart. It has been built from 3D medical data of the two ventricles and incorporates anisotropy occurring from muscular fibre rotation around the ventricles. Two conclusions are drawn from this study. In terms of activation time relative error, the discrepancy between the two models is quite small: of order 1\\% or even below. Moreover this error is smaller than the discretisation error resulting from commonly used mesh size in biomedical engineering.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2410171871", "source": "openalex"}

This summary presents key concepts for the application of currently available instrumentation as well as future directions of nuclear cardiology. 1. Quantitative information is obtained in nuclear cardiology at the cost of high resolution imaging for two reasons: (a) the intrinsic resolution of the detecting systems is limited by available technology, and (b) the statistics required to achieve a high resolution image necessitate doses and imaging times far in excess of those which can be tolerated. Image resolution for both projection images as well as transverse sections are limited to the range of 5 to 20 mm, depending upon the configuration and instrument involved. 2. The second important concept is the fact that nuclear cardiology gives quantitative information regarding the amount of radiopharmaceutical which has accumulated in or is flowing through the cardiovascular system. This information allows one to deduce the dynamics of flow as well as actual metabolic rates. 3. The major emphasis for future work might well lie in the multiple transverse section imaging of the myocardium using both rotating and static devices. The key feature of this approach is the fact that the volume of interest can be localized and actual concentrations of radiopharmaceuticals can be measured by external detection using reconstruction tomography images. 4. Quantitative data on the distribution of a metabolite which accumulates in the myocardium is of little value if regional blood flow is not also known. 5. Finally, it is shown in this chapter that specific volume flow can be evaluated using short half-life isotopes and equations derived from the principle of conservation of mass. In principle it is now possible to obtain quantitative values delineating endo- and epicardial flow for the heart of man without invasive catheterization or high radiation doses. These procedures involve constant inhalation of carbon dioxide labeled with 15O which converts to labeled water and can be used for evaluating myocardial perfusion; bolus injection of 82Rb, a short half-life analogue of potassium, for repeated (every 5 min) imaging of the evolution of myocardial infarction size; evaluation of the accumulation of labeled fatty acids, amino acids, and sugars in the myocarium; presentation of images which reflect the magnitude of ejection fraction; and noninvasive evaluation of cardiac shunts. It is now possible to perform on the same patient during a few hours the following studies of myocardium: cation perfusion evaluation; water perfusion; uptake of fatty acids, amino acids, and glucose; oxygen utilization of the myocardium; and even measurement of the quantity of lung water. We now have the tools and methods to evaluate the in vivo biochemistry of the ischemic, 128 infarcting, repairing, and hypertrophic myocardium.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W126366819", "source": "openalex"}

However, management strategies for this group of patients have been less informed by randomized trials, which have largely focused on 'non-valvular AF' patients. Thrombo-embolic risk also varies according to valve lesion and may also be associated with CHA2DS2VASc score risk factor components, rather than only the valve disease being causal. Given marked heterogeneity in the definition of valvular and non-valvular AF and variable management strategies, including non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with VHD other than prosthetic heart valves or haemodynamically significant mitral valve disease, there is a need to provide expert recommendations for professionals participating in the care of patients presenting with AF and associated VHD.

This report summarises the data that were collected, together with the results of a survey of facilities in cardiology made in 1989. The total number of cardiologists in the United Kingdom, defined as individuals trained in the specialty and spending at least 40% of their time working in it, is now 323. Six individuals work part time only, making 320 whole time posts. This number has increased over the two years from 1988 to 1990 by 32, of which 23 work only in the specialty and nine as general physicians with a major interest in cardiology. The rate of increase in numbers over the past decade has been reasonably consistent with an average of approximately 4.4% per year. Thirty one districts in England and Wales still have no cardiologist and 13 other districts have little provision with an average of three (visiting) sessions each per week. The population in these 44 districts is 8.3 million. Scotland also has an inadequate distribution of service in the specialty. If recommendations for cardiac surgery and angioplasty made in the Fourth Report of a Joint Cardiology Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England are to be met, we calculate that we need 63 more cardiologists in our major centres. To provide one cardiologist in every district hospital and two for larger districts would require 94 more specialists, making a total shortfall of 157 individuals. We have no excess of senior registrars to provide for a major expansion at consultant level. Time spent within the senior registrar (or academic equivalent) grade has tended steadily to decline and very few now reach the end of their contracts. The need for more individuals to pass through the senior registrar grade will be met in part by a planned reduction in the training period to three years. This will be inadequate, however, because projected retirements show that the number of consultant vacancies will increase sharply from 1997. We believe that additional senior registrar posts must be created if a serious shortfall in service provision by consultants is to be avoided. The provision of non-invasive facilities in cardiology is reasonable. The need for additional equipment for invasive cardiology has not been assessed.

With the current imbroglio of health care and burden of work, some of us have been bereft of the pure joys of being a physician or caretaker in pediatric cardiology. Now imagine your future experience as a practitioner for children with heart disease in the year 2040: You are in the serene cardiac intensive care pod where real-time analytics are displayed (rather than the de rigueur vital signs) and deep learning (in the form of recurrent neural network) are now routinely used for personalized intensive care unit decision support and to mitigate the stress of families and physicians/nurses. There is no longer formal lengthy AM rounds as communication among team members is now continuous. The old electronic record and computers are all no longer omnipresent, and patient information is displayed on the video wall only upon activation or automatically in the case of sudden changes. The conversations are recorded with a tiny microphone on your shirt and analyzed with natural language processing (NLP) in order to capture key information onto the electronic record. You receive notifications about recent advances in diagnostics and therapy that pertain to your patients, and you read these new notifications and answer questions to gain points for individualized continuing medical education (as board examinations have been eliminated finally). You then go to the outpatient area. Several of your patients are triaged to be seen remotely with telepresence. A new child with heart failure is seen after the admission process is completed automatically with robotic process automation, and the echocardiogram is preliminarily read, aided by computer vision (by the use of convoluted neural network [CNN]). A precision medicine protocol is promoted by individualized therapy options, and pharmacotherapy is accompanied by the pharmacogenomic profile. A cognitive architecture based on heart failure experts from numerous centers, published reports in this disease condition, as well as the accumulated data from the entire pediatric heart failure patient cohort is utilized for best clinical decision for this child. You use augmented reality to explain the heart condition to the parents including illustration of a micro-axial device for ventricular support (as orthotropic transplantation has been supplanted by advances in miniaturized support devices and nanomedicine). The patient is then set up for wearable technology with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor her blood pressure and heart rate while she is on new medical regimen at home. For a subspecialty that is particularly rich with imaging and clinical data already, and with more sources of data to come in the very near future (especially with electrocardiogram [EKG or ECG] apps, implantable monitors, and biosensors), pediatric cardiology remains relatively dormant in this burgeoning domain of AI.[1] A comprehensive review by Johnson et al. discusses the many dimensions how AI can affect cardiology: from research to clinical practice and even population health.[2] This review also well delineated the basics of machine learning (supervised/unsupervised learning and even the abstruse concept of reinforcement learning). Another excellent and concise review by Shameer et al. focuses on the aspects of cardiovascular medicine in the context of machine learning.[3] Finally, there is an excellent review that showed how effective AI can be in the context of precision cardiovascular medicine, an aspect of cardiology that will be the cornerstone of pediatric cardiology in the near future.[4] First, there is relatively increased use of AI and data science in the domain of cardiac imaging ranging from ECG to echocardiography for both diagnosis and prognosis. The major contribution to medical image interpretation has been CNN [Figure 1]. For signal modalities, an arrhythmia detection end-to-end deep-learning strategy (accomplished with a 34-layer CNN) with a single-lead ECG (with >90,000 single-lead ECGs from over 50,000 patients with 12 rhythm disturbance categories such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia) accomplished interpretation at a cardiologist level.[5] While a prior study described work on automated quantification in echocardiography (chamber quantification for left ventricular [LV] function and assessment of valvular disease),[6] more recent works delineated how CNN was used for automated real-time standard view classification and image segmentation to improve workflow.[78] In addition, machine learning has been applied to the ever so challenging (1) heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction and helped to set up a new phenotypic risk assessment system for heart failure[9] and also (2) patients with either hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or athletes LV hypertrophy based on expert-annotated, speckle-tracking of echocardiograms.[10] One study even described using NLP for large-scale, automated, and accurate extraction of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from echocardiography reports.[11] Deep-learning algorithms have also been applied to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a prognosis prediction tool in patients with pulmonary hypertension and shown to be superior to clinicians' assessment.[12] In short, while ECGs and static images such as cardiac MRI are relatively straightforward for machine and deep learning, more complicated cardiac imaging such as echocardiograms as well as three-dimensional and four-dimensional images are also being studied with machine and deep learning. There is even a future role for hybrid imaging: combination of several modalities of imaging to maximize the advantages of each modality.[13]Figure 1: Convolutional neural network, a type of deep learning, and its many layers for medical image interpretation (courtesy of Tobias Heimann of Siemens engineering).There are also published reports of using AI for clinical decision support in various settings in both adult and pediatric cardiology. Decision-making in cardiology is often complex and is particularly vulnerable to many heuristics and biases.[14] A deep-learning algorithm (called deep learning-based early warning system [DEWS]) that used only four vital signs had a high sensitivity and a low false-positive rate for the detection of patients with cardiac arrest in a multicenter study.[15] A machine learning in the form of support vector machine devised an effective risk calculator that was shown to be superior (less-recommended drug therapy with less adverse events) to the existing accepted American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cardiovascular disease risk calculator.[16] Overall, there are relatively few reports of AI-focused publications in children and adults with congenital heart disease. An AI-assisted auscultation algorithm that performed well in a virtual clinical trial may be difficult to become a routine approach given readily available echocardiographic assessments; in short, an AI strategy for an older technology (the stethoscope) may or may not be adopted by clinicians.[17] Machine learning algorithms were deployed to train a large dataset of adults with congenital heart disease to prognosticate and to facilitate management.[1819] A similar study to the aforementioned DEWS study revealed that predictive models created by AI can lead to earlier detection of patients at risk for clinical deterioration and thereby improve care for pediatric patients in the pediatric cardiac intensive care setting.[20] In addition, four AI-based algorithms were employed to facilitate a clinical decision support system for estimating risk in congenital heart surgery.[21] One innovative report described using machine learning and system modeling to facilitate a multicentric collaborative learning project for rapid structured fact-finding and dissemination of expertise; this forward-thinking approach can provide a complement (and perhaps render less necessary to) the traditional multi-center, randomized clinical trials that are sometimes challenging to execute.[22] As cardiology is both a perceptual or image-intensive field and a cognitive or decision-making subspecialty, AI is a particularly valuable technology for cardiology with potentially very rich dividends that are vastly underexplored at present but has great promise. Given the complexity of operative and interventional procedures in pediatric cardiology, perhaps it will be decades before a robot will be performing a cardiac procedure in its entirety. Nevertheless, AI is a much-needed resource as the cardiovascular disease burden remains singularly the largest and continues to climb in an aging population worldwide. Overall, the cardiologist can be liberated from the long list of relatively mundane tasks to higher level of medical decision-making with full deployment of the various AI tools available. In the complex decision-making area, deep reinforcement learning and cognitive architecture can be particularly useful for the ever-increasingly complex nature of diagnostic and therapeutic precision cardiovascular medicine in both the intensive care (\"precision intensive care\") or hospital setting and the outpatient arena. This type of individualized medicine will need the many layers of data and information, all integrated into an AI-enabled strategy for the delivery of key information for knowledge and treatment. With more research and development, more sophisticated robotic procedures in the interventional catheterization laboratory, as well as in the operating room, will reach clinical use. The administrative aspects of a heart program can be better managed with some of the robotic process automation tools that are already available. Overall, all of these AI efforts promulgate a new paradigm in cardiovascular medicine of machine intelligence-derived phenotype profiling using multiple sources of data to eventually derive new clinical insights. It is more than 100 years since the Flexner report that shaped our present medical school education strategy. With the advent of the aforementioned emerging technologies, it is now more important than ever before to reassess our relatively banal educational and training strategy in pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery. The advent of AI (and other emerging technologies) is a precious gift from our technological colleagues and is the naissance of a special epoch in medicine. While AI is not necessarily going to replace clinicians, it should be part of every medical student's educational curriculum as well as every physician's clinical portfolio from this point forward. So is AI in pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery an irrational hype or a paradigm shift? I have had the privilege of discussing the possibility of AI in pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery for the past three decades (even named a specialized cardiology supercomputer \"Leo\" after Leonardo da Vinci, who first described a congenital heart defect as well as a coronary artery lesion in the 1500s). The more than a dozen technologies described in the aforementioned scenario are all now available; pediatric cardiology is the singularly best subspecialty to benefit the most from the portfolio of AI methodologies and emerging technologies.[23] My long-awaited arrival of AI for our field has finally arrived; we cannot passively wait for the future, but we will need to create this future paradigm shift for our younger colleagues and our beloved children and adults with heart disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/apc.apc_55_19", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2966583340", "source": "openalex"}

Close are of Close Concerns (http://www.closeconcerns.com), a healthcare information company focused exclusively on diabetes and obesity care. Close Concerns publishes Closer Look, a periodical that brings together news and insights in these areas. Each quarter, the Journal of Diabetes includes this News feature, in which Marathe, Dove, Gao, Odeh, and Close review the latest developments relevant to researchers and clinicians. The European Society of Cardiology 2016 Congress (ESC 2016) took place from 27 to 31 August 2016 in Rome, Italy, drawing a record-high 33 000 attendees. Among the highlights of the meeting were several subanalyses of the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial for Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and Boehringer Ingelheim's (Ingelheim, Germany) sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor Jardiance (empagliflozin). Dr David Fitchett (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) presented a new subanalysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results demonstrating that treatment with empagliflozin leads to a risk reduction for a variety of heart failure outcomes and a risk reduction for cardiovascular (CV) death in patients with heart failure burden. The original analysis found a 35% risk reduction in hospitalization for heart failure throughout the trial with empagliflozin treatment;1 this new analysis found that empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of a variety of other measures of heart failure, including: (i) investigator-reported heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.87); (ii) composite of hospitalization for heart failure or investigator-reported heart failure (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57–0.87); (iii) introduction of loop diuretics (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.53–0.73); and (iv) composite of hospitalization for heart failure and introduction of loop diuretics (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.54–0.73). Furthermore, empagliflozin treatment was associated with a 33% CV mortality risk reduction in patients with heart failure burden, defined as a composite of investigator-reported heart failure at baseline, hospitalization for heart failure during the trial, and investigator-reported heart failure during the trial (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47–0.97). The Kaplan–Meier curves for CV mortality in patients with heart failure burden on empagliflozin and on placebo diverged early (within 6 months) and continued to diverge throughout the trial. The CV mortality risk trended in the same direction for each of these components individually, but was not statistically significant. Empagliflozin's CV mortality benefit HR was similar in patients without heart failure burden at 0.63 (95% CI 0.48–0.84). In patients with heart failure burden, empagliflozin was associated with a 4.9% reduction in absolute mortality, compared with a 1.4% absolute mortality reduction in patients without heart failure burden and a 2.2% absolute mortality reduction overall. This finding could be attributed to the fact that patients with heart failure burden are a higher-risk group at baseline. Dr Fitchett also presented a second subanalysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOME at ESC 2016, demonstrating that CV and all-cause mortality benefits observed in the trial were consistent across all age groups and that empagliflozin treatment is safe in elderly populations. The post hoc analysis stratified trial participants into three age groups at baseline, namely those aged <65, 65–74, and ≥75 years. The analysis was adjusted for sex, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline HbA1c, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), region, and additional treatments. Data showed that the risk reduction for CV death was sustained across all age groups and remained significant. The HR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.54–0.96) for participants under 65 years of age, 0.52 (95% CI 0.37–0.79) for those aged 65–74 years, and 0.55 (95% CI 0.32–0.94) for those aged ≥75 years. The overall HR for CV death in the trial was 0.62 (95% CI 0.49–0.77). There was a slight trend towards greater risk reduction in participants aged ≥65 years, but the difference between groups was not significant (P interaction = 0.484). All-cause mortality was similarly consistent across groups, with HRs (95% CIs) for the <65, 65–74, and ≥75 years age groups of 0.72 (0.54–0.96), 0.68 (0.51–0.92), and 0.61 (0.41–0.93), respectively, compared with an HR for all participants of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57–0.82; P interaction = 0.836). Overall adverse events, urinary tract infections, volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and bone fractures were more frequent in the older age groups overall, but there was no increase in each of these adverse events in the empagliflozin-treated participants compared with placebo within any subgroup. In fact, older participants experienced a trend towards a greater reduction in acute kidney injury associated with empagliflozin treatment than those in younger age groups. All other adverse events, including hypoglycemia and genital mycotic infections, were consistent across all age and treatment groups. Continuing on with EMPA-REG OUTCOME subanalyses, Dr Pedro Monteiro (University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal) presented another post hoc analysis to demonstrate that empagliflozin's benefit on hospitalization for heart failure was consistent across all age groups. The analysis examined the effect of empagliflozin on heart failure in participants stratified into three baseline age groups, again <65, 65–74, and ≥75 years. This analysis was adjusted for sex, baseline BMI, baseline HbA1c, baseline eGFR, region, and additional treatments. The analysis found that empagliflozin was consistently safe in terms of hospitalization for heart failure, regardless of baseline age. Older participants appeared to experience a greater benefit for hospitalization for heart failure with treatment (although the difference was not significant; P interaction = 0.488) and the ≥75 years subgroup was the only subgroup in which the reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was statistically significant (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.22–0.89). Hospitalization for heart failure results trended in the right direction for the <65 and 65–74 years age groups, but the CIs crossed the line of unity (HR for 0.73 [95% CI 0.48–1.10] and 0.66 [95% CI 0.44–1.00], respectively). For comparison, hospitalization for heart failure in the overall EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial had an HR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.50–0.85). Subgroup analysis for a composite of heart failure hospitalization and CV death found similar results. The HRs (95% CIs) for the <65, 65–74, and ≥75 years age groups were 0.78 (0.59–1.03), 0.59 (0.44–0.80), and 0.52 (0.33–0.82), respectively. The overall HR for the composite of hospitalization for heart failure and CV death in the trial was 0.66 (95% CI 0.55–0.79). There was no significant difference in the results between age groups (P interaction = 0.240). The Kaplan–Meier curves for the composite of hospitalization for heart failure and CV death diverged more in older age groups. Dr Eberhard Standl (Munich Diabetes Research Center, Munich, Germany) presented data from a post hoc analysis of the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) of Merck's (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor Januvia (sitagliptin). The results suggested that non-fatal CV events and hospitalization for heart failure are associated with increased risk for subsequent severe hypoglycemic episodes. At baseline, those who experienced a severe hypoglycemic event were more likely to be older, insulin-treated, women, and non-White, and to have a longer diabetes duration, lower eGFR, and lower BMI. The new analysis focused on the 68 participants in the TECOS trial who experienced a severe hypoglycemic episode and either a major adverse cardiac event (MACE)-plus event (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI], non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina) and/or hospitalization for heart failure. Of these 68 participants, 34 experienced the severe hypoglycemic episode before the CV event and 41 experienced it after, whereas seven participants experienced it both before and after. Although the unadjusted analysis did find an association between prior severe hypoglycemic episodes and subsequent CV events (including MACE-plus [HR 1.57, P = 0.02], MACE [HR 1.71, P = 0.007], all-cause death [HR 1.91, P = 0.002], and CV death [HR 1.81, P = 0.024]), all these associations became non-significant after adjusting for the potential confounding factors of age, sex, diabetes duration, eGFR, and BMI. Conversely, the association between a prior non-fatal MI or hospitalization for heart failure and a subsequent severe hypoglycemic episode remained significant even after adjusting for the confounding factors. After adjustment, those with a prior non-fatal MI were more than twice as likely to experience a severe hypoglycemic episode (HR 2.39; 95% CI 1.64–3.47; P < 0.0001) and those with a prior hospitalization for heart failure were nearly three times as likely to experience a severe hypoglycemic episode (HR 2.80; 95% CI 1.77–4.42; P < 0.0001). Unadjusted, prior non-fatal stroke was also associated with subsequent severe hypoglycemic episodes (HR 2.74; 95% CI 1.35–5.56; P = 0.0052), but this trend became non-significant after adjusting for confounding factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-0407.12487", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2521248219", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between stage 1 hypertension, as defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and cerebral small vessel disease in a healthy population. We assessed consecutive health checkup participants without the use of antihypertensive medication between 2006 and 2013. White matter hyperintensity volumes were rated using semiautomated quantitative methods. The presence of lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces was also measured as cerebral small vessel disease lesions. We classified the blood pressure of all participants according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. A total of 2460 participants were evaluated. In adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses, stage 1 hypertension was independently associated with white matter hyperintensity volume (β=0.158; 95% CI, 0.046–0.269; P =0.006), presence of lacune (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.00–2.73; P =0.048), and deep cerebral microbleeds (adjusted odds ratio, 2.50, 95% CI, 1.08–5.79; P =0.033). Stage 2 hypertension showed higher coefficients or adjusted odds ratio values and lower P values in all analyses of white matter hyperintensity volumes, lacunes, and deep cerebral microbleeds, indicating dose-response effects across blood pressure categories.

Two hundred and nine patients (37.8% women) from a cardiology inpatient unit completed the Heart-Anxiety-Questionnaire, Progression-Anxiety-Questionnaire, Job-Anxiety-Scale and the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory. The severity of cardiac illness was rated by the treating cardiologists using the Multidimensional Severity of Morbidity Rating.

Heart anxiety was significantly related to progression anxiety and, to a lesser extent, trait anxiety and indicators of subjective symptoms of somatic illness. No association was found with medical ratings for prognosis, multimorbidity, or reduction in life expectancy. Heart-related anxiety is a symptom of an anxiety disorder.

Our study indicates that nurses had insufficient knowledge about radiation safety, and that a high percentage of nurses were concerned about the health hazards of radiation. Moreover, more than 80% of the nurses expressed an interest in attending periodic radiation safety seminars. Annual radiation protection training for hospital staff (including nurses) is important.Conclusions Our results suggest that nurses do not have sufficient knowledge of radiation safety and should receive appropriate radiation safety training.

Patients who had established care at a cardiology clinic from 2015 to 2018 reporting ≥1 average nocturnal void(s) underwent a comprehensive sodium intake interview by their cardiologist, who provided them with individualized strategies for dietary sodium reduction and assessed adherence at follow-up. Average nocturnal voiding frequency and dietary adherence were documented in the medical record. A nocturia database was compiled for retrospective analysis. A total of 74 patients were included. Patients considered to be adherent with dietary sodium restriction at follow-up (n = 56) demonstrated a decrease in median nocturia frequency (2.5 [2.3-3.0] vs 1.0 [1.0-2.0] voids, P < .001). Among nonadherent patients (n = 18), median nocturia frequency did not significantly change from baseline to follow-up (2.0 [1.5-3.8] vs 2.0 [1.5-4.8] voids, P = .423). Median changes were significantly different between the adherent and nonadherent groups (P < .001). Examination of second follow-up available from 37 patients showed a continued effect. In conclusion, adherence with dietary sodium counseling appears to improve nocturia. Accordingly, dietary modification may represent an important adjunct therapy to lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions for decreasing nocturia frequency. Reduction in nocturnal voiding frequency may also reflect an additional benefit of dietary sodium restriction in accordance with best practice standards for cardiovascular disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.13829", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3006093885", "source": "openalex"}

Moreover, aortic stenosis commonly exists in combination with other conditions causing so many patients suffer from the most general and fundamentally challenging condition: complex valvular, ventricular and vascular disease (C3VD). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a new less invasive intervention and is a growing alternative for patients with aortic stenosis. Although blood flow quantification is critical for accurate and early diagnosis of C3VD in both pre and post-TAVR, proper diagnostic methods are still lacking because the fluid-dynamics methods that can be used as engines of new diagnostic tools are not well developed yet. Despite remarkable advances in medical imaging, imaging on its own is not enough to quantify the blood flow effectively. Moreover, understanding of C3VD in both pre and post-TAVR and its progression has been hindered by the absence of a proper non-invasive tool for the assessment of the cardiovascular function. To enable the development of new non-invasive diagnostic methods, we developed an innovative image-based patient-specific computational fluid dynamics framework for patients with C3VD who undergo TAVR to quantify metrics of: (1) global circulatory function; (2) global cardiac function as well as (3) local cardiac fluid dynamics. This framework is based on an innovative non-invasive Doppler-based patient-specific lumped-parameter algorithm and a 3-D strongly-coupled fluid-solid interaction. We validated the framework against clinical cardiac catheterization and Doppler echocardiographic measurements and demonstrated its diagnostic utility by providing novel analyses and interpretations of clinical data in eleven C3VD patients in pre and post-TAVR status. Our findings position this framework as a promising new non-invasive diagnostic tool that can provide blood flow metrics while posing no risk to the patient. The diagnostic information, that the framework can provide, is vitally needed to improve clinical outcomes, to assess patient risk and to plan treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85500-2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3164752200", "source": "openalex"}

The authors hypothesized that angina among outpatients with CAD managed by US cardiologists is low and its prevalence varies by site. Among 25 US outpatient cardiology clinics enrolled in the American College of Cardiology Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) registry, we prospectively recruited a consecutive sample of patients with chronic CAD over a 1‐ to 2‐week period at each site between April 2013 and July 2015, irrespective of the reason for their appointment. Eligible patients had documented history of CAD (prior acute coronary syndrome, prior coronary revascularization procedure, or diagnosis of stable angina) and ≥1 prior office visit at the practice site. Angina was assessed directly from patients using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency score. Among 1257 patients from 25 sites, 7.6% (n = 96) reported daily/weekly, 25.1% (n = 315) monthly, and 67.3% (n = 846) no angina. The proportion of patients with daily/weekly angina at each site ranged from 2.0% to 24.0%, but just over half (56.3%) were on ≥2 antianginal medications, with wide variability across sites (0%–100%). One‐third of outpatients with chronic CAD managed by cardiologists report having angina in the prior month, and 7.6% have frequent symptoms. Among those with frequent angina, just over half were on ≥2 antianginal medications, with wide variability across sites. These findings suggest an opportunity to improve symptom control.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.22628", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2550573619", "source": "openalex"}

Twenty‐five patients had angioscopy performed in conjunction with PTCA, including 20 patients with de novo lesions (16 patients with unstable angina, four patients with stable angina), and five patients with restenosis lesions. Ten cardiac transplant patients had angioscopy performed in conjunction with annual follow‐up angiography in an attempt to identify accelerated atherosclerotic lesions. There were no complications of angioscopy in any patient. There were no intracoronary thrombi seen either by angiography or angioscopy in the stable angina patients. In the unstable angina group, angiography identified thrombus in 2 out of 16 (12.5%) versus 15 out of 16 (94%) (P &lt; 0.001) with angioscopy. Following angioplasty, dissections were seen angiographically in 7 out of 16 (44%) of patients versus 16 of 16 (100%) of the patients by angioscopy (P &lt; 0.01). Restenosis lesions were characterized by a white, fibrous appearance instead of the usual yellow color of primary atherosclerotic lesions. In the ten cardiac transplant patients, angioscopy appeared to be more sensitive than angiography for the detection of atherosclerosis. Yellow (atherosclerotic) and white (fibrotic) plaques were seen in the transplant patients, which often were not detected by angiography. In summary, angioscopy is an excellent tool for visualizing the surface morphology of coronary artery lesions. The clinical indications for angioscopy remain undefined at present. Possible applications for angioscopy include intracoronary thrombolytic therapy, stratification of high risk angiographic results after angioplasty (“hazy” artery), and, finally, as an adjunct to interventional procedures such as stem implantation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-8183.1993.tb00442.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2051260638", "source": "openalex"}

Characterising the referral pattern to a national centre’s cardiology specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs) and the diagnostic outcomes may be useful in formulating referral guidelines to contain rising demand. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational follow-up study was conducted of all consecutive new patient referrals to the cardiology SOCs of the National Heart Centre over a 1-month period. The records of these 1224 patients were reviewed following their first visit and again after 3 months of evaluation and investigation. Patients’ demographics, referral sources, indications of referral, risk factors, provisional and final diagnoses were collected. Referrals from the top 2 volume sources (government polyclinics and hospital Emergency Department) accounted for 600 referrals. These subsidised referrals formed the study group for analysis. Results: The mean age of referred patients was 56 ± 15.2 years, with equal proportion of males and females. Most patients had known cardiac risk factors of hypertension (53.2%) and hyperlipidaemia (42.3%). Only 23% of referrals had significant cardiac abnormalities. Referrals for typical chest pain derived the highest yield whereas referrals for atypical chest pain, non-cardiac chest pain derived the lowest yield. Referrals for asymptomatic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (except for atrial flutter/fibrillation) did not yield cardiac abnormalities. Multivariate analysis of chest pain referrals showed typical chest pain and hyperlipidaemia to be statistically significant predictors for coronary artery disease. Conclusion: Referrals to cardiology outpatient specialist clinics should be based on the presence of patient symptoms, particularly that of typical chest pain. In asymptomatic patients, routine ECG screening did not appear to yield significant cardiac abnormalities.

With regard to the first questionnaire, statistically significant data concern behavioral medicine and cardiology. In the first area the owner’s worry decreases during the follow-up and the number of owners who would give away the animal increases. In cardiology, owners who think that the pathology harms their animal’s quality of life decreased significantly over time. With regard to the 9 additional follow-up questions, in behavioural medicine and urology the owner’s discomfort resulting from the animal’s pathology significantly decreases over time.

The experience of a tertiary centre for paediatric cardiology", "text": "Abstract Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in the paediatric population and an important cause of heart transplantation in children. The clinical profile and course of dilated cardiomyopathy in children have been poorly characterised. A retrospective review of 61 patients (37 female; 24 male) diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy from January, 2005 to June, 2012 at a single institution was performed. The median age at diagnosis was 15 months. Heart failure was present in 83.6% of patients and 44.3% required intensive care. The most prevalent causes were idiopathic (47.5%), viral myocarditis (18.0%) and inherited metabolic diseases (11.5%). In viral myocarditis, Parvovirus B19 was the most common identified agent, in concurrence with the increasing incidence documented recently. Inherited metabolic diseases were responsible for 11.5% of dilated cardiomyopathy cases compared with the 4–6% described in the literature, which reinforces the importance of considering this aetiology in differential diagnosis of paediatric dilated cardiomyopathy. The overall mortality rate was 16.1% and five patients underwent heart transplantation. In our series, age at diagnosis and aetiology were the most important prognosis factors. We report no mortality in the five patients who underwent heart transplantation, after 2 years of follow-up.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951113002369", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999294585", "source": "openalex"}

Originally published6 Apr 2017https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.117.005273Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions. 2017;10:e005273The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today's work superbly well.—William OslerThe last decade has witnessed several groundbreaking innovations in medical and interventional therapies for cardiovascular diseases.1 The field of interventional cardiology, which began with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the 1980s with no formal training programs, now encompasses coronary stent technology with various platforms—metallic scaffolds, bioresorbable polymers, and bioabsorbable vascular scaffolds and percutaneous treatment of complex chronic total occlusions. Furthermore, the field of interventional cardiology has expanded to include peripheral vascular interventions, involving superficial femoral, iliac, and renal artery interventions, to the more complex carotid, subclavian, below-the-knee interventions and endovascular repair of abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. The interventional subspecialty that has exploded and caught the attention of many over the past 5 years is the field of structural heart interventions. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which is now the standard therapy for patients with intermediate- and high-risk aortic stenosis, has been recognized among the top 10 innovations of the decade.2,3 Currently, TAVR is growing at a rate of >16% per year, and further growth is expected as new valves become available for widening indications. If TAVR is shown to be as effective as surgical aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, the volume of cases is expected to significantly increase rapidly. In addition, percutaneous mitral and several tricuspid valve therapies are on the horizon that are expected to expand the gamut of structural heart procedures.4 Similar growth is expected in peripheral vascular interventions. Estimates are that endovascular procedures are growing at a rate of 6% to 8% per year, in part because of earlier identification of the disease, and a shift away from surgery toward interventions. In tandem, venous interventions are also expanding.5 These trends support the expansion of the training programs to adjust to the future demands of interventional cardiology.With all these advances, there are several questions that arise. How long should the interventional cardiology training be? In how many areas should a trainee be expected to be proficient in after completion of training? What should be the curricula for advanced training in coronary, peripheral, or structural heart interventions? Should the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredit the subspecialty tracks within interventional cardiology training or should the duration of training increase to accommodate the need to learn all aspects of interventional cardiology?6–8 In accordance with the current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements, it takes ≤7 to 8 years after medical school completion to become an interventional cardiologist (Figure 1). Although the duration of training seems exhaustive, there may be a few stages that seem redundant. One of the recent welcome initiatives by the American Board of Internal Medicine involves a combined internal medicine/general cardiology fellowship program of 5 years' duration.9 Another alternative is to short track both internal medicine and cardiology postgraduate medical education and training programs to 2 years each for fellows to allow at least 2 years of intensive, focused training in all aspects of interventional cardiology, with the goal of providing training that is relevant to the practice of interventional cardiology.Download figureDownload PowerPointFigure 1. Current pathway of training in interventional cardiology.Although the duration of training still remains controversial, the scope of advanced interventional training is not well defined. The Core Cardiology Training Statement 4 requires 250 coronary interventions and 50 peripheral interventions for level II training, with a lack of similar standards set for advanced training in complex coronary, peripheral, and structural heart interventions.10 These fields have now grown substantially to an extent that requires immediate attention by professional societies.The field of structural heart disease interventions, in particular, has multiple facets associated with it. It not only requires proficiency in outpatient evaluation of these really complex, elderly patients with valvular heart disease, but also involves correlating them with imaging findings on transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiograms and cardiac computed tomographic scans to determine the final treatment plan for each individual patient. Furthermore, managing inpatient consultations, as well as postprocedural follow-up care of these patients, is equally crucial.11 In terms of structural procedures, apart from TAVR, exposure to several other procedures, such as MitraClip (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), left atrial appendage occlusion devices, paravalvular leak closure, atrial septal defect/patent foramen ovale closure, and interventions for tricuspid and pulmonic valves, is needed. How many hands-on TAVR procedures are sufficient? How many other hands-on structural heart interventional procedures should a trainee be exposed to in order to be identified as a structural heart interventionalist? Should there be a prerequisite level of training in adult echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography for fulfilling the eligibility requirements for a structural heart interventional fellowship?12,13 And finally, given the burgeoning structural heart field, should there be levels of training (levels I, II, and III) for every interventional trainee? Answers to all these questions are critical now, and a dedicated curriculum that standardizes all these components is quintessential as programs in the United States offering structural heart fellowship training are growing expeditiously.A recent consensus statement by leaders in the field has proposed 1 of the 2 approaches for training of the next-generation interventionalists.7 One of these involves training a super interventionalist in his/her second year of training (after basic coronary interventional training), where he/she will be trained in advanced coronary, peripheral, and structural procedures in 1 additional year. However, as aptly described in their article, although this approach sounds attractive, it might be difficult to be proficient in all of the above in 1 additional year, and second, after training, it may be questionable whether the volume of procedures would be sufficient enough to maintain skill sets in all of the aforementioned interventional subspecialties. Also, not all programs may have the volume to provide such training. A second, more putative approach might be to train the fellow in 1 or 2 of the 3 subspecialties after basic coronary interventional training—advanced coronary and advanced peripheral and structural heart interventions (Figure 2). This approach might achieve a fair balance of achieving interventional skills and acquiring the necessary consultative and imaging skills required for advanced training in each specific subset. With pros and cons of both the above approaches, it is extremely crucial to develop a training curriculum that would not only enrich training, but also allow fellows to complete it in a reasonable duration.Download figureDownload PowerPointFigure 2. Proposed pathway of training in interventional cardiology.We urge the professional societies (eg, American College of Cardiology and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions) to convene an expert panel to make recommendations to modify the current training programs so that Core Cardiology Training Statement recommendations can be changed, and the American Board of Internal Medicine and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education can accommodate the changes in the board examinations and program structure. We feel that a more comprehensive training makes most sense because it will better reflect the changing practice of interventional cardiology. This important change will allow programs to become more flexible without constraints intrinsic to a 1-year program. Fellows will naturally gravitate to the areas of most interest and can gain strong skills in ≥1 areas if desired.In conclusion, training in interventional cardiology is undergoing a major metamorphosis. With advancements and growth in complex coronary, peripheral, and structural interventions, we need a more comprehensive approach toward duration, type, and quality of future training during interventional cardiology fellowship.DisclosuresNone.FootnotesThe opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the American Heart Association.Correspondence to David P.

This review will discuss new discoveries in genomics and pharmacogenomics in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and the application towards the development of new diagnostics, disease risk predictions, and optimizing response to drugs and surgery. Recent findings Recent advances have identified common and rare variants associated with complex CHD using next-generation sequencing and genotyping technology. Next-generation sequencing is now being used not only for clinical genetic testing but also for noninvasive prenatal testing of fetal DNA in maternal serum to diagnose genetic conditions like fetal aneuploidies as early as the first trimester. This approach is not only more accurate but also safer than invasive maternal screening tests. This technology may also help in noninvasive diagnosis of transplant rejection. As genetic variations that influence the response to surgery in CHD are identified, this can guide decision-making surrounding optimum type and timing of surgery. Drug choice and dosing are being increasingly influenced by knowledge of pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic variations. Age-related and maturation-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics make it crucial to perform pediatric-targeted pharmacogenetic studies to enable the incorporation of age into genotype-guided drug dosing algorithms. Summary Rapid genomic and pharmacogenomic discovery are guiding the development of more sensitive screening and diagnostic tests for CHD as well as development of safer and more effective drugs. This needs to be paralleled by the development of strategies to support rapid translation of emerging genomic knowledge to patient care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0b013e328357a4ea", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2315521739", "source": "openalex"}

A position paper from the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and the Working Group on Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)", "text": "Genetic cardiomyopathies are disorders of the cardiac muscle, most often explained by pathogenic mutations in genes encoding sarcomere, cytoskeleton, or ion channel proteins. Clinical phenotypes such as heart failure and arrhythmia are classically treated with generic drugs, but aetiology-specific and targeted treatments are lacking. As a result, cardiomyopathies still present a major burden to society, and affect many young and older patients. The Translational Committee of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and the Working Group of Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) organized a workshop to discuss recent advances in molecular and physiological studies of various forms of cardiomyopathies. The study of cardiomyopathies has intensified after several new study setups became available, such as induced pluripotent stem cells, three-dimensional printing of cells, use of scaffolds and engineered heart tissue, with convincing human validation studies. Furthermore, our knowledge on the consequences of mutated proteins has deepened, with relevance for cellular homeostasis, protein quality control and toxicity, often specific to particular cardiomyopathies, with precise effects explaining the aberrations. This has opened up new avenues to treat cardiomyopathies, using contemporary techniques from the molecular toolbox, such as gene editing and repair using CRISPR-Cas9 techniques, antisense therapies, novel designer drugs, and RNA therapies. In this article, we discuss the connection between biology and diverse clinical presentation, as well as promising new medications and therapeutic avenues, which may be instrumental to come to precision medicine of genetic cardiomyopathies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2414", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4205958596", "source": "openalex"}

Control of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation by selective vagal stimulation, suppression of ischemia-related ventricular fibrillation by vagal stimulation, and reproduction of neurally commanded heart rate are some examples of bionic treatment for arrhythmia. Implantable radio-frequency-coupled on-demand carotid sinus stimulators succeeded in interrupting or preventing anginal attacks but were replaced later by coronary revascularization. Similar but fixed-intensity carotid sinus stimulators were used for hypertension but were also replaced by drugs.

Closed-loop spinal cord stimulation has successfully treated severe orthostatic hypotension in a limited number of patients. Vagal nerve stimulation is effective in treating heart failure in animals, and a small-size clinical trial has just started. Simultaneous corrections of multiple hemodynamic abnormalities in an acute decompensated state are accomplished simply by quantifying fundamental cardiovascular parameters and controlling these parameters.

We investigated whether a single auscultation training class using a cardiology patient simulator for medical students provides competence required for clinical clerkship, and whether students' proficiency after the training differs among heart sounds and murmurs.A total of 324 fourth-year medical students (93-117/year for 3 years) were divided into groups of 6-8 students; each group participated in a three-hour training session using a cardiology patient simulator. After a mini-lecture and facilitated training, each student took two different tests. In the first test, they tried to identify three sounds of Category A (non-split, respiratory split, and abnormally wide split S2s) in random order, after being informed that they were from Category A. They then did the same with sounds of Category B (S3, S4, and S3+S4) and Category C (four heart murmurs). In the second test, they tried to identify only one from each of the three categories in random order without any category information.The overall accuracy rate declined from 80.4% in the first test to 62.0% in the second test (p<0.0001). The accuracy rate of all the heart murmurs was similar in the first (81.3%) and second tests (77.5%).

Setting Two cardiac care units of the University Hospitals Leuven. Participants One hundred and fifty‐one intervention and 158 control patients aged 75 years or older admitted for acute cardiovascular disease or transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Intervention A nurse from the geriatrics department performed a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 24 h of admission. The cardiac care team and geriatrics nurse drafted an interdisciplinary care plan, focusing on early rehabilitation, discharge planning, promoting physical activity, and preventing geriatric syndromes. The geriatrics nurse provided daily follow‐up and coached the cardiac team. A geriatrician co‐managed patients with complications. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was functional status measured using the Katz Index for independence in activities of daily living (ADL; one‐point difference was considered clinically relevant). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of ADL decline and complications, length of stay, unplanned readmissions, survival, and quality of life. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 85 years. Intervention patients had better functional status at hospital discharge (8.9, 95% CI = 8.7–9.3 versus 9.5, 95% CI = 9.2–9.9; p = 0.019) and experienced 18% less functional decline during hospitalization (25% vs. 43%, p = 0.006). The intervention group experienced significantly fewer cases of delirium and obstipation during hospitalization, and significantly fewer nosocomial infections.

DESCRIPTION: Six areas of evidence-based cardiac medicine are addressed in this book: risk factors for coronary artery disease; coronary invasive studies; unstable angina/non-Q wave myocardial infarction; acute myocardial infarction; congestive heart failure; and ventricular arrhythmias. PURPOSE: The purpose is to summarize current data from many clinical trials in the six major areas of cardiovascular medicine in an easy to access fashion. These are worthy objectives since the data are accumulating at such a rapid rate – frequent reviews and updates are mandatory. AUDIENCE: The text is directed toward general cardiologists but internal medicine physicians, and residents, fellows, and students would find it worthwhile. This is simply because it would allow them to focus on more pertinent reference materials. ASSESSMENT: I think this is a worthwhile addition to the cardiac literature. The shortcoming of these texts is that they quickly become outdated because of the large number of clinical trials both ongoing and completed on a yearly basis. A comparable text published in 1999 was Kloner’s Cardiovascular Trials Review, 4th Edition (LeJacq Communications, 1999). Kloner’s text represents nine years of trials comparing management and disease categories. The large text in this area is by Yusuf, Evidence Based Cardiology (BMJ Publishing Group, 1998). Yusuf’s text is a large book in which individual expertise is mixed with the best research evidence available. The pocket size text has an appeal to it.

In addition, over the last 5 years we have witnessed a shift towards the use of physiology to enhance procedural planning, assess post-PCI functional results, and guide PCI optimisation. In this regard, clinical studies have reported compelling data supporting the use of longitudinal vessel analysis, obtained with pressure guidewire pullbacks, to better understand how obstructive CAD contributes to myocardial ischaemia, to establish the likelihood of functionally successful PCI, to identify the presence and location of residual flow-limiting stenoses and to predict long-term outcomes. The introduction of new functional coronary angiography tools, which merge angiographic information with fluid dynamic equations to deliver information equivalent to intracoronary pressure measurements, are now available and potentially also applicable to these endeavours. Furthermore, the ability of longitudinal vessel analysis to predict the functional results of stenting has played an integral role in the evolving field of simulated PCI. Nevertheless, it is important to have an awareness of the value and challenges of physiology-guided PCI in specific clinical and anatomical contexts. The main aim of this European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions clinical consensus statement is to offer up-to-date evidence and expert opinion on the use of applied coronary physiology for procedural PCI planning, disease pattern recognition and post-PCI optimisation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4244/eij-d-23-00194", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4376225633", "source": "openalex"}

We devised criterions for selection to determine which peripheral centres would be linked by telemedicine to the university-based services for paediatric cardiology provided in the Canadian Province of Quebec. The criterions included: distance from a university centre, number of births per year, and presence of an already-established outreach clinic for paediatric cardiology. The Quebec Network became operational in 2000, and was composed of 32 peripheral centres and 4 university centres. A total of 363 transmissions of echocardiograms occurred over a 3-year period from January 2000 to December 2002. Peripheral centres located at a distance greater than 100 kilometres from a university centre were 8.5 times more likely to use the network. Criterions other than distance did not influence whether or not a peripheral centre used the network. Cardiac abnormalities were identified in almost two-thirds of the transmissions. The use of the Quebec Network resulted in the avoidance of transfers or clinic visits to university hospitals in seven-tenths of cases. We conclude that distance greater than 100 kilometres from a centre offering subspecialty services in paediatric cardiology is the most important criterion for choosing the peripheral centres that are most likely to use a telehealth network. In its first three years of operation, the telehealth network had a major impact on the delivery of paediatric cardiac care, improving access to subspecialty services across the province.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951104006055", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130743401", "source": "openalex"}

Before 1981, most studies on diastolic function were performed in the catheter laboratory using invasive techniques and complex methods. Recently, radionuclide angiograms and Doppler echocardiography have been employed to measure the dynamics of filling In normal individuals and in patients with heart disease. These methods are noninvasive, easy to perform, accurate, and reproducible. It is now clear that diastolic function may be altered globally and regionally, at rest and perhaps during exercise, in many patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, these diastolic abnormalities may even appear before systolic abnormalities are identified in these patients. Thus, diastolic abnormalities may permit assessment of presence of disease early In its evolution. Whether detection and quantitation of diastolic abnormalities will permit grading of disease severity or evaluation of therapeutic efficacy remains an important research question. At the present time, it appears that the decision to employ either radionuclide angiography or Doppler echocardiography for the assessment of diastolic abnormalities will depend on the local expertise to carry out the investigation. Both diagnostic modalities require standardization of accuracy and reproducibility with proper selection of control values from the appropriate populations of normal individuals. It is also Important to remember that left ventricular diastolic abnormalities have to be identified after the elimination of the confounding influence of variables such as ejection fraction, heart rate, age, and preload (end-diastolic volume). Automation of the derivation of indexes of diastolic filling should provide an objective assessment of the dynamics of left ventricular filling. Although the value of measurement of diastolic filling in the individual patient remains controversial, we believe that the practice of cardiology is incomplete without consideration of the second half of cardiac function.

Cardiovascular clinician and trainee knowledge and comfort with this topic, and the extent of implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to cardio-obstetrics, are unknown. Methods and Results We aimed to assess the current state of cardio-obstetrics knowledge, practices, and services provided by US cardiovascular clinicians and trainees. A survey developed in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology was circulated to a representative sample of cardiologists (N=311), cardiovascular team members (N=51), and fellows in training (N=139) from June 18, 2020, to July 29, 2020. Knowledge and attitudes about the provision of cardiovascular care to pregnant patients and the prevalence and composition of cardio-obstetrics teams were assessed. The widest knowledge gaps on the care of pregnant compared with nonpregnant patients were reported for medication safety (42%), acute coronary syndromes (39%), aortopathies (40%), and valvular heart disease (30%). Most respondents (76%) lack access to a dedicated cardio-obstetrics team, and only 29% of practicing cardiologists received cardio-obstetrics didactics during training. One third of fellows in training reported seeing pregnant women 0 to 1 time per year, and 12% of fellows in training report formal training in cardio-obstetrics. Conclusions Formalized training in cardio-obstetrics is uncommon, and limited access to multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics teams and large knowledge gaps exist among cardiovascular clinicians. Augmentation of cardio-obstetrics education across career stages is needed to reduce these deficits. These survey results are an initial step toward developing a standard expectation for clinicians' training in cardio-obstetrics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.121.024229", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4225983373", "source": "openalex"}

Due to the results of the latest studies, however, the radial approach has become increasingly popular. The aim of this study was a safety analysis of cardiological interventional procedures (i.e., coronarography and PCI) according to the vessel approach. Material andMethods:The 204 coronary interventions done in our Department of Interventional Cardiology were retrospectively analyzed. All the procedures were classified according to femoral or radial access. The incidence of local complications (e.g., major bleedings and hematomas) was assessed as well as the volume of contrast agent administered during the procedure and the radiation dose. Results:It has been shown that radial approach, which is obviously more comfortable for patients, reduces the risk of local complications (0 vs. 2.97% and 0 vs. 3.96%) and does not lead to increased radiation exposure (p=0.88). However, there could be a larger volume of contrast agent administered (p=0.029), which in some cases could increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Conclusions:The radial approach should be recommended as a first choice because it is safer than the classical femoral approach, but one must be cautious in choosing radial approach patients with renal insufficiency.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.893193", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1914841783", "source": "openalex"}

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of radiation cataractogenesis in the interventionists and staff performing various procedures in different interventional laboratories. Patients and Methods: This cohort study included 81 interventional cardiology staff. According to the working site, they were classified into 5 groups. The control group comprised 14 professional nurses who did not work in the interventional sites. Participants were assigned for lens assessment by two independent trained ophthalmologists blinded to the study. Results: The electrophysiology laboratory staff received higher doses of ionizing radiation (17.2 ± 11.9 mSv; P < 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between the years of working experience and effective dose in the lens (P < 0.001). In general, our findings showed that the incidence of lens opacity was 79% (95% CI, 69.9-88.1) in participants with exposure (the case group) and our findings showed that the incidence of lenses opacity was 7.1% (95% CI:23-22.6) with the relative risk (RR) of 11.06 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We believe that the risk of radiation-induced cataract in cardiology interventionists and staff depends on their work site.

Since a considerable number of patients with chest pain, however, have a non cardiac etiology of their pain, properly triaging these patients represents a diagnostic challenge for physicians in the emergency department. As the available diagnostic procedures have limited accuracy, many different diagnostic strategies have been evaluated. Among these, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) at rest or in combination with stress procedures has been investigated in many trials. MPI has been proven to be useful, especially in a patient population with a low to intermediate probability of an ischemic event. Perfusion scintigraphy has a high sensitivity in the detection of myocardial infarction and reveals an excellent negative predictive value, allowing a safe discharge strategy of patients with a negative scan result. Moreover, it enables risk stratification and provides incremental and independent prognostic information regarding short to long term future cardiac adverse events. Several cost effectiveness studies have shown that perfusion imaging leads to lower overall direct costs, mainly by a reduction of unnecessary hospital admissions and diagnostic angiograms, without worsening of the clinical outcome of these patients. As a possible study endpoint, myocardial perfusion imaging in the acute setting enables the quantification of salvaged myocardium and therefore the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Besides perfusion agents, several infarct avid radiopharmaceuticals have been developed, which in part show promising results. However, larger randomized trials evaluating these tracers in clinical settings are needed to warrant routine clinical application.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2474870358", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in consecutive patients referred to perform an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for diagnosis or therapeutic purposes. Office BP measurements and ABPM were performed in the same visit. The cohort was divided according to office BP in optimal, normal, high-normal and hypertension. The prevalence and adjusted risk for combined daytime and nocturnal hypertension and INH were estimated for each category. Results: We evaluated 1344 individuals, 59.3% women (51 ± 14 years old) and 40.7% men (52 ± 15 years old). 61.5% of the individuals had nocturnal hypertension, 12.9% INH and 48.7% combined daytime and nocturnal hypertension. Prevalence of combined daytime and nocturnal hypertension increased through office BP categories ( P &lt; 0.001). Conversely, prevalence of INH was lower in individuals with hypertension than in normotensives (7.4 vs. 17.2%, P &lt; 0.001) and similar between nonhypertensive office BP categories, 16.6, 15 and 19.4% for optimal, normal and high-normal BP, respectively ( P &lt; 0.399).

Results from pre-clinical research are promising and raise the question of whether cure of some subtypes of HCM may be possible in the future. This review provides an overview of current genetic therapy platforms including 1) genome editing 2) gene replacement 3) allelic-specific silencing and 4) signalling pathway modulation. The current applicability of each of these platforms within the paradigm of HCM is examined, with an update on current and emerging trials in each domain provided. Barriers and limitations within the current landscape are also highlighted. Despite recent advances, translation of genetic therapy for HCM to clinical practice is still in early development.

Yesterday's relatively crude procedures have been replaced by safe and more effective techniques. Improvements and new developments in specifically designed paediatric equipment have played a significant role. In order to meet the cardiologist's drive to refine existing techniques and develop new ones, further investment into paediatric cardiac catheterization equipment is mandatory. More and more \"heart operations' will be performed in cardiac catheterization laboratories in the future, and this will have clear implications on costs, as most non-surgical techniques are cheaper than surgery, and hospitalization is much shorter. New methods, tested within research protocols in specialized centres, combined with continuous critical evaluation of established techniques will ensure improved and sustained results. The primary consideration of practising paediatric cardiologists should not be whether it is possible to perform such techniques, but whether their clinical utility, morbidity and mortality justifies a non-surgical approach for their centre. Interventional catheterization, in other words has to \"compete' with the results of surgery prior to new techniques being recommended for general use. Despite this \"competition' it has been welcome to see a collaboration between paediatric cardiologists and paediatric cardiac surgeons in planning staged repairs of complex congenital heart disease. A typical example of this is the fenestrated Fontan procedure, in which the immediate post-operative course has dramatically improved due to the deliberate placement of a residual atrial shunt, which is then closed with an umbrella in the catheter laboratory. This type of cooperation is bound to increase further and is already contributing to a far better outcome for many of the complex congenital heart lesions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a060826", "url": "https://openalex.org/W165074655", "source": "openalex"}

Metabolic remodeling plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF). Changes in metabolic pathways such as substrate preference, high-energy phosphate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, are involved in pathological structural remodeling and functional impairment. These metabolic alterations are usually not restricted in the cardiac tissue, but also manifest in circulation. In clinical practice, blood sample is routinely used for HF screening. Metabolomics is an emerging omics technology that provides an efficient way to acquire dynamic metabolic profiles in circulation. An increasing number of metabolic biomarkers have been implicated in disease progression, making it possible to fight HF in a more effective and precise way. This review summarizes the modern analytical techniques in metabolomics as well as emerging circulating metabolites during the pathogenesis of HF, aiming to provide new insights into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HF in the era of precision medicine.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbad005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4324130936", "source": "openalex"}

Methods— Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council’s Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the AHA’s Manuscript Oversight Committee. The panel reviewed relevant articles on adults using computerized searches of the medical literature through 2014. The evidence is organized within the context of the AHA framework and is classified according to the joint AHA/American College of Cardiology and supplementary AHA methods of classifying the level of certainty and the class and level of evidence. The document underwent extensive AHA internal and external peer review, Stroke Council Leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. Results— Stroke rehabilitation requires a sustained and coordinated effort from a large team, including the patient and his or her goals, family and friends, other caregivers (eg, personal care attendants), physicians, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, recreation therapists, psychologists, nutritionists, social workers, and others. Communication and coordination among these team members are paramount in maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation and underlie this entire guideline. Without communication and coordination, isolated efforts to rehabilitate the stroke survivor are unlikely to achieve their full potential. Conclusions— As systems of care evolve in response to healthcare reform efforts, postacute care and rehabilitation are often considered a costly area of care to be trimmed but without recognition of their clinical impact and ability to reduce the risk of downstream medical morbidity resulting from immobility, depression, loss of autonomy, and reduced functional independence. The provision of comprehensive rehabilitation programs with adequate resources, dose, and duration is an essential aspect of stroke care and should be a priority in these redesign efforts.

They support informed treatment decisions about the initiation or adjustment of preventive medication. Risk prediction tools facilitate risk communication to the patient and their family, and this may increase commitment and motivation to improve their health. Over the years many risk algorithms have been developed to predict 10-year cardiovascular mortality or lifetime risk in different populations, such as in healthy individuals, patients with established cardiovascular disease and patients with diabetes mellitus. Each risk algorithm has its own limitations, so different algorithms should be used in different patient populations. Risk algorithms are made available for use in clinical practice by means of - usually interactive and online available - tools. To help the clinician to choose the right tool for the right patient, a summary of available tools is provided. When choosing a tool, physicians should consider medical history, geographical region, clinical guidelines and additional risk measures among other things.

While AI-driven advancements have demonstrated promise, their real-world implementation remains constrained by critical challenges. Current AI applications, such as electrocardiogram interpretation and automated imaging analysis, have improved diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency, yet generalizability, regulatory hurdles, and integration into existing clinical workflows remain major obstacles. Algorithmic bias and the lack of explainable AI further complicate widespread adoption, potentially leading to disparities in healthcare outcomes. In interventional cardiology, robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention has emerged as a technological innovation, but comparative clinical evidence supporting its superiority (or even non-inferiority) over conventional approaches is still limited. Additionally, AI-based decision support systems in high-risk cardiovascular procedures require rigorous validation to ensure safety and reliability. Ethical considerations, including patient data security and region-specific regulatory frameworks, also pose significant barriers. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, robust external validation, and the development of transparent, interpretable AI models.

The idea was that of Jane Somerville, who worked with enormous energy and enthusiasm to bring together paediatric cardiologists and surgeons from around the world. The 2nd World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology took place in New York in 1985, organised by Bill Rashkind, Mary Ellen Engle, and Eugene Doyle. The 3rd World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1989, organised by Chompol Vongraprateep. Although cardiac surgeons were heavily involved in these early meetings, a separate World Congress of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery was held in Bergamo, Italy, in 1988, organised by Lucio Parenzan. Thereafter, it was recognised that surgeons and cardiologists working on the same problems and driven by a desire to help children should really rather meet together. A momentous decision was taken to initiate a Joint World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery. A steering committee was established with membership comprising the main organisers of the four separate previous Congresses, and additional members were recruited in an effort to achieve numerical equality of cardiologists and surgeons and a broad geographical representation. The historic 1st “World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery” took place in Paris in June, 1993, organised by Jean Kachaner. The next was to be held in Japan, but the catastrophic Kobe earthquake in 1995 forced relocation to Hawaii in 1997. Then followed Toronto, Canada (2001, organised by Bill Williams and Lee Benson), Buenos Aires, Argentina (2005, organised by Horatio Capelli and Guillermo Kreutzer), and most recently Cairns, Australia (2009, organised by Jim Wilkinson). Having visited Europe (1993), Asia-Pacific (1997), North America (2001), South America (2005), and Australia (2009), and reflecting the “African Renaissance”, the World Congress is coming to Africa. The 6th World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery will be held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 17 to 22 February, 2013.

In the American population, diet remains the biggest uncontrolled risk factor for cardiovascular disease.This study aimed to test the hypothesis that asynchronous dietary counseling supplied through a custom smartphone app results in better adherence to a Mediterranean diet in a non-Mediterranean population than traditional standard-of-care (SOC) counseling.In total, 100 patients presenting to the cardiology clinic of an academic medical center were randomized to either the SOC or smartphone app-based experimental (EXP) Mediterranean diet intervention after informed consent and 1 hour of individual face-to-face dietary counseling with a registered dietitian. Participants in EXP received a custom smartphone app that reinforced the Mediterranean diet, whereas participants in SOC received 2 additional sessions of in-person dietary counseling with the registered dietitian-30 min at 1 month and 30 min at 3 months. Preexisting knowledge of a Mediterranean diet was measured by the validated Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) instrument. Baseline height, weight, blood pressure (BP), and laboratory biomarkers were collected. At 1, 3, and 6 months, participants presented for a follow-up appointment to assess compliance to the Mediterranean diet using the MDS as well as a patient satisfaction survey, BP, and weight. Repeat laboratory biomarkers were performed at 3 and 6 months.Enrolled participants had a mean age with SE of 56.6 (SD 1.7) for SOC and 57.2 (SD 1.8) for EXP; 65.3% of SOC and 56.9% of EXP were male, and 20.4% of SOC and 35.3% of EXP had coronary artery disease. There were no significant differences between EXP and SOC with regard to BP, lipid parameters, hemoglobin A1c, or C-reactive protein (CRP). Participants in EXP achieved a significantly greater weight loss on average of 3.3 pounds versus 3.1 pounds for participants in SOC, P=.04. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased significantly over time for both groups (P<.001), but there was no significant difference between groups (P=.69). Similarly, there was no significant difference in diet satisfaction between EXP and SOC, although diet satisfaction increased significantly over time for both groups. The proportion of participants with high Mediterranean diet compliance (defined as the MDS ≥9) increased significantly over time (P<.001)-from 18.4% to 57.1% for SOC and 27.5% to 64.7% for EXP; however, there was no significant difference between the groups.Both traditional SOC counseling and smartphone-based counseling were effective in getting participants to adhere to a Mediterranean diet, and these dietary changes persisted even after counseling had ended. However, neither method was more effective than the other. This pilot study demonstrates that patients can change to and maintain a Mediterranean diet with either traditional or smartphone app-based nutrition counseling.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03897426;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03897426.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2196/10755", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2908125294", "source": "openalex"}

Simulation based education (SBE) increases competence, reduces complications, and decreases costs. We developed, implemented, and evaluated the efficacy of a right heart catheterization (RHC) SBE curriculum. Methods The RHC curriculum consisted of a pretest, video didactics, deliberate practice, and a posttest. Pre‐and posttest skills examinations consisted of a dichotomous 43‐item checklist on RHC skills and a 14‐item hemodynamic waveform quiz. We enrolled two groups of fellows: 6 first‐year, novice cardiology fellows at Northwestern University in their first month of training, and 11 second‐ and third‐year fellows who had completed traditional required, level I training in RHC. We trained the first‐year fellows at the beginning of the 2018–2019 year using the SBE curriculum and compared them to the traditionally‐trained cardiology fellows who did not complete SBE. Results The SBE‐trained fellows significantly improved RHC skills, hemodynamic knowledge, and confidence from pre‐ to posttesting. SBE‐trained fellows performed similarly to traditionally‐trained fellows on simulated RHC skills checklists (88.4% correct vs. 89.2%, p = .84), hemodynamic quizzes (94.0% correct vs. 86.4%, p = .12), and confidence (79.4 vs. 85.9 out of 100, p = .15) despite less clinical experience.

Data Sources: Peer-reviewed articles were identified from MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Current Contents (all 1966-August 2010) using the search terms heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, diastolic heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), digoxin, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and vasodilators. Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Fourteen published manuscripts relating to pharmacologic management of HFPEF were identified. Data Synthesis: The prevalence of HFPEF has continued to increase. Compared to heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, HFPEF has been largely understudied. Unlike in the management of heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists did not demonstrate mortality benefit in HFPEF, with the exception of one small study evaluating the use of propranolol. However, this study enrolled a small number of patients with recent history of myocardial infarction, which limited the generalizability of the results. Most of the current evidence centers on morbidity benefits and symptom reduction. One study showed that treatment with candesartan reduced hospital admissions in this population of patients. Management of HFPEF still focuses on optimally managing underlying diseases (eg, hypertension). Conclusions: Much remains to be learned about the appropriate pharmacologic management of patients with HFPEF. Hypertension is in most cases the predominant contributor to its development and progression. For this reason, antihypertensive treatment, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, has been evaluated and is recommended to control the disease in this patient population, although these agents have not demonstrated significant benefit beyond blood pressure control. Further research into the pathophysiology of HFPEF may contribute to identifying the most optimal agent in managing this disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1p372", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099318333", "source": "openalex"}

Biographical noteBorn in Quimnper in Western Brittany in 178I, his mother died when he was 5 and his father, a lawyer, was usually in debt so that Laennec came under the care of his uncles.He (Fig. I) had a good grounding in Greek and Latin under an uncle who was a priest and he re- mnined an ardent student of the classics.Another uncle, who later became Professor of Medicine at Nantes, took charge of Theo- phile's medical training at the H6tel-Dieu Hospital there.Laennec's only modern lan- guage was French, though later he also be- came familiar with the Celtic dialect of lower Brittany.After serving in military hospitals, he went to Paris in i8oi and was attached to the Charite Hospital under Corvisart.His many activities included lectures on pathological anatomy, editor of the Journal de Medecine, and a number of published papers, notably one on peritonitis.He graduated in I804, his thesis being entitled Propositions sur la Doc- trine d'Hippocrate, Relativement a' la Medecine Pratique. Immediate auscultationHippocrates applied his ear to the chest, Robert Hooke had heard the beating of a man's heart, and Corvisart listened with his ear near the chest.Bayle and Laennec were accustomed to apply the ear directly to the chest in a perfunctory way and Double (I8I7) published an account of immediate ausculta- tion which he had practised.Examining an obese young woman with cardiac symptoms", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/hrt.34.12.1193", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152520974", "source": "openalex"}

The second parameter was personal occupational dose to the operator per DAP, measured by thermoluminescence dosimeter stripes during 121 procedures in routine clinical work.The local and personal doses per unit DAP - using typical 0.5-mm lead overcouch and undercouch protection - were comparable (left eye 180 vs. 360, thyroid 260 vs. 260, left shoulder 280 vs. 150, chest 400 vs. 500, hands 400 vs. 550, waist 900 vs. 400 nSv/Gy x cm (2)). The results, however, were far lower than typically reported values. Our findings therefore disclose a typically inadequate use or acceptance by individual operators of available table-attached lead protection devices, and of ceiling-attached lead-glass screens. The additional use of individual 1.0-mm lead-equivalent garments reduced local doses to levels between 1. 10 %.DAP-standardized dose parameters - determined experimentally (phantom measurements), or in routine clinical work - are not appreciably influenced by the equipment age and type, or by the image-intensifier entrance dose rate of the respective catheterization system. They are consequently best suited for obtaining eloquent comparisons of various radiation-protection devices, and for reliable estimation of local scatter radiation exposure by simple documentation of intervention DAP.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2003-43412", "url": "https://openalex.org/W40461019", "source": "openalex"}

This way, biomedical experts are provided with a gateway to easily access a grid infrastructure for the execution of these research studies. Emphasis is stressed on the methodology employed. In order to assess the benefits of the grid, a cardiac case study, which analyzes the effects of premature stimulation on reentry generation during myocardial ischemia, has been carried out.

In an attempt to deal with this challenge a new healthcare delivery model called primary care plus (PC+) was introduced in the Netherlands. Within the PC+ model, medical specialists perform consultations in a primary care setting. PC+ aims to support the general practitioners in gatekeeping and prevent unnecessary referrals to hospital care. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a cardiology PC+ intervention on the Triple Aim outcomes, which were operationalized by patient-perceived quality of care, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes, and healthcare costs per patient.This is a quantitative study with a longitudinal observational design. The study population consisted of patients, with non-acute and low-complexity cardiology-related health complaints, who were referred to the PC+ centre (intervention group) or hospital-based outpatient care (control group; care-as-usual). Patient-perceived quality of care and HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS and SF-12) were measured through questionnaires at three different time points. Healthcare costs per patient were obtained from administrative healthcare data and patients were followed for nine months. Chi-square tests, independent t-tests and multilevel linear models were used to analyse the data.The patient-perceived quality of care was significantly higher within the intervention group for 26 out of 27 items. HRQoL outcomes did significantly increase in both groups (P <0.05) but there was no significant interaction between group and time. At baseline and also at three, six and nine months' follow-up the healthcare costs per patient were significantly lower for patients in the intervention group (P<0.001).While this study showed no improvements on HRQoL outcomes, PC+ seemed to be promising as it results in improved quality of care as experienced by patients and lower healthcare costs per patient.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217923", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2947302749", "source": "openalex"}

This situation is a “perfect storm” of factors that predispose patients to medication errors. The goals of this paper are to outline potential roles for clinical pharmacists in a multidisciplinary HF team, to document outcomes associated with interventions by clinical pharmacists, to recommend minimum training for clinical pharmacists engaged in HF care, and to suggest financial strategies to support clinical pharmacy services within a multidisciplinary team. As patients transition from inpatient to outpatient settings and between multiple caregivers, pharmacists can positively affect medication reconciliation and education, assure consistency in management that results in improvements in patient satisfaction and medication adherence, and reduce medication errors. For mechanical circulatory support and heart transplant teams, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services considers the participation of a transplant pharmacology expert (e.g., clinical pharmacist) to be a requirement for accreditation, given the highly specialized and complex drug regimens used. Although reports of outcomes from pharmacist interventions have been mixed owing to differences in study design, benefits such as increased use of evidence‐based therapies, decreases in HF hospitalizations and emergency department visits, and decreases in all‐cause readmissions have been demonstrated. Clinical pharmacists participating in HF or heart transplant teams should have completed specialized postdoctoral training in the form of residencies and/or fellowships in cardiovascular and/or transplant pharmacotherapy, and board certification is recommended. Financial mechanisms to support pharmacist participation in the HF teams are variable. Positive outcomes associated with clinical pharmacist activities support the value of making this resource available to HF teams.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.1295", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101177431", "source": "openalex"}

These challenges, which are inherent in studying pregnancy in physiologic and pathologic states, have contributed to the scant research in pregnancy. Until recently, most studies in pregnancy were nonrandomized and retrospective in nature, representing prevailing clinical standards of practice and clinicians' biases. Prospective studies were generally limited to single centers, comprising of small sample sizes and were observational in nature, rather than randomized studies involving therapy. Ethical and legal factors, research mandates, patient factors, the protracted nature of pregnancy, institutional commitment to research, interdisciplinary clinical and research collaboration, funding support, administrative issues and the level of involvement of national cardiac and obstetric and gynecological societies have been barriers to research in pregnancy in developed countries. Even prospective observational studies are difficult to perform due the difficulties involved with obtaining consent, study recruitment and follow-up. Misconceptions regarding research have led to a lack of participation by women. The longitudinal nature of prospective studies in pregnancy, the problems associated with enrolling women before pregnancy and in the first trimester and the failure to understand the commitment required by the patient, as well as many social factors, have led to increased drop-out rates during pregnancy, as well as difficulty with follow-up in the post-partum state. These factors, along with the failure to supplement funding support due to longer study periods than anticipated, have led to studies of small sample sizes. Understanding patient factors that lead to a lack of participation in research or dropping out following initial consent could help make research participation more conducive for pregnant women. The involvement of national societies in the planning and funding of multicenter studies, interdepartmental and interinstitutional collaboration, institutional and extramural funding support and patient incentives are crucial for shortening study duration and ensuring adequacy of sample sizes for successful research in pregnancy. National health service structures, such as those found in Europe and Canada, makes multicenter collaboration for prospective studies more feasible than for countries such as the USA, in which the fees-for-service system is used. Utilization of telemedicine and handheld ultrasound systems and participation in prospective multicenter registries could not only improve the clinical care of pregnant women in underdeveloped countries, but also provide a platform for research during pregnancy. Multicenter and even global registries supported by European cardiac societies have been formed recently that are beginning to bring forth much-needed data regarding pathological states, such as peripartum cardiomyopathy and pregnancy in congenital heart disease. Such studies are largely confined to non-US countries and have started seeing participation from underdeveloped countries.

The United Kingdom audit of important cardiac diagnoses made antenatally suggests that postcode inequality may exist.3The more affluent areas of the United Kingdom achieved higher rates of antenatal detection, mirroring the regional differences in prevalence of adult cardiovascular disease. Does this suggest inequality of access to perinatal cardiology, or are there other explanations? Looking at the figures closely, two facts emerge. First, those areas with the lowest antenatal yield of congenital heart disease are similar to those with the highest incidence of adult coronary artery disease. Second, those areas with the highest detection rate of congenital heart disease before birth (up to 75% of cases detected) lie close to those teaching hospitals that have shown a special interest in the prenatal diagnosis of heart malformations during the years preceding the audit. One of the prerequisites of screening is that the test applied is both highly sensitive and specific for the condition. Ultrasound screening at 18–20 weeks of gestation detects at least 85% of spinal and renal abnormalities in the fetus, and yet overall only 23% of structural cardiac abnormalities were detected in the United Kingdom survey.3 4 If the public were aware of this low sensitivity compared with screening for other conditions, would the rate of cardiac diagnosis be deemed acceptable?

In conclusion, this study suggests that PCTs need further support to develop structure, leadership and coordination of resources to function in a more effective manner. National plans or recommendations that mandate the organization and working methods of PCTs would be helpful for the ongoing development of PCTs in Sweden.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/13561820.2013.767224", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2146167688", "source": "openalex"}

Close collaboration of cardiologists and stroke physicians is critical to ensure optimum utilisation of short- and long-term care and preventive measures in patients with stroke. Risk factor management is an important strategy that requires cardiologic involvement for primary and secondary stroke prevention. Treatment of stroke generally is led by stroke physicians, yet cardiologists need to be integrated care providers in stroke units to address all cardiovascular aspects of acute stroke care, including arrhythmia management, blood pressure control, elevated levels of cardiac troponins, valvular disease/endocarditis, and the general management of cardiovascular comorbidities. Despite substantial progress in stroke research and clinical care has been achieved, relevant gaps in clinical evidence remain and cause uncertainties in best practice for treatment and prevention of stroke. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the European Society of Cardiology together with the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke in cooperation with the European Stroke Organisation and partners from related scientific societies, regulatory authorities and industry conveyed a two-day workshop to discuss current and emerging concepts and apparent gaps in stroke care, including risk factor management, acute diagnostics, treatments and complications, and operational/logistic issues for health care systems and integrated networks. Joint initiatives of cardiologists and stroke physicians are needed in research and clinical care to target unresolved interdisciplinary problems and to promote the best possible outcomes for patients with stroke.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319873460", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2978714972", "source": "openalex"}

Our objective is to assess the longer-term results (delay time in care, accessibility, and hospital admissions) of an electronic consultation (e-consultation) outpatient care program.Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from the 41 258 patients referred by primary care to the cardiology department from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019. Until 2012, all patients were attended in an in-person consultation (2010-2012). In 2013, we instituted an e-consultation program (2013-2019) for all primary care referrals to cardiologists that preceded patients' in-person consultations when considered. We used an interrupted time series regression approach to investigate the impact of the e-consultation on (1) delay time (days) in care and (2) hospital admissions. We also analyzed (3) total number and referral rate (population-adjusted referred rate) in both periods (in-person consultation and e-consultation), and (4) the accessibility was measured as number of consultations and variation according to distance from municipality and reference hospital.During the e-consultation, the demand increased (7.2±2.4% versus 10.1±4.8% per 1000 inhabitants, P<0.001), and referrals from different areas were equalized. The reduction in delay to consultation during the in-person consultation (-0.96 [95% CI, -0.951 to -0.966], P<0.001) was maintained with e-consultations (-0.064 [95% CI, 0.043-0.085], P<0.001). After the implementation of e-consultation, we observed that the increasing of hospital admission observed in the in-person consultation (incidence rate ratio, 1.011 [95% CI, 1.003-1.018]), was stabilized (incidence rate ratio, 1.000 [95% CI, 0.985-1.015]; P=0.874).Implementing e-consultations in the outpatient management model may improve accessibility of care for patients furthest from the referral hospital.

We sought to evaluate and compare the quality of information available to patients online on three closely linked specialties: Interventional radiology (IR), cardiology, and vascular surgery. Materials and Methods: We searched the leading three search engines for the terms: \"Interventional Radiology\", \"cardiology,\" and \"vascular surgery,\" collating the top 50 hits from each search. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant sites, 43, 25, and 36 sites remained, respectively. Sites were analyzed using the LIDA instrument (an online tool for assessing health-related websites) and Fleisch Reading Ease Scores (FRES) were compared across the different search terms and correlated with the country of origin and certification by the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation. Results: There was no significant difference ( P &gt;0.05) in the total LIDA, accessibility, usability or reliability scores between the three specialties. HONCode certification was associated with higher LIDA (83.1±1.6 vs. 71.53±0.8 ( P &lt;0.0001)), reliability (75.7±3.6 vs. 49.0±1.6 ( P &lt;0.0001)) and FRES (37.4±4.0 vs. 29.7±1.4 ( P =0.0441)). Conclusion: Websites are generally well designed and easy to use; the majority however, lacks currency and reliability.

In fact, TAVI emerged as a better option than either medical therapy or balloon aortic valvuloplasty for patients who cannot undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or are at high surgical risk. Recently, increased operator experience and improved device systems have led to a worldwide trend toward the extension of TAVI to low-risk or intermediate-risk patients. In this expert opinion paper, we first discuss the basic pathophysiology of aortic stenosis in different settings then the key results of recent clinical investigations on TAVI in intermediate-risk aortic stenosis patients are summarized. Particular emphasis is placed on the results of the nordic aortic valve intervention, placement of aortic transcatheter valves (PARTNER) 2 and Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Randomized trials. The PARTNER 2 was the first large randomized trial that evaluated the outcome of TAVI in patients at intermediate risk. The PARTNER 2 data demonstrated that TAVI is a feasible and reasonable alternative to surgery in intermediate-risk patients (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 4–8%), especially if they are elderly or frail. There was a significant interaction between TAVI approach and mortality, with transfemoral TAVI showing superiority over SAVR. Moreover, we examine the complementary results of the recently concluded Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation trial. This prospective randomized trial demonstrated that TAVI is comparable with surgery (primary end point 12.6% in the TAVI group vs. 14.0% in the SAVR group) in severe aortic stenosis patients deemed to be at intermediate risk. We review the most relevant clinical evidence deriving from nonrandomized studies and meta-analyses. Altogether, clinical outcome available data suggest that TAVI with a newer generation device might be the preferred treatment option in this patient subgroup. Finally, the differences between the latest European and American Guidelines on TAVI were reported and discussed. The conclusion of this expert opinion article is that TAVI, if feasible, is the treatment of choice in patients with prohibitive or high surgical risk and may lead to similar or lower early and midterm mortality rates compared with SAVR in intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000000636", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2794581819", "source": "openalex"}

Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to explore the spectrum of cardiovascular complications in infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs). The study was also aimed at investigating probable relations between infants' heart lesions, the type of maternal diabetes, and the neonatal somatic data. Patients and Methods: Between July 2010 to June 2011, two-dimensional/M-mode and Doppler echocardiography evaluations were performed in IDMs at the out-patient clinic of the pediatric cardiology ward of a University hospital in Tehran. Results: A total of 32 IDMs (18 male and14 female) were studied. Congenital heart disease (CHD) was found in 6 (18.7%) neonates and 3 of them suffered from conotruncal malformations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was observed in 15(46.9%) cases. There were 22 (68.8%) large for gestational age (LGA) infants. Gestational diabetes was found in 21(65.6%) mothers.

Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate ESC members’ opinions on the current provision of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation services across Europe and explore barriers to guideline implementation. Method: Electronic surveys using a secure web link were sent to members of the ESC in eight purposively selected ESC affiliated countries. Results: A total of 479 professionals completed the survey, of whom 67% were cardiologists, 8.6% general physicians, 8.2% nurses and 16.2% other healthcare professionals. Respondents were predominantly (91%) practising clinicians, generally highly motivated regarding cardiovascular disease prevention, but most reported that secondary prevention in their country was sub-optimal. The main barriers to prevention were lack of available cardiac rehabilitation programmes and long-term follow-up, patients’ disease perception and professional attitudes towards prevention. While knowledge of the prevention guidelines was generally good, practices such as motivational counselling and better educational tools were called for to promote exercise, smoking cessation and for nutritional aspects. Conclusions: The provision of services focusing on the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease varies greatly across Europe. Furthermore, despite ESC Guidelines and a strong evidence base supporting the efficacy of secondary prevention, the infrastructure and co-ordination of such care is lacking. In addition patient motivation is considered poor and some professionals remain unconvinced about the merits of prevention.

Methods and Results: American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline documents available as of May 2018 were abstracted for both endovascular and surgical peripheral vascular intervention. The number of recommendations, class of recommendations (I, II, and III) and the distribution of their respective level of evidence (LOE; A, B, and C) were determined for each procedure. Guidelines were also evaluated for changes in recommendations over time. Of 5 current guidelines reporting 134 recommendations, only 13% were supported by LOE A and 39% were supported by LOE C. Overall, most recommendations were class II (54%), while 35% were class I. Lower LOEs were observed for interventions for pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (A 0%, B 24%, C 76%), inferior vena cava filter (A 0%, B 31%, C 69%), and renal artery stenosis (A 0%, B 67%, C 33%). Comparatively higher LOE A was observed for endovascular stroke therapy (24%). Compared with previous versions, total number of recommendations for lower extremity peripheral artery disease in the current guideline, decreased from 49 to 26, without an improvement in high-quality evidence. Conclusions: There is significant variation in the LOE supporting various peripheral vascular intervention in the current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. Overall, the availability of high-quality evidence remains low and the LOE appears insufficient to support many guideline recommendations for peripheral vascular intervention. These findings highlight the need for more objective and comparative evidence to support the use of endovascular and surgical therapy and in some areas, for updated guidelines.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circinterventions.118.007244", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2906694114", "source": "openalex"}

Rapid technological advances have provided the means for interventional cardiologists to perform more complex procedures throughout the vascular bed, in a safer and more time-efficient manner. However, as the field of the interventionalist expands, so do the unfamiliar situations in which a life or limb is at stake. Fortunately, formal training programs ensure that the interventional cardiologist receives the fundamental training and practical experience necessary to safely perform basic intravascular interventions. Unfortunately, anatomic heterogeneity in all its beauty will raise its head at the most inappropriate times and pose novel problems that must be handled quickly and appropriately, in territory sometimes foreign to the operator. Dr. Thach Nguyen and his group of distinguished coeditors and authors have developed an outstanding resource in the Practical Handbook of Advanced Interventional Cardiology. While this handbook focuses on the more advanced technical aspects of cardiovascular intervention, there are also important pearls and technical tips concerning the most basic components of a procedure. The handbook opens with the same logical progression in which an interventionalist approaches a patient. Its preface discusses the merits of preparation and planning for each intervention, and the initial chapters highlight vascular access, angiographic views for intervention, and the selection of equipment. Each chapter informs the reader both of cuttingedge technology and of potential pitfalls and complications. Technical tips are labeled basic, advanced, rare, and exotic or investigational, and are so differentiated by stars. The following 17 chapters focus on specific interventions, ranging from balloon angioplasty to interventions in ischemic stroke and in adults with congenital heart disease. Contributing authors provide insight into the potential uses of intravascular ultrasound and pressure-flow wires, and into some of the more esoteric interventional procedures, such as val-vuloplasty and mitral commissurotomy. Finally, they assess emerging technologies in the field. The handbook is intended for both the interventional fellow and the experienced interventionalist. The editors purposefully omit review of widely accepted techniques and of the clinical trial results that form the basis for current practice; their emphasis, rather, is on anecdotal explication of potential problems and solutions as they affect a wide array of procedures. Case reports reinforce many of the technical tips. The text is user-friendly, clarified by multiple diagrams, tables, and figures. Overall, Dr. Nguyen and his collaborators on this project should be commended for assembling such an unusually comprehensive and efficient Practical Handbook of Advanced Interventional Cardiology, with its emphasis on applied techniques and problem-solving strategies that can benefit all interventional cardiovascular operators.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444312584", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4876757", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2465076586", "title": "2014 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Anaesthesiology guidelines on non-cardiac surgery", "text": "This Invited Commentary accompanies the following article: Kristensen SD, Knuuti J, Saraste A, et al. 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery: cardiovascular assessment and management. The Joint Task Force on non-cardiac surgery: cardiovascular assessment and management of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA). Eur J Anaesthesiol 2014; 31:517–573. It has become usual for different specialties to write multi-disciplinary guidelines when 'teams' of physicians collaborate daily in patient care. This is typically the case for cardiovascular assessment and management of patients who undergo non-cardiac surgery.1 The goals of this Invited Commentary are to briefly summarise the main domains of the cardiology part of the guidelines that are of primary relevance for anaesthesiologists (e.g. peri-operative use of β-blockers, biomarkers, the electrocardiogram, rest echocardiography) and to discuss a few recommendations that may change the practice of anaesthesia and peri-operative care. Why was the update of these European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Anaesthesiology guidelines necessary? The answer is because the number of patients with cardiovascular diseases who undergo surgery and have peri-operative complications is high. The magnitude of the problem is difficult to measure in detail but can be approached in terms of the size of the adult non-cardiac surgical group and the average risk of cardiac complications in this cohort. For Europe, with an overall population of over 500 million, there are approximately 19 million major surgical procedures per year, of which approximately 30% are performed in the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidity (approximately 5.7 million procedures/year). The average overall annual complication rate is between 7 and 11%, and the mortality rate is 0.8 to 1.5%; up to 42% of these are caused by cardiac complications. For the European Union member states, these figures represent 167 000 cardiac complications, of which 19 000 are life-threatening. It is estimated that the number of patients undergoing surgery will increase by 25% by the year 2020. In the same time period, the elderly population will increase by 50%. Therefore, the magnitude of the problem clearly accounts for the necessity for (updated) guidelines. Another issue that explains the updated guidelines is the role of peri-operative β-blockade in the prevention of cardiac complications after non-cardiac surgery. Previous guidelines put emphasis on, and a central role for, peri-operative β-blockade, even recommending de-novo initiation before the surgery in certain classes of patients.2,3 This strategic approach has been challenged by the results of the Peri-Operative ISchemic Evaluation-1 trial, which observed that a beneficial effect of peri-operative blockade on the incidence of peri-operative myocardial infarction was at the expense of increased mortality related to the occurrence of peri-operative stroke (probably secondary to peri-operative arterial hypotension).4 In addition, it became evident that specifically the Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echo (DECREASE) studies – which contributed in large part as scientific background for the previous recommendation on peri-operative β-blocking therapy – should be discredited for various reasons.5 These different issues prompted the editorial office of the European Heart Journal to publish an expression of concern6 and the commitment to address this issue in the new guidelines. The novelties of the 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) guidelines are as follows. The role of the anaesthesiologist: Anaesthesiologists (a term that refers to those physicians trained in anaesthesia and intensive care) have a leading role in identifying patients who require pre-operative evaluation by a team of integrated multi-disciplinary specialists including anaesthesiologists, cardiologists and surgeons, and when appropriate an extended team (e.g. internists, pulmonologists or geriatricians). Selected patients include those identified by the anaesthesiologist due to the following: suspected or known cardiac disease with sufficient complexity to carry a potential peri-operative risk (e.g. congenital heart disease, unstable symptoms or low functional capacity); patients in whom pre-operative medical optimisation is expected to reduce peri-operative risk before low-risk and intermediate-risk surgery; and patients with known or high risk of cardiac disease undergoing high-risk surgery. Evaluation of surgical risk: The evaluation of surgical risk has not changed profoundly from the 2009 recommendations. It is still based on low (<1%), intermediate (1 to <5%) and high risk (≥5%). Nevertheless, the wide variety of surgical procedures with different contexts makes it difficult to assign a specific risk of a major adverse cardiac event to each procedure. When invasive/less invasive procedures are available for the same pathologies and there is alteration of cardiovascular reserve, it has been recommended that less invasive procedures be considered by the multi-disciplinary team. This is based on the assumption that major complications are less frequent after less invasive procedures. Pre-operative risk scores for non-cardiac surgery patients: There was much debate within the ESC/ESA Task Force on the relative merits of pre-operative risk scores. It was concluded that although the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI or Lee score) is not the strongest in terms of discrimination, the alternatives (e.g. NSQIP from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database) required calculations (available on (http://www.surgicalriskcalculator.com/miorcardiacarrest). The consensus opinion was that the two scores provide complementary prognostic perspectives and can help the clinician in the decision-making process. The advantage of RCRI is its facility of use and this is why the ESA members of the Task force insisted on keeping the RCRI despite its lower discriminative performance. Peri-operative measurement of cardiac biomarkers in selected patients: Previous ESC/ESA or American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines did not recommend the use of pre-operative and post-operative biomarkers, but the 2014 ESC/ESA guidelines stipulate that the assessment of cardiac troponins in high-risk patients, both before and 48 to 72 h after major surgery, may be considered (Class of recommendation IIb/Level of evidence B). Similarly, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or BNP measurements may be considered for obtaining independent prognostic information for peri-operative and late cardiac events in high-risk patients (IIb/B). It must be underlined that routine pre-operative biomarker sampling in all patients for risk stratification and to prevent cardiac events is not recommended (III/C). The impact of these recommendations on peri-operative management of patients who must undergo non-cardiac surgery is still to be determined, but these recommendations clearly set up the beginning of use of biomarkers as part of peri-operative management. ECG and echocardiography: For the two most prescribed tests by anaesthesiologists, that is ECG and echocardiography, the guidelines stipulate that pre-operative ECG is recommended for patients with risk factors (according to the pre-operative risk scores) if they must undergo intermediate-risk or high-risk surgery (I/C), pre-operative ECG may be considered (IIb/C) for patients with risk factors and low-risk surgery or for patients with no risk factors but who are older than 65 years and must undergo intermediate-risk surgery, and rest echocardiography may be considered as part of pre-operative evaluation in patients undergoing high-risk surgery (IIb/C). Pharmacological risk reduction strategies: This was probably the most difficult part of the guideline-writing process because of the controversy on the peri-operative use of β-blockers, and the recent data on peri-operative use of aspirin and clonidine. To summarise this section on β-blockers, the strategies are as follows: peri-operative continuation of β-blockers is recommended in patients currently treated with β-blockers (I/B); pre-operative initiation of β-blockers may be considered (IIb/B) (preferably with atenolol or bisoprolol as a first choice; IIb/B) in patients scheduled for high-risk surgery and who have at least two clinical risk factors or American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) physical status at least 3, or in patients who have known ischaemic heart disease or myocardial ischaemia; β-blockers should not be initiated pre-operatively (III/B) at high doses without titration or in patients who must undergo low-risk surgery.Peri-operative continuation of statins is recommended, favouring statins with a long half-life or extended-release formulation (I/C). Pre-operative initiation of statins may be considered (starting at least 2 weeks before) for patients who undergo vascular surgery (IIa/B).Novelties concerning aspirin, dual anti-platelet therapy and the direct oral anti-coagulants are too numerous to be discussed in this statement, but there are many changes in the 2014 ESC/ESA guidelines. The complexity of these therapies, independent from the peri-operative period, are such that their peri-operative management will be a major task of the 'peri-operative team'.Intra-operative and post-operative anaesthetic management: Some recommendations regarding intra-operative and post-operative anaesthetic management have changed since the previous guidelines. The first change is related to the fact that recent articles found statistical associations between intra-operative arterial hypotension (defined as decreases >20% of mean arterial pressure, or mean arterial pressure values <60 mmHg for cumulative durations of >30 min) and an increased risk of post-operative complications (myocardial infarction, stroke and death). Therefore, avoidance of arterial hypotension (a process more complex than mere correction of arterial pressure values through infusion of vasoconstrictors) has been recommended (IIb/B). The IIb classification was selected because the relationship between arterial hypotension and post-operative cardiovascular complications/death was obtained in observational studies only. The term 'avoidance' (rather than 'correction') is a tribute to methodological constraints related to the guideline-writing process. Avoidance covers different approaches from anticipation/diagnosis/correction of hypovolaemia to diagnosis and correction of anaesthetic drug overdose (detected most easily through cortical electroencephalography (EEG) or EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors). From the recent literature, it is impossible to assert that correction of intra-operative arterial hypotension through the use of different vasconstrictors will affect the direction of the relationship between intra-operative arterial hypotension and post-operative outcome. It will become obvious for all those who read attentively the 2014 ESC/ESA guidelines that the task force did not recommend the use of EEG-based depth of anaesthesia monitors in patients with altered cardiovascular reserve because it was considered that the studies relating anaesthetic drug overdose to worse post-operative outcome were subject to many methodological difficulties. Despite this, the ESA members of the task force consider that diagnosis/correction of anaesthetic drug overdose is part of the process of 'avoidance' of intra-operative arterial hypotension.The fact that intra-operative haemodynamic instability is associated with post-operative complications allows for risk stratification at the end of surgery. This has been the result of the use of the surgical Apgar score.7 It is therefore possible to stratify the risk based not only on pre-operative factors but also on intra-operative events. The benefit of immediate post-operative risk stratification could be related to better identification of patients who may require special attention in the post-operative period (e.g. measurement of cardiac-specific troponin or natriuretic peptides, or continued observation in the ICU).A second major issue regarding peri-operative management concerns the recommendation on haemodynamic optimisation. Patients with high cardiac and surgical risk should be considered for goal-directed therapy (IIa/B). This recommendation is based on several meta-analyses. The implications of this recommendation for the organisation of the anaesthesia/peri-operative care processes are difficult to assess for the moment, but it seems clear that putting this recommendation into practice will require identification of specific subgroups of patients and definition of processes of care (what monitors, what interventions, location of the patients, etc.). The third major change concerns the fact that neuraxial anaesthesia alone (but not when associated with general anaesthesia) has been shown to decrease the risk of major post-operative complications. Neuraxial anaesthesia (alone) can therefore be considered as the anaesthetic technique of choice following careful assessment of the risk/benefit ratio for each patient. Similarly, neuraxial analgesia is also associated with better post-operative outcome and should therefore be considered as the technique of first choice (following careful assessment of individual risk/benefit profile). In conclusion, it is obvious that the role conferred on anaesthesiologists both as members of the 'cardiac peri-operative team', as initiators of the patient selection process and as contributors (through management of anaesthesia and the post-operative period) has changed since the 2009 ESC/ESA guidelines in which the intra-operative period was 'invisible' in terms of outcome. This will increase the workload and the responsibility of anaesthesia teams. The next steps are, of course, careful reading and analysis of the 2014 ESC/ESA guidelines followed by implementation in all institutions.

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key <i>cis</i>-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones.

This article, the second part, discusses the results of a survey to evaluate the 12-hour shifts, the problems encountered during the implementation of 12-hours shifts, the solutions and the NDU framework as described in the first part of the article. A qualitative design to the postal survey was chosen with the resulting data being subjected to a content analysis. Data triangulation compared survey results with incident reports and sickness records. The limitations of the survey included having the change agent analysing the data, the sampling method and being unable to pilot the questionnaire. The results indicated an improvement in the quality of patient care, although this is difficult to measure, a pacing of workload throughout the day, and tiredness during, after and at the end of a stretch of shifts. Other results centred on staff morale, social life, student nurses' experience and night shifts. The solutions to identified problems included the employment of two twilight nurses to help the night staff during the busy early evening period. As a requirement of the NDU framework, standards were produced from the survey results, as this would allow subsequent audit of the 12-hour shift system. The recommendations from this survey included the dissemination of results both locally and nationally to expand the body of nursing knowledge and to promote practice based on the best available evidence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2000.9.20.2169", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042153525", "source": "openalex"}

Most European countries, however, also have their own cardiovascular journals. National Society Cardiovascular Journals (NSCJ) are time-honoured and classically disseminate high-quality scientific research mainly originating from each particular European country, although some, such as Heart, are now international in their content and distribution. The journals also play a major role in education and harmonization of clinical practice. Most NSCJ are published in local languages but many of them also incorporate English editions. Altogether, NSCJ provide a highly effective means to disseminate cardiovascular research produced in Europe. Scientific knowledge, however, has no barriers and many of these journals have gained an undisputed international profile. Some NSCJ, however, are just emerging and would benefit from networking support. It became clear that enhancing collaboration among NSCJ Editors would facilitate advancement in knowledge and further diffusion of scientific and educative contents. Developing a “Constitution Document” and “Mission Statement” was considered desirable to set the basis of future collaboration among NSCJ Editors. We assumed this responsibility in recognizing the crucial role of NSCJ in Europe. Our target was to produce and issue a core document with fundamental principles upon which all NSCJ Editors would agree. Common goals will be identified and agreed-on measures will be pursued.

Under the spotlight of ‘the cutting edge of cardiology’, exciting and ground-breaking cardiovascular (CV) science was presented both in basic and clinical research. This commentary summarizes essential updates from ESC 2020—The Digital Experience. Despite the challenges that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed on the conduct of clinical trials, the ESC Congress launched the results of major studies bringing innovation to the field of general cardiology, cardiac surgery, heart failure, interventional cardiology, and atrial fibrillation. In addition to three new ESC guidelines updates, the first ESC Guidelines on Sports Cardiology and Exercise in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease were presented. As former ESC president, Professor Casadei undoubtedly pointed out the ESC Congress 2020 was a great success. During the ESC 2020 Congress, BMC Cardiovascular Disorders updated to seven journal sections including Arrhythmias and Electrophysiology, CV Surgery, Coronary Artery Disease, Epidemiology and Digital health, Hypertension and Vascular biology, Primary prevention and CV Risk, and Structural Diseases, Heart Failure, and Congenital Disorders.

Approximately 20 different MMPs are identified, and they can be subdivided into different groups according to which components of the extracellular matrix they degrade. MMPs are secreted in a latent proform and require activation for proteolytic activity. The activity of MMPs is normally low in healthy tissue, but the increased expression and activity of several MMPs in a range of pathological processes, such as inflammation and ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction, might indicate that they play a role in the pathophysiology and progression of atherosclerotic disease. The activity of MMPs is tightly regulated at gene transcription level and is also regulated by their secretion in an inactive zymogen form that requires extracellular activation and co-secretion of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).2 In healthy humans, MMP-2 and the … *Corresponding author.

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview and list of current potential applications for LUS in children with congenital heart disease, post-surgery. We herein describe protocols for LUS examinations in children, discuss diagnostic criteria, and introduce methods for the diagnosis and classification of pulmonary disease commonly encountered in pediatric cardiology (e.g., pleural effusion, atelectasis, interstitial edema, pneumothorax, pneumonia, and diaphragmatic motion analysis). Furthermore, applications of chest ultrasounds for the evaluation of the retrosternal area, and in particular, systematic search criteria for retrosternal clots, are illustrated. We also discussed the potential applications of LUS, including the guidance of interventional procedures, namely lung recruitment and drainage insertion. Lastly, we analyzed current gaps in knowledge, including the difficulty of the quantification of pleural effusion and atelectasis, and the need to differentiate different etiologies of B-lines. We concluded with future applications of LUS, including strain analysis and advanced analysis of diaphragmatic mechanics. In summary, US is an easy, accurate, fast, cheap, and radiation-free tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of major pulmonary complications in pediatric cardiac surgery, and we strongly encourage its use in routine practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12030763", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4220740324", "source": "openalex"}

Methods and Results— A writing group was appointed by the AHA for their expertise in prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis, with liaison members representing the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The writing group reviewed input from national and international experts on infective endocarditis. The recommendations in this document reflect analyses of relevant literature regarding procedure-related bacteremia and infective endocarditis, in vitro susceptibility data of the most common microorganisms that cause infective endocarditis, results of prophylactic studies in animal models of experimental endocarditis, and retrospective and prospective studies of prevention of infective endocarditis. MEDLINE database searches from 1950 to 2006 were done for English-language papers using the following search terms: endocarditis, infective endocarditis, prophylaxis, prevention, antibiotic, antimicrobial, pathogens, organisms, dental, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, streptococcus, enterococcus, staphylococcus, respiratory, dental surgery, pathogenesis, vaccine, immunization, and bacteremia. The reference lists of the identified papers were also searched. We also searched the AHA online library. The American College of Cardiology/AHA classification of recommendations and levels of evidence for practice guidelines were used. The paper was subsequently reviewed by outside experts not affiliated with the writing group and by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. Conclusions— The major changes in the updated recommendations include the following: (1) The Committee concluded that only an extremely small number of cases of infective endocarditis might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures even if such prophylactic therapy were 100% effective. (2) Infective endocarditis prophylaxis for dental procedures is reasonable only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. (3) For patients with these underlying cardiac conditions, prophylaxis is reasonable for all dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. (4) Prophylaxis is not recommended based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquisition of infective endocarditis. (5) Administration of antibiotics solely to prevent endocarditis is not recommended for patients who undergo a genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedure. These changes are intended to define more clearly when infective endocarditis prophylaxis is or is not recommended and to provide more uniform and consistent global recommendations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.106.183095", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2096279874", "source": "openalex"}

In the medical field, there are numerous applications of AI and subsequently, in a relatively short time, significant progress has been made. Cardiology is not immune to this trend, this fact being supported by the exponential increase in the number of publications in which the algorithms play an important role in data analysis, pattern discovery, identification of anomalies, and therapeutic decision making. Furthermore, with technological development, there have appeared new models of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DP) that are capable of exploring various applications of AI in cardiology, including areas such as prevention, cardiovascular imaging, electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, and many others. In this sense, the present article aims to provide a general vision of the current state of AI use in cardiology. Results: We identified and included a subset of 200 papers directly relevant to the current research covering a wide range of applications. Thus, this paper presents AI applications in cardiovascular imaging, arithmology, clinical or emergency cardiology, cardiovascular prevention, and interventional procedures in a summarized manner. Recent studies from the highly scientific literature demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using AI in different branches of cardiology. Conclusions: The integration of AI in cardiology offers promising perspectives for increasing accuracy by decreasing the error rate and increasing efficiency in cardiovascular practice. From predicting the risk of sudden death or the ability to respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or the early detection of valvular diseases, AI algorithms have shown their potential to mitigate human error and provide feasible solutions. At the same time, limits imposed by the small samples studied are highlighted alongside the challenges presented by ethical implementation; these relate to legal implications regarding responsibility and decision making processes, ensuring patient confidentiality and data security. All these constitute future research directions that will allow the integration of AI in the progress of cardiology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics14111103", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4399047878", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2121293277", "title": "The frontiers of nuclear cardiology research", "text": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death. Each year in the United States, more than 500,000 men and women die from coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD results from the narrowing of blood vessels that supply the heart. The blood vessels become narrow when fatty deposits build up inside the arterial wall. When the arteries become clogged, the blood flow to the myocardium is impaired and a heart attack can occur. Nuclear cardiology studies use noninvasive imaging techniques to assess myocardial blood flow. Among the techniques of nuclear cardiology, single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is most widely used to diagnose CAD. The annual number of SPECT MPI procedures is 7-8 million in the United States. The research in the field of nuclear cardiology is everlasting and prosperous. The specific journal that publishes nuclear cardiology research studies is the Journal of Nuclear Cardiology, the official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology. Readers interested in nuclear cardiology research studies can also find their articles in many other imaging journals as well as cardiology journals. In this issue, the Journal of Biomedical Research publishes a series of reviews on the cutting edges of several research areas in nuclear cardiology. Dr. Hung's article[1] reviews the research efforts in exploring additional markers for diagnosing CAD from the conventional SPECT MPI. SPECT MPI is mainly indicated for the evaluation of patients with suspected or known CAD through the assessment of presence, location, extent, and severity of myocardial ischemia and infarction. However, the diagnostic accuracy of SPECT MPI is limited, especially in patients with a multi-vessel disease. Therefore, extensive research studies have been performed to search for additional markers from SPECT MPI that can provide incremental diagnostic value. There are three quantitative markers reviewed in Dr. Hung's article: transit ischemic dilation, stress-induced stunning, and stress-induced dyssynchrony. These markers compare the parameters of left-ventricular (LV) function between the stress and rest images, based on the concept that stress-induced myocardial ischemia can cause regional and global functional abnormalities. Transit ischemic dilation refers to a significant enlargement in LV size on the stress images as compared to the rest images. Stress-induced stunning refers to a significant reduction in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) from rest to stress. Stress-induced dyssynchrony refers to a significant increase in the LV dyssynchrony parameters measured by phase analysis from rest to stress. These markers have been shown as useful tools to increase the diagnostic accuracy of SPECT MPI, especially in patients with a multi-vessel disease. Dr. Hsu's article[2] reviews MPI tracers and techniques of positron emission tomography (PET). PET has superior spatial and temporal resolution to SPECT and is capable of measuring absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF). Extensive research studies have shown that PET MBF measurements have incremental diagnostic value in CAD patients, especially in those with a multi-vessel disease. There are three PET MPI tracers reviewed in Dr. Hsu's article: O-15, N-13, and Rb-82. These tracers have different kinetics following injection, and thus their imaging methods and flow quantitation models are different. Moreover, because of their different imaging methods there are different practical considerations for the clinical use of these tracers. In Dr. Hsu's article, these differences are clearly noted and compared. Dr. Piccinelli et al.[3] review the image fusion techniques that integrate SPECT MPI and cardiac CT angiography (CTA) to diagnose CAD. This multimodal fashion of image assessment has been shown to greatly improve the diagnostic accuracy of both modalities. Since SPECT MPI and CTA provide the complementary functional and anatomical information, such multimodal method can overcome some of the limitations of the individual modalities and provide a comprehensive assessment of CAD. Software techniques to accurately register the SPECT MPI and CTA images into a fused 3D display can further improve the visualization and analysis of the images and provide an incremental diagnostic value over the side-by-side approach. The above three areas represent the major research efforts that are aimed to improve the current clinical practice of nuclear cardiology. In the last article, Dr. Zhou et al.[4] introduces a novel tracer, I-123 MIBG, and its associated imaging techniques, which can predict ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure. I-123 MIBG is an imaging tracer for the assessment of myocardial sympathetic innervation in evaluation of patients with heart failure and severe LV dysfunction. Its relative scintigraphic uptake in the heart compared with a reference region in the mediastinum can accurately identify heart failure patients with lower-than-average one- and two-year mortality risk. The integration of I-123 MIBG SPECT and Tc-99m SPECT MPI can provide regional assessment of myocardial innervation and infarction for predicting ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac mortality. I-123 MIBG has been recently approved by FDA in the United States and has a clear potential to bring new patient populations to nuclear cardiology practice. In summary, the series of reviews cover several major research areas of nuclear cardiology. As an important sub-specialty of cardiovascular imaging, nuclear cardiology strives to improve its quality, collaborate with other imaging modalities, and expand its clinical applications through extensive research efforts.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.27.20130150", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121293277", "source": "openalex"}

In Italy, as well as in other countries, needs of the HF population are not adequately addressed by current HF outpatient services, as documented by differences in age, gender, comorbidities and recommended therapies between patients discharged for acute hospitalized HF and those followed-up at HF clinics. The Italian Working Group on Heart Failure has drafted a guidance document for the organisation of a national HF care network. Aims of the document are to describe tasks and requirements of the different health system points of contact for HF patients, and to define how diagnosis, management and care processes should be documented and shared among health-care professionals. The document classifies HF outpatient clinics in three groups: (i) community HF clinics, devoted to management of stable patients in strict liaison with primary care, periodic re-evaluation of emerging clinical needs and prompt treatment of impending destabilizations, (ii) hospital HF clinics, that target both new onset and chronic HF patients for diagnostic assessment, treatment planning and early post-discharge follow-up. They act as main referral for general internal medicine units and community clinics, and (iii) advanced HF clinics, directed at patients with severe disease or persistent clinical instability, candidates to advanced treatment options such as heart transplant or mechanical circulatory support. Those different types of HF clinics are integrated in a dedicated network for management of HF patients on a regional basis, according to geographic features. By sharing predefined protocols and communication systems, these HF networks integrate multi-professional providers to ensure continuity of care and patient empowerment. In conclusion, This guidance document details roles and interactions of cardiology specialists, so as to best exploit the added value of their input in the care of HF patients and is intended to promote a more efficient and effective organization of HF services.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/sux009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2614908166", "source": "openalex"}

Medical knowledge graphs have been the most recent advances in technology, therapy and medicine. Nowadays, a number of specific uses and applications rely on knowledge graphs. The application of the knowledge graph, another form of artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiology and cardiovascular medicine, is a new concept, and only a few studies have been carried out on this particular aspect. In this brief literature review, the use and importance of disease-specific knowledge graphs in exploring various aspects of Kawasaki disease were described. A vision of individualized knowledge graphs (iKGs) in cardiovascular medicine was also discussed. Such iKGs would be based on a modern informatics platform of exchange and inquiry that could comprehensively integrate biologic knowledge with medical histories and health outcomes of individual patients. This could transform how clinicians and scientists discover, communicate and apply new knowledge. In addition, we also described how a study based on the comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of dietary factors associated with acute myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease used a knowledge graph to show the dietary factors associated with cardiovascular diseases in Nurses' Health Study data.

Virtual care was somewhat established in primary care and mental health care prepandemic, but video telehealth implementation was new for most subspecialties, including cardiology. We sought to identify patient characteristics of virtual and video-based care users in VA cardiology clinics nationally during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods Cohort study of Veteran patients across all VA facilities with a cardiology visit January 1, 2019–March 10, 2020, with follow-up January 1, 2019–March 10, 2021. Main measures included cardiology visits by visit type and likelihood of receiving cardiology-related virtual care, calculated with a repeated event survival model. Results 416 587 Veterans with 1 689 595 total cardiology visits were analyzed; average patient age was 69.6 years and 4.3% were female. Virtual cardiology care expanded dramatically early in the COVID-19 pandemic from 5% to 70% of encounters. Older, lower-income, and rural-dwelling Veterans and those experiencing homelessness were less likely to use video care (adjusted hazard ratio for ages 75 and older 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75–0.86; for highly rural residents 0.77, 95% CI 0.68–0.87; for low-income status 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–0.98; for homeless Veterans 0.85, 95% CI 0.80–0.92). Conclusion The pandemic worsened the digital divide for cardiology care for many vulnerable patients to the extent that video visits represent added value over phone visits.

Invariant NK T cells were markedly decreased in peripheral blood from advanced prostate cancer patients, and their ex vivo expansion with a CD1d-presented lipid Ag (α-galactosylceramide) was diminished compared with healthy donors. Invariant NK T cells from healthy donors produced high levels of both IFN-γ and IL-4. In contrast, whereas invariant NK T cells from prostate cancer patients also produced IL-4, they had diminished IFN-γ production and a striking decrease in their IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio. The IFN-γ deficit was specific to the invariant NK T cells, as bulk T cells from prostate cancer patients produced normal levels of IFN-γ and IL-4.

We randomly assigned (1:1) participants to standard care plus CTCA or standard care alone. Randomisation was done with a web-based service to ensure allocation concealment. The primary endpoint was certainty of the diagnosis of angina secondary to coronary heart disease at 6 weeks. All analyses were intention to treat, and patients were analysed in the group they were allocated to, irrespective of compliance with scanning. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01149590.FindingsBetween Nov 18, 2010, and Sept 24, 2014, we randomly assigned 4146 (42%) of 9849 patients who had been referred for assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease. 47% of participants had a baseline clinic diagnosis of coronary heart disease and 36% had angina due to coronary heart disease. At 6 weeks, CTCA reclassified the diagnosis of coronary heart disease in 558 (27%) patients and the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease in 481 (23%) patients (standard care 22 [1%] and 23 [1%]; p<0·0001). Although both the certainty (relative risk [RR] 2·56, 95% CI 2·33–2·79; p<0·0001) and frequency of coronary heart disease increased (1·09, 1·02–1·17; p=0·0172), the certainty increased (1·79, 1·62–1·96; p<0·0001) and frequency seemed to decrease (0·93, 0·85–1·02; p=0·1289) for the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease. This changed planned investigations (15% vs 1%; p<0·0001) and treatments (23% vs 5%; p<0·0001) but did not affect 6-week symptom severity or subsequent admittances to hospital for chest pain. After 1·7 years, CTCA was associated with a 38% reduction in fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (26 vs 42, HR 0·62, 95% CI 0·38–1·01; p=0·0527), but this was not significant.InterpretationIn patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease, CTCA clarifies the diagnosis, enables targeting of interventions, and might reduce the future risk of myocardial infarction.FundingThe Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates funded the trial with supplementary awards from Edinburgh and Lothian's Health Foundation Trust and the Heart Diseases Research Fund.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60291-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2186191235", "source": "openalex"}

Of the 10 cases with pacing failure, left ventricular pacing was successfully tested in 5 by introducing the coronary wire or another wire into the left ventricle. It yielded a threshold of 2–8 (3.2 ± 2.7) mA. Therapeutic pacing for significant bradycardia was required in 7 patients (2%). It was successful in all. Coronary or left ventricular pacing appears to be a simple and reliable temporary measure.

Method A cardiology project team identified system issues impeding patient flow through the ward, including the discharge medication pathway. The stages of the medication pathway were mapped before and after the intervention of pharmacist‐initiated electronic discharge prescribing. The accuracy of prescribing in both phases of the study was measured against evidence‐based standards agreed by the cardiology unit. Results 39 patients were recruited in phase 1 (usual practice) and 35 patients in phase 2 (pharmacist‐initiated discharge prescriptions). The time from a decision to discharge a patient to the completed prescription reaching the patient was significantly reduced from a median of 190 minutes to 50 minutes in the intervention arm (p &lt; 0.0001). However, this result did not translate into patients leaving the hospital earlier. In phase 1, 26% of prescriptions (n = 39) contained at least one error, including 19 clinically significant omissions. In phase 2, no omissions were made but the signing doctor made two changes to the pharmacist‐initiated prescriptions that were unrelated to the evidence‐based standards. Conclusion This pilot study has shown that an experienced pharmacy specialist using an electronic discharge prescribing system can significantly reduce the time elements of the discharge medication pathway. In addition, errors of omission that deviate from evidence‐based practice are reduced. This practice model can be extended to other specialist areas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2055-2335.2005.tb00365.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2018304047", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2062426834", "title": "The added value of 3D/4D ultrasound imaging in fetal cardiology: has the promise been fulfilled?", "text": "As sonography matures, with its constant technological advances and ever-growing base of experienced examiners, it is reasonable to expect that its sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of fetal anomalies will increase. Perhaps the most dramatic advance has been the introduction of three-dimensional (3D) and real-time 3D (4D) ultrasound imaging1-7, which have become common adjuncts to fetal examinations in many centers. In fetal echocardiography, the 4D ultrasound modality applied most widely to the assessment of structure and function is spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC). Some 50 papers have been published on STIC since its first appearance in 2003 in this Journal8, 9 and two more papers examining the reproducibility and reliability of STIC appear in this issue. The study by Bennasar et al.10 examines the reliability of qualitative evaluation and quantitative measurements of STIC-derived images. The study by Uittenbogaard et al.11 uses an in-vitro balloon model to examine the reproducibility of STIC-derived ventricular volume measures. While these studies add to the literature on STIC technology itself, they do not address another practical aspect of our use of STIC: does it improve rates of diagnosis or diagnostic accuracy in fetal echocardiography? Briefly, following STIC acquisition, rendered 3D ultrasound and multiplanar images of the heart are created from the volume dataset. The different views are available for review as still or moving images. During acquisition, STIC can be combined with B-flow, color or power Doppler, high-definition power Doppler and tissue Doppler. During post-processing, visualization modalities such as 3D volume rendering, inversion mode and tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI) can be applied12-20. The saved volume can be manipulated offline, minimizing patient scanning time. STIC appears to offer promise of improvement in four main areas: increased diagnostic accuracy by virtue of the ability to view the heart from planes other than the acquisition plane and the depth perspective available on rendered images; evaluation of unique functional parameters; data availability for expert review offline, even from a remote computer; and improved patient counseling and interdisciplinary consultation through more comprehensible images, as well as creation of a library of cardiac anomalies that would be invaluable teaching materials for professional education. The images produced by this technology9, 21 are impressive, and occasionally allow potentially complicated diagnoses to be made at a glance. But has 3D/4D ultrasound imaging in general, and STIC in particular, enhanced our diagnostic capabilities in fetal cardiology? Has it resulted in improved screening results and diagnostic accuracy? Has the promise been fulfilled? The STIC technique is readily acquired in most cases22, and integrating STIC does not increase scanning time materially. This has also been our experience. By transmitting STIC datasets on the internet, remote diagnoses of anomalies have been achieved as early as 11 weeks' gestation16. We and others have applied STIC technology in teaching fetal cardiology, and find it to be an effective training tool for both normal fetal echocardiography and elucidating fetal cardiovascular anomalies. 3D ultrasound23 and STIC24-27 also facilitate the evaluation of cardiac function: only by using 3D/4D ultrasound can cardiac volumes be measured reliably and easily27, 28 and derivate indices such as the ejection fraction23 and 4D myocardial performance index25 be calculated, opening up new areas of research and clinical application. Two-dimensional (2D) fetal echocardiography (with color Doppler) under optimal conditions may achieve detection rates of up to 92%29-32 for congenital heart disease. It must be remembered that some cases of CHD will inevitably be missed at a mid-trimester scan, because of the developmental nature of the lesions29. In addition, not all other missed diagnoses are technology-dependent: operator error will affect anomaly detection regardless of technology29, 33. Our experience, in a tertiary referral center, of the added value of 3D/4D ultrasound to our examination protocols is only moderately encouraging. For example, in only 11/155 of our cases with confirmed anomalies did 3D/4D ultrasound add to the diagnostic accuracy: four ventricular septal defects diagnosed with the aid of virtual planes; two cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous return diagnosed with multiplanar imaging; one right ventricle aneurysm diagnosed with B-flow; one transposition of the great arteries with pulmonary atresia, and one segmental interrupted aortic arch diagnosed with TUI; and two portosystemic shunts to the coronary sinus diagnosed by multiplanar imaging and B-flow. In all these cases other anomalies observed on 2D ultrasound examination prompted in-depth cardiovascular evaluation34. It is perhaps not surprising that in the environment of a tertiary referral center, where the detection rate of CHD is > 90%, the margin of improvement with the introduction of new technology is modest. To discover whether 3D/4D ultrasound improves detection rates in a screening center, where the potential margin of added value of the technology may be greater, we must investigate its use under such conditions. All the information available on the 3D/4D scan is present on the 2D scan; the allure of 3D ultrasound is its novel information display. STIC acquisition, performed properly, will contain all the planes necessary to perform fetal echocardiography according to ISUOG (International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology) guidelines35. An experienced operator takes the information from multiple 2D planes36, 37 and reconstructs them in his mind. The 3D/4D modalities take this reconstructed information and display a more complete—and therefore more comprehensible—picture, so those examiners least experienced in this mental reconstruction stand to gain most from the technology. 3D/4D ultrasound also facilitates the display of standardized images of the heart13, 38-41, moving towards automated retrieval of fetal cardiac ultrasound planes from a volume dataset39, 40, 42. How close we are to standardization and automation of ultrasound diagnostic imaging, and whether these could confer any advantage in anomaly detection rates, remains to be seen. 3D/4D ultrasound modalities in fetal cardiology are here to stay. We expect that their proven value in research, in studying cardiac function, in sharing information between professionals, in teaching and in patient counseling will lead to their further penetration into our field. Their ability to increase detection rates in screening programs has not been shown. However, as the technology matures we may see corresponding improvement in diagnostic accuracy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.7569", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2062426834", "source": "openalex"}

For each perspective, we visualize and statistically analyze the effectiveness of the common techniques, and discuss the methodological advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we summarize five practical lessons based on the aforementioned analysis: (1) Data augmentation should be employed and adapted to specific scenarios; (2) Combining different features can improve performance; (3) A hybrid design of different types of deep neural networks (DNNs) is better than using a single type; (4) The use of end-to-end architectures should depend on the task being solved; (5) Multiple models are better than one.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a training program to instruct cardiology residents to perform FCU with a hand‐carried device ( HCD ) in different clinical settings. Methods Twelve cardiology residents were subjected to a 50‐question test, 4 lectures on basic echocardiography and imaging interpretation, the supervised interpretation of 50 echocardiograms and performance of 30 exams using HCD . After this period, they repeated the written test and were administered a practical test comprising 30 exams each (360 patients) in different clinical settings. They reported on 15 parameters and a final diagnosis; their findings were compared to the HCD exam of a specialist in echocardiography. Results The proportion of correct answers on the theoretical test was higher after training (86%) than before (51%; P = 0.001). The agreement was substantial among the 15 parameters analyzed (kappa ranging from 0.615 to 0.891; P &lt; 0.001).

Retrograde delivery of drugs accelerates coronary thrombolysis, preserves regional myocardial function, and limits infarct size in animal models. Modifications of the coronary venous retroperfusion technique have allowed access to smaller coronary venous branches and minimization of systemic effects of local drug delivery. Retrograde coronary sinus perfusion as an adjunct in high-risk coronary PTCA is limited by its inability to provide systemic hemodynamic support during circulatory collapse. Targeted and specific gene delivery to myocardium with transfection rates superior to intraarterial or systemic injection may be a promising new application for this technique. The coronary venous system can also be used for the noninvasive creation of coronary artery bypasses or the insertion of leads for left ventricular pacing. Contrast-enhanced electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) can noninvasively provide high-resolution imaging of the coronary vessels with qualitative and quantitative information on coronary venous anatomy and coronary arteriovenous relationships and may help in selecting appropriate candidates, anticipating the degree of difficulty of the procedure, and guiding the approach. Therefore, EBCT may become the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of patients considered for such strategies.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2418183868", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2088502101", "title": "Quality assessment and improvement in interventional cardiology: A position statement of the society of cardiovascular angiography and interventions, Part II: Public reporting and risk adjustment", "text": "As described in Part I of this Position Statement [1], programmatic assessment of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes is fundamental to the delivery of high quality care. Quality improvement requires documenting clinical outcomes and modifying behaviors based on the data. Part II addresses public reporting, current risk models utilized in PCI, recommendations for their proper use and interpretation, and limitations in current methodologies. Currently, PCI quality is often judged based on advertising, Internet health grades, and public reporting of raw mortality rates. These sources lack sufficient detail and the expertise needed to provide accurate evaluations of facilities or individual operator quality. We propose that PCI quality appraisals be based on the development and use of risk-adjusted models that meaningfully assess clinical outcomes. Public reporting, appropriately performed, promotes informed choice among health care consumers, facilitates quality improvement and increases health care transparency. Conversely, it may emphasize the individual physician operator disproportionately over the clinical team and institutional PCI processes. Public reporting may predispose to the selection of low-risk cases and avoidance of higher-risk cases [2]. SCAI concurs with the 2008 American College of Cardiology Foundation statement of principles regarding public reporting of quality of care [3]. SCAI also agrees with a multi-societal statement [4] regarding the four standards that should be used for public reporting. These principles are summarized in Table I. Public reporting is categorized as voluntary or compulsory. An example of voluntary reporting is a hospital's marketing of its outcomes as part of public relations efforts. Submission of data to health insurance payers for the purpose of ranking and assignment as a \"center of excellence\" is another example. Compulsory public reporting programs include the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report on annual case volume and median Medicare reimbursement for PCI procedures, door-to-balloon times within 90 min for primary PCI for STEMI, post-infarct mortality and post-infarct 30-day readmission rates [5]. Several states use proprietary databases to report annual PCI volume and outcomes [6-14]. The use of claims data for public reporting of PCI outcomes is not recommended, since these administrative databases lack sufficient clinical detail for accurate risk adjustment. Self-reporting is also an inherently inaccurate method [15]. Publicly reported measures of quality should include specific definitions that are easily recognized by data collectors, thus avoiding inaccurate data collection [16]. One example is the variability in the assessment of cardiac biomarkers post-PCI, rendering \"post-PCI myocardial infarction\" a misleading quality metric. After discharge, 30-day mortality is often difficult to ascertain. The lack of standardized definitions also decreases the value of vascular complications and transfusions as quality metrics. Accurate apportionment of accountability to facilities versus individual operators is essential. Community hospitals providing primary PCI without on-site cardiac surgery often transfer their sickest patients immediately post-PCI to tertiary referral centers, thus avoiding reporting subsequent adverse events. Tertiary facilities using LV assist devices for high-risk PCI accept high-risk patients in transfer, giving them a high-risk case mix. Therefore, simple reporting of mortality without risk adjustment is misleading and may not accurately reflect site quality. Public reporting of high mortality rates has affected patient selection in unintended and deleterious ways. After the initiation of public reporting in New York, patients undergoing PCI were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock, have heart failure, or have acute myocardial infarction than patients in Michigan [17, 18]. This suggests a purposeful avoidance of high-risk procedures [2, 19-24]. Termed \"risk avoidance creep\" [2], operator case selection intended to limit the risk of complications suggests that reporting of unadjusted mortality may not be a reliable guide to quality nor good for patient care. The position of the Society is that it may be able to support some instances of public reporting which conform to the standards discussed in this two-part quality position statement. Certainly the Society recognizes that the public has a right to know the competency of those individuals they may choose to perform their PCI procedures. However, the reporting of raw outcomes without risk adjustment is likely to be misleading to the public, and the Society cannot support that method of public reporting. Unless case selection is adequately addressed, the reporting and comparison of unadjusted outcomes may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding relative quality. The outcome measures the Society supports are the risk adjustment models discussed below. Annual operator and institutional PCI volumes have been proposed as a method of assessing PCI quality. Based on the intuitive concept that \"practice makes perfect\" and supported by the demonstration of such relations with surgical procedures, the linkage of operator and institutional volume to PCI quality has been assumed [25-33]. The use of an arbitrarily defined annual operator volume to define quality has been the subject of controversy for two decades [34]. Individual operator volume is a longstanding quality indicator in the AHA/ACC/SCAI PCI Guidelines [25], a position which the Society has endorsed. A caseload of ≥75 PCI cases/year is the minimal number of PCI procedures suggested to maintain competency after formal training and to obtain board certification. Several third parties [35] incorporate a minimum annual volume as a criterion for being named a preferred provider. The supporting data, PCI Guidelines [25], and the ACC Competence Statement [36] suggest a weak and inconsistent relationship of volume with outcomes. They also suggest that PCI annual volume not be used as a surrogate for quality or risk-adjusted outcomes. In the stent era (Table II), no relationship between operator volume and in-hospital mortality exists. Further, there is only a weak relationship with unplanned CABG [38-44], which is likely due to the many clinical variables that impact outcomes (Table III). In the Northern New England Registry [26] there was no relationship between operator volume and clinical success, MI as a complication, mortality (low or high-risk patients) or in-hospital CABG. Among Medicare beneficiaries [27], only a 0.6% difference in CABG and no difference in 30-day mortality or MACE were found at high versus low volume programs. In over 38,000 PCIs in Canadian hospitals, there was no relationship between operator volume and outcomes [32]. Although the Michigan database [30] showed a 0.63% difference in unplanned CABG (just one additional unplanned CABG per 157 PCIs) when comparing the lowest two quintiles (1–33 and 34–89 PCI/year) vs. the highest quintile (>206 PCI/year), no relationship between low operator volume and death, MI, or stroke at any quintile, or mortality or all MACE at 75 cases/year was demonstrated. In the New York State Registry [29], there was no relationship between mortality, unplanned CABG and operator volume. Only the subgroup of lowest operator volumes at the lowest volume centers had any relationship with increased CABG and perhaps mortality, a finding the editorialists [45] suggested should be accepted only with caution due to the very small sample size in that subgroup. Yet another consideration is whether the 75 case/year standard is practical. If there are 9,000 active interventionists in the country, and 600,000 PCIs per year [46], then the average interventionist performs 67 PCIs/year. Moreover, there is a skew in the distribution of cases such that few interventionists do >150 cases and many more are less active. SCAI recognizes that mandating 75 cases per year as a measure of competence may be unrealistic. It is probably true that certain high-risk cases are better performed by operators most experienced with the specific clinical situation or technical problem. Any relationship between outcome and operator volume is probably minimized through careful case selection by operators themselves: the low volume, more risk averse, or limited skilled and experienced operators, likely and appropriately avoid high-risk elective cases. Supporting this point, there are excellent data that annual operator volume is highly predictive of outcomes in primary PCI for STEMI [47, 48]. No studies have examined the impact of lifetime operator experience as a predictor of outcomes. Institutional volume may be a better quality indicator, but it does not supersede validated clinical outcomes [29, 33, 37, 38, 49]. A team with more experience in high-risk cases, increased sharing techniques, greater collaboration with surgical colleagues, and broader access to newer technologies are possible explanations for better outcomes at large-volume institutions. It should be pointed out, however, that the absolute benefit of high volume centers is about 0.1% lower for unplanned CABG or death, or 1 in 1,000 cases [29]. Additionally, it must be recognized that geographic, social, or cultural isolation usually are the reasons why small volume programs remain active; furthermore, local perceived quality and insurance matters increasingly are important considerations. Where patients choose to go for their health care depends on more complex reasons than measured quality. Hence, it is impractical to advocate closing laboratories simply because they do not perform 400 cases, especially if their outcomes are reasonably good. Public reporting of operator and institutional volumes and unadjusted complication rates penalizes adverse outcomes, regardless of patient risk, and rewards high procedural volume, regardless of appropriateness [50]. This approach creates incentives for operators and hospitals to perform large volumes of low-risk cases regardless of appropriateness. The consequence is increased healthcare costs without measurable benefit [51]. In summary, the unadjusted incidence of adverse events is a potentially misleading indicator of PCI quality and cannot be satisfactorily interpreted. Unless case selection is adequately addressed, the reporting and comparison of observed outcomes may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding relative quality. SCAI supports the use of operator and institutional volumes as a quality metric only in the context of an adequate description and case mix analysis. Furthermore, a means of assessing the clinical appropriateness of PCI procedures must be developed; good outcomes alone do not constitute high quality. Although SCAI agrees with the current guidelines advocating a minimum caseload, that agreement is contingent on the understanding of its inherent flaws, which are well documented in this statement as well as in other guidelines. Ultimately, perhaps in the near future, the Society supports moving away from the flawed volume standard and embraces risk adjustment as inherently the most accurate method. Recognizing that risk adjustment is a science which is in constant change and that there continue to be problems with it as well, as will be discussed below, nevertheless it is this standard which needs to be adopted over the next several years. The ACE process moving toward accreditation of interventional programs also has this society's firm support as another measure of cath lab quality. Risk adjustment to account for case selection is necessary to be able to compare results between institutions and operators. Patient risk is the single most important factor in determining short-term outcomes after PCI [52]; thus, case selection will significantly impact outcomes. A uniformly collected, contemporaneously collected and analyzed measure, adjusted for patient risk, provides the clearest measure of performance. Risk adjustment methods have limitations [53]. Older models are mathematically complex, requiring simplification for physician acceptance. The use of self-reported patient risk data without independent audits raises concerns about accuracy, regardless of the case mix. There is still a need for risk models of health status and quality of life, which represent great value to patients [54]. These models do not assess the risk-benefit ratio, and cannot be used to evaluate the appropriateness of the intervention; hence, models cannot be the sole determining factor in decision-making. Risk adjustment models, developed from diverse patient populations, are strongly predictive of outcomes [39, 40]. As this endpoint represents the primary measure of clinical outcome and appropriateness, the cardiology community must ensure the accuracy of the databases and registries from which these models are derived. External validation is the critical step in determining the value of any model [39-42]. Four recently published risk prediction models derived from contemporary datasets are detailed in Table IV [43, 44, 55-57]. Older models are depicted in Table V [52, 58-65]. Most current models predict in-hospital mortality only; two [55, 57] predict all MACE. The newer models incorporate integer-based risk scores to quantify risk; this simplifies their use by patients and health care providers. The most important clinical risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality are reviewed in Table VI [66-71]. The NCDR, through the CathPCI Registry, provides benchmarks in quarterly reports to each participating institution. The executive summary illustrates the ranking of each institution within 95% confidence intervals in 23 quality metrics, including risk-adjusted mortality and composite MACE over a rolling four-quarter period [72]. New York State provides a 3-year summary of each PCI program and each operator that includes: the total number of cases, deaths, observed and expected risk-adjusted mortality rates for all cases and for emergency cases [8]. Outliers are demarcated with two asterisks. Massachusetts publishes annual risk-adjusted mortality rates for all hospitals, stratified by cardiogenic shock or STEMI vs. all others, with statistical assessment of outlier status based on a 3-year rolling average [7, 73]. NCDR has advocated the use of an observed:expected (O:E) mortality ratio of 2.25 as the cut-point of optimal utility as a benchmark [74]. This value was identified by an evaluation of the frequency distribution curve of NCDR among participants [75], and corresponds to the 3% of programs with the worst outcomes. Lower O:E ratio thresholds would identify a larger number of possibly problematic programs. A statistical model based on a corporate quality control method (cumulative funnel plots) has been proposed [76, 77]. The model plots a specific risk-outcome cross point and compares that value to two and three sigma limits using cumulative results over 3 years. This method allows specific plots to be created for high-risk, acute MI or shock cases. Benchmarking and public reporting are credible only if safeguards insure that outcomes and the clinical variables employed for risk-adjustment are reported accurately. Part of the reluctance to acknowledge adverse events relates to the fear that all such occurrences will be considered causally related to the procedure, when it is evident that some are not. Physicians and hospitals that are lax about reporting complications may appear to have good quality, while vigilant operators and facilities will be penalized. Over-coding of risk factors will lead to false perceptions of better quality after risk adjustment, while adherence to published definitions will be interpreted as poor quality. A thoughtful approach to evaluating O:E adverse event ratios is required. The best operators and institutions are those with a relatively high-risk case mix yet who produce acceptable observed results, e.g., an O: E ratio of less than 1.0, but not necessarily near 0, which suggests low-risk case selection. An evaluation of the expected rate of adverse events along with the O:E ratio is required. A program or operator's expected risk should reflect the distribution of risk in the cases they typically perform. The SCAI endorses previously described standards for public reporting [3, 4]. Risk-adjusted complication rates using validated risk models for mortality and major complications are recommended to gauge operator and institutional proficiency. A mechanism that accurately determines 30-day mortality should be developed. Future risk-adjusted models should conform to this standard. The SCAI strongly opposes the use of claims data and supports the use of audited, validated clinical data as the optimal means of evaluating quality. Operator and institutional volume should not be used as primary quality indicators. Validated risk-adjusted models should be the primary method to assess clinical outcomes. A means of assessing the clinical appropriateness of PCI procedures must be developed; good outcomes alone do not constitute high quality. The SCAI strongly supports the development of accurate national and regional databases and registries The use of validated risk-adjustment models as the standard of quality is the goal which the SCAI endorses Risk-adjusted models that include all major complications, not just mortality, should be developed and used as the primary means to assess PCI programmatic quality. Benchmarking programmatic results against a national standard is the next crucial step in the evolution of PCI quality assessment. In this two-part Position Statement, SCAI supports the fundamental position that interventional cardiologists must actively participate and help establish the standards of quality in PCI delivery. Practitioners of interventional cardiology should lead in the definition of quality, in collaboration with other stakeholders. Furthermore, the principles outlined in this Statement should be employed both within each institution performing interventional procedures as well as by outside agencies, which we believe are the best means of assessing quality and evaluating the structure, processes, and outcomes of PCI care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.23153", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088502101", "source": "openalex"}

The management strategies for STEMI are to do early diagnosis, minimize delay of medical contact, and administration of reperfusion therapy as rapidly as possible. Initial evaluation in emergency department for STEMI includes concise history taking, physical examination, electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers measurement. A 12-lead electrocardiogram should be performed within 10 minutes of emergency department arrival. Oxygen, nitroglycerin, analgesia, dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation drugs should be given immediately. Patients with STEMI should receive reperfusion therapy either by primary percutaneous coronary intervention with door-to-balloon time within 90 minutes or by thrombolytic therapy with door-to-needle time within 30 minutes. The pharmacological treatment after admission includes antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulation drugs, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and statins. STEMI patients should be watched out for hypotension, heart failure or even cardiogenic shock. Mechanical complications, such as acute mitral regurgitation, septum rupture and free wall rupture, cause high mortality after STEMI. Tachy-and bradyarrhythmias are also common in patients with STEMI and should be treated accordingly. Permanent cardiac pacing and implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be necessary after STEMI. Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery may be performed as a definitive or adjunctive revascularization therapy after STEMI. Surgery is also necessary if there are mechanical complications. Before discharge, cardiac rehabilitation should be considered when patients are stabilized. Referral for outpatient rehabilitation should also be encouraged. Antiplatelet drugs, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and statins should be continued after discharge for secondary prevention.

A general overview of the European and national legal framework (relevant data protection and privacy legislation) applying to quality-of-care registries is provided. One of the main rules is that non-anonymous patient data may, in principle, not be used for research without the patient's informed consent. When patient data are solely and strictly used for quality control and improvement, this rule does not apply. None of the described registries (NHR, SWEDEHEART, and NICOR) currently ask specific informed consent of patients before using their data in the registry, but they do carry out medical data research.

Unfortunately, discrepancies in the standards of trial reporting have been persistent in previous trials. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist aims to improve research efficacy by setting standards for quality intervention reporting and reproducibility.

The design of inpatient medical services for children admitted to and discharged from noncritical cardiology care units, however, is undefined. North American Pediatric Cardiology Programs were surveyed to define noncritical cardiac care unit models in current practice. Method An online survey that explored institutional and functional domains for noncritical cardiac care unit was crafted. All questions were multi-choice with comment boxes for further explanation. The survey was distributed by email four times over a 5-month period. Results Most programs (n = 45, 60%) exist in free-standing children's hospitals. Most programs cohort cardiac patients on noncritical cardiac care units that are restricted to cardiac patients in 39 (54%) programs or restricted to cardiac and other subspecialty patients in 23 (32%) programs. The most common frontline providers are categorical pediatric residents (n = 58, 81%) and nurse practitioners (n = 48, 67%). However, nurse practitioners are autonomous providers in only 21 (29%) programs. Only 33% of programs use a postoperative fast-track protocol. When transitioning care to referring physicians, most programs (n = 53, 72%) use facsimile to deliver pertinent patient information. Twenty-two programs (31%) use email to transition care, and eighteen (25%) programs use verbal communication. Conclusion Most programs exist in free-standing children's hospitals in which the noncritical cardiac care units are in some form restricted to cardiac patients. While nurse practitioners are used on most noncritical cardiac care units, they rarely function as autonomous providers. The majority of programs in this survey do not incorporate any postoperative fast-track protocols in their practice. Given the current era of focused handoffs within hospital systems, relatively few programs utilize verbal handoffs to the referring pediatric cardiologist/pediatrician.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/chd.12438", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2551979146", "source": "openalex"}

Percutaneous renal denervation (RDN) is designed to disrupt renal afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves to achieve sustained blood pressure (BP) reduction. Since 2017 onward, all three proof-of-concept, sham-controlled RDN trials demonstrated that RDN achieved consistent and clinically meaningful BP reductions [approximately 10 mmHg in office systolic BP (SBP) and 6-9 mmHg in 24-hour SBP] compared to sham operation in patients with mild to moderate or uncontrolled hypertension. There were no serious adverse events. The registry data in Taiwan showed similar 24-hour BP reductions at 12 months following RDN. The Task Force considers RDN as a legitimate alternative antihypertensive strategy and recommends 1) RDN should be performed in the context of registry and clinical studies (Class I, Level C) and 2) RDN should not be performed routinely, without detailed evaluation of various causes of secondary hypertension and renal artery anatomy (Class III, Level C). RDN could be performed in patients who fulfill either of the following BP criteria: 1) office BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg and daytime ambulatory SBP ≥ 135 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg, irrespective of use of antihypertensive agents (Class IIa, Level B), or 2) 24-hour ambulatory SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP ≥ 80 mmHg, irrespective of use of antihypertensive agents (Class IIa, Level B), with eligible renal artery anatomy and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Five subgroups of hypertensive patients are deemed preferred candidates for RDN and dubbed \"RDN i2\": Resistant hypertension, patients with hypertension-mediated organ Damage, Non-adherent to antihypertensive medications, intolerant to antihypertensive medications, and patients with secondary (2ndary) causes being treated for ≥ 3 months but BP still uncontrolled. The Task Force recommends assessment of three aspects, dubbed \"RAS\" (R for renal, A for ambulatory, S for secondary), beforehand to ascertain whether RDN could be performed appropriately: 1) Renal artery anatomy eligibility assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance renal angiography if not contraindicated, 2) genuine uncontrolled BP confirmed by 24-hour Ambulatory BP monitoring, and 3) Secondary hypertension identified and properly treated. After the procedure, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, together with the dose and dosing interval of all BP-lowering drugs, should be obtained 6 months following RDN. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance renal angiography should be obtained 12 months following RDN, given that renal artery stenosis might not be clinically evident.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.6515/acs.201905_35(3).20190415a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2980659414", "source": "openalex"}

Results Of the 339 included residents (59% male; mean age 27) from 120 medical schools, 73 (22%) matched to CV fellowship. At the time of residency application, 104 (31%) had ≥1 publication, 38 (11%) declared intention to pursue CV in their residency application personal statement, and 104 (31%) were members of AOA. Prior to fellowship application, 111 (33%) completed a CV elective rotation. At the completion of residency training, 108 (32%) had ≥3 publications. In an adjusted logistic regression analysis, declaration of intention to pursue CV (OR 6.4, 99% CI 1.7–23.4; p &lt; 0.001), completion of a CV elective (OR 7.3, 99% CI 2.8–19.0; p &lt; 0.001), score on the CV portion of the PGY-2 ITE (OR 1.05, 99% CI 1.02–1.08; p &lt; 0.001), and publication of ≥3 manuscripts (OR 4.7, 99% CI 1.1–20.5; p = 0.007) were positively associated with matching to a CV fellowship. Overall PGY-2 ITE score was negatively associated (OR 0.93, 99% CI 0.90–0.97; p &lt; 0.001) with matching to a CV fellowship. Conclusions Residents’ matriculation into CV fellowships was associated with declaration of CV career intent, completion of a CV elective rotation, CV medical knowledge, and research publications during residency. These findings may be useful when advising residents about pursuing careers in CV. They may also help residents understand factors associated with a successful match to a CV fellowship. The negative association between matching into CV fellowship and overall ITE score may indicate excessive subspecialty focus during IM residency.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02154-w", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3045655989", "source": "openalex"}

The continuing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been especially devastating to patients with known or occult CVD since sitting time and recreational PA have been reported to increase and decrease by 28% and 33%, respectively. Herein, in this first of a 2-part series, we discuss foundational factors in exercise programming, with specific reference to energy metabolism, contemporary PA recommendations, the dose-response relationship of exercise as medicine, the benefits of regular exercise training, including the exercise preconditioning cardioprotective phenotype, as well as the CV risks of PA. Finally, we discuss the 'extreme exercise hypothesis,' specifically the potential maladaptations resulting from high-volume, high-intensity training programs, including accelerated coronary artery calcification and incident atrial fibrillation. The latter is commonly depicted by a reverse J-shaped or U-shaped curve. On the other hand, longevity data argue against this relationship, as elite endurance athletes live 3–6 years longer than the general population.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100424", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4304957529", "source": "openalex"}

Background : Any delay in PPCI in acute STEMI is associated with higher mortality and, therefore, time to treatment should be as short as possible. Despite the use of several strategies, goal D2B time of &lt;90 min remains elusive. Methods : The study examined 790 consecutive STEMI patients treated with PPCI as the reperfusion therapy of choice. Patients were grouped into a pre‐24×7 and post‐24×7 cohort to study the impact of the new protocol on D2B time and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality. Results : Median D2B time decreased from 99 min in the pre‐24×7 group to 55 min in the post‐24×7 group ( P = 0.001) and was not influenced by time of day or day of week. Adjusted for patient and clinical characteristics, the pre‐24×7 group had increased in‐hospital cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 0.95–3.94; P = 0.048) and MACE (odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.10–2.49; P = 0.009) compared with the post‐24×7 group. Prolonged D2B time was also associated with higher 1‐year overall mortality in the pre‐24×7 group compared with the post‐24×7 group (12.8% vs. 8.1%; hazard ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04–2.66; P = 0.044).

The introduction of innovations requires successful solutions and should be based on the experience of classical treatment of heart and vessels pathologies. For the development of interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery in Lviv, doctors of the cardiac surgery department of the Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital initiated the involvement of Polish colleagues to found a joint Ukraine-Polish heart center \"Lviv\" on the basis of the Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital. The purpose of the article is to inform the medical community about the availability of modern methods of diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel diseases in Lviv and Western Ukraine. New diagnostic methods are being introduced that optimize the results of coronary endovascular revascularization. In particular, assessment of coronary physiology - instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to determine the morphology of the affected coronary vessels. The wider use of endoprostheses for the descending thoracic aorta (EVAR) makes it possible to adequately stent the hard-to-reach segment of the aorta in its aneurysms or stratification, as well as to avoid complex traumatic open surgeries.

A Position Paper From the Cardiac Rehabilitation Section of The European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the European Society of Cardiology", "text": "A large body of empirical research shows that psychosocial risk factors (PSRFs) such as low socio-economic status, social isolation, stress, type-D personality, depression and anxiety increase the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and also contribute to poorer health- related quality of life (HRQoL) and prognosis in patients with establishedCHD. PSRFs may also act as barriers to lifestyle changes and treatment adherence and may moderate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Furthermore, there appears to be a bidirectional interaction between PSRFs and the cardiovascular system. Stress, anxiety and depression affect the cardiovascular system through immune, neuroendocrine and behavioural pathways. In turn, CHD and its associated treatments may lead to distress in patients, including anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, PSRFs can be assessed with single-item screening questions, standardised questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews. Psychotherapy and medication can be considered to alleviate any PSRF-related symptoms and to enhance HRQoL, but the evidence for a definite beneficial effect on cardiac endpoints is inconclusive. A multimodal behavioural intervention, integrating counselling for PSRFs and coping with illness should be included within comprehensive CR. Patients with clinically significant symptoms of distress should be referred for psychological counselling or psychologically focused interventions and/or psychopharmacological treatment. To conclude, the success of CR may critically depend on the interdependence of the body and mind and this interaction needs to be reflected through the assessment and management of PSRFs in line with robust scientific evidence, by trained staff, integrated within the core CR team.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.18565/cardio.2015.10.96-108", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4255672469", "source": "openalex"}

We studied the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) associated with sodium bicarbonate (Na2HCO3) infusion in order to prevent CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography with administration of contrast medium.296 patients with indication to perform coronary angiography were included in a randomized, observational study. All patients were randomly assigned to receive pre- and post-contrast hydration with 1500 ml of 0.9% saline solution infusion (Group A) or NAC (1200 mg × 2 days) + Na2HCO3 (Group B). The primary end-point was to examine CIN appearance, defined as a raise in serum values of Cr (Creatinine) ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or ≥ 25% within 24-72 hours after the exposure to the contrast medium.It has been observed a frequency of CIN of 9.4% in Gr. A compared to 7.2% in Gr. B. Nevertheless, when we put these results through a more accurate screening according to gender, degree of raise in creatinine levels and the extent of change in GFR (glomerular filtration rate), we observed a very different behaviour. In patients with normal Cr and CrCl (Clearance of Creatinine) the frequency of CIN was similar in both group A and B (approximately 5%). In patients with normal Cr but reduced ClCr the use of NAC was more effective than hydration in preventing CIN (0% vs 18% in prevalence respectively in B and A group). In patients with moderately reduced Cr and CrCl, hydration with saline solution was more effective than NAC + Na2HCO3 (8.6% vs 17.6%) while in patients with severe CRF the combined use of NAC + Na2HCO3 showed off to be very successful in preventing CIN compared to the merely hydration (0% vs 50%).In patients affected by severe CRF who are undergoing investigations with contrast medium administration, such as coronary angiography, the combined use of NAC + Na2HCO3 infusion significantly reduces the risk of developing CIN. In other circumstances the final result is related to the degree of previous GFR or creatinine values alteration or to gender. In such situations the combined use of both substances is more questionable and sometimes ineffective.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2181780364", "source": "openalex"}

A simpler alternative to this test is the 6-minute walk test. The 6-minute walk test is easy to realize and well-tolerated. Moreover, it is reliable just after one familiarization practice and requires standardization. Indeed, its conduction, which is submitted to some security precautions, can be altered by variation factors. The distance walked during the 6 minutes was the only parameter studied during the test. This parameter could allow judging the CHF severity and prognostic. The analyse of cardiorespiratory parameters has shown that the 6-minute walk test relative intensity is near to the peak individual values. Moreover, the cardiac and ventilatory adaptation of patient during this test depends to his own functional capacity.
