A decade later Marchionini and several coworkers published 5 scientific communications in the Klinische Wochenschrift on \"Der S√§uremantel der Haut und Bakterienabwehr\" (acid mantle and defense against bacteria). They described experimental detail, documented age- and body site as well as skin disease-dependent skin pH shifts, and discussed the significance of the pH and bacterial growth on the skin. In their fourth and fifth communication, they made the first connection between the altered quantitative and qualitative bacterial growth in pathologically modified skin and the shifted skin pH and attributed it partly to the gap in the acid mantle (pathologische L√ºcke des S√§uremantels). They also investigated the pH of several topical dermatologic preparations and concluded that their benefit can at least partly be attributed to their acid character and recommended the systematic investigation of acid treatments in dermatology. At that time, the physiologic role of the acid skin surface was thought to be a protective mechanism against invading organisms. Hence, it seemed reasonable to allocate protection to an easy and conceivable term such as \"mantle.\" Today, \"acid mantle\" as a term is still a very suitable metaphor to illustrate the protective quality of the \"acid\" in the skin and the term has become part of colloquial speech. In the meantime, our understanding of the skin pH has broadened, and we know that the acid character and its gradual change within the skin also help to orchestrate epidermal differentiation and corneocyte shedding. For many more biochemical processes within the skin, the compartmental pH is crucial, for example, in pigmentation, ion homeostasis, epidermal (stem) cell behavior, and so on. The often existing difference between the H+ concentration of extra- and intracellular as well as subcellular compartments establishes an ionic, electric, and/or osmotic driving force; hence, H+ concentration per se acts as an extra-, intra,- and subcellular signaling modality affecting and controlling many cellular functions. One may even consider pH a universal signal and effector. It is therefore also no surprise that skin pH shifts have been observed in various skin pathologies. More recently, in carefully controlled trials (acne, atopic dermatitis, incontinence-associated dermatitis, aged skin), the benefits of targeted skin acidification have become evident and the use of topical preparations with reduced pH may be recommended. The currently prevailing formulation concepts for direct acidification are based on a reduced pH of the hydrophilic product phase in combination with a buffer with a sufficiently high buffering capacity within the vehicle.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125885/"}

Further, clinical trials struggle to keep participants engaged in the study and as many as 40% drop out. To overcome these challenges pharmaceutical companies and research institutions (e.g., universities) increasingly use an emerging concept: virtual clinical trials (VCT) based on a remote approach. VCT (site-less) are a relatively new method of conducting a clinical trial, taking full advantage of technology (apps, monitoring devices, etc.) and inclusion of web platforms (recruitment, informed consent, counselling, measurement of endpoints, and any adverse reactions) to allow the patient to be home-based at every stage of the clinical trial. Studies have shown that VCT are not only operationally feasible, but also successful. They have higher recruitment rates, better compliance, lower drop-out rates, and are conducted faster than traditional clinical trials. The visual nature of dermatological conditions, the relative ease in evaluating skin diseases virtually, and the fact that skin diseases often are not life-threatening and rarely require complex examinations make VCT very attractive for dermatological research. Further, making correct diagnoses based on photographs and patient symptomatology has always been part of the dermatologist's routine. Thus, VCT are in many ways made for dermatology.

As a result, we experience chronic, low-grade inflammation, which has been termed &ldquo;inflammaging&rdquo;. This type of low-level inflammation is driven by a progressive increase in pro- inflammatory systemic cytokines over time. Inflammaging is thought to contribute to many age-related chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and even certain cancers. Recent studies suggest that the human microbiome may play a critical role in inflammaging. As the largest organ of the body and home to a significant portion of the human microbiome, the skin may play a unique role in inflammaging. In this review article, we present common dermatological diseases through the lens of inflammaging, look at how our skin may play a role in reducing inflammaging, and highlight the need for further focused research in this area.

Basal level autophagy plays an important role in cellular homeostasis through the elimination of the old or damaged organelles, as well as aggregated intracellular proteins. Autophagy refers to sequestration of intact organelles along with a portion of cytosol, into a double-or multi-membrane structure known as phagophore, which elongates, and after closure, forms a vesicular structure known as the autophagosome. Subsequently, the mature autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, thereby forming a single membrane structure, an autolysosome. Autophagy plays a critical role in inflammation, autoimmunity and cellular differentiation. Skin serves as the first line of defense against a variety of environmental insults and autophagy is thought to be a form of an endogenous defense mechanism against such environmental derangements. Autophagy has been linked with keratinocyte differentiation and melanocyte survival, as well as with the pathogenesis of diverse skin disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, vitiligo, infectious skin diseases and cancer. Autophagy has been one of the most studied phenomena in cell biology and pathophysiology, and given its broad clinical implications, has become a major target for drug discovery. The last decade has seen a substantial upsurge in autophagy-related research and publications; still, the dermatology literature appears to be less initiated. Autophagy will probably change our understanding of dermatological disorders/medicines. Hence, a basic knowledge of autophagy is a prerequisite to understand the developments in the field of autophagy-related research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28004651/"}

Apart from selecting the appropriate active substance and its proper concentration, choosing a suitable pharmaceutical (galenic) formulation - and thus utilizing the intrinsic effects thereof - is pivotal in enhancing the intended therapeutic effects. When prescribing individual formulations, dermatologists should, to the greatest extent possible, always resort to standardized extemporaneous preparations. Given the multitude of potential ingredients available for pharmaceutical formulations as well as the complexity resulting therefrom, arbitrary changes in quality or quantity of individual components are associated with a high risk of instability, thus jeopardizing safety and the rationale behind any given formulation.

This review explored skin barrier impairment in rosacea and reduced symptomatology when using over the counter (OTC) skincare products. Nine dermatologists (the panel) completed a survey on OTC products they recommend for rosacea. The survey results were summarized, presented, and discussed during the online meeting, together with the results of a literature review. The outcome of these discussions, coupled with the panel's expert opinion and experience, is shown in the current review. Addressing barrier dysfunction by use of moisturizer and cleanser formulations that restore skin hydration, normalize skin pH, restore the microbiome, and skin lipids can assist in improving rosacea signs and symptoms. The panel's consensus was that in addition to the use of prescription medications, skincare recommendations are a crucial part of successful rosacea therapy. In addition to occlusives and humectants, barrier restoring ingredients such as ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide were considered beneficial. Equally important was the absence of potentially irritating substances. The use of OTC products can improve rosacea symptomatology and signs. As adjuncts, these products are recommended before and during prescription therapy and as part of a maintenance regimen.

Although the risk of severe infections with psoriatic treatments is well established, little is known about cutaneous infections. Therefore, we studied the frequency of cutaneous infections in patients with psoriasis who underwent biologic treatment. A total of 878 patients (237 females and 641 males) were analyzed in this follow-up survey conducted in 2020 and based on the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry. The observed skin phenotypes were psoriasis vulgaris (83.3%), pustular psoriasis (7.5%), and psoriatic arthritis (28.9%). The most frequently prescribed systemic drug was apremilast (11.3%), followed by ixekizumab (11.0%), risankizumab (10.9%), and secukinumab (10.4%). The incidence of cutaneous bacterial infections was 12 (1.37% of the total patients), with cellulitis being the most common (8/12, 67%). The incidence of viral infections was 11 (1.25%) including the most common, herpes zoster (9/11, 82%); and that of fungal infections was 45 (5.13%) including 33 (73%) and seven (16%) patients with trichophytosis and oral candidiasis, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that cutaneous bacterial infections were frequently observed in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (odds raio [OR] 9.917, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.069-47.572, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004) and interleukin (IL)-17 (OR 10.798, 95% CI 2.35-49.616, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002) inhibitor treatments.

The pathogen to be treated can be identified sometimes by the clinical symptoms (e.g. in classical erysipelas) or by microbiological analysis. The latter requires adequate sampling methods. Due to the demographic development, which entails age-related multimorbidity and polypharmacy, criteria for the selection of the correct antibiotic not only encompass the pathogen spectrum and the tissue penetration of the drug, but also the risks for adverse events and unwanted interactions with other drugs. In this review article the mode of action, mechanisms of resistance, pharmacokinetics, adverse events, and drug interactions of the dermatologically important antibiotics are summarized, as are some relevant indications for their appropriate use in dermatology. For most bacterial skin and soft tissue infections beta-lactam antibiotics represent the first line therapy. They are efficacious, their adverse events are well known and defined, and they are mostly cost-effective. Penicillins G and V are recommended for classical erysipelas (caused by hemolytic streptococci). For uncomplicated soft tissue infections originating from wounds, which are mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus, the first line therapy are cephalosporins group 1 and 2, or isoxazoyl penicillins. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is indicated only for complicated soft tissue infections when a different spectrum of bacterial pathogens is suspected or when (multi-) resistant bacteria are supposed to be the causative organism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549482/"}

Anecdotal reports report it useful in treating the cutaneous manifestations and associations of inflammatory bowel disease, Beh√ßet's disease, graft versus host disease, Sjogren's syndrome, refractory sarcoidosis, and a variety of other conditions. Its notable side effects include an increased risk of the induction of infections (e.g., tuberculosis). Infliximab is a very promising medication in the treatment of inflammatory dermatological conditions and should be used in larger scale trials of more diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15176162/"}

In contrast to the successes achieved for gastrointestinal disorders, positive effects for atopic dermatitis only have been found in a few studies. New insights could now fundamentally change the impact of probiotics on dermatology. Probiotics are - like microflora of the skin - non-pathogenic microbes, which do not induce inflammatory responses in the skin. Common pathways for probiotics, non-pathogenic microbes, and microflora are characterized, in order to facilitate their more effective therapeutic use. These microbes display a majority of their effects directly at the site of application and thereby induce natural defense mechanisms. However, promotion of immunological tolerance is just as important in producing positive effects. Tolerance of the resident flora on surface organs developed during evolution and the mechanisms of action are multifaceted. Therefore, the topical application of probiotics and non-pathogenic microbes for prophylaxis and therapy of overwhelming cutaneous pro-inflammatory immune reactions is very promising. Results of recent clinical trials already have demonstrated the efficacy of this new therapeutic concept.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19655096/"}

Berries, seeds, and leaves of the plant are widely used as a folk medicine for the treatment of hypertension, oedema, inflammation, tissue-regeneration, skin-grafts, burns/injury, wounds, and ulcers. This article reviews geographical distribution, botanical description, phytochemistry, ethnomedicinal uses, and dermatological activities including, cosmeceuticals of H. rhamnoides available in the market. The data has been compiled employing the various search engines like Science Direct, Pub Med, Google, Google Scholar, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and SciVal. H. rhamnoides is primarily found in cold-temperate regions of Eurasia and was first located in China. Berries are the most prominent feature of the plant. Phytochemical studies reveal the presence of a wide variety of compounds like flavonoids, carotenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, Omega 3, 6, 9 and rarest Omega 7 and about 190 bioactive compounds. The pharmacological studies demonstrated, sea buckthorn to exhibit antibacterial, anti-sebum, antifungal, anti-psoriasis, anti-atopic dermatitis and wound healing activities. Besides, it has also been included in various cosmeceuticals for its use in skin-eventone, smoothening, rejuvenation, removal of wrinkles, scars, and pigmentation, and also in hair related problems. Pharmacological evaluation confirmed the ethnomedically claimed biological actions and other beneficial effects on the skin of H. rhamnoides using scientifically accepted protocols and controls, although some of the studies require more elaborative studies. Its full application in the dermatology may be attributed to the presence of a variety of flavonoids, vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids. Great use of plant in the traditional system for dermatological aspect, demands further comprehensive phytochemical work based on its actual use by the traditional population.

However, there is a lack of insights on industry trends for dermatology research. We aim to describe trends and features of clinical trials for dermatology drugs in China, understand recent achievements, and forecast development trends. Clinical trial records posted on the Registration and Information Disclosure Platform of Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) were screened. All trials for dermatological drugs, posted on platform between 2016 and 2022 were included. A total of 1172 trial records were identified, among which studies for skin infection, immune-mediated and inflammatory skin disease (IMIDs) and skin malignancy accounted for 48.9% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ573), 42.0% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ492) and 9.1% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ107), respectively. Most trials focused on generic drugs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ728, 62.1%). Multi-regional clinical trials (MRCTs) accounted for less than 6% of all trials. The number of trials on dermatology drugs increased sharply from 2016 to 2018 followed by a decline, which is mainly driven by the drop in bioequivalence evaluation (BE) studies for generic drugs indicated for skin infection. A growing trend in the number of trials for innovative drugs was observed. After removing duplicated drugs based on generic name, a total of 607 tested dermatology drugs were identified among which 51.9% were indicated for IMIDs. The number of innovative drugs exceeded generic drugs from 2020 to 2022. The geographic distribution of lead sites (the site where the principal investigator being employed) was uneven, with most of them located in east China. Of 1,068 trials sponsored by Chinese firms, most were BE (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ692, 64.8%) and generic drugs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ722, 67.6%), while among 104 trials sponsored by multinational corporations (MNC), a majority were phase III (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ53, 51.0%) trials and focused on innovative drugs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ94, 90.4%). Findings demonstrated positive consequences of reforms in the healthcare industry in China.

Psoriatic arthritis may develop in about 20% of psoriasis patients while metabolic syndrome is a frequent comorbidity, and risk of cardiovascular disease is increased in psoriasis patients. Classical systemic treatments have not evolved much during the last decades; biological therapies on the contrary have added most significant progress in systemic treatment during the last 10 years. In particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade has changed the treatment outcomes in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. With drugs such as infliximab treatment goals of 75% improvement of psoriasis lesions together with significant improvement of quality of life can be achieved. Furthermore, skin clearance is possible in many patients with continued maintenance treatment with infliximab. More recent pivotal studies have shown that associated nail psoriasis responds well to infliximab, an outcome that was difficult to reach with classical therapies. There is good evidence that infliximab may be useful in other dermatological conditions such as pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa. Infliximab is an intravenous administration over a 2-hour period. Some patients may develop infusion reactions, and dermatologists need to be well aware of any possible adverse events that may be associated with anti-TNF treatment.

Recently, there have been significant changes in dermatologic clinical practice. Advances in knowledge of disease pathophysiology have led to significant breakthroughs in diagnostics and therapy, as well as discovery of new treatment modalities. Additionally, research focusing on differences between individual patients has resulted in the growth of personalized medicine. Health care professionals are focusing on tailoring therapy to the individual characteristics of each patient, which in turn leads to improved quality of care and management of each individual. Of note, patient safety may be compromised when applying or taking dermatologic therapy as a result of medical error, patient noncompliance, adverse effects, or drug interactions. It is therefore of great importance to minimize, and if possible prevent these risks. Finally, the appraisal of health care goods and services currently does not only analyze the safety and efficacy of treatment, but also considers the economic impact on the cost of health care. Consequently, pharmacoeconomic evaluation has become an essential step in the introduction of new dermatologic treatments and the rational use of pharmaceuticals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237068/"}
{"id": "24150820", "title": "[Appropriate off-label prescription in practice].", "text": "More than 2,000 different types of disease entities are treated in dermatology. Even for some of the more commonly occurring diseases there is no explicitly approved medication. Further limitations in the approval status can be found for skin diseases in children and adolescents, in pregnancy and with multiple comorbidities. Therefore, for medical and ethical reasons in many dermatological treatment situations prescription of medications off label is necessary. Against the background of the difficult formal and legal framework conditions for off-label prescription, knowledge of the regulations on off-label use is essential for dermatologists. The presented data were taken from the essential sources of the social security statutes V (SGB V), pharmaceutical guidelines and legal texts on jurisprudence of off-label use. There are no standardized regulations on off-label use for dermatological diseases in Germany. Only a few indications and pharmaceuticals have as yet been included in the processing procedure by the Federal Joint Committee. The large proportion of the necessary treatment in off-label use refers to the jurisprudence, in particular the Federal Social Court. According to this an off-label use can be justified in exceptional cases, and from the sociolegal perspective can even be demanded by patients, if the existing indications represent a serious life-threatening disease or one which permanently reduces the quality of life, a suitable therapy under approved conditions is not available and there is a well-founded prospect of successful treatment. For appropriate prescription in off-label use it is necessary to carry out an appropriate and thorough evaluation and documentation of previous treatment and of the degree of suffering on the side of the patient and to have knowledge of the international literature on studies involving the selected substance. Off-label use is involved in approximately 5-15% of necessary pharmaceutical prescriptions in dermatology and affects some 30 drugs and several hundred indications in routine treatment. Currently the CVderm is constructing a databank for dermatology called E-skin for simplification of off-label use in dermatology (http://www.arzneimittelleitfaden.de). Prescriptions for off-label use are an integral component of qualified dermatological treatment. Despite regulatory and legal hurdles off-label use can be implemented with knowledge of the juridical and formal conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150820/"}

Within-person design can be used to compare different drugs concomitantly in the same patient. Randomization does not concern patients but rather lesions or body sites within patients, and the drugs to be compared are applied to the different lesions (or sites).

The aim of this work was to develop evidence-based recommendations on topical treatments and phototherapy in psoriasis for daily clinical use. A scientific committee selected clinically relevant questions on efficacy and safety of topical agents and phototherapy in psoriasis. This selection was made using the Delphi method. A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The articles selected for analysis were reviewed and the level of evidence was appraised according to the Oxford Levels of Evidence. An Expert consensus meeting took place in June 2011, including 42 dermatologists. Recommendations for use of topical treatments and phototherapy were made during interactive workshops where the evidence was presented and discussed. Agreement among participants was assessed on a 10-point scale. The participants systematically assessed the impact of the recommendations on clinical practice. A total of 3555 references were identified, among which 312 articles were included in the systematic reviews. Three recommendations were issued on phototherapy including both PUVA and narrow-band UVB. The recommendations related to administration schedule, clearance rate and risk of side-effects. The mean agreement between participants was good varying from 8.5 to 9.5. Six recommendations were issued on topical treatments focusing on administration schedule, clearance rate, risk of side-effects, cost-effectiveness and measures to improve treatment adherence. The mean agreement between participants varied from 7.3 to 9.9.

Numerous immunomodulatory mechanisms for hdIVIg have been proposed, and they are discussed alongside treatment protocols and adverse effects. Increasing use of this therapy has helped to establish its excellent safety record, without the many adverse effects of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. This safety record makes hdIVIg an attractive therapeutic option; however, in view of the time required to administer the infusions, the cost, and the urgent need for controlled trials of hdIVIg in patients with specific dermatological disorders such as pemphigus, patients must be carefully selected. Unfortunately, current dermatological uses of hdIVIg have been limited to either uncontrolled trials or anecdotal case reports, except for a single controlled trial of hdIVIg as adjunctive therapy in patients with dermatomyositis, which documented a significant benefit. Further trials in dermatomyositis should be established to confirm these data and to clarify the dose and frequency of therapy required for patients with dermatomyositis.

Aim.‚ÄÇ To assess whether fasting during Ramadan influence the use of topical treatments for skin disease in Muslim patients. This was a prospective, anonymous, questionnaire survey undertaken in a dermatology centre in a tertiary hospital in the UK. Patients were asked if they would use topical treatment while fasting, and whether they would consider this a breach of their fast. We found that more than one-third of the people interviewed would not use topical treatment while fasting, and around the same number (> 30%) would also consider this a breach of their fast. Although the majority of these patients thought that using steroid-based topical products was not acceptable, a significant proportion extended this opinion to use of any cream or emollient, and even to light therapy. Gender, age, or educational level were not useful predictors of patient opinion, but there was a significant association with birthplace and likelihood of using topical treatment during Ramadan; patients born outside the UK were significantly (P < 0.01) less likely than those born in the UK to use topical treatment in the fasting period. Our study indicates that fasting may be a significant and a hitherto unrecognised cause of non-compliance with topical treatment in Muslim patients in the UK, with potential health, quality and cost implications.

The current evidence for the different therapies has many limitations due to lack of sufficient studies on the different Leishmania species with differing virulence. So far there is no international gold standard for the optimal management. The aim of the German joint working group on Leishmaniasis, formed by the societies of Tropical Medicine (DTG), Chemotherapy (PEG) and Dermatology (DDG), was to establish a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of CL and MCL in Germany, based on evidence (Medline search yielded 400 articles) and, where lacking, on consensus of the experts. As the clinical features do not necessarily reflect the involved Leishmania species and, as different parasite species and even geographically distinct strains of the same species may require different treatments or varying dosages or durations of therapy, the guidelines suggest for Germany to identify the underlying parasite prior to treatment. Because of relevant differences in prognosis and ensuing therapy species should be identified in i) New World CL/MCL (NWCL/ MCL) to distinguish between L. mexicana-complex and subgenus Viannia, ii) in suspected infections with L. mexicana-complex to distinguish from L. amazonensis, and iii) in Old World CL (OWCL) to distinguish between L. infantum and L. major, L. tropica, or L. aethiopica. A state-of-the-art diagnostic algorithm is presented. For recommendations on localized and systemic drug treatment and physical procedures, data from the accessible literature were adjusted according to the involved parasite species and a clinical differentiation into uncomplicated or complex lesions. Systemic therapy was strictly recommended for i) complex lesions (e. g. > 3 infected lesions, infections in functionally or cosmetically critical areas such as face or hands, presence of lymphangitis), ii) lesions refractory to therapy, iii) NWCL by the subgenus Viannia or by L. amazonensis, iv) in MCL and v) in recalcitrant, or disseminating or diffuse cutaneous courses. In e. g. infection with L. major it encompasses miltefosine, fluconazole and ketoconazole, while antimony or allopurinol were here considered second choice. Local therapy was considered appropriate for i) uncomplicated lesions of OWCL, ii) L. mexicana-complex and iii) pregnant women. In e. g. infection with L. major it encompasses perilesional antimony, combined with cryotherapy, paromomycin 15 %/in methylbenzethoniumchlorid 12 % and thermotherapy.

However, the needs of those who had undertaken a diploma-level module in dermatology and/or dermatology study days, and those working in both primary and secondary care, were met to a statistically significantly greater extent during the programme than for those nurses without this preparation, or those working in either primary or secondary care. Independent extended supplementary prescribing has extended the role that nurses in the United Kingdom are able to play in the management of skin disease. Specialist dermatology training is a prerequisite for nurses adopting this role. Further evaluative work on patient-focused outcomes, i.e. accessibility and convenience of care, and satisfaction with quality of care, is required.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16925618/"}

Forty percent of these visits were to dermatologists. Dermatologists were 3.9 times more likely to prescribe very high potency steroids than were other physicians. Physicians other than dermatologists were 8.4 times more likely than dermatologists to prescribe combination agents containing moderate- or high-potency topical corticosteroids and an antiinfective agent.

Those using topical dermatological drugs on prescription generally scored lower than the other groups with skin problems: in particular, they evaluated personal health as poorer (general health perceptions), perceived more limitations in daily activities (role limitation because of emotional health problems) and felt more tired and worn out (vitality).

The guidelines consider a systematic Cochrane review on interventions for HE, which is based on a systematic search of the published literature (including hand-searching). In addition to the evidence- and consensus-based recommendation on the treatment of HE, the guidelines cover mainly consensus-based diagnostic aspects and preventive measures (primary and secondary prevention). Treatment recommendations include non-pharmacological interventions, topical, physical and systemic treatments. Topical corticosteroids are recommended as first line treatment in the management of HE, however continuous long-term treatment beyond six weeks only when necessary and under careful medical supervision. Alitretinoin is recommended as a second line treatment (relative to topical corticosteroids) for patients with severe chronic HE. Randomized control trials (RCT) are missing for other used systemic treatments and comparison of systemic drugs in \"head-to-head\" RCTs are needed. The guidelines development group is a working group of the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) and has carefully tried to reconcile opposite views, define current optimal practice and provide specific recommendations, and meetings have been chaired by a professional moderator of the AWMF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften; Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany).

The treatments used by GPs and dermatologists in juvenile psoriasis were investigated. A questionnaire was sent to 229 GPs and 73 dermatologists. Questions were addressed about the prevalence of childhood psoriasis and treatments used in this disease. Seventy-three questionnaires were completed. The response rate was 17.0% for GPs and 46.6% for dermatologists. Almost one-third of all GPs have seen one or more patients with juvenile psoriasis under the age of 11 in their own patient population, in contrast to more than 80% of the dermatologists. Extrapolating the results implied an estimated prevalence of childhood psoriasis of 0.17% in the overall Dutch population. Topical corticosteroids were used by 46.2% of GPs and by 91.2% of dermatologists. Vitamin D analogues were prescribed by GPs and dermatologists in 15.4% and 73.5% of cases, respectively. Systemic medication for juvenile psoriasis was only used by 20.6% of dermatologists.

Dermatologists were responsible for 95% of these office visits. Topical corticosteroids were the only medication listed at 50% of psoriasis visits, and were used in combination with another medication in an additional 26% of visits. High and superpotent corticosteroid agents accounted for 55% of all topical corticosteroid agents listed.

The 2012 cost and production data (homogeneous production units -HPU-)were provided by Inforcoan, the cost accounting information system of the Servicio Andaluz de Salud. The observed drug expenditure ratio ranged from 0.97?/inh to 8.90?/inh and from 208.45?/HPU to 1,471.95?/ HPU. The Pearson correlation between drug expenditure and population was 0.25 and 0.35 for the correlation between expenditure and homogeneous production (p=0.32 and p=0,15, respectively), both Pearson coefficients confirming the lack of correlation and arelevant degree of variability in drug expenditures.

The aim of this paper was to review current literature to assess topical steroid phobia prevalence, populations most at risk, reasons behind steroid phobia, and interventions to reduce it. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid (Journals@Ovid, MEDLINE), ScienceDirect, and Web of Science was performed. Studies ranged from May 2000 to February 2021. In total, 37 articles met the inclusion criteria. There was inter-study variation in the way steroid phobia is defined, from concern to irrational fear. The worldwide prevalence of topical steroid phobia ranges from 31 to 95.7% and does not differ with patient race/ethnicity or dermatological condition. Female patients and caregivers, and those who have experienced side effects of topical corticosteroids are most likely to express steroid phobia. Reasons for steroid phobia include lack of education, fear of side effects, polypharmacy, misinformation, negative experience with topical steroids, and frequently changing of clinics. Successful interventions to address steroid phobia include patient education in the form of educational videos followed by individualized oral education based on concerns, and demonstrations of application of topical steroids. Multiple interventions address topical corticosteroid phobia and improve adherence of topical corticosteroids in the management of dermatological conditions. Providers should screen patients for steroid phobia, especially in populations particularly at risk. Interventions using patient education should be individualized based on concerns expressed during screening. Further research should investigate if reducing steroid phobia can in fact improve long-term adherence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34287768/"}

Pro-drugs are chemical derivatives of an active drug which is covalently bonded to an inactive pro-moiety in order to overcome pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. A pro-drug relies upon conversion within the body to release the parent active drug (and pro-moiety) to elicit its pharmacological effect. The main drawback of this approach is that the pro-moiety is essentially an unwanted ballast which, when released, can lead to adverse effects. The term 'co-drug' refers to two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same disease bonded via a covalent chemical linkage and it is this approach which is reviewed for the first time in the current article. For topically applied co-drugs, each moiety is liberated in situ, either chemically or enzymatically, once the stratum corneum barrier has been overcome by the co-drug. Advantages include synergistic modulation of the disease process, enhancement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetic properties and the potential to enhance stability by masking of labile functional groups. The amount of published work on co-drugs is limited but the available data suggest the co-drug concept could provide a significant therapeutic improvement in dermatological diseases. However, the applicability of the co-drug approach is subject to strict limitations pertaining mainly to the availability of compatible moieties and physicochemical properties of the overall molecule.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18393881/"}

Cross-sectional study investigating prescribing practices for acne, a common dermatologic condition for which free samples are often available. The settings were, first, the offices of nationally representative dermatologists from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (an IMS Health Incorporated database) and, second, an academic medical center clinic without samples. Participants were ambulatory patients who received a prescription from a dermatologist for a primary initial diagnosis of acne vulgaris or rosacea in 2010. National trends in dermatologist prescribing patterns, the degree of correlation between the availability of free samples and the prescribing of brand-name medications, and the mean cost of acne medications prescribed per office visit nationally and at an academic medical center without samples. On a national level, the provision of samples with a prescription by dermatologists has been increasing over time, and this increase is correlated (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.92) with the use of the branded generic drugs promoted by these samples. Branded and branded generic drugs comprised most of the prescriptions written nationally (79%), while they represented only 17% at an academic medical center clinic without samples. Because of the increased use of branded and branded generic drugs, the national mean total retail cost of prescriptions at an office visit for acne was conservatively estimated to be 2 times higher (approximately $465 nationally vs $200 at an academic medical center without samples). Free drug samples can alter the prescribing habits of physicians away from the use of less expensive generic medications.

Principles of rational use of systemic antibiotics in dermatology].", "text": "Antibiotics are frequently prescribed and extremely valuable drugs, because they are curative. However, their often incorrect use is the main reason for the increase of multiresistant pathogens. Inappropriate prescription of broad spectrum antibiotics for skin and soft tissue infections favors the selection and spread of multiresistant bacteria not only in the skin, but also in remote visceral organs (e.g. in the intestines), due to their systemic distribution and effects in the body (so-called collateral damage). For this reason basic knowledge and special prudence when using antibiotics are just as desirable as an awareness of responsibility for the public welfare. This article intends to convey basic knowledge on the indications and selection of suitable antibiotics as well as on the development of bacterial resistance and it gives recommendations for allergological procedures when patients report alleged drug reactions to antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics for soft tissue infections are indicated when the infection spreads within the tissue so that it is no longer accessible for local antiseptics. In addition to the clinical symptoms, important parameters are high blood sedimentation rates (BSR) and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis with neutrophilia and fever (not always present in elderly or immunosuppressed patients). Certain constellations, such as the presence of severe underlying diseases, perfusion disorders or a particular localization (e.g. infection of the face) may necessitate early or parenteral administration. There is no need for systemic administration of antibiotics for uncomplicated wounds without soft tissue infections. Due to their curative effects, the decisive criterion for the use of antibiotics is their sufficient antimicrobial efficacy at the site of infection. An inappropriate administration increases both the selection pressure and costs of treatment and can have fatal consequences in serious situations. In dermatological patients the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin V, penicillin G and cephalosporins of groups 1 and 2 are the antibiotics most commonly indicated for skin and soft tissue infections. If the patient's history arouses the suspicion of incompatibility to these antibiotics, allergological diagnostics should be carried out in order to avoid as often as possible the alternative use of antibiotics which result in more undesired effects and development of resistance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549481/"}

We performed an extensive literature search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies included in the review were those that analysed systemic treatments using biologics and SMIs in subjects under 18¬†years of age. We extracted data on participant demographics, treatment regimens, effectiveness outcomes, adverse effects, and follow-up details. The risk of bias in the studies was determined using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB2). From an initial pool of 1,454 studies, 49 articles fitting the inclusion criteria were identified, encompassing 6372 cases. The review found that biologics such as Dupilumab, along with investigational JAK inhibitors like Abrocitinib and Upadacitinib, exhibited considerable efficacy in treating various conditions, particularly atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Dupilumab specifically demonstrated significant improvements in both disease severity and quality of life. While most reported adverse events were mild to moderate, some serious adverse events were noted with certain treatments. Biologics and SMIs show great promise as therapeutic options in paediatric dermatology, offering better efficacy compared to traditional treatments. Despite these encouraging findings, additional research is needed to verify their long-term safety, especially in relation to growth and development in younger patients.

By 1961, however, there were mounting reports of phocomelia and other severe congenital abnormalities associated with maternal use of thalidomide, and the drug was withdrawn from the market and its availability highly restricted. A few years later, thalidomide would find use in dermatology after it was reported that leprosy patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) experienced rapid and dramatic improvement after taking the drug as a sedative. Additional data quickly confirmed thalidomide's efficacy in ENL, and today it is the drug of choice in the condition. In subsequent decades, the drug has been successfully tried in treatment of a variety of apparently unrelated dermatologic disorders. Meanwhile, thalidomide has been shown to possess a range of biologic actions, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha, possibly relevant to its clinical efficacy. Dermatologic disorders in addition to ENL in which thalidomide's effectiveness is well documented include aphthous stomatitis, discoid lupus erythematosus, actinic prurigo, Beh√ßet's disease, and prurigo nodularis. More recently, the drug has been employed in dermatologic conditions associated with HIV infection. When used with safeguards to prevent teratogenicity and the drug's other major adverse effect, peripheral neuropathy, thalidomide may offer a good therapeutic option for many patients in whom other drug therapies have proven inadequate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9859910/"}

For this reason, the selection presented covering the period from November 2009 to October 2010 is to a very large extent based on controlled trials, either because they contribute important information or because they raise great hope for a significant number of patients. For the first time in cutaneous oncology, a treatment (ipilimumab) has significantly increased overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (phase III), although this gain remains modest (4-6 months) and adverse immunological effects are frequent (30-40%). A phase I trial with treatment specifically targeting the mutant BRAF protein has shown an objective response in 81% of the patients treated in the metastatic phase of melanoma, thus allowing its development to be pursued. Grouping two studies in a rare tumor such as dermatofibrosarcoma also gives hope with imatinib as a neoadjuvant treatment when the initial tumor is inoperable, with, however, an inconsistent response of approximately 50% and only if the tumor presents reorganization of chromosomes 17 and 22. Cutaneous inflammatory diseases are still dominated by dual therapies in psoriasis, with, notably, an effectiveness trial on etanercept at different doses not showing a difference in efficacy depending on dose for the joint component of psoriasis, but also by the publication of a direct comparison of two dual therapies, ustekinumab versus etanercept. In atopic dermatitis, a controversial article invites one to reflect upon the progress made in the management of children by clinical nurses, as in the Netherlands and in Great Britain, in an attempt to contend with the shortage of dermatologists. Since the use of biotherapies is not the prerogative of psoriasis, infliximab was assessed in a phase II trial in Verneuil disease without demonstrating significant efficacy on the main criterion, but it did show a tendency to reduce the score used. This trial suffered from a weakness both in methodology and statistical power, thus precluding any conclusion. The rarity of therapeutic trials on drug eruptions warrants their mention. A French phase II study gives a glimpse of a trend toward efficacy in terms of survival in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis with cyclosporine. As for infectious dermatosis and sexually transmitted infections, a French multicenter study has shown significantly higher efficacy with ivermectin than with malathion in treating pediculosis without increasing the side effects. Today, however, this systemic treatment cannot be a first-line treatment outside of certain specific situations. A large cohort study (somewhat unsatisfactory in its methodology) has not demonstrated the teratogenicity of antiherpes treatments in 830,000 infants. In prevention of HIV transmission, no microbicidal gel had shown efficacy to date. This has now been accomplished in South Africa with a 1% tenofovir gel. The results of a preliminary trial on therapeutic vaccination against HPV16 proposed to women who are carriers of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia opens the way for wide vaccine therapy of cutaneous virus-induced neoplasia.

Among the 39 responding dermatologists (15 women, 24 men), 54% saw fewer than 10 psoriatic patients per week, 23% 10-20 patients, and 23% more than 20 patients. About half of the dermatologists treat their patients with an initial MTX dose of <7.5 mg/week (range 5-17.5 mg/week), an average dose of <10 mg/week (range 5-25 mg/week), and a maximum dose of <20 mg/week (range 7.550 ‚Äì mg/week) with 71.8% prescribing the medication orally and 28.2% intramuscularly.

Currently, skin diseases are considered a major global health issue, impacting individuals of all ages. Skin conditions can vary broadly, ranging from common issues like acne and eczema to more serious diseases such as psoriasis, melanoma, and other types of skin cancer. In recent years, computational methods have appeared as powerful tools for explaining the lurking mechanisms of skin diseases and the advancement of the discovery regarding updated therapeutics. This review spotlights the notable researches that have been performed in using computational approaches such as virtual screening, molecular modelling, and molecular dynamics simulations to discover potential treatments for dermatological conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, skin cancer, and tyrosinase-related disorders. Moreover, using in silico methods, researchers have explored the molecular interactions between cosmetic actives and skin targets, providing insights into the binding affinities, stability, and efficacy of these compounds. This computational exploration allows the identification of potential off-target effects and toxicity profiles, ensuring that only the most promising candidates proceed to clinical testing. In addition, the use of molecular dynamics simulations helps to understand conformational changes and interaction dynamics over time, further refining the selection of effective cosmetic actives.

Objectives To compare methotrexate dosing and monitoring practices in dermatology and rheumatology, assess adverse drug reactions, and analyse the financial impact of rigorous monitoring. Methods This observational, electronic medical record-based retrospective chart review included psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients started on methotrexate at the dermatology and rheumatology departments at a tertiary care centre in 2020-2021. Patients with concurrent hepatotoxic/myelotoxic medications, inadequate follow-up, or abnormal baseline laboratory tests were excluded. Data regarding demographics, relevant medical histories, clinical variables, methotrexate dosing, frequency of laboratory monitoring, adverse events, and resource utilization were recorded and analysed. Descriptive statistics (means/percentages) and inferential tests (Chi-Square Test or Mann- Whitney Test) were used based on data normality (p<0.05 considered significant). Results The study included 100 psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients each. The psoriatic arthritis patients were given higher methotrexate doses initially but underwent less frequent laboratory monitoring compared to psoriasis patients. The incidence of hepatotoxicity was comparable between the two groups. However, leukopenia was observed more frequently in psoriatic arthritis patients. Methotrexate monitoring under dermatologists cost 44% more than that under rheumatologists over 6 months (Rs 4766.08¬± 1631.9 vs Rs 3290.32¬± 1207.8). Limitations The single centre, small sample size, retrospective chart review, and convenience sampling in this study may all limit the generalisability of the findings. Conclusion Current methotrexate guidelines in dermatology recommend lower doses and more frequent monitoring than rheumatology guidelines. Insights from this study and comparison with rheumatology practices and existing literature highlight the potential for designing large-scale, multicentric, non-inferiority studies that could eventually help develop more efficient and streamlined methotrexate monitoring protocols for dermatology and rheumatology, ultimately improving patient adherence, safety and affordability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40587530/"}

These treatments can be associated with a variety of local and systemic side effects, as well as to very often unsatisfactory results. The purpose of this critical review of the literature is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the synthesis of new analogues of the Vitamin D3 Tacalcitol, which is formulated in ointment form at a concentration of 4 microg/g, for the treatment of mild and/or moderate psoriasis (involvement of <20% of the surface of the skin) and to evaluate whether this drug can be used in the treatment of other skin conditions. Based on existing data in the literature, Tacalcitol is an effective drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis and is also able to ensure that the effects last over time, even after treatment has stopped. Tacalcitol is also well tolerated because the onset of side effects, such as local irritation, pruriginous or burning sensations, were reported in only a small percentage of the subjects who were treated. Lastly, the marked regulatory effects it has on the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, as well as on the immunocompetent cells, has led to suggestions that Tacalcitol may be used in other keratinisation disorders and in some hyperproliferative skin diseases. Evaluation of the effective indications to use in these conditions still requires further data confirming its effectiveness, opening the way to wider use of this molecule in dermatology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16116820/"}

Objective: To review the literature and assess available randomized-controlled trials using collagen supplementation for treatment efficacy regarding skin quality, anti-aging benefits, and potential application in medical dermatology. Evidence Review: A literature search was conducted with PubMed using search criteria (collagen) AND (supplement OR food OR nutrition). No lower limit on the year of publication was set. Inclusion criteria were: randomized, placebo-controlled trials using collagen supplementation in human subjects related to dermatology and written in English. Findings: Eleven studies with a total of 805 patients were included for review. Eight studies used collagen hydrolysate, 2.5g/d to 10g/d, for 8 to 24 weeks, for the treatment of pressure ulcers, xerosis, skin aging, and cellulite. Two studies used collagen tripeptide, 3g/d for 4 to 12 weeks, with notable improvement in skin elasticity and hydration. Lastly, one study using collagen dipeptide suggested anti-aging efficacy is proportionate to collagen dipeptide content. Conclusions and Relevance: Preliminary results are promising for the short and long-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density. Collagen supplementation is generally safe with no reported adverse events.

To evaluate these compendia for dermatologic conditions, with a focus on less common conditions that often require systemic treatment. This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 1, 2018, through September 30, 2018. To identify diseases for which dermatologists may often need access to off-label systemic treatments, a list of 22 chronic, noninfectious, nonneoplastic diseases with at least 4 systemic therapies (including 1 in the first-line therapies and less than 25% approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) were selected for evaluation. With use of Treatment of Skin Disease, 5th Edition, a list of first-, second-, and third-line medications was created, including the level of evidence for each disease. A search of AHFS and DRUGDEX compendia was performed to evaluate for inclusion of the evidence-based therapies. In addition, the references cited in the compendia to justify inclusion of the therapy were examined qualitatively. Percentage of treatment options included in each compendium, stratified by level of evidence and position on the therapeutic ladder. Concordance between the 2 compendia was assessed using Cohen Œ∫. Overall, 73 of 238 treatments (30.7%) evaluated were included in either compendium.

Discrepancies in which a medication was included in one compendium but not in the other compendium occurred for 53 of the 238 medications (22.3%) evaluated. Literature use did not follow a discernible pattern and was often based on decades-old sources.

While for pemphigus gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and impetigo herpetiformis, specific diagnostic tests such as histopathology, immunofluorescence, or laboratory investigations will confirm the diagnosis, the identification of the other types of pregnancy dermatoses is based only on clinical criteria. In this context, the review argues for the inclusion of the whole group represented by the papular dermatoses of pregnancy within the broad spectrum of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, separating each of these entities by focusing on their onset: early-onset polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (comprising prurigo of pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, and atopic eruption of pregnancy) and late-onset polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.

Instinctively, we try to treat a skin injury or irritation with cooling or soothing substances. Even animals lick their wounds, trusting instinctively in the healing power of saliva. When did this archaic pattern of treatment take the gigantic leap from folk medicine to modern drug therapy? This text illustrates the evolution of topical dermatological vehicles, their application (guidelines) and future use. In particular, a phenomenon that has so far been ignored in product development and clinical testing is the vehicle metamorphosis. In clinical and experimental situations, most dermatological vehicles undergo considerable changes after they have been removed from the primary container and are applied to the skin. Subsequently, the initial structural matrix, and the quantitative composition of the vehicle, will most likely change during and after the mechanical shear associated with application of the product and/or evaporation of ingredients. This natural, but highly dynamic process will generate mini-environments for the active moiety that are difficult to predict and that are crucial to the fate of the active moiety. Despite the reasonable wishes of formulators, clinicians, patients and customers, there are still no universal vehicles. Each drug, at each concentration, requires a different vehicle for optimized therapy. Stability and compatibility of excipients and active moiety are crucial for any commercially available pharmaceutical or cosmetic formulation, together with local and systemic safety of all components. Nonetheless, more diverse and molecularly complex classes of new dermatological vehicles are continuously being researched and refined. The scientific progress has been remarkable when one considers the simple emulsion mixtures that were commonplace in dermatological therapy and still persist to this day in commercial products. It is to be hoped that the result of these research endeavors will be the emergence of more innovative topical formulations, applying engineered bioavailability control systems, with broader applications in topical therapeutic and cosmetic vehicles.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15724099/"}

In the case of psoriasis there is a range of treatments available, with varying degrees of efficacy and risk of adverse events. To examine the extent to which the attributes of a treatment affect dermatologists' choice of drug therapy and explore the magnitude and nature of the trade-offs between the risks and benefits of treatment. A postal questionnaire was sent to members of the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD). The questionnaire used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit dermatologists' preferences for the treatment of psoriasis. In all, 227 dermatologists completed the questionnaire. The results indicated that time to moderate improvement, time to relapse, risk of hypertension, liver damage, skin cancer and skin irritation were all important factors affecting dermatologists' choice of treatment. Comparing the coefficients for the different side-effects indicated that the dermatologists considered the risk of liver damage to be the most important side-effect, followed by the risk of skin cancer. The time to achieve a moderate (50%) improvement in psoriasis was prioritized over the time to relapse. This study has provided novel insight into the trade-offs that dermatologists face when selecting treatment for psoriasis patients. Future research should explore the extent to which dermatologists' preferences for treatment match those of psoriasis sufferers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17107395/"}

{"id": "32053878", "title": "Electrophiles Against (Skin) Diseases: More Than Nrf2.", "text": "The skin represents an indispensable barrier between the organism and the environment and is the first line of defense against exogenous insults. The transcription factor NRF2 is a central regulator of cytoprotection and stress resistance. NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles. These electrophiles oxidize specific cysteine residues of the NRF2 inhibitor KEAP1, leading to KEAP1 inactivation and, subsequently, NRF2 activation. As oxidative stress is associated with inflammation, the NRF2 pathway plays important roles in the pathogenesis of common inflammatory diseases and cancer in many tissues and organs, including the skin. The electrophile and NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an established and efficient drug for patients suffering from the common inflammatory skin disease psoriasis and the neuro-inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of DMF and other NRF2 activators. Recent evidence suggests that electrophiles not only activate NRF2, but also target other inflammation-associated pathways including the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B and the multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are central regulators of inflammation and are involved in many inflammatory conditions. Most importantly, the NRF2 and inflammasome pathways are connected at different levels, mainly antagonistically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053878/"}

A panel of dermatologists from Latin America employed an online procedure to answer questions on this topic: What is used, by whom, when, how, and why? Before the meeting, a survey was completed by dermatologists from Latin America on OTC products for acne recommended by the panel in their clinical practice. The survey information and a literature review on Latin American acne guidelines and clinical studies were used to address this topic. The survey responders' choices on OTC products for monotherapy comprised alpha-hydroxy acid and beta-hydroxy acid-containing serum, ceramides-containing foaming cleanser, a soap-free exfoliating cleanser, adapalene, and benzoyl peroxide-containing products. The clinicians recommended OTC cleansing products mainly for younger patients at a starter level and for women with adult acne. The use of these OTC products is similar to practice described in therapeutic acne guidelines and algorithms for Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal, Europe, and the United States. Advisors agreed that OTC products and skincare recommendations, in addition to the use of prescription medications, are a crucial part of successful acne therapy. Participants noted that the use of quality OTC products could improve acne symptomatology and severity.

However, there are few studies on this subject. To increase the knowledge about the dermatological consequences of this practice in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. A representative sample of 368 adult women presenting at our dermatological centre was selected. Each woman was questioned about her cosmetic use of bleaching products. Next, the following data were recorded in 425 women who used bleaching products: names and types of products used; modalities of the skin bleaching practice; skin diseases motivating the dermatological visit, with recording of their clinical features; and results of a full skin examination. The active substances of the bleaching products were determined mainly by reading the indications on their packages; with products of unknown composition, a pharmacological analysis of samples was done. A statistical analysis was performed. Of the 368 women questioned, 194 (52.7%) were current users of bleaching products. Concerning the 425 users enrolled, products were applied on the whole body in 92% of users, with a median duration of use of 4 years. The active principles used included hydroquinone (used by 89% of users), glucocorticoids (70%), mercury iodide (10%) and caustic agents (17%); 13% of users used products of unknown composition. In the samples that were analysed, hydroquinone was found at concentrations of between 4% and 8.7%. Concerning steroids, superpotent (class 1) glucocorticoids predominated. The main skin complaints in bleaching products users included dermatophyte infections (n = 105) and scabies (n = 69), both often unusually extensive and severe; acne (n = 42), often severe; eczema (n = 41); irritant dermatitis (n = 14); and dyschromia (n = 26, including 14 cases of exogenous ochronosis). The skin examination noted features apparently disregarded by users: striae (noticed in 39% of users), and macular hyperchromia involving the face, mainly the periocular area (33%). The statistical analysis showed that glucocorticoid use was associated with the presence and severity of infectious skin diseases, and of acne. More than half of the adult women presenting at our dermatology centre were using bleaching products. Most skin diseases observed in bleaching products users appeared to be induced, aggravated or modified by this practice.

There have been several case reports on thalidomide efficacy but long-term outcome is unknown. We report results in 10 cases of cutaneous sarcoidosis treated with thalidomide. Data from ten patients with sarcoidosis treated with thalidomide between January 1998 and March 1999 were collected from delivery authorizations and analyzed. All ten patients had chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis resistant to conventional therapy. Six patients had an associated visceral localization and disease duration of 2 to 18 years (median 6 years). We considered that regression was complete when erythema and infiltration had totally disappeared, that regression was incomplete when cutaneous signs remained, and that treatment had failed when no effect was observed or when the disease worsened. Disease regression was noted in 7 patients for a daily dose of 1.84 mg/kg for 2.8 months. Skin lesions totally regressed in 3 patients, an incompletely in 4. Treatment failed in 3 patients. Patients were treated for 10 months (2 to 21 months). The daily dose of thalidomide was gradually reduced in 5 of 7 patients for whom treatment was effective. Three of these 5 patients relapsed and thalidomide was again given and was effective again at the same dose and after the same delay. We observed improved kidney function in one patient, improvement in nasal infiltration in one other and complete regression in 3 patients who achieved long lasting reduction in angiotensin convertase level. When treatment failed, the daily dose was 1.15 mg/kg and the treatment had to be stopped for 2 patients. Side effects were minor, excepting 2 cases of neuropathy. This open study of 10 patients treated with thalidomide showed the efficacy of a 1.84 mg/kg daily dose in 7 out of 10, but complete regression of the lesions was obtained in only 3 patients. Thalidomiide appears to suspend the disease, with relapse when the drug is discontinued and efficacy at re-introduction. This would argue against a placebo effect.

Clinically, it manifests as chronic-recurrent xerosis, pruritus, and erythematous lesions. Its pathophysiology is complex, making the selection of appropriate treatment options a task. To share insights gained from a literature review and discussions with experts in dermatology on key factors related to the prevention, treatment, and management of AD in relation to the skin microbiome. Results from an expert panel were summarized and discussed to provide updated recommendations for the treatment and maintenance of AD. Evidence supports a strategy for managing inflammatory skin diseases with a selenium-rich post-biotic thermal water and biomass containing moisturizer. The moisturizer helps to restore homeostasis of the skin, re-populate a diverse microbiome, encourage the growth of commensal bacteria, and improve barrier function and symptoms of AD. Normalization of skin microbiome diversity using a topical moisturizer containing post-biotic aqua and biomass may offer a valuable option for the treatment and maintenance of inflammatory skin diseases. Clinicians should discuss the benefits of this treatment in the context of a full AD management program that covers prevention, active treatment, and maintenance.

PDT is used in several medical specialties as an organ-specific therapy for different entities. In this review we focus on the current dermatological procedure of PDT. In the most widely used PDT protocol in dermatology, ROS production occurs by accumulation of the endogenous photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX after treatment with the metabolic precursors 5-methylaminolevulinic acid (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). To date, current approved dermatological indications of PDT include actinic keratoses (AK), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and in situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) also known as Bowen disease (BD). With regards to AKs, PDT can also treat the cancerization field carrying an oncogenic risk. In addition, an increasing number of pathologies, such as other skin cancers, infectious, inflammatory or pilosebaceous diseases are being considered as potentially treatable entities with PDT. Besides the known therapeutic properties of PDT, there is a modality used for skin rejuvenation and aesthetic purposes defined as photodynamic photorejuvenation. This technique enables the remodelling of collagen, which in turn prevents and treats photoaging stygmata. Finally we explore a new potential treatment field for PDT determined by the activation of follicular bulge stem cells caused by in situ ROS formation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27422482/"}

Efficacy of treatment was assessed clinically using the Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI), the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) and the pruritus visual analogue scale. In parallel, blood microcirculation in the skin was measured as an objective parameter for skin inflammation. Skin hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were monitored as parameter relevant for the barrier function. Treatment with pimecrolimus cream 1% resulted in a quick and marked improvement of signs and symptoms of AD and a significant reduction of microcirculation from 33.90 to 15.55 AU (P < 0.0001). Skin hydration increased continually from 42.86 to 52.69 AU (P = 0.002) and TEWL decreased from 35.30 to 21.50 g/m(2)/h (P = 0.001), indicating restoration of skin barrier.

The prevailing perception of a limited commercial potential of dermatological drug products has restricted innovation and encouraged a more conservative development approach. For example, the focus was on repurposing/reformulation of existing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) specifically for the topical delivery route. However, the situation is quite different today catalyzed in part by the blockbuster success of Dupixent (dupilumab), the first monoclonal antibody treatment for atopic dermatitis which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2017. Dupixent's success not only encouraged the development of other biologics but also inspired the (re-)development of new dermal drug products that can reap the many benefits of topical administration. We have also witnessed a shift toward outsourcing development efforts (and associated risks) towards small- to mid-size pharmaceutical companies which often require support of contract research and development/manufacturing organizations (CRO and CDMO). Such trends also emphasize the need of greater expertise in topical formulation design, as well as associated commercial and regulatory considerations. Today, we believe that topical drug products remain not only an essential but also commercially viable class of dermatological therapeutics.

Whereas it has been shown that dermatologists prefer using more intensive therapy for AD than generalists, actual drug utilization has not been quantified. The purpose of this study is to characterize visits for and treatment of AD in the office-based setting. National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 1990 to 1997 was analyzed to determine the use of topical corticosteroids (including their relative potencies), oral antibiotics, and oral antihistamines in the treatment of AD. There were an estimated 900,000 outpatient visits per year for AD. If in some visits to generalists the diagnosis for AD was miscoded as contact dermatitis, there may have been as many as 3 million outpatient visits per year for AD. Topical corticosteroids were used in 67% of visits with a mean potency rank of 4.5 (4.3, 4.8 95% CI). Dermatologists saw 48% of all visits for AD (63 yearly visits/physician) and allergists saw 10% of visits (30 yearly visits/physician). Other physicians saw from 0.1 to 2 yearly visits per physician. Dermatologists were the most likely to use topical corticosteroids (81% of visits) and high-potency corticosteroid agents (22% of visits). Dermatologists and allergists were the only physicians to prescribe ultrahigh-potent corticosteroid agents (12% and 9% of visits, respectively) and were more likely than other physicians to use multiple-agent regimens (21% and 27% of visits treated with a corticosteroid agent, respectively).

Neoral is a microemulsion preconcentrate formulation that has self-emulsifying properties and immediately forms a microemulsion in aqueous fluids, allowing rapid and consistent absorption of cyclosporin from the gastrointestinal tract. Benefits in dermatology are likely to be more patients responding at lower doses, a faster onset of action and a more predictable response to a given dose allowing for fewer dose adjustments.

{"id": "30561009", "title": "Dermatology today and tomorrow: from symptom control to targeted therapy.", "text": "For many decades and until recently, medical approach to dermatologic diseases has been based on the physician's ability to recognize and treat symptoms. Nowadays, advances in the understanding of the biology of diseases and in technologies for intervening against them have allowed physicians to diagnose and treat underlying disease processes rather than simply addressing the symptoms. This means that rather than addressing 'the disease in humans', physicians can now address the particular pathologic (biologic, molecular) disturbance as it presents in the individual patient, i.e., physicians now can practice something much closer to 'personalized medicine', leading to greater benefits for the patients and the health of society in general. The deeper understanding of ultraviolet radiation, the importance of photoprotection and increased knowledge about signalling pathways of melanoma and carcinoma have led to more complete care for the dermatologic patient. The current popularity for excessive exposure to the sun, without adequate application of the appropriate photoprotection remedies, is the origin of melanoma, but also for the weakening of the structure and functions of the skin. Indeed, fragility of the skin can affect humans around the world. In the senior population, this skin fragility is accompanied by pruritus, whereas atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory disease with highest prevalence in children and adolescents. Acne, the number one reason for dermatologic consultations worldwide, increases its prevalence in adolescents and in females. Senescent alopecia affects humans after menopause and andropause.

The Jadad scoring method was used to determine risk of bias. Of the 3220 publications retrieved from online searching, 457 articles met the eligibility criteria and included 198 587 patients. DLQI scores were used as primary outcomes in 24 (5.3%) of these studies comprising 15 different diseases and 3436 patients. Most study interventions (17 of 24 studies, 68%) were systemic drugs, with biologics (liraglutide, alefacept, secukinumab, ustekinumab, adalimumab) accounting for 5 of 25 pharmacological interventions (20%). Topical treatments comprised 32% (8 studies), whereas nonpharmacological interventions (n = 8) were 24% of the total interventions (N = 33). Three studies used nontraditional medicines. Eight studies were multicentred (33.3%), with trials conducted in at least 14 different countries, and four studies (16.7%) were conducted in multiple countries. The Jadad risk of bias scale showed that bias was uncertain or low, as 87.5% of studies had Jadad scores of ‚â• 3. This study provides evidence for use of the DLQI as a primary outcome in clinical trials. Researchers and clinicians can use this data to inform decisions about further use of the DLQI as a primary outcome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38819233/"}

Topical therapy is usually the first line of management. It is believed that successful topical treatment requires pharmaceutical formulation from a sufficient dosage to exert therapeutic effects by penetrating the stratum corneum and then diffusing to the target area. However, many factors can affect this process including the physicochemical properties of the active compound, the composition of the formulation base, and the limitations and conditions of the skin barrier, especially in inflammatory skin.

Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if there is chemical, microbiological, and/or clinical evidence, from a scientific perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug development. We compile and emphasize the most important part of ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants against problem skin diseases as well. Different kinds of key phrases such as \"Indian traditional ethnodermatology\", \"ethnodermatology\", \"ethnobotany\", \"skin diseases\", \"Ayurveda dermatology\", \"pharmacological activity\" were searched in online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/), PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants' uses have been found across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against particular skin diseases. The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today, ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be intensified.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34656666/"}

The motivation to accomplish organotypic structures was driven by the clinics to enable transplantation of in vitro grown tissue substitutes and by the cosmetics industry as alternative test substrates in order to replace animal models. Today a huge variety of 3D human skin models exist, covering a multitude of scientific and/or technical demands. This review summarizes and discusses different approaches of skin model development and sets them into the context of drug development. Although human skin models have become indispensable for the cosmetics industry, they have not yet started their triumphal procession in pharmaceutical research and development. For drug development these tissue models may be of particular interest for a) systemically acting drugs applied on the skin, and b) drugs acting at the site of application in the case of skin diseases or disorders. Although quite a broad spectrum of models covering different aspects of the skin as a biologically acting surface exists, these are most often single stand-alone approaches. In order to enable the comprehensive application into drug development processes, the approaches have to be synchronized to allow a cross-over comparison. Besides the development of biological relevant models, other issues are not less important in the context of drug development: standardized production procedures, process automation, establishment of significant analytical methods, and data correlation. For the successful routine use of engineered human skin models in drug development, major requirements were defined. If these requirements can be accomplished in the next few years, human organotypic skin models will become indispensable for drug development, too.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24378581/"}

As skin conditions and diseases may affect all ages from cradle to grave, a disproportionate burden will clearly fall on the elderly and may significantly impact on quality of life (QoL). With a reduced ability of the skin to regenerate, the elderly are at an increased risk of skin breakdowns from even the simplest insults. It is therefore vital that skin care in the late adulthood is seen as a priority among both clinicians and caregivers. The scientific literature on diagnosing and assessing age-related skin conditions and diseases is vast; however, when it comes to preventive care and treatment, the scientific data available is less profound, and the recommendations are often based on personal experience, opinions or at best on consensus documents rather than on scientific data retrieved from controlled clinical trials. In addition to the absence of the scientific data, the imprecise terminology to describe the topical products, as well as the lack of understanding the essence of the vehicle, contributes to vague and often unhelpfully product recommendations. This paper aims to elucidate some basic principles of skincare, the choice of skincare products and their regulatory status.

Current treatments for severe cases include broad immune-suppressants, which are associated with significant adverse effects, precluding long-term use, with rapid hair loss following treatment termination. As a result of the extent of the disease in severe cases, topical contact sensitizers and intralesional treatments are of limited use. The pathogenesis of AA is not yet fully understood, but recent investigations of the immune activation in AA skin reveal Th1/IFN-Œ≥, as well as Th2, PDE4, IL-23, and IL-9 upregulations. Tissue analyses of both animal models and human lesions following broad-acting and cytokine-specific therapeutics (such as JAK inhibitors and ustekinumab, respectively) provide another opportunity for important insights into the pathogenesis of AA. As reviewed in this paper, numerous novel therapeutics are undergoing clinical trials for AA, emphasizing the potential transformation of the clinical practice of AA, which is currently lacking. Dermatologists are already familiar with the revolution in disease management of psoriasis, stemming from better understanding of immune dysregulations, and atopic dermatitis will soon follow a similar path. In light of these recent developments, the therapeutic arena of AA treatments is finally getting more exciting.

Whereas most clinicians correctly estimated characteristics of patients with TCC and the impact of patient information, only 31% of clinicians knew that skin atrophy was the leading concern, and only 30% correctly ranked the reasons for TCC. 74% of the clinicians had at least minor concerns themselves.

However, the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied therapies is dependent on several characteristics, including percutaneous penetration and permeation of active ingredient and lack of side effects, especially local tolerability reactions. Importantly, the ultimate performance of a topical product includes collectively the effects of the active ingredient and the impact that specific additives have on vehicle characteristics, such as penetration, permeation, epidermal barrier properties, relative irritancy, allergenicity potential, and patient acceptance/preference of the vehicle formulation used. Foam vehicles have evolved over time with the emergence of a menu of alcohol-based and aqueous-based variations that provide various advantages depending on clinical circumstances and the disease being treated. Aqueous-based foams have gained widespread acceptance and preference, especially due to favorable skin tolerability and the cosmetic elegance of the products. In this manuscript, data are presented supporting the efficacy, tolerability, and safety, of specific aqueous-based foam vehicles for calcipotriene used to treat plaque psoriasis, and for tazarotene used to treat acne vulgaris. Discussions include both vehicle-based properties that are relevant to clinical practice, and outcomes from the large-scale pivotal clinical trials that review efficacy and safety results and patient reported outcomes.

In this supplement, we focus on the fourth category, the iatrogenic origin of fragile skin and the role that dermo-cosmetics can have in restoring the natural protective function of the skin following treatments for skin diseases and medical interventions. We present epidemiological data on the prevalence of fragile skin in three different geographical regions, and the results of two randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy and tolerability of dermo-cosmetics in combination with topical acne treatment and following physical skin damage. Overall, we found that prevalence across the three regions (23% in Germany, 41% in UAE, 56% in Taiwan) reflected previous global estimates (24-53%) across skin types, with significant associations found with environmental and lifestyle factors, such as stress, humidity and pollution. The iatrogenic effects of topical acne treatments can result in poor compliance or use of over-the-counter moisturizers, which may reduce treatment efficacy. Dermo-cosmetics were found to aid in restoration of fragile skin caused by the acne topical retinoid treatment adapalene 0.1% gel, by reducing transepidermal water loss and improving skin hydration, as well as reducing the side-effects such as skin irritation that are frequently associated with topical retinoids.

Both short-term (acute) and long-term side effects should be well known by the physician. The pros and cons of oral and parenteral therapy for various disorders and in various situations should be recognized. For long-term therapy, an intermediate-acting agent such as prednisone in single, early morning doses is most commonly used to minimize suppression of the HPA axis. Alternate-morning doses produce even less suppression if the disease process will respond. A through patient history, including general medical history and medications the patient is taking, is important to anticipate any potential problems. Weight and blood pressure should be checked initially and every 1 to 3 months thereafter. Blood glucose, electrolytes, and lipid studies, including triglycerides, should be done approximately every 6 months. An ophthalmology examination should be performed every year, and stool examination for occult blood and chest radiography can be obtained as indicated. Bone density studies might be necessary in patients who are at high risk for osteoporosis. Specific acute situations may dictate other studies. The patient on long-term GCS should be kept as active as possible, as mild-to-moderate exercise helps prevent certain side effects, such as osteoporosis. The dose of oral GCS is best given with food to prevent gastrointestinal irritation, and agents to decrease gastric acidity might be needed in certain situations. Exposure to infections should be prevented, where possible, and treatment initiated at the first sign of systemic or cutaneous infection. Pain should be evaluated early, especially abdominal pain or bone pain; MRI is indicated if aseptic necrosis of bone is suspected. Both trauma and severe sun exposure should be avoided. Consultation with other specialists is strongly recommended when the situation dictates. Diet is one of the most important strategies to minimize side effects from long-term GCS therapy. Vegetable protein should be increased in the diet, and fats and carbohydrates limited. Adequate calcium is imperative, and calcium supplementation is recommended for high-risk osteoporosis patients. Small amounts of vitamin D may be necessary to increase absorption of calcium. Restriction of sodium is also important, as is maintainance of dietary potassium. Supplemental potassium may be necessary in some patients, and a thiazide diuretic might be useful in patients with hypertension, edema, or osteoporosis. Vitamin C can be given to promote wound healing. A good doctor-patient relationship is important in managing the patient on long-term GCS. The patient must return for regular visits and be encouraged to promptly report any adverse reactions to the physician. If these criteria are maintained and the strategies noted previously are followed, problems from long-term therapy with GCS will be minimized.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8785896/"}

No surveys of physicians have addressed this issue by proposing new information system technologies that augment prescription medication price transparency and measuring how receptive physicians are to using these novel solutions in their daily clinical practice. Our research aims to investigate these topics with a survey of physicians in dermatology. Members of the North Carolina Dermatology Association were contacted through their electronic mailing list and asked to take an online survey. The survey asked several questions about dermatologists' attitudes and beliefs about drug costs. To measure their knowledge of prescription medications, the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost was used as an authoritative price that was compared to the survey takers' price estimates of drugs commonly used in dermatology. Physicians' willingness to use four distinct information system technologies that increase drug price transparency was also assessed. Dermatologists believe drug costs are an important factor in patient care and believe access to price information would allow them to provide a higher quality of care. Dermatologists' knowledge of the costs of medicines they commonly prescribe is poor, but they want to utilize information system technologies that increase access to drug pricing information.

Although it most often starts in infancy and affects two of ten children, it is also highly prevalent in adults. It is the leading non-fatal health burden attributable to skin diseases, inflicts a substantial psychosocial burden on patients and their relatives, and increases the risk of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, and mental health disorders. Originally regarded as a childhood disorder mediated by an imbalance towards a T-helper-2 response and exaggerated IgE responses to allergens, it is now recognised as a lifelong disposition with variable clinical manifestations and expressivity, in which defects of the epidermal barrier are central. Present prevention and treatment focus on restoration of epidermal barrier function, which is best achieved through the use of emollients. Topical corticosteroids are still the first-line therapy for acute flares, but they are also used proactively along with topical calcineurin inhibitors to maintain remission. Non-specific immunosuppressive drugs are used in severe refractory cases, but targeted disease-modifying drugs are being developed.

With regards to the role of TLRs in pathogenesis of diverse cutaneous conditions, recent advances, as well as the future prospects of therapeutic implications of TLRs in cutaneous disorders is reviewed in this article. Although non-specific therapeutic strategies seem to reduce the symptoms in majority of patients, a considerable proportion remain untreated or have to deal with inevitable adverse effects of such therapies.

Although originally developed to facilitate glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a number of studies showed that these agents effectively inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and tissue inflammation. Many of the initial cell growth inhibition studies were conducted with malignant epithelial cells from various sites; however, in addition to malignant epithelial cells, other studies showed that rapidly proliferating epidermal keratinoctyes in culture were also sensitive to the growth-inhibiting action of these moieties. Additional studies subsequently demonstrated that some patients with plaque psoriasis responded to treatment with one or another member of the thiazolidinedione family. Due to the potential therapeutic benefit of these compounds in diseases such as psoriasis, studies have been conducted to elucidate mechanisms by which growth inhibition is achieved. Interference with a number of growth-influencing signalling pathways has been demonstrated. Of interest, some of the growth-inhibiting effects are seen under conditions in which PPAR-gamma activation may not be responsible for the activity. Based on therapeutic potential, additional ongoing studies are aimed at developing novel thiazolidinediones that may have better efficacy than the currently available agents.

Treatment of nail psoriasis should balance consideration of the extent of skin disease, psoriatic arthritis, and severity of nail disease with concomitant impairment of quality of life. All patients should be evaluated for onychomycosis because this may complicate psoriatic nail disease. For disease limited to the nails, high-potency topical corticosteroids with or without calcipotriol are initial options. For patients with significant nail disease for whom topical therapy has failed, treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, intralesional corticosteroids, ustekinumab, methotrexate sodium, and acitretin are recommended. For patients with significant skin and nail disease, adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab are strongly recommended, and methotrexate, acitretin, infliximab, and apremilast are recommended.

A multiple case study was conducted with 10 practice settings across England in which nurses prescribed medicines for patients with dermatological conditions. Data were collected between June 2006 and September 2007 using semi-structured interviews (n = 40), patient questionnaires (n = 165/200) and videotaped observations of nurse consultations (n = 40). Data analysis included thematic analysis, descriptive statistics, chi-square and non-parametric tests.

Listening and explanation of treatments were aspects of nurse communication that were rated highly by patients. Listening and dealing sensitively with emotions were also aspects of the videotaped consultations that were rated highly by assessors.

It usually begins in childhood, has a considerable impact on patients' quality of life, and incurs substantial healthcare costs. The standard-of-care treatments for patients with moderate to severe disease are very limited and have variable and typically insufficient efficacy and many side effects, some of which are quite serious. However, over the last decade, considerable advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis have paved the way for a number of new treatments. Most notable are the drugs that target the Th2-polarized immune system, which is thought to play a key role in many of the signs and symptoms characteristic of this disease. In this article, we briefly review the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, while noting that each patient's disease phenotype is likely due to a unique interplay of several disease-specific dysregulated pathways. Lastly, we cover emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis, focusing on those that target specific components of the immune system, which are altered in atopic dermatitis. The hope is that these new biologics or small-molecule antagonists, which have high specificity for their target molecules, will decrease the undesirable side effects caused by off-target effects commonly observed with current immunosuppressive agents that are characterized by broad biological actions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27371134/"}

We report a case of rosacea fulminans occurring at the onset of pregnancy and discuss a possible triggering role of endocrine factors, as well as therapeutic options. A 32-year-old woman with no previous history of dermatological disease consulted for rosacea fulminans appearing within the first three weeks of her first pregnancy, which required hormonal stimulation with recombinant FSH (follitropin alpha, Gonal F) and an LHRH inhibitor (cetrorelix, Cetrotide). She did not use topical corticosteroids or any other medication and had no other abnormalities at clinical examination. The skin disease lasted throughout pregnancy despite different treatments. After delivery, moderate improvement was observed within two weeks. Treatment with isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg/day was started three months after delivery and led to the disappearance of the papular and pustular lesions within three weeks, with persistence of the erythema for six months. The patient had never previously presented from acne or rosacea and the question of the responsibility of hormonal changes induced by stimulating ovulation or pregnancy can be raised. However, since her rosacea lasted throughout pregnancy, a causal role of the drugs used for ovarian stimulation appears unlikely. We suggest that pregnancy was the major triggering factor in this case. The recurrence of the skin disease on a subsequent pregnancy would constitute a strong argument to support this hypothesis and rule out simple co-incidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929918/"}

We report the simultaneous occurrence of bullous pemphigoid and primary biliary cirrhosis in an 86-year-old patient who also suffered from vitiligo. Multiple autoimmune syndrome, proposed by Humbert and Dupond, can be divided into three groups based on preferential associations of autoimmune disorders. The association of bullous pemphigoid, cirrhosis biliary primary and vitiligo has been reported three times in the literature. This association is probably not fortuitous and suggests a pathogenic relationship. This association is not typical of the multiple autoimmune syndrome as defined by Humbert and Dupond but the collection of such observations may contribute to revise the classification of autoimmune disease and provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of autoimmunity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12442082/"}
{"id": "12196891", "title": "Nonpsoriatic uses of calcipotriol.", "text": "Calcipotriol is a synthetic vitamin D3 analog that binds to vitamin D receptors in epidermal cells. In vitro studies have shown that calcipotriol stimulates terminal cell differentiation and has antiproliferative effects. In vivo, calcipotriol has been shown to reduce the number of cycling epidermal cells. Calcipotriol also has less effect on calcium metabolism than calcitriol, which is the natural, bioactive, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These properties make calcipotriol an ideal candidate for the topical treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders. While it has been approved for topical use in psoriasis, its potential for use in other dermatological disorders has not yet been fully investigated. This survey of the literature suggests that calcipotriol may show promise in the treatment of other conditions involving abnormal keratinization and hyperproliferation of epidermal cells. While some of these disorders are rare, and therefore difficult to study, further study into the nonpsoriatic uses of calcipotriol may be rewarding.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12196891/"}

Their excitation energies are correlated with conjugation length. We hypothesized that carotenoids whose energy states are above the singlet excited state of oxygen (singlet oxygen) would possess photosensitizing properties. Here, we demonstrated that human skin melanoma (A375) cells are damaged through the photo-excitation of several carotenoids (neoxanthin, fucoxanthin and siphonaxanthin). In contrast, photo-excitation of carotenoids that possess energy states below that of singlet oxygen, such as Œ≤-carotene, lutein, loroxanthin and violaxanthin, did not enhance cell death. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photo-excited fucoxanthin or neoxanthin was confirmed using a reporter assay for ROS production with HeLa Hyper cells, which express a fluorescent indicator protein for intracellular ROS. Fucoxanthin and neoxanthin also showed high cellular penetration and retention. Electron spin resonance spectra using 2,2,6,6-tetramethil-4-piperidone as a singlet oxygen trapping agent demonstrated that singlet oxygen was produced via energy transfer from photo-excited fucoxanthin to oxygen molecules. These results suggest that carotenoids such as fucoxanthin, which are capable of singlet oxygen production through photo-excitation and show good penetration and retention in target cells, are useful as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy for skin disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22185691/"}

Phytoconstituents, renowned for their diverse pharmacological attributes, present considerable promise in the management of various dermatological conditions. This review delineates the integration of phytoconstituents into ethosomal formulations, which are advanced lipid-based carriers specifically designed to enhance transdermal delivery. We discuss the advantages conferred by ethosomes, including their capacity to improve the stability and bioavailability of phytochemicals, facilitate deeper skin penetration, and provide controlled release profiles. Recent advancements in the formulation of ethosomes encapsulating a variety of phytoconstituents are highlighted, with a focus on their physicochemical properties, therapeutic efficacy, and safety profiles. Furthermore, the review examines the mechanisms by which ethosomes enhance the delivery of bioactive compounds to targeted skin layers, particularly in the context of treating conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Challenges associated with formulation stability and scalability are also addressed, along with potential future research directions in this domain. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying existing gaps, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of phytoconstituent-based ethosomes as a promising strategy for the development of effective and safe topical therapies for skin disorders. Ultimately, this review underscores the potential of these innovative formulations to improve patient outcomes and contribute significantly to the advancement of dermatological treatment options.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39870257/"}

It has recently been reported that azelaic acid is effective in treating these conditions and that it possesses anti-enzymatic and antimitochondrial activity, including cytochrome-P450 reductase and 5 alpha-reductase in microsomal preparations with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We therefore investigated the effects of azelaic acid on human neutrophil functions, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and ROS generation. ROS generation in a cell-free system was also assessed. The results revealed that neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis as well as ROS generated in a xanthine-xanthine-oxidase system were not significantly changed in the presence of azelaic acid. However, azelaic acid markedly decreased O2- and OH. generated by neutrophils. It may be concluded that the reported clinical effectiveness of azelaic acid is partly due to its inhibitory action on neutrophil-generated ROS, leading to a reduction both in oxidative tissue injury at sites of inflammation and in melanin formation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1867478/"}

To communicate the experience and recommendation of Brazilian dermatologists on oral use of the drug in dermatology. Eight experts from five universities were appointed by the Brazilian Society of Dermatology to develop a consensus on indications for this drug. Through the adapted DELPHI methodology, relevant elements were listed and an extensive analysis of the literature was carried out. The consensus was defined with the approval of at least 70% of the experts. With 100% approval from the authors, there was no doubt about the efficacy of oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne, including as an adjunct in the correction of scars. Common and manageable common adverse events are mucocutaneous in nature. Others, such as growth retardation, abnormal healing, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease have been thoroughly investigated, and there is no evidence of a causal association; they are rare, individual, and should not contraindicate the use of the drug. Regarding unapproved indications, it may represent an option in cases of refractory rosacea, severe seborrheic dermatitis, stabilization of field cancerization with advanced photoaging and, although incipient, frontal fibrosing alopecia. For keratinization disorders, acitretin performs better.

This non-adherence contributes to poor disease control and increased health care costs. However, it is unknown if assessment of these concerns might help to identify patients at risk of TCS-non-adherence. Clinical tools indicating non-adherence could be helpful to improve management of this patient group. To assess whether the available tools for measuring concerns regarding corticosteroids, the TOPICOP scale and the 0-10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), could help to detect non-adherence to TCS. In 75 patients with concerns regarding TCS use both the TOPICOP scale and VAS were anonymously assessed. A comparison was made between TCS-adherent and non-adherent patients regarding the intensity and characteristics of their concerns. The intensity and quality of the concerns varied broadly among the patients. When using the VAS, a score of ‚â•5 detected 87% of non-adherent patients. The answers to the TOPICOP scale did not discriminate non-adherent from adherent patients. Using the VAS to assess concerns to use TCS could help identify patients at risk of TCS-non-adherence and facilitate discussion with the patient about potential non-adherence in a more substantiated, non-judgemental way.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27396480/"}

In this study, we investigated the suitability of biodegradable poly-lactic acid (PLA) particles loaded with fluorescent dyes as carriers for transepidermal drug delivery. The penetration profiles of PLA particles (228 and 365 nm) and the release of dye from the particles were investigated in human skin explants using fluorescence microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. PLA particles penetrated into 50% of the vellus hair follicles, reaching a maximal depth corresponding to the entry of the sebaceous gland in 12-15% of all observed follicles. The accumulation of particles in the follicular ducts was accompanied by the release of dye to the viable epidermis and its retention in the sebaceous glands for up to 24 h. Kinetic studies in vitro as well as in skin explants revealed, that, although stable in aqueous solution, destabilization of the particles and significant release of incorporated dye occurred upon contact with organic solvents and the skin surface. These results suggest that particles based on PLA polymers may be ideal carriers for hair follicle and sebaceous gland targeting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19533305/"}

To investigate the safety, efficacy and utilization of phototherapy in elderly patients. In January 2014, we analysed all patients recently referred for, currently receiving or recently having completed a course of phototherapy at a university teaching hospital in England (UK). In total, 249 patients were identified; 37 (15%) were over the age of 65 years (the WHO definition of an elderly or older person). The dermatoses being treated were psoriasis (51%), eczema (11%), nodular prurigo (11%), pruritus (11%), Grover disease (5%) and others (11%). One patient with dementia was deemed not safe to embark on phototherapy, and five patients were yet to start. The remaining 31 elderly patients received 739 individual phototherapy treatments: 88% narrowband (NB)-UVB and 12% systemic, bath and hand/foot psoralen UVA (PUVA). The acute adverse event (AE) rate was 1.89%, all occurring in those receiving NB-UVB. No severe acute AEs occurred. Of those who completed their course of phototherapy, 80% achieved a clear/near clear or moderate response, while just two patients (8%) had minimal response and two (8%) had worsening of the disease during treatment. Of those receiving NB-UVB for psoriasis, 91% achieved a clear or near-clear response. In this small survey, the first of its kind to focus on elderly patients, phototherapy appears to be well-tolerated, safe and efficacious in the short term.

In addition to magnification, other technological advances have been made over the last century to improve our visual assessment of the skin. Examination of skin under ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with Wood's light, gained traction for its utility in assessing superficial cutaneous infections and pigmentary changes. During Wood's light examination, UV light is directed at the skin and fluorescence is detected by our eyes. The variable fluorescent characteristics of endogenous and exogenous cutaneous chromophores help us better diagnose skin disease. UV fluorescent photography is based on the same concept as the Wood's light, but also allows image analysis and documentation of the captured image. In addition to UV-induced fluorescence, the differential reflection and absorption of UV light captured in the UV spectral range can also provide a new contrast for diagnosing skin diseases during UV reflectance photography.

Of the acne treatments that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for ages 12 years and older, it is unclear which medications are being prescribed off-label for this younger patient population. The purpose of this study is to compare the therapies being prescribed to preadolescent patients with acne (defined in this study as ages 7 to 11 years) with those being prescribed to adolescent patients (ages 12 to 18 years) and to determine whether prescribing patterns differ between dermatologists and pediatricians. Leading therapies for the treatment of children with a diagnosis of acne were collected from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) from 1993 to 2009. Data were stratified according to age group and physician specialty. Physicians prescribed a wide variety of FDA-approved and off-label medications to preadolescent patients with acne. The leading medications were topical treatments, including adapalene (14.4%), benzoyl peroxide (12.8%), and tretinoin (12.5%). Treatment of this age group differed substantially between specialties, with dermatologists frequently prescribing topical retinoids and primary care physicians preferring antibiotics, particularly oral antibiotics. Limitations included a lack of data on acne severity and morphology through NAMCS, as well as the absence of longitudinal data. With the limited number of FDA-approved treatment options, off-label prescribing for acne in preadolescent patients is common. Furthermore, this study identified a potential knowledge gap between pediatricians based on their prescribing patterns in this patient population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23876222/"}

The somatic and psychosocial development of the children is also often severely affected by severe forms of the diseases. The concept of inpatient rehabilitation is, on the one hand, the development of an individually adapted topical therapy plan, which often follows a step concept and is adapted to the severity of the skin symptoms. On the other hand, the disease management of children and affected families is promoted. Specific skills such as dealing with itching, learning of cream and dressing techniques, as well as the targeted application of medical baths with suitable additives are taught and practiced. In addition, the motivation for an adapted dealing with the disease and specific resources is promoted in order to comply better with the considerable psychosocial burdens.The results after the rehabilitation show, depending on the basic disease, not only an improved skin condition but also an improved quality of life and participation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28395376/"}

At the interval of 30 min between SM exposure and iodine treatment, there was a significant degree of healing or recovery, albeit to a lesser extent than that observed in the shorter interval. Although the epidermal healing markers were not elevated, the parameters indicative of active tissue damage, such as subepidermal microblisters, epidermal ulceration, dermal acute inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis, were significantly reduced by 35, 67, 43, 39, and 45%, respectively. At the 45-min interval between exposure and treatment, there was also a certain degree of healing or recovery expressed as significant reductions in dermal subacute inflammation, subepidermal microblister formation, and epidermal ulceration, whereas, acanthosis was statistically elevated, indicating an increased healing potential. At the 60-min interval, iodine was less efficacious; nevertheless, a significant reduction in the incidence of subepidermal microblisters and an expansion of the acanthotic area were observed.

However, its prescription has become increasingly less frequent in dermatology practice. Little knowledge about its exact mechanism of action, lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry, the advent of new drugs, and the toxicity caused by the use of high doses of the drug are some possible explanations for that. Consequently, there are few scientific studies on the pharmacological aspects, dosage and efficacy of this drug. Also, there is no conventional standard on how to manipulate and prescribe the saturated solution of potassium iodide, which leads to unawareness of the exact amount of the salt being delivered in grams to patients. Considering that dosage is directly related to toxicity and the immunomodulatory features of this drug, it is essential to define the amount to be prescribed and to reduce it to a minimum effective dose in order to minimize the risks of intolerance and thus improve treatment adherence.

It must be considered today as a true public health problem and the most widespread metabolic bone disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Under physiological conditions, there is a balance between bone formation and bone resorption necessary for skeletal homeostasis. In pathological situations, this balance is altered in favor of osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption. During chronic inflammation, the balance between bone formation and bone resorption may be considerably affected, contributing to a net prevalence of osteoclastogenesis. Skin diseases are the fourth cause of human disease in the world, affecting approximately one third of the world's population with a prevalence in elderly men. Inflammation and the various associated cytokine patterns are the basis of both osteoporosis and most skin pathologies. Moreover, dermatological patients also undergo local or systemic treatments with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants that could increase the risk of osteoporosis.

The relationship between doctor and patient, the nature of disease, drug prices and the possibility of adverse side effects are also significant. Lack of involvement of patients in the treatment process is particularly evident in chronic diseases that require prolonged and regular treatment. Interpersonal skills of the clinician and a possibility to establish a good relationship between doctor and patient have strong influence on adherence. In the Internet age, patients often gain on their own information about their disease, which can both positively and negatively affect the healing process. For this reason, one of the factors that increase the compliance is a proper education of patients. In addition, the doctor may use several other useful methods to enhance the therapeutic effect.

Among nondermatologic medications, studies have shown a role for robust generic market competition in reducing drug prices. The association between competition and the costs of topical dermatologic generic drugs has not been evaluated. To characterize the association between changes in drug price and the number of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved manufacturers among the most commonly used topical dermatologic generic products. This retrospective cost analysis of the most commonly prescribed topical dermatologic generic drugs used cumulative annual claims data from the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public User File to identify 597 dermatologist-prescribed drugs with more than 10 claims. The number of manufacturers and the price per unit were identified from the FDA Orange Book and the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) database, respectively, for 2013 through 2016. Drugs that were nondermatologic, were not topically administered, were missing NADAC data, were lacking a generic formulation, or had fewer than 400 claims were excluded. Primary outcomes included per-unit drug price and number of FDA-approved manufacturers. Pricing measures were adjusted for inflation and are reported in 2016 dollars. The present analysis included 116 topical dermatologic generic formulations, representing 70.5% of the total Medicare Part D dermatologist-coded claims from 2015. Drug formulations with 1 to 2 manufacturers during the study period sustained a median percentage increase in price of 12.7%, whereas those with more than 6 manufacturers had a median percentage decrease in price of 20.5%. Formulations with 1 to 2 manufacturers had a 20.6%, 19.5%, and 33.2% higher percentage increase in price than those with 3 to 4 manufacturers, 5 to 6 manufacturers, and more than 6 manufacturers, respectively. There was a statistically significant inverse association between the percentage change in drug price and median number of manufacturers (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.26; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.005). The negative association between the change in drug price and the median number of manufacturers of generic topical dermatologic drugs indicates a role for market competition in controlling the costs of generic drug prices within dermatology.

This review focuses on the role of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), the principal endogenous metabolite of vitamin A (retinol) and its metabolism in oncology and dermatology. ATRA has been used successfully in differentiated therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia, skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and also in the treatment of acne and psoriasis. However, its usefulness is limited by the rapid emergence of acquired ATRA resistance involving multifactoral mechanisms. A key mechanism of resistance involves ATRA-induced catabolism of ATRA. Thus, a novel strategy to overcome the limitation associated with exogenous ATRA therapy has been to modulate and/or increase the levels of endogenous ATRA by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent ATRA-4-hydroxylase enzymes (particularly CYP26s) responsible for ATRA metabolism.

Of the psoriasis patients complaining of joint pain, only 33.0% had a diagnosis of PsA. An impact on daily activities or social/emotional well-being was recognized by 57.2% to 79.3% of physicians. In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, dermatologists reported 74.9% were receiving topical therapy, 19.5% conventional oral therapy and 19.6% biologics. Dermatologists and rheumatologists reported similar rates of topical (‚âà45%) and biologic (‚âà30%) therapy utilization for their PsA patients; conventional oral therapy was more often prescribed by rheumatologists (63.4%) vs. dermatologists (35.2%). Reasons for not initiating or maintaining systemic therapies were related to concerns about long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy and costs (biologics). Physicians in North America and Europe caring for patients with psoriasis and PsA acknowledge unmet treatment needs, largely concerning long-term safety/tolerability and efficacy of currently available therapies; evidence suggests underdiagnosis of PsA and undertreatment of psoriasis among dermatologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25885420/"}

There are many currently available TCS, which tend to be classified into groups based on potency. Unfortunately with modern TCS classification, there is no universally accepted system and many countries have their own independent sorting arrangement. The purpose of this review is to assess and compile available literature concerning TCS potency and the various classification systems.

Physicians, particularly general practitioners, dermatologists and gerontologists, must be aware of the problems that the treatment of psoriasis in the elderly can present. This is especially important because of the increased risk of adverse drug reactions in the elderly.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9534019/"}

To assess NCD prevalence and their influence on psoriasis treatment outcomes. From 2022 to 2024, we recruited psoriasis patients in Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital. Data on demographic features, NCD comorbidities and treatment outcomes at week 4 and week 8 were systematically collected through questionnaire, physical examination, and clinical severity assessment (psoriasis area and severity index [PASI], body surface area [BSA], physician's global assessment [PGA]). Among 1116 patients, 48.4% had at least one NCD comorbidity. NCD-free patients exhibited higher PASI<sub>50</sub> response rates at both week 4 (46.5 <i>vs.</i> 39.1%) and week 8 (72.2 <i>vs.</i> 70.9%). Log binomial regression revealed that NCDs significantly reduced the likelihood of achieving PASI<sub>50</sub> at week 4 (relative risk [RR]‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.96), with a similar but non-significant trend at week 8 (RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92-1.06).

Patients with these 'specific' manifestations have varying degrees of systemic involvement from rare systemic disease in patients with localized discoid lupus erythematosus to common and often severe involvement in patients with acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Patients who do not demonstrate interface dermatitis also may have systemic disease and in some instances the skin manifestations are linked to some of the more severe systemic manifestations. Many patients with cutaneous lesions characterized by the interface dermatitis can be controlled with 'standard' therapies including sunscreens, protective clothing and behavioural alteration, and topical corticosteroids with or without an oral antimalarial agent.

The majority of individuals have psoriasis in limited areas and topical products are the mainstay of therapy according to existing guidelines. It is known that medication adherence rates are lower for topical treatment than for systemic treatment. Poor medication adherence is a major multidimensional problem for patients with chronic disorders as it is associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes, increased risk for development of concomitant diseases and inefficient use of health resources. Despite four decades of adherence research and the large number of studies that have identified the importance of medication non-adherence, there are relatively few studies reporting and designing effective strategies to improve adherence. The aim of this article was to report and describe non-adherence in the topical treatment of psoriasis, the factors that might contribute to this phenomenon, and which interventions have so far been developed for the management of chronic conditions. This article proposes that given that the barriers to medication adherence are complex and varied, solutions to improve adherence and thus clinical outcomes must be multifaceted and must also provide the possibility to be tailored according to each patient's individual needs. Such an individualized and comprehensive adherence-enhancing intervention would probably enable the successful long-term management of this disabling chronic condition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24684738/"}

For scalp psoriasis, clearance was achieved with 13 courses, marked improvement with 19, minimal improvement in 3 and no change with 1. Treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis/hyperkeratotic eczema showed clearance with 7 courses, marked improvement with 9, minimal change with 2 and no change with 4. Of the courses for nail dystrophies (mainly psoriasis), clearance occurred with 1, marked improvement with 7, minimal change with 8 and no change with 11. In addition to immediate outcomes, the remission times were also evaluated. For scalp psoriasis, only 8 of the initial 32 patients still had clearance or marked improvement at the most recent follow-up. For nail dystrophy, 3 of 8 patients remained in remission, while for hyperkeratotic eczema/psoriasis, 7 of the initial 16 patients who had clearance or marked improvement had sustained this improvement, and only 1 patient with palmoplantar pustulosis still had clearance at the most recent follow-up.

A healthy 39-year old woman consulted for a 3-year history of a painless, non-pruritic eruption. She had multiple erythematous-purplish macules on the lower limbs. A skin biopsy showed severe lymphocytic arteritis with fibrinoid necrosis of the vascular wall and endoluminal thrombus, associated with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. This inflammation concerned the arteries of the deep dermis and of the superficial hypodermis. There were no neutrophils or eosinophils. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of any extracutaneous signs. The clinical peculiarity of macular arteritis is the non-infiltrated and painless character of the primary lesion, in contrast with the classic lesions described in vasculitis, which are palpable and sometimes painful. In all cases described, the course is indolent with no associated systemic signs. The distinguishing histopathological characteristic is the presence of an intense lymphocytic infiltrate all around the arterial wall, associated with hyalinised necrosis and thrombosis of the vascular lumen. The histological picture is unusual and does not correspond to classical arterial abnormalities, in particular periarteritis nodosa.

Topical corticosteroids can lead to cutaneous and systemic adverse events. The purpose of this expert consensus panel was to review published literature on the safety and efficacy of topical corticosteroids and role for advanced targeted topical therapies for inflammatory skin diseases. A comprehensive literature search was completed using a combination of keywords: \"topical,\" \"corticosteroid,\" \"non-steroid,\" \"efficacy,\" \"adverse effects,\" \"malpractice,\" and \"inflammatory skin diseases.\" Articles were screened for relevance to topic of safety and efficacy of topical corticosteroids and noncorticosteroid therapies for inflammatory skin diseases. A panel of four dermatologists with expertise treating inflammatory skin diseases reviewed the articles and created consensus statements. A modified Delphi process was used to approve each statement and a strength of recommendation was assigned. The literature search produced 350 articles. A screening of the studies resulted in 24 articles that met criteria. The panel unanimously voted to adopt 10 consensus statements and recommendations. Topical corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids are associated with numerous adverse effects, and medical-legal risks for clinicians prescribing these medications exist. Advanced targeted topical therapies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness as an alternative to corticosteroids.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40526929/"}

After ligand activation (often lipid metabolites), these intracellular receptors exert their functions by binding to specific response elements in regulatory sequences of target genes, preferentially those involved in differentiation, energy expenditure and lipid metabolism. A number of selective activators has been developed by combinational chemistry, initially for their anti-diabetic and lipid lowering properties as well as their ability to regulate bile acid and drug metabolism.

Several recent studies on calcium hydroxyapatite in filling treatments and facial volumetry, in esthetics, but also in HIV patients, have been published. It was also tested in accentuated melomental folds where it is superior to hyaluronic acid. In aging of the skin of the dorsal aspect of the hands, hyaluronic acid provides slightly better results than collagen. Filler rhinoplasty can correct minor deformations of the nose. Lipofilling is advantageous for linear scleroderma of the face, at least in the forehead region, and adipocyte stem cells may be a future solution for facial aging or lipoatrophy. The risk of local and/or general sarcoid reactions related to interferon in patients having undergone filling injections has been reported. In the field of laser treatment, fractionated photothermolysis has motivated much more research and seem particularly valuable in treating acne scars, aging of the dorsal aspect of the hands, and, more anecdotally, in colloid milium and pearly penile papules. Laser is also useful in preventing surgical scars where a mini-diode can also be used. For axillary hyperhidrosis, subdermic Nd-YAG laser competes with botulinum toxin, with longer-lasting results. Solutions are appearing for treatment of red or white striae cutis distensae.

Additionally, distinctive cutaneous inflammation can often be observed. For most of the patients these diseases lead to a significant restriction in quality of life. The diagnostic criteria include clinical and histological findings, often confirmed by specialized tests. Because many of the ichthyoses are extremely rare, their accurate diagnosis is often carried out in specialized centers. We summarize isolated vulgar and congenital ichthyoses both with and without associated symptoms and focus on the common genetic changes and their clinical phenotype. Specific therapies are still not available for most of these genetic disorders. The use of different topical agents (e. g. urea, retinoids and salicylic acid) and baths followed by mechanical keratolysis (sometimes in combination with systemic retinoids) reduce symptoms. Patients with uncommon congenital ichthyoses often benefit from interdisciplinary management which involves specialized dermatological centers. In this first part of the paper the vulgar ichthyoses as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic options are discussed. The second part focuses on the congenital ichthyoses and their differential diagnosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19192163/"}

Juvenile GPP is a rare severe form of psoriasis occasionally associated with life-threatening complications.

However, there is a lack of data in the optimal treatment course of infliximab for juvenile GPP. Prolonged administration of these medications may cause toxic or fatal complications. We suggest that short-term infliximab regimen should be recommended as a choice for acute juvenile GPP refractory to traditional systemic therapies. WBC count and CRP are sensitive parameters to reflect the disease activity and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. Monitoring CD4 T lymphocyte count, preventing and correcting CD4 lymphocytopenia are important in the treatment course of juvenile GPP.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26627198/"}

{"id": "17312367", "title": "Limitations of skin protection.", "text": "Skin protection products and gloves are essential constituents of personal protective equipment at workplaces, which can be used in a complementary way, each offering particular benefits and disadvantages. In many workplace situations, both measures are being used either in an alternating or in a combined manner, typically in professions with exposures to mild irritants and a high wet-work load, such as hairdressers, healthcare workers or employees in the food-processing industry. Skin protection creams can be used to reduce unnecessarily long glove usage in order to reduce occlusion-related effects on the skin barrier. Whenever rotating machines are used, these products are the only option due to safety regulations. However, some particular requirements can be postulated for skin-protective products claimed especially to be used in combination with gloves. Reduction of glove-induced perspiration, of stratum corneum swelling, and postocclusive barrier impairment are intended attributes of such products, which have been already successfully implemented in some commercially available products. On the other hand it has to be proven that the ingredients do not interfere with the glove material, neither in the way of degrading the material, thus making it permeable for harmful substances, nor by enhancing the potential release of rubber allergens. Examples out of the literature are reviewed showing that skin products can exhibit unpredictable effects on the allergen release of rubber materials, if not thoroughly tested for this purpose beforehand. Some raw materials should be avoided in protection products, though they are of established value when used in afterwork emollients to accelerate barrier recovery. Usage of moisturizers, in contrast to special barrier products, at the workplace together or even under gloves is therefore judged critically, although selected products showed beneficial effects in particular experimental settings. Another future option is the implementation of 'active gloves' that are intended to gradually release ingredients that help to strengthen and preserve skin barrier integrity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17312367/"}

The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the long-term prognosis of AIBDs that started during childhood. We conducted a monocentric retrospective study, in the French dermatology centre, by including all children affected by AIBDs. The long-term outcome was obtained through a phone call questionnaire. Sixty-three patients were included from January 1993 to December 2015, 34 female and 29 males: 27 Linear immunoglobulin A disease (LAD), 12 bullous pemphigoid (BP), 12 pemphigus, 8 herpetiform dermatitis (DH) and 4 epidermolysis bullosa aquisita (EBA). The mean age was 4.7¬†years old. Twenty-five patients were lost during the follow-up. For the 38 remaining patients, the mean follow-up duration for all pathologies was 6.6¬†years. Twenty-nine of them had at least one relapse. Late relapses were observed in two cases of DH and six cases of pemphigus (7-34¬†months). The mean treatment duration was 30.6¬†months with variability according to the AIBDs. Topical corticosteroids were used alone, effectively, for seven patients and in association with other treatment in 19 patients in complete remission. Complete remission was noted in 34/38 children with a follow-up of 4.4¬†years (0.08-19.5). The mean duration to complete remission was 30.5¬†months (6-114¬†months). Late nasal synechiae were reported in one EBA only. There was no significant associated comorbidity, but an association with a primary immune deficiency (PID) was observed in two cases. Childhood AIBDs appear to be of good overall prognosis but a long-term follow-up is mandatory, as relapses can be late, except for BP. The use of topical corticosteroids is frequently effective alone or in association.

The therapist must strive to relieve the symptoms and also to provide long-lasting prevention of recurrences, especially in chronic skin diseases. Clinical experience has shown complementary procedures, especially the classical naturopathy, to be promising supplements to conventinal therapy. Proof of efficacy in dermatological applications has been found in controlled studies for some of these procedures. By far the majority of these applications in dermatology still require controlled investigation. The required efficacy studies should orient to internationally accepted criteria for clinical studies and record not only clinical efficacy but also quality of life factors and cost of treatment in a therapy comparison. Psychosomatic relationships play a particular role in dermatological treatment. In addition to their importance as occasional originators or potentiaters of skin disease, emotional factors are crucial in the secondary stress associated with the disease due to the numerous visible effects on the skin. An integrative dermatological therapy makes the attempt both to determine and to treat the co-eliciting emotional factors and to support the patient's mode of coping with the disease. The doctor-patient relationship is especially important here. In summary, conventional, complementary and psychosomatic procedures can be mutually beneficial in dermatological therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10352373/"}

Studies assessing the proportion of subjects achieving 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) within a 12-week period were included. Studies on pediatric populations and psoriatic arthritis were excluded. The weighted average of PASI-75 for each reported regimen was calculated to determine the efficacy of biologic agents used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Tolerance and secondary efficacy measures were also examined for the selected studies. FDA-approved regimens of adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, and alefacept were effective in treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Based on the current evidence, methotrexate and biologics should not be discontinued for psoriasis patients with low disease activity. However, the doses of these medications could be tapered by reducing the maintenance dose or increasing the between-dose intervals. If the disease recurs, methotrexate and biologics should be restarted at their standard doses, and for cyclosporine, the dose can be maintained or discontinued progressively.

Articles also suggested that dermatology may differ from general medicine as topical treatments have fewer side effects, are more complicated to use, and come in different vehicles. We identified few studies specifically focused on issues relevant to sampling in dermatology. There are strong arguments for and against drug sampling involving both cost and quality of care issues. Dermatology-specific medications clearly differ from oral medications in several regards. We ultimately conclude that the benefits of drug sampling outweigh the risks, but give recommendations on how drug sampling can be done ethically and effectively, including limiting personal use, not selling samples, properly documenting sample release, teaching patients about proper use, teaching students and residents ethical use of samples, working with pharmaceutical representatives in an ethical manner, prescribing the drug that is best for the patient, and securing samples appropriately to prevent theft and misuse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172623/"}

It is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder leading to keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Psoriasis has genetic predisposition that is further aggravated by certain stimulating factors. In spite of significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the exact etiology of the disease remains unknown. The clinical manifestations of this disease include various forms that affect different parts of the body. Treatment options vary according to the mode of application or severity of the disease. Earlier treatments have included application of emollients or keratolytic agents to hydrate the skin or shed off the skin. But later treatments have been modified to treat the underlying T-cell proliferation. Hence, topical treatments like coal tar, vitamin D, retinoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors for treating mild psoriasis, systemic treatments including methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, hydroxyurea, as well as light therapy for severe psoriasis have become more prominent. Current treatment modalities are associated with the risk of serious side effects from prolonged treatment. Combinations of these therapies have provided effective and rapid modalities to suppress the disease and reduce the side effects of treatment. In addition, newer carrier systems for conventional drugs are being developed to improve the effectiveness of treatment and reduce the side effects. Development of biologics and gene therapy have revolutionized the treatment of this skin disease.

Rosacea is characterized by facial flushing, erythema, chronic inflammation, edema and fibrosis. Several trigger factors can worsen the disease or cause recurring episodes of inflammation. Although some aspects in the pathophysiology of rosacea have been characterized in more detail during the past years, the precise interplay of the various dysregulated systems is still poorly understood. In early disease manifestations and milder stages, dysfunction of neurovascular regulation and the innate immune system seem to be driving forces in rosacea pathophysiology.

Crisaborole, a nonsteroidal topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor (PDE4i), has been utilized in treating AD. Crisaborole regulates the production of inflammatory cytokines, which are usually overactive among AD patients. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of crisaborole in treating AD in patients aged ‚â§18 years. <b>Methods</b> A literature search was performed across PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria involved primary studies evaluating the effect of crisaborole in treating dermatitis, articles exploring the use of crisaborole in AD patients below 18 years (>two years), and articles published in English between 2000 and 2022. However, the studies evaluating AD in adult patients, those reporting treatments other than crisaborole, those published before 2000, and articles written in languages other than English were excluded from this analysis. Furthermore, secondary data sources such as case reports, newspaper articles, magazines, and other systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. The risk of bias in the manuscripts was assessed using the Cochrane tool. The I-square test statistic was used to determine heterogeneity, and Egger's test was used to evaluate publication bias. <b>Results</b> Ten studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Most of the studies exhibited a low risk of bias with no publication bias. Meta-analysis indicated a significant difference in the number of patients attaining Investigator Static Global Assessment (ISGA) success at day 29, with significantly higher patients in the crisaborole group than in the vehicle group (odds ratio (OR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 77%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001).

In regards to the immediate type allergic response, there is no debate about the importance of histamine. In addition, histamine has immunomodulatory functions, some of which are related to the histamine H2 receptor. However, with the discovery of the histamine H(4) receptor in the year 2000, the role of histamine as an immunomodulator became more obvious. The histamine H(4) receptor is expressed on several hematopoietic cells; along with the chemotaxis of immune cells, this recently characterized receptor modulates also the cytokine and chemokine secretion of some hematopoietic cells. Highly selective histamine H(4) receptor antagonists display promising results in animal models of allergic inflammatory diseases and also in in vitro studies on animal and human cells. These first results indicate that the histamine H(4) receptor is an interesting new pharmacological target for the treatment of allergic inflammatory disorders.

Targeted biologics have changed the outcome for patients in a variety of diseases including psoriasis. Ixekizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A and it has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and recently also psoriatic arthritis. <b>Areas covered</b>: In this review, we summarize the latest clinical study results on ixekizumab. Long-term Phase III study data on efficacy and safety are now available for both plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, new indications for ixekizumab are under investigation. <b>Expert commentary</b>: Overall, the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab are promising. In plaque psoriasis, the efficacy of ixekizumab was superior to etanercept and ustekinumab, while the efficacy was comparable to adalimumab in psoriatic arthritis. The safety profile has also been found very tolerable and similar to other biologics; however, vigilance regarding non-invasive <i>Candida</i> infections is necessary. Also, caution is advised when treating patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, since ixekizumab could cause exacerbations.

More commonly encountered in patients with a past negative experience, this effect stems from highly active processes in the central nervous system, mediated by specific neurotransmitters and modulated by psychological mechanisms such as expectation and conditioning. The magnitude of nocebo effect in clinical medicine is being increasingly appreciated and its relevance encompasses clinical trials as well as clinical practice. Although there is hardly any reference to the term nocebo in dermatology articles, the phenomenon is encountered routinely by dermatologists. Dermatology patients are more susceptible to nocebo responses owing to the psychological concern from visibility of skin lesions and the chronicity, unpredictable course, lack of 'permanent cure' and frequent relapses of skin disorders. While finasteride remains the prototypical drug that displays a prominent nocebo effect in dermatologic therapeutics, other drugs such as isotretinoin are also likely inducers. This peculiar phenomenon has recently been appreciated in the modulation of itch perception and in controlled drug provocation tests in patients with a history of adverse drug reactions. Considering the conflict between patients' right to information about treatment related adverse effects and the likelihood of nocebo effect stemming from information disclosure, the prospect of ethically minimizing nocebo effect remains daunting.

While there is currently no cure for psoriasis, many treatment options are available. Topical therapies are the mainstay for the majority of patients who have limited or mild psoriasis. Among these medications, topical vitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriene) and corticosteroids (eg, betamethasone), and these drugs in combination, are the most widely prescribed psoriasis drugs and are the cornerstone of topical therapies. For patients with more severe disease, phototherapy, conventional systemic agents, and biologics are often indicated. Currently, the goal of treatment is to control the clinical symptoms of the skin, reduce systemic disease potential, and improve the patient's quality of life. Despite the availability of various therapeutic options for psoriasis, many patients go untreated, and even among those who are treated, many do not achieve complete resolution of the disease. The new consensus is to treat to a target of 1% or less of body surface area involvement. Innovative treatment strategies are needed to meet this goal and patients' desire to achieve clear skin. Combination therapies are widely used by physicians, and adjunctive topical therapies used with other antipsoriatic regimens have been demonstrated to provide many clinical benefits.

To discuss the evolving pathophysiology of rosacea, factors involved in promoting the chronic vascular and inflammatory abnormalities seen in rosacea, and the available drug therapies for the condition. Chronic inflammation and vascular changes are believed to be underlying factors in the pathophysiology of rosacea. Aberrant cathelicidin expression, elevated kallikrein 5 (KLK5) proteolytic activity, and altered toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression have been reported in rosacea skin leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Until recently, drug therapies only targeted the inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and transient erythema associated with these inflammatory lesions of rosacea.

The classification and pathogenesis of this condition are still obscure. To classify IAD and study its pathogenesis. From our cohort of 5402 cases of autoimmune bullous disease, we selected 49 cases of various types of intercellular IgA dermatosis (IAD) and 13 cases of classical subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD), for which sera and information were available. We studied these cases clinically and immunologically. There were 17 SPD-type IAD, 12 intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis (IEN)-type IAD, two IgA-pemphigus vegetans, four IgA-pemphigus foliaceus, six IgA-pemphigus vulgaris and eight unclassified IAD cases. There was no sex predominance, and the average age at disease onset was 45¬∑9¬†years. Clinically, bullous and pustular skin lesions developed on various sites, particularly intertriginous areas. Histopathology showed intraepidermal blisters or pustules at the upper epidermis in the SPD-type and at the midepidermis in the IEN-type. Immunological studies revealed that direct immunofluorescence, indirect immunofluorescence of normal human skin and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) of recombinant proteins of desmogleins and desmocollins frequently showed positive results, although no antigens were detected in many cases. All cases of classical SPD, which showed no positive immunological results, were indistinguishable clinically and histopathologically from SPD-type IAD. The present study of the largest cohort of cases of IAD showed that the¬†major subtypes are SPD and IEN, and that the combination of indirect immunofluorescence and ELISAs of desmogleins and desmocollins, in addition to direct immunofluorescence, was useful for the diagnosis of IAD and its subtypes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27258999/"}

Statins are commonly used in clinical practice to lower cholesterol concentration and, accordingly, decrease the individual risk of developing a cardiovascular episode. There have been reports that statin administration could also result in better management of psoriasis. The observed beneficial effects are contributed to the effects on lipid metabolism, including that in skin, as well as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of statins. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were found to improve the clinical outcome in patients with psoriatic skin lesions. Clinically, the effectiveness of this novel treatment was confirmed by the significant reduction in PASI score.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues suppress endogenous sex hormones, thus avoiding the onset of acne in prepubertal individuals. To identify the specific issues of acne in transgender patients and propose suitable medical care for dermatologists. A group of five experts on acne reviewed and discussed 68 publications regarding the issue of acne in transgender patients. Key words included \"acne+transgender\", \"acne+transgender+treatment\", \"transgender+skin¬†diseases+treatment\", \"transmen+acne+treatment,\" and \"transwomen+acne+treatment\". The gender affirming process in transgender patients requires a multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, psychiatrists, cardiologists and dermatologists, especially if the hormonal treatment causes or worsens acne. Treatment of \"transgender\" acne differs from \"classic\" acne treatment. The administration of masculinizing hormones frequently causes moderate to severe acne which requires the administration of oral treatments involving specific conditions of use and, conversely, the use of feminising hormones reduces the risk of more severe forms of acne. However, mild to moderate acne may persist, requiring topical treatments that may further increase skin dryness and irritation. The risk of relapse after stopping treatment may be very high and justifies a maintenance topical treatment. The use of ceramide-enriched emollients is mandatory in all patients.

Although normally presenting to physicians at an early stage and with an indolent course, mycosis fungoides can have a varied presentation. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has created guidelines for the treatment and staging of mycosis fungoides. Although comprehensive, in practice these guidelines do not provide specific treatment regimens for lesions located in difficult locations and those recalcitrant to the recommended therapy. Because of this, suggestions based on the practices and decisions made at the multidisciplinary cutaneous lymphoma clinic at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, are presented here. Lesions located in areas such as the face and intertriginous zones are often challenging to treat because first-line therapies are often inappropriate, with the locations increasing the possibility of side effects. Additionally, lesions located in the bathing suit distribution are often nonresponsive to first-line therapies for reasons still undetermined. Finally, although well-described, erythroderma secondary to mycosis fungoides is challenging to treat, with controversy surrounding various methods of control. This article both highlights difficult clinical scenarios and reviews the recommended treatment as provided by the NCCN guidelines and provides alternative therapy for lesions that are either difficult to treat because of the location or are recalcitrant to the recommended therapy. With suggestions for the apparent gaps in guidelines, providers can better treat patients who present with more complicated conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30993584/"}

Studies have depicted that the epidermal cell cycle of psoriatic lesions is shortened by approximately eight-fold more than normal. The lesions are classified as erythrosquamous, due to the erythema which develops asa result of involvement of the vasculature, and the involvement of the epidermis with scale formation. The diagnosis of psoriasis can usually be established on clinical grounds. If the clinician is in doubt, a small cutaneous punch biopsy and subsequent histopathological examination can be performed. There are multiple therapeutic options for psoriasis. First-line therapy for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis is the application of topical agents, followed by phototherapy (UVB) for more extensive disease.

Skin care belongs to the core activities of nursing practice. Especially in aged and long-term care settings, clients are vulnerable to various skin conditions. Dry skin is one of the most prevalent problems. Using mild skin cleansers and the regular application of moisturizing leave-on products is recommended. Until today, there are no quantitative empirical data about nursing skin care practice at home in the community. A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2012. Home care clients from the German home care nursing setting were randomly selected. Instructed nurse raters performed the data collection using standardized forms. Variables included demographics, skin care needs and skin caring activities. Approximately 60% of home care clients received skin care interventions. The majority were washed and two-thirds received a leave-on product once daily. There was large heterogeneity in cleansing and skin care product use. Most often the product labels were unknown or product types were selected haphazardly. Skin care interventions play a significant role in home care and nurses have a considerable responsibility for skin health. Skin care provided does not meet recent recommendations.

Despite its efficacy, limitations such as incomplete responses and pain have motivated the exploration of protocol enhancements. This review examines the clinical and biological rationale for light fractionation-dividing the total light dose into two separate exposures with a dark interval-as a strategy to improve PDT outcomes. We reviewed preclinical and clinical studies evaluating fractionated illumination using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or methyl aminolevulinate (MAL). The findings consistently demonstrate superior efficacy of fractionated schemes, particularly with ALA, showing higher complete response rates in AK, superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC), and Bowen's disease (BD), and improved long-term tumor control compared to single illumination. The better outcomes are attributed to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation following tissue reoxygenation during the dark interval and greater susceptibility of partially damaged cells to subsequent illumination. Fractionated PDT also shows a favorable safety and cosmetic profile. These results support considering light fractionation protocols as a standard approach for optimizing PDT efficacy in dermatologic oncology, particularly in lesions with limited depth and high recurrence risk.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40869373/"}

It can be caused by the withdrawal of corticosteroids and, among its extra-cutaneous manifestations, liver abnormalities are frequently under-reported or attributed to drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and laboratory data, treatment options, and disease outcome in patients with AGPP and to search for significant differences between subgroups of these patients. This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical files from inpatients with AGPP observed in our department between 1973 and 2008. Statistical tests were performed at a significance level of 5%. This was an inpatient, single-center study. Outcome measures were a previous history of psoriasis, corticosteroid use before admittance, mortality rate, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and abnormalities in liver enzymes. A total of 34 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of whom 61% were men and 65% had a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris. Topical corticosteroids were applied by 50% of patients before admittance. Skin lesions remitted with methotrexate, etretinate, or acitretin treatment in all but two patients who died of sepsis. Abnormalities in liver enzymes were present in 47% of patients. Patients without a previous history of psoriasis had a significantly younger age at the first episode of AGPP. In the comparison between the groups of patients with and without liver abnormalities, a male preponderance and higher leukocyte counts were found in the former, with a positive correlation between the absolute neutrophil count and total bilirubin also being observed. Previous use of retinoids or methotrexate was not associated with these hepatic alterations. Limitations of the data were that this was a single-center, retrospective study with a small sample size. Withdrawal of systemic or topical corticosteroids can precipitate or worsen AGPP and these agents should not be used in these patients. Liver abnormalities can be considered an extra-cutaneous manifestation of AGPP. As in other series, no association between the use of drugs and changes in liver tests was found and therefore the deleterious withdrawal of efficient drugs, namely acitretin and methotrexate, should be avoided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21495733/"}

People with acne find the condition especially difficult to manage because of the disease's chronicity and variability in response to treatment. Acne is the result of pores clogged with shed skin cells combined with sebum in the hair follicle. Successful treatment of acne is important because acne has the potential to result in lasting physical and emotional scarring. For many years, physicians have agreed that although cleansing is not effective on its own, effective cleansing is an important part of any acne treatment regimen. However, patients have not been satisfied with the types of cleansers available. In addition to containing dyes and perfumes that can irritate and exacerbate acne, these cleansers often are too harsh and can result in excessive drying of the skin, which leads to overcompensation by the oil glands and ultimately to more oil on the surface of the skin. This study examined the use of a daily facial cleanser formulated for normal to oily skin in subjects with mild facial acne. The cleanser was studied for 2 weeks in the absence of additional treatments to eliminate the confounding effects of various treatments. Subjects were monitored for skin barrier function through transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and corneometry, sebum level, and lesion counts.

This multicentre study included 260 adult AD patients, with 184 undergoing a full TPE programme and 76 control patients. Evaluations included disease severity, quality of life (DLQI), and systemic treatment use. The primary goal was to measure AD improvement, with secondary goals assessing DLQI score changes and systemic treatment use. AD severity improved in 64.7% of TPE patients vs 45.7% of controls (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008). The mean DLQI score dropped by 5.7 points in the TPE group vs 2.4 points in controls (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006). Additionally, 69.8% of TPE patients had a DLQI score ‚â§‚Äâ4/30 compared with 50% of controls (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.025). Regarding therapeutics, 83.6% of patients naive to systemic treatment at inclusion were maintained exclusively under topical treatment vs 21.7% in the control group. The likelihood of needing systemic treatment was 66% in controls vs 6% in the TPE group. TPE enhances AD severity and quality of life, ensures better disease control, and reduces systemic treatment use, highlighting its importance in managing adult AD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39670437/"}

Occasionally, isolated scalp involvement is observed; and this causes significant psychosocial morbidity. Management of scalp psoriasis is difficult, in part due to the difficulty of applying topical agents and its refractory nature. Various treatment options are available with variable efficacy. Topical agents include topical steroids, keratolytics, tar and anthralin compounds, vitamin D analogues, and vitamin A derivatives. The combination treatment of topical betamethasone and calcipotriene is the most effective topical therapy. Systemic agents include conventional agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and oral retinoids. Biologics offer a greater efficacy, with near complete or complete clearance of the scalp.

Acne is an inflammatory disorder in whose emergence androgens, PPAR ligands, the IGF-1 signaling pathway, regulating neuropeptides and environmental factors are probably involved. These factors interrupt the natural cycling process in the sebaceous gland follicle and support the transition of microcomedones to comedones and inflammatory lesions. Proinflammatory lipids and cytokines are mediators for the development of acne lesions. Bacterial antigens can potentate the inflammatory phenomena. Acne is predominantly treated with combination therapy. Selecting a treatment regimen depends on the exact classification of acne type and severity. The development of scars is the main criterion for the choice of systemic therapy. Retinoids for mild comedonal acne and the combination of retinoids with antibiotics and/or benzoyl peroxide for mild to moderate papulopustular acne are the drugs of first choice for topical treatment. The use of topical antibiotics is not recommended any more because of the development of resistant bacterial strains. Systemic antibiotics, in combination with topical retinoids and/or benzoyl peroxide, for moderate papular/nodular acne and isotretinoin for severe nodular/conglobate acne are the columns of systemic acne treatment. Systemic anti-androgens are used in women against moderate papulopustular acne.

PRP occurs equally in men and women. In some patients, associated autoimmune diseases, infections, or malignancies are possible trigger factors. PRP shows a bimodal age distribution, peaking in the first as well as in the fifth to sixth decade. Its classification into five subgroups is based on age at onset, clinical course, morphologic features, and prognosis. More than 50% of patients are best classified as type I with adult-onset PRP. This form is also characterized by high spontaneous remission rates (80%) within 1-3 years. Clinically, the classical adult (type I) and classical juvenile (type III) forms appear to be the same except for the patient's age. Recently, the designation of a new category of PRP (type VI) has been proposed that is characterized by the presence of HIV infection with different clinical features and a poorer prognosis. Typical morphologic features of PRP are erythematosquamous salmon-colored plaques with well demarcated islands of unaffected skin. Often, keratoderma of the palms and soles is present. In patients with extensive disease, ectropion is a dreaded complication. Histology shows hyperkeratosis, alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in a checkerboard pattern, and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis. Descriptions and therapeutic experiences are mainly based on case reports. Mostly, systemic retinoids, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressive agents as well as UV light therapy are applied, with varying response rates.

The modified presentation supports the understanding of the dynamics and underscores that in dermatological care not only direct health effects of climate and environmental changes have to be dealt with, but also with an increasing number of mental illnesses, which in turn are to be regarded as direct and indirect health effects. Coping with the predicted increase in the burden of disease and the decline in the available labor force associated with demographic change poses a¬†major challenge. In order to maintain the functionality of the healthcare system, the prompt implementation of resource-efficient, sustainable measures in all areas of society is essential. The integrative consideration of dermatological and psychological complaints in the context of climate and environmental changes requires the adaptation of content for the education, training, and continuing education of specialists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39117980/"}

The classic presentation is of well-defined red plaques with silver scale. The characteristic scale makes the disorder highly visible and intrusive on the patient's lifestyle. The visible nature of the disease ensures that psoriasis has both physical and psychosocial effects. In normal skin, epidermal cell reproduction and proliferation takes 28 days. In psoriasis, this process is considerably accelerated to approximately four days, resulting in the deposit of immature cells on the skin. While the exact cause of this process is unknown, certain environmental and genetic factors are known to be provoking factors. Disease management will be dependent on disease severity, psychosocial effects and the patient's lifestyle. To effectively treat this disease the nurse must be skilled in psoriasis management, and in patient education and motivation.

No systematic reviews on the topic have focused on the term newborn. The objective of this review was to determine, for the well term baby, if the use of soaps or detergents in bath water is associated with the development of dry, cracked, or flaking skin in the perinatal period, and short- and long-term consequences of the use of emollients, lotions, or moisturizers for dry skin. We conducted a structured systematic review of prospective studies involving term newborns. No relevant studies were located. No prospective studies of research in skin care involving the term newborn were found. Some recommendations for skin care may balance risk and benefit for the compromised infant, but this balance may be different for the healthy term newborn. Clinical practitioners should be aware that outcomes related to the use of soaps, detergents, emollients, and lotions on the term neonatal skin have not been formally investigated. Systematic reviews that yield no formal results provide insights into unresearched areas of practice, and should be reported to highlight these deficits, and to avoid duplication of effort by future investigators.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16128978/"}

A previous study suggested that dogs treated with oclacitinib in an Australian referral hospital required fewer courses of antimicrobial therapy compared to dogs receiving other anti-pruritic treatments. This study aimed to quantify the effect of oclacitinib treatment on the use of antimicrobials and other therapies in general practice veterinary clinics across Australia. A retrospective case-controlled review of patient records was designed to investigate the number of courses of antimicrobials and other therapies in dogs that received oclacitinib (Apoquel¬Æ), compared with those who received an anti-pruritic treatment that was not oclacitinib. The target population included canine patients with a presumptive diagnosis of allergic dermatitis presenting between 2008 and 2018 to general practices contributing to the VetCompass Australia database. Patient records of interest were identified using search terms relating to allergic dermatitis, resulting in over 700,000 observations. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to determine whether cases were prescribed fewer antimicrobial courses than controls, after adjusting for the presence of concurrent skin infections or infectious agents in ears. Our results indicate that fewer antimicrobial courses were prescribed in the cases compared to the controls. After adjusting for the concurrent skin infections, there was a significant reduction in the use of cefovecin [OR:0.62(0.39-0.98), P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043], chlorhexidine [OR:0.57(0.42-0.77), P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001], neomycin [OR:0.4(0.28-0.56), P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001] and amoxycillin clavulanic acid (AMC) [OR: 0.55(0.39-0.78), P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001] in cases compared to controls.

{"id": "40056037", "title": "MOAT: MobileNet-Optimized Attention Transfer for Robust and Scalable Dermatology Image Classification.", "text": "In recent times, dermatological disease is a common health issue around the world. Timely and accurate dermatological disease detection is mandatory for proper treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. Prior to this, various detection and classification methodologies were developed for the early prediction of skin disease using dermatology images. However, they have struggled with poor detection accuracy and require high computational time. This research proposes a novel MobileNet-Optimized Attention Transfer framework for the accurate classification of skin disease. In this study, the MobileNet model is deployed for feature extraction, which integrates the self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. The attention mechanisms prioritize essential features within the images and allow the model to identify the subtle patterns associated with various skin conditions. For hyperparameter tuning, an Optical Microscope Algorithm with an initial search strategy is applied. The algorithm iteratively fine-tunes the parameters to balance global and local search and prevent the model from converging on suboptimal configurations. The performance of the proposed method is validated using the Skin Cancer ISIC dataset and the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset and compared to existing skin disease classification methodologies in terms of some common assessing metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the MobileNet-Optimized Attention Transfer framework effectively classified the dermatological disease and achieves a high accuracy of 98.89%, a lower mean squared error of 0.186, and a low computational time of 1.53‚Äâs compared to existing methodologies. This result indicates that the proposed framework is a scalable, adaptable solution for clinical applications, aiding dermatologists with reliable diagnostic support and enabling early intervention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40056037/"}

The mechanism of action is anti-inflammatory, rather than immunosuppressive. For pretreatment, consider testing full blood count (FBC), liver and renal function, non-fasting lipids, hepatitis serology, HbA1c and glucose. Body mass index and abdominal circumference should also be measured. Optional investigations in at-risk groups include an HIV test, a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and a chest X-ray. In patients without complications, repeat the FBC at 2-4¬†weeks, then every 3-6¬†months and the liver/renal function test at 3¬†months and then every 6¬†months. There is little evidence that a MTX test dose is of value. Low-dose MTX rarely causes clinically significant hepatotoxicity in psoriasis.

To identify and achieve consensus on refined, specific treatment goals for GPP treatment via a Delphi panel with patient participation. Statements were generated based on a systematic literature review and revised by a Steering Committee. Statements were categorized into overarching principles, and short- and long-term treatment goals. A global panel of 30 dermatologists and 3 patient representatives voted in agreement or disagreement with each statement. Consensus was defined as ‚â• 80% approval by the panellists. Consensus was reached in the first round of voting and ‚â• 90% agreement was reached for 23 of 26 statements. In summary, GPP requires a timely, tailored treatment plan, co-developed by patients and physicians, that involves a multidisciplinary approach and addresses the complexity, heterogeneity and chronicity of the disease. Short-term treatment goals should include pustule clearance within 7‚ÄÖdays and prevention of pustule recurrence, reduction of cutaneous symptom burden (-4 or more points on the Itch and Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale), improvement in systemic symptoms (e.g. resolution of fever within 3‚ÄÖdays of treatment initiation and reduced fatigue), prevention of life-threatening complications and progressive improvement of inflammatory biomarkers. In patients with comorbid psoriatic diseases, treatment decisions should prioritize GPP. Long-term treatment goals should include minimizing disease activity through flare prevention and symptom control between flares, sustained disease control, management of comorbidities and improvement in quality of life (QoL). Small differences in perception between patients and physicians regarding the importance of certain treatment goals (e.g. avoiding hair and/or nail loss to improve QoL), reflect the complexity of assessing treatment goals and emphasize the need for a patient-centred approach. In the first global Delphi panel in GPP to include patient perspectives, consensus between dermatologists and patients was achieved on overarching principles of treatment, and short- and long-term treatment goals for GPP.

This chronic condition not only contributes to stigmatization and mental health challenges but also poses an independent risk for cardiovascular and other comorbid diseases. Affecting approximately 60 million people globally, psoriasis manifests primarily as mild-to-moderate disease in about 80% of cases, where topical therapy is pivotal. The most commonly used topical antipsoriatic therapy involves a combination of vitamin D3 analog (calcipotriene - Cal) and a synthetic potent corticosteroid (betamethasone dipropionate - BD). Various formulations of Cal/BD, including ointment, gel (topical suspension), and aerosol foam, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cream based on the PAD (Polyaphron Dispersion) technology is another formulation of this combination drug, expanding the therapeutic options for patients with psoriasis.

With actinic keratosis and skin cancer prevalence increasing as the aged population expands in the US, optimizing treatment strategies may produce cost savings for the healthcare system. Since the time of our last review in 2008, investigation of the economic considerations in treating actinic keratosis has advanced. To provide an update of treatment cost effectiveness and to review factors relating to the costs of care, we conducted a systematic review of pharmacoeconomic publications since December 2008. We identified 11 pharmacoeconomic studies, with one cost-of-treatment, five cost-effectiveness, and five cost-utility analyses. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was well tolerated and produced a favorable cosmetic outcome in most studies. Ingenol mebutate, the newest but most expensive topical field therapy, 5-fluorouracil, and PDT were the most cost-effective treatments in our review. Patient adherence to therapy and the management of adverse effects were significant contributors to treatment costs. In the US, treatment guidelines and formalized cost-effectiveness analyses for actinic keratosis are absent from the recent literature. Future pharmacoeconomic investigation will depend on up-to-date comparative efficacy data, as well as clarification of rates of, and management strategies for, adverse effects, therapeutic non-adherence, and lesion recurrence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27785771/"}

A survey was conducted in which internists reported their self-perception regarding their abilities in dermatology, the amount of dermatology training they had received, and the percentage of patients they encounter with and treat for skin diseases. This was correlated with results from an objective photographic (Kodachrome) examination assessing their diagnostic abilities in dermatology. The setting was university and private practices in Miami, Fla, and New Haven, Conn. The participants were general internists, medical subspecialists, and medical residents. After completing a self-administered questionnaire, each physician then participated in an examination where they were shown 20 color photographs of common skin disorders. We correlate the relationship between the survey variables and the results of the photographic examination. Eighty-four internists diagnosed 50.5% of the diseases correctly. Internists perceive themselves as mediocre in dermatology (2.6, on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best), which correlated with their poor performance on the photographic evaluation (P = .04). Internists reported having limited education or training in dermatology (> 85% having < 1 month of training in or after medical school). There was a trend toward a correlation between the amount of training internists received and their ability in dermatology (P = .07). Notably , there was no correlation between internists' ability in dermatology and the percentage of patients they encounter with and treat for skin disease. Internists receive limited training and have resultant poor performance in diagnosing skin disease. Internists are aware of their limited ability in dermatology as demonstrated by their mediocre self-perceived ability. Notably, no correlation was found between internists' abilities in dermatology and the percentage of patients they encounter and treat for skin disease.

The use of the drug has been highly variable because of differences in compounding, and as a result, the literature reports vary widely in the concentrations used for sensitization and challenge treatment with DPCP. The efficacy of DPCP has generally been ascribed to immunological reactions by the host. Inducing inflammation with a contact sensitizer is counterintuitive to treating AA, an autoimmune disorder. We have hypothesized that the body's attempt to downregulate the inflammation caused by the contact sensitizer may also ameliorate AA. Studies using microarray and miRNA profiling may provide information about how DPCP induces inflammation in human skin at different times. Gene targets and microRNAs identified through these data may be modulated by an RNA interference approach to enhance DPCP efficacy and response rates.

Males are more satisfied with their psoriasis treatment and respond better to biologics. Females have a significant higher rate of adverse events and drug-related discontinuation rate compared to males. About conventional systemic treatments for psoriasis during pregnancy, only cyclosporine is suggested when the benefits exceed the potential side effects, whereas methotrexate is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and in the three months before fatherhood and motherhood.

In addition to skin manifestations, this condition may be accompanied by fever, muscle pain, joint pain, systemic inflammation, or organ failure. GPP during pregnancy poses a serious threat to both mother and fetus, with limited options for medication. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of secukinumab during pregnancy as a treatment option for psoriasis. We report the case of a 35-year-old pregnant woman presenting with extensive, confluent erythematous scaly plaques and numerous pustules, accompanied by fever. Over the past few years, her lesions showed remission following treatment with corticosteroids, traditional Chinese medicine, and secukinumab. However, after a brief remission with spesolimab, the lesions recurred and no significant improvement was obtained with glucocorticoid therapy. Secukinumab treatment was then initiated. Secukinumab was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300‚Äâmg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. Following treatment, GPP symptoms were reduced, and fetal development remained normal.

Nail psoriasis is also considered a risk factor for the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Management of nail psoriasis is deemed challenging and as a result, it is often left untreated by physicians. Assessing the severity of nail disease can also be difficult in clinical practice. While the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index is used widely in trials, it is time-consuming and rarely used in the clinic, highlighting the need to develop a simplified disease severity score for nail psoriasis. All patients should be advised to keep their nails short, wear gloves for wet and dirty work, and regularly apply emollient to the nail folds and nail surface. Patients with mild nail psoriasis, without signs of severe cutaneous psoriasis or PsA, may benefit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail involvement.

This Special Communication examines Kodachrome's contributions to the field of dermatology, as well as its lessons for improving inclusive representation of patients of all skin tones in 21st century dermatologic curricula. Kodachrome's color quality, its slide transparency format, and its broad commercial availability democratized the creation, sharing, and teaching of visual information about skin disease in the 20th century. Kodachrome's usefulness as a complement to bedside teaching modernized medical school curricula, dermatologic conferences, and the American Board of Dermatology certifying examination, which inspired the Kodachrome-style of didactic that remains central to dermatologic training programs today. However, Kodachrome film was also the product of a prejudiced era when color film technology and photographic best practices were optimized for white skin. These biases are still evident in industry standards, photographic techniques, and the historically unjust representation of skin of color in educational resources. Kodachrome film contributed substantially to shaping 20th-century medical education; however, its legacy is a reminder that diverse and inclusive image representation in dermatologic curricula is vital to counteracting implicit biases, correcting assumptions about disease epidemiology, and providing high-quality care for patients of all skin tones.

Receptors for TNF are found on virtually all cell types, and many physiologic processes seem to be altered by TNF-alpha. The understanding of how TNF-alpha is involved in the pathophysiology of diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, has allowed the development of new drugs that can interfere with excess TNF-alpha and thus has allowed novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As the role of TNF-alpha in other diseases becomes better understood, such TNF-alpha-modulating drugs may find further applications. In the skin, TNF-alpha is prominent cytokine that seems to be important in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and inflammatory skin conditions. Modulating TNF-alpha activity in the skin may provide therapeutic benefits for a variety of skin conditions (Table 4). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels are elevated in skin lesions of psoriasis. A few reports have already suggested that etanercept and infliximab may offer a therapeutic effect in patients with psoriasis. Clinical studies evaluating the true efficacy of these drugs in psoriasis are under way. Specifically, the authors and others are involved in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of etanercept for psoriasis. Thalidomide has been used off-label with some success to treat a number of dermatologic diseases, including several inflammatory skin conditions. Etanercept and infliximab might perhaps prove efficacious for inflammatory skin conditions as well. Finally, it is possible that drugs targeting TNF-alpha may have yet-unrecognized serious side effects. Because TNF-alpha seems to be a central cytokine in UVR-induced apoptosis, the chronic use of TNF-alpha-altering drugs might increase the risk for skin cancers. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha also plays some role in cutaneous wound healing; the effect these drugs might have on this process is also unknown at this time.

The databases Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL (1990-2012), Scopus, SCI (February 2013) and reference lists were searched. Inclusion criteria were primary intervention studies using skin care products in physiologically aged skin (lower age limit 50 years). Study and sample characteristics, interventions and outcomes were extracted. The methodological quality was assessed and a level of evidence was assigned. From 1535 screened articles 188 were read in full text. From these, 33 articles were included reporting results on treating dry skin conditions, and preventing incontinence-associated dermatitis and superficial ulcerations. Most studies had lower levels of evidence of 3 or 4. Skin-cleansing products containing syndets or amphoteric surfactants compared with standard soap and water washing improved skin dryness and demonstrated skin-protecting effects. Moisturizers containing humectants consistently showed statistically significant improvements in skin dryness. Skin barrier products containing occlusives reduced the occurrence of skin injuries compared with standard or no treatment. Owing to methodological limitations the current evidence base for basic skin care in the aged is weak. Using low-irritating cleansing products and humectant- or occlusive-containing moisturizers seems to be the best strategy for maintaining the skin barrier function and integrity. We know little about the effects of cleansing regimens and about the benefits of moisturizers when compared with each other.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23773110/"}

{"id": "29782305", "title": "Tatami Mats: A Source of Pitted Keratolysis in a Martial Arts Athlete?", "text": "Dear Editor, Pitted keratolysis (PK), also known as keratosis plantaris sulcatum, is a non-inflammatory, bacterial, superficial cutaneous infection, characterized by many discrete superficial crateriform ''pits'' and erosions in the thickly keratinized skin of the weight-bearing regions of the soles of the feet (1). The disease often goes unnoticed by the patient, but when it is noticed it is because of the unbearable malodor and hyperhidrosis of the feet, which are socially unacceptable and cause great anxiety to many of the patients. PK occurs worldwide, with the incidence rates varying based on the environment and occupation. The prevalence of this condition does not differ significantly based on age, sex, or race. People who sweat profusely or wash excessively, who wear occlusive footwear, or are barefoot especially in hot and humid weather are extremely prone to this condition (2). Physicians commonly misdiagnose it as tinea pedis or plantar warts. Treatment is quite simple and straightforward, with an excellent expected outcome if treated properly. We report a case of a 32-year-old male patient with skin changes of approximately one-year duration diagnosed as plantar verrucae, who was referred to our Department for cryotherapy. The patient presented with asymptomatic, malodorous punched-out pits and erosions along with hyperkeratotic skin on the heel and metatarsal region of the plantar aspect of both feet. The arches, toes, and sides of the feet were spared (Figure 1). Except for these skin changes, the patient was healthy and denied any other medical issues. He was an athlete active in martial arts and had a history of sweating of feet and training barefoot on the tatami mat for extended periods of time. The diagnosis of PK was established based on the clinical findings (crateriform pitting and malodor), negative KOH test for hyphae, and a history of prolonged sweating in addition to contact of the skin with tatami mats, which are often a source of infection if hygiene measures are not adequately implemented. Swabs could have been helpful to identify causative organisms, but they were not crucial for the diagnosis and treatment. The patient was prescribed with general measures to prevent excessive sweating (cotton socks, open footwear, and proper hygiene), antiseptic potassium permanganate foot soaks followed by clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide 5% in a gel vehicle twice daily. At the one-month follow-up visit, the skin changes, hyperhidrosis, and malodor were entirely resolved (Figure 2). Pitted keratolysis is common among athletes (3,4). The manifestations of PK are due to a superficial cutaneous infection caused by several bacterial Gram-positive species including Corynebacterium species, Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus congolensis, Actynomices keratolytica, and Streptomyces that proliferate and produce proteinase and sulfur-compound by-products under appropriate moist conditions (5-7). Proteinases digest the keratin and destroy the stratum corneum, producing the characteristic skin findings, while sulfur compounds (sulfides, thiols, and thioesters) are responsible for the malodor. Athletes and soldiers who wear occlusive footwear for prolonged periods of time or even barefooted people that sweat extensively and spend time on wet surfaces such as laborers, farmers, and marine workers are more prone to this problem (3,4,8-11). Martial arts athletes are at greater risk of skin infections due to the constant physical contact that can lead to transmission of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens directly but also indirectly through contact with the mat and the skin flora of an another infected individual. A national survey of the epidemiology of skin infections among US high school athletes conducted by Ashack et al. supported the prevalent theory that contact sports are associated with an increased risk of skin infections. In this study, wrestling had the highest skin infection rate of predominantly bacterial origin (53.8%), followed by tinea (35.7%) and herpetic lesions (6.7%), which is consistent with other literature reporting (12). Being barefoot on the tatami mat in combination with excessive sweating and non-compliance with hygiene measures makes martial arts athletes more susceptible to skin infections, including PK. The diagnosis is clinical, by means of visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. Dermoscopy can be useful, revealing abundant pits with well-marked walls that sometimes show the bacterial colonies (13). Cultures, if taken, show Gram-positive bacilli or coccobacilli. Because of the ease of diagnosis on clinical findings, biopsy of pitted keratolysis is rarely performed. Skin scraping is often performed to exclude tinea pedis, which is one of the main differential diagnosis, the others including verrucae, punctate palmoplantar keratoderma, keratolysis exfoliativa, circumscribed palmoplantar hypokeratosis, and basal cell nevus syndrome. If unrecognized and left untreated, skin findings and smelly feet can last for many years. Sometimes, if unrecognized, PK can be mistreated with antifungals, or even with aggressive treatment modalities such as cryotherapy. Appropriate treatment includes keeping feet dry with adequate treatment of hyperhidrosis, preventive measures, and topical antibiotic therapy. Topical forms of salicylic acid, sulfur, antibacterial soaps, neomycin, erythromycin, mupirocin, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide, clotrimazole, imidazoles, and injectable botulinum toxin are all successful in treatment and prevention of PK (14,15). Topical antibiotics are the first line of medical treatment, among which fusidic acid, erythromycin 1% (solution or gel), mupirocin 2%, or clindamycin are the most recommended (14). As in our case, a fixed combination of two approved topical drugs - clindamycin 1%-benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, had been already demonstrated by Vlahovich et al. as an excellent treatment option with high adherence and no side-effect (16). The combined effect of this combination showed signiÔ¨Åcantly greater effect due to the bactericidal and keratolytic properties of benzoyl peroxide. Additionally, this combination also lowers the risk of resistance of causative microorganisms to clindamycin. Skin infections are an important aspect of sports-related adverse events. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, dermatologists are not the only ones who should be aware of the disease, but also family medicine doctors, sports medicine specialists, and occupational health doctors who should educate patients about the etiology of the skin disorder, adequate prevention, and treatment. Athletes must enforce the disinfecting and sanitary cleaning of the tatami mats and other practice areas. Keeping up with these measures could significantly limit the spread of skin infections that can infect athletes indirectly, leading to significant morbidity, time loss from competition, and social anxiety as well.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29782305/"}

The overall problems lead to a decrease in the quality of life of the child and its parents and to an increased risk of psychosomatic diseases. The complex pathomechanism of AD is due to chronic inflammation of the skin, in which various cell phenotypes are involved.

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the pathogenesis and treatment of rosacea based on the dermatology and ophthalmology literatures. Literature searches were conducted for rosacea and ocular rosacea. Preference was given to systematic reviews, meta-analysis, case-controlled studies, and documented case reports while excluding poorly documented case studies and commentaries. The data were examined and independently analyzed by more than two of the authors. Rosacea is a complex inflammatory condition involving the pilosebaceous unit. Its underlying mechanism involves an interplay of the microbiome, innate immunity, adaptive immunity, environmental triggers, and neurovascular sensitivity. The latest classification of rosacea includes three dermatologic subgroups and a fourth subgroup, ocular rosacea. Ocular rosacea clinically displays many features that are analogous to the cutaneous disease, such as lid margin telangiectasia and phlyctenulosis. The role of environmental triggers in the exacerbation of ocular rosacea appears to be understudied. While lid hygiene and systemic treatment with tetracycline drugs remain the mainstay of treatment for ocular rosacea, newer dermatologic targets and therapies may have potential application for the eye disease. Ocular rosacea appears to embody many of the manifestation of the dermatologic disease. Hence, the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms of the ocular and cutaneous disease are likely to be shared. Better understanding of the ocular surface microbiome and the immunologic mechanisms, may lead to novel approaches in the management of ocular rosacea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32586107/"}

Acne therapy is made more complicated by the diversity of presentation that includes age, gender, race, underlying skin type, product adherence, lesion morphology, and severity. A panel of 6 dermatologists with expertise in the treatment of acne met twice for consensus conferences in March and November 2024. Discussion included the generation of 13 common disease presentations, the identification of potential cases to illustrate the presentations, and the design of 2-month case studies utilizing acneceuticals. Panelists chose new or established patients in their care who fit into the predetermined categories, provided them with the agreed-upon acneceuticals, and followed them for 2 months. Ten cases were chosen to comprise the most common therapeutic crossroads where pharmacologic or procedural interventions were not providing satisfactory control. This case study series included patients who were medication-intolerant, failing internet cures, not fully responsive to their current regimen, adult female acne patients with concomitant aging concerns, those needing maintenance therapy, and patients with issues regarding access to care. Acneceuticals were found to play an important role as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, and maintenance therapy for acne patients. The 10 cases elucidated the ability of these over-the-counter (OTC) actives to improve patient care under several clinical scenarios.

Topical therapy is widely used to treat mild-moderate acne and is known as well-tolerated thanks to its low systemic toxicity, although associated to skin adverse effects. Acne seems to be associated also to an intrinsic alteration of the epidermal barrier, regarding both the upper and the follicular stratum corneum that promotes the onset of such local side effects. The commonest one is irritant contact dermatitis, an event of frequent observation occurring with erythema, burning, dryness, scaling, and itching, usually characterized by low severity and limited duration. Among topical acne drugs, retinoids are the most irritating ones. Another side effect is allergic contact dermatitis: it is rare and mainly associated to benzoyl peroxide.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26302055/"}

{"id": "40772752", "title": "Updated Swiss Practice Recommendations for the Treatment of Acne.", "text": "Acne is one of the most common skin diseases. It has a high impact on the quality of life of the affected patients. It is now recognized that in some patients, acne shows characteristics of a chronic disease. Because of a lack of current recommendations/guidelines in Switzerland, a group of hospital and private practice based dermatologists, specialized in acne, as well as an experienced general practitioner revised the available literature on acne and its treatment. The group subsequently developed several consensus statements regarding grading, treatment and monitoring of acne. The first version of the recommendations was published in 2020 and is now being updated. The experts agreed that acne severity should be determined by a subjective method and that, for short-term therapy, treatment success is defined as an approximately 50‚Äâ% reduction of inflammatory lesions within 3 months. The choice of induction treatment is based on the severity of the disease. Its main component is a topical retinoid alone or - in more severe case - in combination with benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Only in moderate to severe forms of acne or if a more rapid resolution of inflammatory lesions is desired, a systemic antibiotic should be added to induction treatment. For severe acne with a tendency to scarring, systemic retinoids are the induction treatment of choice in the absence of contra-indications. Maintenance therapy is indicated in all patients with acne, independent of disease severity. The choice of maintenance therapy should always be based on acne severity, duration of disease, current treatment and history of relapse. The preferred options for maintenance therapy are topical retinoids with/without BPO. While treating acne, a special focus should lie on the prevention of scars. For this reason, patients should be evaluated 3 months after treatment initiation to determine whether they have responded or whether further therapeutic options should be considered. The expert group also recommends counselling patients on nutrition, psychological aspects, stress, use of contraceptives, skin care, use of cosmetics and use of other drugs (like steroids). Monitoring of patients with acne should particularly focus on adherence to treatment and quality of life. Patients with severe forms of acne (acne with a tendency of scarring, patients with acne conglobata or acne fulminans), patients with insufficient treatment response after 3 months and patients with frequent relapses should be referred to a dermatologist.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40772752/"}

The diagnosis of plaque psoriasis is usually straightforward, a helpful diagnostic clue is the tendency for silver scales to appear after gentle scratching of a lesion. Stress, streptococcal infection and drugs including beta-blockers, antimalarials and lithium may precipitate or exacerbate psoriasis. Psoriasis, especially when severe, predisposes to metabolic syndrome, and patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia. Additionally, psoriasis sufferers appear at increased risk of uveitis, inflammatory boweldisease, lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, COPD and venous thromboembolism. Psoriasis should be assessed on the basis of: severity, impact on physical, psychological and social wellbeing, symptoms of arthritis and the presence of comorbidities. Poor response to topical therapy may be as much to do with lack of compliance as with lack of efficacy. The number of treatments each day should be kept to a minimum, and patients should be reviewed after four weeks when initiating or changing topical therapy to improve adherence to treatment and assess response. The majority of patients with psoriasis can be managed in primary care, although specialist care may be necessary at some point in up to 60% of cases.

It is characterized by distinct erythematous plaques shielded with conspicuous silvery scales that shows up in different areas of the skin. Knowledge of pathophysiology, especially the pathogenesis of psoriasis, has significantly progressed in the recent decade. Advancement in molecular knowledge leads to better understanding of the disease, thus influencing the development of efficient treatment modalities. However, even with the availability of various options of treatment most of the efficient treatment modalities are costly. Expenses of health care bring about major financial weight to the patients as well as to health care systems. Thus, it was important to review the available current treatment options and those which are under development, in terms of efficacy, safety and cost to assist in selecting the most appropriate treatment for psoriasis patients. Literatures were searched by using key words psoriasis, topical treatment, systemic treatment, biologics and phototherapies, on Embase, Medline, Jstor, Cochrane and Merck Index databases. Life-style choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and stress are recognised as risk factors and triggers associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis poses psycho-social and economic burden on affected patients that sometimes leads to depression, reduced social interaction and suicidal tendencies in patients. Depending on the type, severity and extent of the disease, comorbidities, patient preference, efficacy and safety profile, numerous treatment modalities and therapeutic agents are available such as topical, systemic, biologic and phototherapeutic treatments.

Recently, there has been tremendous scientific interest in novel, safe, and effective topical agents to manage melasma. Objective: To evaluate topical treatments for melasma and provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical use and further research. Methods: We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on topical agents for the treatment of melasma on March 4th, 2019 using PRISMA guidelines. Clinical recommendations were based on the American College of Physicians guidelines. Results: After screening, we identified 35 original RCTs using azelaic acid, cysteamine, epidermal growth factor, hydroquinone (liposomal-delivered), lignin peroxidase, mulberry extract, niacinamide, Rumex occidentalis, triple combination therapy, tranexamic acid, 4-n-butylresorcinol, glycolic acid, kojic acid, aloe vera, ascorbic acid, dioic acid, ellagic acid and arbutin, flutamide, parsley, or zinc sulfate for melasma. Conclusions: Cysteamine, triple combination therapy, and tranexamic acid received strong clinical recommendations for the treatment of melasma. Cysteamine has excellent efficacy and is reported to have anti-cancer properties, but has not been directly compared with hydroquinone. Triple combination agents and tranexamic acid are effective, but carry theoretical risks for ochronosis and thrombosis, respectively. Natural compounds are associated with low risk for adverse events, but more research is needed to determine the efficacy, optimal formulation, and appropriate concentration of novel treatments.

Afamelanotide binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), and MC1R signaling increases melanin synthesis, induces antioxidant activities, enhances DNA repair processes and modulates inflammation. The loss-of-function variants of the MC1R present in fair-skinned Caucasians are less effectively activated by the natural hormone. Afamelanotide was the first Œ±-MSH analogue to be applied to human volunteers. Ten daily doses of between 0.08 and 0.21¬†mg/kg in saline injected subcutaneously resulted in long-lasting skin pigmentation and enabled basic pharmacokinetics. Subcutaneous application had full bioavailability, but neither oral nor transdermal application resulted in measurable plasma concentrations or pigmentation response. Two trials in human volunteers showed that neither MC1R variants nor fair skin reduced the afamelanotide-induced increase in skin pigmentation. A controlled-release formulation optimizes administration in man and is effective at a lower dose than the daily saline injections. Promising therapeutic results were published in polymorphic light eruption, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), solar urticaria, Hailey-Hailey disease and vitiligo. In 2014, afamelanotide was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP.

In female adolescent and adults of childbearing potential, topical retinoids should be used with caution, because they are contraindicated in pregnant females (FDA Pregnancy category) C (adapalene, tretinoin) and X (tazarotene).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32347138/"}
{"id": "20336617", "title": "[Atopic dermatitis - current insights into path physiology and management].", "text": "Atopic eczema (AE) is a multifaktoriell skin disease caused by a variety of factors such as genetic conditions, alterated skin structure, immunologic deviations, psychological and environmental factors, among others. There are two main subtypes of AE, i.e. the IgE-associated (\"extrinsic atopic eczema\") and the non-IgE-associated type (\"intrinsic atopic eczema\") with different prognosis concerning the development of respiratory diseases (\"atopy march\"). The role of allergens varies: while in early childhood food allergens may play a role, mites and microbial antigens may become more relevant in adolescence and adulthood. Recently, it was demonstrated that Filaggrin is a major gene for atopic eczema. The altered skin structure and a deficiency in antimicrobial peptides favour colonization with Staphylococcus aureus; their enterotoxins with superantigenic activity stimulate activation of T cells and macrophages. Also sensitization to the yeast Malassezia spp. occurs almost exclusively in AE patients. So far, AE skin lesions are orchestrated by the local tissue expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with activation of T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, keratinocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils which lead to the skin inflammatory responses. From the therapeutic point of view, a step wise approach using emollients as a basic treatment is recommended. Modern topical corticosteroids of moderate to medium potency applied once per day and only on several days per week offer an efficient anti-inflammatory treatment with moderate side effects. Topic immunomodulatory drugs (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) have in addition substantially improved the treatment of AE. Proactive treatment approaches also in disease-free intervals may reduce exacerbations and total drug use. Phototherapy and wet dressings are both efficient and safe additional tools in more severe forms. For generalized severe forms systemic drugs such as Cyclosporin A are very helpful. Various Biologicals and antipruriginous substances are under clinical investigation and may add to an improved therapy in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20336617/"}

Although various treatments are available, they often cause adverse effects, prompting the exploration of alternative therapies. Curcumin, a bioactive compound in <i>Curcuma longa</i> Linn. (turmeric), has demonstrated potential benefits in managing psoriasis. This article aims to comprehensively evaluate the anti-psoriatic activity, efficacy, and safety profiles of curcumin and its novel formulations, as well as to discuss future directions for enhancing their use as an alternative treatment for psoriasis. Curcumin exerts its anti-psoriatic effects through multi-targeted actions, including inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhancing skin barrier proteins, thereby alleviating psoriasis lesions. However, both oral and topical curcumin formulations face challenges, such as low bioavailability and limited skin penetration, underscoring the need for novel formulations to improve therapeutic outcomes. Clinical findings suggest that oral curcumin may provide greater efficacy and better tolerance as an adjunctive therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis, while topical formulations may help reduce severity and improve well-being in mild to moderate cases. Overall, curcumin and its novel formulations show promise as therapeutic agents for psoriasis treatment. However, further research, particularly large-scale clinical trials, is essential to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety comprehensively.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40589446/"}

Several new systemic treatments have recently been approved for use in patients with moderate to severe AD. However, head-to-head comparisons have not been conducted for all the currently available treatments for AD. Multiple network meta-analyses have compared efficacy of these different therapies during the initial 16-week treatment period, but not beyond week 16. Therefore, understanding the differences in key trial design and statistical methods is essential for evaluating long-term efficacy, making cross-trial comparisons, and informing treatment decisions. This focused narrative review provides an overview of data and trial methodology to guide clinicians in evaluating longer-term efficacy and safety of currently approved systemic treatments for patients with AD. We discuss important elements of longer-term trial designs and statistical analysis strategies that should be considered based on our experience as clinical trialists. In addition, a summary of key efficacy results of published, longer-term, phase III clinical trials of US Food and Drug Administration-approved, novel systemic treatments (i.e., dupilumab, tralokinumab, abrocitinib, and upadacitinib) is provided, including the design and data handling methods used. Long-term safety considerations and differences in the time-effect and safety profiles of various medications are also noted to help inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

{"id": "40474034", "title": "Is There a Place for Biologics in Acne?", "text": "Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a multifactorial pathogenesis involving follicular hyperkeratinization, sebaceous gland dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis-particularly involving Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis-and complex immune-mediated mechanisms, on which T helper cell 1 (T<sub>h</sub>1) and T<sub>h</sub>17 pathways are central players. This evolving understanding has led to the exploration of biologic therapies targeting cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFŒ±), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-17, and IL-23. However, clinical trials to date have not demonstrated efficacy of biologics in moderate to severe acne. In contrast, some case reports and studies suggest clinical improvement with TNFŒ± and IL-17A inhibitors in severe, treatment-resistant acne, although these presentations often overlap with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), raising questions about diagnosis and underlying disease mechanisms. Furthermore, in various monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes where \"acne-like\" lesions are part of the clinical spectrum, biologic therapies have shown effectiveness. These observations suggest that in such contexts, the lesions may reflect HS or HS-like pathology rather than true acne, potentially explaining the therapeutic benefit of biologicals in this context. This review synthesizes current insights into the immunopathogenesis of acne and critically evaluates the rationale, evidence, and limitations of biologic therapy in its treatment. While biologics hold promise in defined inflammatory dermatoses, their role in the management of acne vulgaris remains unproven and may be limited to specific phenotypes that overlap with autoinflammatory or HS-related conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40474034/"}

{"id": "19221635", "title": "Chronic pruritus: targets, mechanisms and future therapies.", "text": "Pruritus (itch) is an unpleasant sensation inducing the desire to scratch. Chronic pruritus (>6 weeks' duration) is a major and distressing symptom of many diseases of dermatological, systemic, neurological or psychogenic origin. Frequently, the underlying cause of pruritus cannot be identified and causal therapy is not possible. Furthermore, chronic pruritus is frequently refractory to conventional symptomatic therapies. Recent research has revealed new neuronal mechanisms in the skin and brain, suggesting novel therapeutic targets. The efficacy of the corresponding innovative therapies has been proven in recent studies and case series. For example, topical or systemic application of specific agonists such as cannabinoids or calcineurin inhibitors can influence neuroreceptors on sensory nerve fibers of the skin and suppress pruritus. Itch-selective neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord can be targeted to inhibit the transmission of pruritus to the somatosensory cortex. Anticonvulsants, antidepressants and micro-opioid receptor antagonists interfere with the sensation of pruritus in the central nervous system. Chronic pruritus of any origin leads to considerable psychosocial burden and impairs quality of life. Psychoeducational interventions, stress training, training in social competence and relaxation techniques are therefore important elements in the treatment of chronic pruritus. Increasing knowledge of the neurobiology of chronic pruritus offers new therapeutic strategies. Currently, several clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of new substances addressing neuroreceptors and cytokines in the skin and central nervous system. The present review aims to provide an overview of current neurophysiological and neurochemical therapeutic models in chronic pruritus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19221635/"}

It is a component of coenzyme A, which serves as a cofactor for a variety of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are important in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins, gluconeogenesis, sterols, steroid hormones, and porphyrins. The topical use of dexpanthenol, the stable alcoholic analog of pantothenic acid, is based on good skin penetration and high local concentrations of dexpanthenol when administered in an adequate vehicle, such as water-in-oil emulsions. Topical dexpanthenol acts like a moisturizer, improving stratum corneum hydration, reducing transepidermal water loss and maintaining skin softness and elasticity. Activation of fibroblast proliferation, which is of relevance in wound healing, has been observed both in vitro and in vivo with dexpanthenol. Accelerated re-epithelization in wound healing, monitored by means of the transepidermal water loss as an indicator of the intact epidermal barrier function, has also been seen. Dexpanthenol has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect on experimental ultraviolet-induced erythema. Beneficial effects of dexpanthenol have been observed in patients who have undergone skin transplantation or scar treatment, or therapy for burn injuries and different dermatoses. The stimulation of epithelization, granulation and mitigation of itching were the most prominent effects of formulations containing dexpanthenol. In double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials, dexpanthenol was evaluated for its efficacy in improving wound healing. Epidermal wounds treated with dexpanthenol emulsion showed a reduction in erythema, and more elastic and solid tissue regeneration. Monitoring of transepidermal water loss showed a significant acceleration of epidermal regeneration as a result of dexpanthenol therapy, as compared with the vehicle. In an irritation model, pretreatment with dexpanthenol cream resulted in significantly less damage to the stratum corneum barrier, compared with no pretreatment. Adjuvant skin care with dexpanthenol considerably improved the symptoms of skin irritation, such as dryness of the skin, roughness, scaling, pruritus, erythema, erosion/fissures, over 3 to 4 weeks.

Management can be difficult. The beginning of the 21st century has been an interesting period for the management of pediatric psoriasis, with access to new topical and systemic treatments including several biotherapies. Herein, we analyze the current therapeutic strategies for managing psoriasis in young patients, ranging from infants to adolescents, in a holistic approach. Usual treatment but also new galenics, new topical associations, and biological (anti-TNF-alpha, anti-interleukin 12/23, anti-interleukin 17) recently developed are presented. Results from clinical trials are detailed, but also real-world evaluations, and recent guidelines. Practical tips for day-to-day management are finally proposed. Currently, we have a wide range of treatments, which we can adapt to all types of psoriasis, depending on the demands of the child and his parents. The near future also looks promising with new topical combinations, new oral therapies (apremilast) and biologics (anti-interleukin 23), as well as genetically targeted therapies for pustular psoriasis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33784929/"}

Medical and legal aspects].", "text": "The different definitions of skin disease in medicine and in law are frequently confusing for dermatologists. While a skin disease may be defined medically referring to the definition of health by the WHO as a pathological condition of the skin leading to a disruption of the physical, mental and social well-being of the individual, legal definitions vary depending on the field of insurance law that is referred to. In the law of private health insurance, a skin disease is defined as an anomalous condition of the skin requiring medical treatment that exists independently of the subjective judgement of the insured person and needs to be objectively confirmed by a medical evaluation. In contrast, in the law of the social health insurance, the Federal Court of Social Justice defines disease as irregular physical or mental condition, deviating from the perception of a healthy human being that requires medical treatment or leads to inability to work. Substantial bodily disfigurement may be regarded as an irregular physical condition. In the law of the statutory accident insurance, occupational skin diseases are defined under clause 5101 of the occupational disease regulation as serious or repeatedly relapsing skin diseases that have forced a person to refrain from any work activities causal for the development, the aggravation or the recurrence of the disease. The Federal Court of Social Justice interprets the term \"skin disease\" from the protective purpose of the law, i.e. the protection against the economic and health consequences of the exposure to harmful agents and a thereby forced change of profession. This broad interpretation of the term \"skin disease\" leads to the recognition of diseases of the conjunctiva of the eye or diseases of the blood vessels of the skin due to cold damage as skin diseases according to clause 5101. For the correct treatment and possibly notification of occupational skin diseases in collaboration with various insurance carriers, dermatologists should be familiar not only with the medical definition, but also with these different legal definitions of skin disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680904/"}

MTX can be administered orally or subcutaneously. Over the past decades, the use of subcutaneous versus oral MTX has been a subject of ongoing debate among dermatologists. Therefore, this literature review aimed to investigate the differences between oral and subcutaneous MTX described in the scientific literature in terms of intestinal absorption and bioavailability, efficacy, safety, patient satisfaction and quality of life, treatment adherence, and economic outlook. Thirty-two articles were included in the review, notably including evidence-based guidelines on the management of psoriasis, as well as randomized clinical trials and real-world studies. Only European guidelines recommend the use of subcutaneous MTX over oral MTX; hence, the use of subcutaneous MTX is reported almost exclusively in European countries. Despite the paucity and heterogeneity of the literature, findings from the review suggest that subcutaneous MTX may overcome some limitations of the oral route in terms of intestinal absorption, bioavailability, and safety. Moreover, subcutaneous MTX may provide higher efficacy with a faster, or even greater, response in psoriatic patients and better adherence to treatment. In conclusion, subcutaneous MTX tends to be advantageous with regard to psoriasis management, similar to other chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis; however, this comes with a higher cost. The treatment of psoriasis using subcutaneous MTX deserves further study, especially in the biologics age.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167349/"}

In this study, we harness the power of machine learning classifiers to enhance diagnostic accuracy by predicting skin diseases based on histopathological features extracted from biopsy samples. We evaluated the performance of six widely used classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes. A thorough analysis of performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, was conducted to ascertain each model's effectiveness. Among these classifiers, the SGD Classifier stood out, achieving an exceptional accuracy of 99.09¬†% and an F1-score of 98.77¬†%, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in handling complex multi-class classification tasks. To further enhance model performance and interpretability, we employed advanced feature selection techniques, which identified the most relevant attributes influencing the predictions. Notably, features such as the Koebner phenomenon, erythema, and itching were consistently highlighted across multiple classifiers, underscoring their significance in the diagnostic process. This analysis not only emphasizes the critical role of feature selection in improving model efficiency but also facilitates a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms associated with skin diseases. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the application of machine learning in dermatology, paving the way for the development of reliable and automated diagnostic tools. Future work will aim to refine feature selection methodologies, expand the dataset to enhance generalization, and explore advanced deep learning techniques to further improve classification accuracy and clinical applicability.

Whether intentional or unintentional, nonadherence to treatment can limit patient outcomes of this disease for a variety of reasons. These include frustration with medication efficacy, inconvenience, and fear of side effects. Other factors include forgetfulness, financial burden of treatment, lack of trust in the physician, dislike of prescribed medication, or lack of understanding of disease or treatment.

Preventive interventions such as educational programs, avoidance of allergens, and exclusive care toward the skin could play a partial role in suppressing the symptoms. Based on the available clinical evidence, topical corticosteroids (TCs) are among the most commonly prescribed agents; however, these should be selected with care. In cases of steroid phobia, persistent adverse effects or chronic use, topical calcineurin inhibitors can be considered as a promising adjunct to TCs. Recent advances in the pharmacotherapeutic paradigm of atopic diseases exploring the therapeutic dominance of nanocarrier-mediated delivery is also discussed in this evidence-based review with regard to the treatment of AD. The present review summarizes the available clinical evidence, highlighting the current and emerging trends in the treatment of AD and providing evidence-based recommendations for the clinicians and health care professionals.

This can be attributed not only to the scaling, itching and cosmetic embarrassment that go with scalp psoriasis, but also to the fact that the scalp skin is relatively inaccessible, making topical therapies difficult to apply. The proximity of sensitive facial skin can also limit the use of potentially irritating topical treatments. Nevertheless, the specific challenges of scalp psoriasis are often neglected by treatment guidelines. This paper summarizes the discussions that took place at an international conference of experts convened in Geneva, Switzerland, in March 2008. The objective of the meeting was to review the available treatments for scalp psoriasis in terms of efficacy, safety, convenience, and the implications for patient compliance with treatment. In addition, definitions of mild, moderate and severe scalp psoriasis were agreed. This paper presents a treatment algorithm that includes recommendations for patients in all three categories. It considers the role of potent topical corticosteroids, vitamin D3 derivatives, salicylic acid preparations, and photo- and radiotherapy, as well as systemic therapies, including newer biological agents, for patients with widespread psoriasis with scalp involvement.

While the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) has traditionally been used to assess disease severity and treatment response, achieving substantial improvement in QoL has become an increasingly important therapeutic goal. Recent advances in biologic therapies have enabled higher rates of PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses; however, PASI 75 is no longer considered sufficient for optimal patient outcomes. Calculating PASI improvement rates in daily practice remains challenging, shifting focus toward absolute PASI values as a practical indicator of disease control. In this study, we analyzed 235 psoriasis patients treated with biologics at Nagoya City University Hospital, evaluating 3526 data points collected over a maximum of 288‚Äâweeks. We found that PASI positively correlated with DLQI (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5696, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), and that an absolute PASI score of ‚â§2.2 was associated with DLQI remission (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.8140).

However, 1.0% of patients with a PASI score of 0 still reported a DLQI ‚â•10, suggesting that factors beyond skin lesions, such as stigma or residual damage, may contribute to impaired QoL. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating absolute PASI values to guide treatment decisions and achieve DLQI remission.

Thus, there is a huge need for locally applied, locally acting drugs for inflammatory skin diseases with better risk-benefit profiles compared to topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Drug repositioning is a complex process, but offers advantages, in particular for indications with lower revenues. In this viewpoint, the neuroendocrine system of the skin is described as an attractive drug target because it contributes significantly to neutralizing external noxious agents prior to inducing immune or vascular changes leading to the clinical signs of skin inflammation, for example, itch and erythema. In addition, epidermis and dermis are accessible for topically applied products which may act locally without pharmacodynamically relevant systemic exposure limiting adverse events. Moreover, since numerous drugs have been evaluated for various CNS diseases, some failed and some approved, this resource should be exploited for repurposing as anti-inflammatory drugs for topical application, for example, cannabidiol, fingolimod or asimadoline.

This regular occurrence happens despite most GPs' lack of knowledge and training in skin disease. We aimed to explore different diagnostic approaches of GPs in patients presenting with a dermatological problem. In addition, we aimed to identify strategies used by GPs to handle diagnostic uncertainty in these patients. We conducted interviews (20-40 minutes) with 14 GPs using a semi-structured guideline. Recalling encounters with patients with skin disease, GPs described their individual diagnostic strategies. Interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis was conducted by two independent raters using a deductive-inductive approach. We identified several aspects of a complex decision-making process in GPs' diagnostic management of patients with dermatological problems. In the general diagnostic workup, GPs used a broad spectrum of different strategies such as spot diagnosis, stepwise refinement, pattern recognition trigger or test of treatment. GPs reduced diagnostic uncertainty through the identification of red flags, the application of the test of time, therapeutic trials and asking for further advice, including patient referral. GPs encounter a broad range of dermatological problems in their daily work using a variety of strategies in the workup of these patients. However, in a significant number of patients, there remains diagnostic uncertainty that is mainly reduced by specialist referral.

Since its first description in 1930, the pathogenesis of PG has remained elusive even as an ever-widening range of systemic diseases has been described in association with it. The diagnosis of PG is based on clinical and pathologic features and requires exclusion of other conditions that produce ulcerations, since misdiagnosis exposes patients to risks associated with treatment. Critical to proper management are correct diagnosis, identification and treatment of any underlying disorder, and the appropriate choice of topical and systemic therapy. PG has four distinctive clinical and histologic variants, and the specific clinical features of the lesion may provide a clue to the associated disease. The most common associated diseases are inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological or hematological disease or malignancy. Although there is no single successful treatment for PG, certain type of PG lesions are recognized to respond more readily to accepted therapies than others. Local treatment may be sufficient for mild disease, while systemic immunosuppressive therapy is necessary for severe cases. The treatments with the best clinical evidence are oral or pulse intravenous corticosteroids, and cyclosporine. Surgical therapy is useful in selected cases in conjunction with immunosuppression. Wound stabilization is obtained only through control of the systemic and local inflammatory process. Emerging therapies include use of platelet-derived growth factor and cell culture grafts when re-epithelialization is slow, and the TNF-alpha blocking agent infliximab for refractory disease. Despite advances in therapy, the long-term outcome for patients with PG remains unpredictable, because relapses are common.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16372799/"}

The pathophysiological connections unveil unique signatures, distinct from other inflammatory skin conditions, in particular psoriasis-specific genetic polymorphisms in IL-23 and TNF-Œ± have consistently been linked to CVD. The review navigates the complex landscape of psoriasis treatments, addressing challenges and future directions in particular relevance to CVDs in psoriasis. Therapeutic interventions, including TNF inhibitors (TNFi), present promise in reducing cardiovascular risks, and methotrexate could constitute a favourable choice. Conversely, the relationship between IL-12/23 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk remains uncertain, while recent evidence indicates that Janus kinase inhibitors may not carry CVD risks. Emerging evidence supports the safety and efficacy of IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors in patients with CVDs, hinting at evolving therapeutic paradigms. Lifestyle modifications, statins, and emerging therapies offer preventive strategies. Dedicated screening guidelines for CVD risk assessment in psoriasis are however lacking. Further, the impact of different disease phenotypes and treatment hierarchies in cardiovascular outcomes remains elusive, demanding ongoing research at the intersection of dermatology, rheumatology, and cardiology.

To determine the changes in the prices of commonly prescribed dermatologic medications since 2009 and to identify trends in price increases for different classes of drugs. Four national chain pharmacies received surveys requesting price data on commonly prescribed dermatologic drugs in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015. The initial survey requested information on 72 brand-name drugs. Subsequent surveys increased to eventually include 120 additional brand-name drugs and their generic alternatives when available. Owing to the frequency of prescription, diseases treated, or unusual price increases, 19 brand-name drugs surveyed in all 4 years were selected for final price trend analysis, which was conducted from August 1 to 15, 2015. Retail prices of topical and systemic drugs for the treatment of various dermatologic conditions. Prices of surveyed brand-name drugs increased rapidly between 2009 and 2015. Of the 19 brand-name drugs analyzed, the retail prices of 7 drugs more than quadrupled during the study period. Among these 19 drugs, the mean price increase was 401% during the 6-year survey period, with the majority of the price increases occurring after 2011. Prices of topical antineoplastic drugs had the greatest mean absolute and percentage increase ($10,926.58 [1240%]). Prices of drugs in the antiinfective class had the smallest mean absolute increase ($333.99); prices of psoriasis medications had the smallest mean percentage increase (180%). Prices of acne and rosacea medications increased a mean of 195%, and prices of topical corticosteroids increased a mean of 290% during the study period. Selected generic drugs surveyed in 2011 and 2014 also increased a mean of 279% during the 3-year period. The price of prescription dermatologic drugs rose considerably from 2009 to 2015, with the vast majority of price increases occurring after 2011. Percent increases for multiple, frequently prescribed medications greatly outpaced inflation, national health expenditure growth, and increases in reimbursements for physician services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606197/"}

The clinical features of acne range from non-inflammatory comedones to inflammatory nodules. While often perceived as an adolescent disease, the prevalence remains high into adulthood, and the manifestations can have detrimental psychosocial effects. It is therefore not surprising that many patients are motivated to seek treatment. The existing treatment strategies for acne are complex due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease. Although it is difficult to cure, four categories of medications have proved efficacious in reducing acne lesions: topical agents, systemic antibiotics, systemic retinoids, and hormonal agents. Unfortunately, these medications can cause adverse effects that may limit their use. Typically, these adverse effects are mild and transient and can be remedied by altering the dose or frequency of the offending agent. However, more serious adverse effects can occur that pose a significant health risk to the patient. Understanding how to recognize and manage the adverse effects of common acne therapies is imperative to providing the safest and most appropriate treatment for each patient.

A systematic literature search in Medline and Embase was carried out. Clinical trials that evaluated head-to-head comparisons of treatments in patients suffering from mild-to-moderate papulopustular acne were included. Abstract and full-text screening and data extraction were done independently by two investigators. With respect to inflammatory lesions, different concentrations of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or adapalene did not seem to influence the TOA. BPO seemed to act more quickly than isotretinoin and tretinoin. Adapalene showed a shorter TOA than isotretinoin. Conflicting results were seen when comparing adapalene with tretinoin, with a tendency for adapalene to be faster. Clindamycin/BPO seemed to act more quickly than adapalene. Inconsistent results were seen for the comparison of clindamycin/BPO and BPO alone with a slight indication of a shorter TOA for clindamycin/BPO. Adapalene/BPO and clindamycin/BPO showed comparable TOA. When interpreting the data, the different study designs and the limited study quality need to be taken into account.

PsA presents as a heterogeneous disease involving different domains and burdened by an important impact on function and quality of life. Dermatologists play an important role in the early detection of PsA because in most patients PsA develop after cutaneous psoriasis. The ideal goal of treating patients with PsA is to optimize the controls of symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent structural damage and disability. The choice of treatment in patients with PsA should take into account also the skin signs and symptoms. Treatment options include NSAIDs, synthetic DMARDSs, anti-TNF-Œ± agents, anti-IL-12/IL-23 agents, anti-IL-17 agents, PDE4 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and co-stimulatory blockers. A narrative review based on electronic searches on PubMed¬Æ database was performed. Original articles assessing either the role of the dermatologist in the management of PsA and the available treatments for PsA were included. Among different treatments, some drugs show more efficacy in joint signs and symptoms, and poor response on the skin and vice versa. The perspective of the dermatologist in a multidisciplinary setting may provide a helpful tool in the management of patients with PsA.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32320308/"}
{"id": "16428145", "title": "The use of ciclosporin in psoriasis.", "text": "Ciclosporin is a cyclic undecapeptide discovered in the 1970s to possess a potent inhibitory action on T lymphocytes. The subsequent discovery, in 1979, that it was remarkably effective in treatment of psoriasis transformed thinking about the nature of the disease, which subsequently became generally recognized as autoimmune in nature. Ciclosporin remains one of the most effective and rapidly acting treatments currently available for psoriasis. Virtually all the diverse manifestations of this disease can respond. The main side effects are nephrotoxicity and hypertension. There is considerable variation between individuals in susceptibility to these so careful monitoring is required. Ciclosporin should be used in single or intermittent short courses for all except the most severe cases as this is safer than continuous treatment. The rate of improvement depends very much on the dose, which ranges from 2 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. Ciclosporin can be combined with any topical treatment and a useful dose-sparing effect can be achieved in this way if patients are compliant. In severe cases ciclosporin is often used in combination with other systemic antipsoriatic drugs in order to spare the dose of each agent and reduce toxicity. Concurrent or intercurrent use of ultraviolet therapy is discouraged due to the increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. This article reviews the mode of action, pharmacokinetics, indications, contraindications, side effects, dosage regimens, pretreatment screening and monitoring, drug interactions, and use of treatment combinations with ciclosporin in the management of psoriasis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16428145/"}

Cutaneous lesions are frequent (20 to 35% of cases). Their clinical features and follow-up data are highly variable. Numerous treatments have been proposed. The clinical features and follow up data of four patients with chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis treated with methotrexate are reported. Mean age of patients (3 female, 1 male) was 40 years old (34-49 years). One patient presented with a lupus pernio, two patients with papules and nodules, and the last with an annular lesion of the face. All patients had been previously treated with topical corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine without any success. Patients were treated with methotrexate at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 30 mg per week for at least 6 months. Complete remission of cutaneous lesions was observed in 3 of 4 patients after a mean treatment duration of 29 months (16 to 36). Methotrexate side effects were observed in one patient (elevated liver enzymes) leading to methotrexate discontinuation. Methotrexate seems to be an effective treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis. It should be used namely in patients who failed to respond to previous treatments with topical corticosteroids or antimalarial drugs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16230915/"}

The objective of our study was to measure, through a standardized questionnaire, fear of TCS in families of pediatric patients with AD and to identify items associated with fear. Families of pediatric patients with AD were enrolled in 9 Italian centers of pediatric dermatology. Enrolled parents were invited to fill in a questionnaire including questions on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and 3 sets of questions on corticosteroid phobia (general fear, specific fears, behaviours regarding TCS). Determinants of the level of general fear were investigated through multivariable analysis. A total of 300 outpatients with AD were enrolled. Most parents (80%) had a high instruction level. Eighty-one percent reported to have a certain amount of fear of TCS. At the multivariable analysis, fear of TCS was associated with the following items: believing that TCS treatment advantages do not overweight disadvantages (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.011); believing that TCS may be dangerous independently from the specific side effect (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Moreover, TCS fear was associated with fear of applying too much cream (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). TCS phobia is widespread among Italian families of children with AD. Fear of TCS is associated with fear of applying too much cream, thus increasing the risk of poor compliance and treatment failure. Therapeutic education of families on the use of TCS should be implemented.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28245844/"}

{"id": "15649186", "title": "Novel pharmacological approaches in the treatment of psoriasis.", "text": "Progress in the understanding of psoriasis as a T-cell mediated inflammatory disease has led to the development of new immunomodulatory therapies. Currently the main focus is on the so-called biologics (or biological agents), including fusion proteins, monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and selective receptors. They mainly target single steps in the complex cascade of humoral and cellular inflammatory immuno-mechanisms that finally lead to the accelerated growth of epidermal and vascular cells in the psoriatic lesions. The most promising and advanced biological agents are discussed along with their influence on the critical pathophysiological steps in psoriasis, including depletion of T cells, blockade of initial T-cell activation and T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, blockade of costimulatory signals and T-cell proliferative signals as well as restoration of the T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th2 balance by diminishing type 1 cytokines and administration of type 2 cytokines. In addition to the biological agents, further development of 'classical' dermatological therapies, such as retinoids, or the discovery of new indications for non-dermatological agents contribute to the novel pharmacological approaches in the treatment of psoriasis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15649186/"}
{"id": "39269130", "title": "Acne and the cutaneous microbiome: A systematic review of mechanisms and implications for treatments.", "text": "Acne vulgaris is a pervasive skin disease characterized by inflammation of sebaceous units surrounding hair follicles. It results from the complex interplay between skin physiology and the intricate cutaneous microbiome. Current acne treatments, while effective, have major limitations, prompting a shift towards microbiome-based therapeutic approaches. This study aims to determine the relationship between acne and the cutaneous microbiome, assess the effects of current treatments on the cutaneous microbiome, and explore the implications for developing new therapies. A systematic review was performed using PubMed and SCOPUS databases within the last 10 years. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors. The search retrieved 1830 records, of which 26 articles met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of alpha diversity change was assessed using fixed and randomized effect models per therapeutic group. Eight studies pertain to the role of the cutaneous microbiome in acne, identifying C. acnes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis as key contributors through overproliferation, commensalism, or dysbiosis. Eleven studies discuss current acne treatments, including doxycycline (1), topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) (4), isotretinoin (2), sulfacetamide-sulfur (SSA) (2) and aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) (2), identified as modulating the cutaneous microbiome as a mechanism of efficacy in acne treatment. Seven studies discuss new treatments with topical probiotics, plant derivatives, and protein derivatives, which contribute to acne clearance via modulation of dysbiosis, inflammatory markers and diversity indexes. A meta-analysis of the effects of existing therapeutics on the cutaneous microbiome identified benzoyl peroxide as the only treatment to facilitate significant change in diversity. Despite the heterogeneity of study types and microbiome classifications limiting the analysis, this review underscores the complexity of microbial involvement in acne pathogenesis. It delineates the effects of acne therapeutics on microbial diversity, abundance, and composition, emphasizing the necessity for personalized approaches in acne management based on microbiome modulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39269130/"}

It is characterized by sterile pustule formation in palms and soles and a recurrent disease course. Although we have many treatments for PPP, there is no authoritative guidance. A thorough search of PubMed was conducted to identify studies in PPP from 1973 onwards, with additional references to specific articles. Any treatment methods were outcomes of interest, including topical treatment, systemic treatment, biologics, other targeted treatments, phototherapy, and tonsillectomy. Topical corticosteroids are suggested as first-line therapy. Oral acitretin has become the most applied systemic retinoid recommended in PPP without joint involvement. For patients with arthritis, immunosuppressants like cyclosporin A and methotrexate are more recommended. UVA1, NB-UVB, and 308-nm excimer laser are effective phototherapy options. The combinations of topical or systemic agents and phototherapy may enhance the efficacy, particularly in recalcitrant cases. Secukinumab, ustekinumab, and apremilast are the most investigated targeted therapies. However, heterogeneous reported outcomes in clinical trials provided low-to-moderate quality evidence of their efficacy. Future studies are required to address these evidence gaps. We suggest managing PPP based on the acute phase, maintenance phase, and comorbidities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36970858/"}
