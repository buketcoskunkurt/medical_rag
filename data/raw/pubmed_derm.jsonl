A decade later Marchionini and several coworkers published 5 scientific communications in the Klinische Wochenschrift on \"Der Säuremantel der Haut und Bakterienabwehr\" (acid mantle and defense against bacteria). They described experimental detail, documented age- and body site as well as skin disease-dependent skin pH shifts, and discussed the significance of the pH and bacterial growth on the skin. In their fourth and fifth communication, they made the first connection between the altered quantitative and qualitative bacterial growth in pathologically modified skin and the shifted skin pH and attributed it partly to the gap in the acid mantle (pathologische Lücke des Säuremantels). They also investigated the pH of several topical dermatologic preparations and concluded that their benefit can at least partly be attributed to their acid character and recommended the systematic investigation of acid treatments in dermatology. At that time, the physiologic role of the acid skin surface was thought to be a protective mechanism against invading organisms. Hence, it seemed reasonable to allocate protection to an easy and conceivable term such as \"mantle.\" Today, \"acid mantle\" as a term is still a very suitable metaphor to illustrate the protective quality of the \"acid\" in the skin and the term has become part of colloquial speech. In the meantime, our understanding of the skin pH has broadened, and we know that the acid character and its gradual change within the skin also help to orchestrate epidermal differentiation and corneocyte shedding. For many more biochemical processes within the skin, the compartmental pH is crucial, for example, in pigmentation, ion homeostasis, epidermal (stem) cell behavior, and so on. The often existing difference between the H+ concentration of extra- and intracellular as well as subcellular compartments establishes an ionic, electric, and/or osmotic driving force; hence, H+ concentration per se acts as an extra-, intra,- and subcellular signaling modality affecting and controlling many cellular functions. One may even consider pH a universal signal and effector. It is therefore also no surprise that skin pH shifts have been observed in various skin pathologies. More recently, in carefully controlled trials (acne, atopic dermatitis, incontinence-associated dermatitis, aged skin), the benefits of targeted skin acidification have become evident and the use of topical preparations with reduced pH may be recommended. The currently prevailing formulation concepts for direct acidification are based on a reduced pH of the hydrophilic product phase in combination with a buffer with a sufficiently high buffering capacity within the vehicle.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125885/"}

Further, clinical trials struggle to keep participants engaged in the study and as many as 40% drop out. To overcome these challenges pharmaceutical companies and research institutions (e.g., universities) increasingly use an emerging concept: virtual clinical trials (VCT) based on a remote approach. VCT (site-less) are a relatively new method of conducting a clinical trial, taking full advantage of technology (apps, monitoring devices, etc.) and inclusion of web platforms (recruitment, informed consent, counselling, measurement of endpoints, and any adverse reactions) to allow the patient to be home-based at every stage of the clinical trial. Studies have shown that VCT are not only operationally feasible, but also successful. They have higher recruitment rates, better compliance, lower drop-out rates, and are conducted faster than traditional clinical trials. The visual nature of dermatological conditions, the relative ease in evaluating skin diseases virtually, and the fact that skin diseases often are not life-threatening and rarely require complex examinations make VCT very attractive for dermatological research.

Inflammaging is thought to contribute to many age-related chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and even certain cancers. Recent studies suggest that the human microbiome may play a critical role in inflammaging. As the largest organ of the body and home to a significant portion of the human microbiome, the skin may play a unique role in inflammaging. In this review article, we present common dermatological diseases through the lens of inflammaging, look at how our skin may play a role in reducing inflammaging, and highlight the need for further focused research in this area.

Emerging studies suggest its potential for off-label use in various dermatological disorders. This review systematically explores the off-label dermatological applications of upadacitinib. We conducted a comprehensive literature search across MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies on alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo, and other conditions were included. The review identified two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating upadacitinib's efficacy in hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo. Both trials demonstrated promising improvements in clinical outcomes, though some results were not statistically significant. Additionally, case reports and series highlight its efficacy in alopecia areata and lichen planus. These findings suggest upadacitinib as a viable option for refractory dermatological conditions. However, the limited sample sizes and short follow-up periods underscore the need for further large-scale, long-term studies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39920358/"}

Basal level autophagy plays an important role in cellular homeostasis through the elimination of the old or damaged organelles, as well as aggregated intracellular proteins. Autophagy refers to sequestration of intact organelles along with a portion of cytosol, into a double-or multi-membrane structure known as phagophore, which elongates, and after closure, forms a vesicular structure known as the autophagosome. Subsequently, the mature autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, thereby forming a single membrane structure, an autolysosome. Autophagy plays a critical role in inflammation, autoimmunity and cellular differentiation. Skin serves as the first line of defense against a variety of environmental insults and autophagy is thought to be a form of an endogenous defense mechanism against such environmental derangements. Autophagy has been linked with keratinocyte differentiation and melanocyte survival, as well as with the pathogenesis of diverse skin disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, vitiligo, infectious skin diseases and cancer. Autophagy has been one of the most studied phenomena in cell biology and pathophysiology, and given its broad clinical implications, has become a major target for drug discovery. The last decade has seen a substantial upsurge in autophagy-related research and publications; still, the dermatology literature appears to be less initiated. Autophagy will probably change our understanding of dermatological disorders/medicines. Hence, a basic knowledge of autophagy is a prerequisite to understand the developments in the field of autophagy-related research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28004651/"}

Apart from selecting the appropriate active substance and its proper concentration, choosing a suitable pharmaceutical (galenic) formulation - and thus utilizing the intrinsic effects thereof - is pivotal in enhancing the intended therapeutic effects. When prescribing individual formulations, dermatologists should, to the greatest extent possible, always resort to standardized extemporaneous preparations. Given the multitude of potential ingredients available for pharmaceutical formulations as well as the complexity resulting therefrom, arbitrary changes in quality or quantity of individual components are associated with a high risk of instability, thus jeopardizing safety and the rationale behind any given formulation.

Symptoms of rosacea can be bothersome and include pain, stinging, burning, itching, and facial flushing. This review explored skin barrier impairment in rosacea and reduced symptomatology when using over the counter (OTC) skincare products. Nine dermatologists (the panel) completed a survey on OTC products they recommend for rosacea. The survey results were summarized, presented, and discussed during the online meeting, together with the results of a literature review. The outcome of these discussions, coupled with the panel's expert opinion and experience, is shown in the current review. Addressing barrier dysfunction by use of moisturizer and cleanser formulations that restore skin hydration, normalize skin pH, restore the microbiome, and skin lipids can assist in improving rosacea signs and symptoms. The panel's consensus was that in addition to the use of prescription medications, skincare recommendations are a crucial part of successful rosacea therapy. In addition to occlusives and humectants, barrier restoring ingredients such as ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide were considered beneficial. Equally important was the absence of potentially irritating substances. The use of OTC products can improve rosacea symptomatology and signs. As adjuncts, these products are recommended before and during prescription therapy and as part of a maintenance regimen.

Although the risk of severe infections with psoriatic treatments is well established, little is known about cutaneous infections. Therefore, we studied the frequency of cutaneous infections in patients with psoriasis who underwent biologic treatment. A total of 878 patients (237 females and 641 males) were analyzed in this follow-up survey conducted in 2020 and based on the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry. The observed skin phenotypes were psoriasis vulgaris (83.3%), pustular psoriasis (7.5%), and psoriatic arthritis (28.9%). The most frequently prescribed systemic drug was apremilast (11.3%), followed by ixekizumab (11.0%), risankizumab (10.9%), and secukinumab (10.4%). The incidence of cutaneous bacterial infections was 12 (1.37% of the total patients), with cellulitis being the most common (8/12, 67%). The incidence of viral infections was 11 (1.25%) including the most common, herpes zoster (9/11, 82%); and that of fungal infections was 45 (5.13%) including 33 (73%) and seven (16%) patients with trichophytosis and oral candidiasis, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that cutaneous bacterial infections were frequently observed in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-α (odds raio [OR] 9.917, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.069-47.572, p = 0.004) and interleukin (IL)-17 (OR 10.798, 95% CI 2.35-49.616, p = 0.002) inhibitor treatments.

The pathogen to be treated can be identified sometimes by the clinical symptoms (e.g. in classical erysipelas) or by microbiological analysis. The latter requires adequate sampling methods. Due to the demographic development, which entails age-related multimorbidity and polypharmacy, criteria for the selection of the correct antibiotic not only encompass the pathogen spectrum and the tissue penetration of the drug, but also the risks for adverse events and unwanted interactions with other drugs. In this review article the mode of action, mechanisms of resistance, pharmacokinetics, adverse events, and drug interactions of the dermatologically important antibiotics are summarized, as are some relevant indications for their appropriate use in dermatology. For most bacterial skin and soft tissue infections beta-lactam antibiotics represent the first line therapy. They are efficacious, their adverse events are well known and defined, and they are mostly cost-effective. Penicillins G and V are recommended for classical erysipelas (caused by hemolytic streptococci). For uncomplicated soft tissue infections originating from wounds, which are mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus, the first line therapy are cephalosporins group 1 and 2, or isoxazoyl penicillins. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is indicated only for complicated soft tissue infections when a different spectrum of bacterial pathogens is suspected or when (multi-) resistant bacteria are supposed to be the causative organism.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549482/"}

In contrast to the successes achieved for gastrointestinal disorders, positive effects for atopic dermatitis only have been found in a few studies. New insights could now fundamentally change the impact of probiotics on dermatology. Probiotics are - like microflora of the skin - non-pathogenic microbes, which do not induce inflammatory responses in the skin. Common pathways for probiotics, non-pathogenic microbes, and microflora are characterized, in order to facilitate their more effective therapeutic use. These microbes display a majority of their effects directly at the site of application and thereby induce natural defense mechanisms. However, promotion of immunological tolerance is just as important in producing positive effects. Tolerance of the resident flora on surface organs developed during evolution and the mechanisms of action are multifaceted. Therefore, the topical application of probiotics and non-pathogenic microbes for prophylaxis and therapy of overwhelming cutaneous pro-inflammatory immune reactions is very promising. Results of recent clinical trials already have demonstrated the efficacy of this new therapeutic concept.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19655096/"}

Berries, seeds, and leaves of the plant are widely used as a folk medicine for the treatment of hypertension, oedema, inflammation, tissue-regeneration, skin-grafts, burns/injury, wounds, and ulcers. This article reviews geographical distribution, botanical description, phytochemistry, ethnomedicinal uses, and dermatological activities including, cosmeceuticals of H. rhamnoides available in the market. The data has been compiled employing the various search engines like Science Direct, Pub Med, Google, Google Scholar, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and SciVal. H. rhamnoides is primarily found in cold-temperate regions of Eurasia and was first located in China. Berries are the most prominent feature of the plant. Phytochemical studies reveal the presence of a wide variety of compounds like flavonoids, carotenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, Omega 3, 6, 9 and rarest Omega 7 and about 190 bioactive compounds. The pharmacological studies demonstrated, sea buckthorn to exhibit antibacterial, anti-sebum, antifungal, anti-psoriasis, anti-atopic dermatitis and wound healing activities. Besides, it has also been included in various cosmeceuticals for its use in skin-eventone, smoothening, rejuvenation, removal of wrinkles, scars, and pigmentation, and also in hair related problems. Pharmacological evaluation confirmed the ethnomedically claimed biological actions and other beneficial effects on the skin of H. rhamnoides using scientifically accepted protocols and controls, although some of the studies require more elaborative studies. Its full application in the dermatology may be attributed to the presence of a variety of flavonoids, vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids.

However, there is a lack of insights on industry trends for dermatology research. We aim to describe trends and features of clinical trials for dermatology drugs in China, understand recent achievements, and forecast development trends. Clinical trial records posted on the Registration and Information Disclosure Platform of Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) were screened. All trials for dermatological drugs, posted on platform between 2016 and 2022 were included. A total of 1172 trial records were identified, among which studies for skin infection, immune-mediated and inflammatory skin disease (IMIDs) and skin malignancy accounted for 48.9% (n = 573), 42.0% (n = 492) and 9.1% (n = 107), respectively. Most trials focused on generic drugs (n = 728, 62.1%). Multi-regional clinical trials (MRCTs) accounted for less than 6% of all trials. The number of trials on dermatology drugs increased sharply from 2016 to 2018 followed by a decline, which is mainly driven by the drop in bioequivalence evaluation (BE) studies for generic drugs indicated for skin infection. A growing trend in the number of trials for innovative drugs was observed. After removing duplicated drugs based on generic name, a total of 607 tested dermatology drugs were identified among which 51.9% were indicated for IMIDs. The number of innovative drugs exceeded generic drugs from 2020 to 2022. The geographic distribution of lead sites (the site where the principal investigator being employed) was uneven, with most of them located in east China.

Classical systemic treatments have not evolved much during the last decades; biological therapies on the contrary have added most significant progress in systemic treatment during the last 10 years. In particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade has changed the treatment outcomes in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. With drugs such as infliximab treatment goals of 75% improvement of psoriasis lesions together with significant improvement of quality of life can be achieved. Furthermore, skin clearance is possible in many patients with continued maintenance treatment with infliximab. More recent pivotal studies have shown that associated nail psoriasis responds well to infliximab, an outcome that was difficult to reach with classical therapies. There is good evidence that infliximab may be useful in other dermatological conditions such as pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa. Infliximab is an intravenous administration over a 2-hour period.

Recently, there have been significant changes in dermatologic clinical practice. Advances in knowledge of disease pathophysiology have led to significant breakthroughs in diagnostics and therapy, as well as discovery of new treatment modalities. Additionally, research focusing on differences between individual patients has resulted in the growth of personalized medicine. Health care professionals are focusing on tailoring therapy to the individual characteristics of each patient, which in turn leads to improved quality of care and management of each individual. Of note, patient safety may be compromised when applying or taking dermatologic therapy as a result of medical error, patient noncompliance, adverse effects, or drug interactions. It is therefore of great importance to minimize, and if possible prevent these risks. Finally, the appraisal of health care goods and services currently does not only analyze the safety and efficacy of treatment, but also considers the economic impact on the cost of health care. Consequently, pharmacoeconomic evaluation has become an essential step in the introduction of new dermatologic treatments and the rational use of pharmaceuticals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237068/"}
{"id": "24150820", "title": "[Appropriate off-label prescription in practice].", "text": "More than 2,000 different types of disease entities are treated in dermatology. Even for some of the more commonly occurring diseases there is no explicitly approved medication. Further limitations in the approval status can be found for skin diseases in children and adolescents, in pregnancy and with multiple comorbidities. Therefore, for medical and ethical reasons in many dermatological treatment situations prescription of medications off label is necessary. Against the background of the difficult formal and legal framework conditions for off-label prescription, knowledge of the regulations on off-label use is essential for dermatologists. The presented data were taken from the essential sources of the social security statutes V (SGB V), pharmaceutical guidelines and legal texts on jurisprudence of off-label use. There are no standardized regulations on off-label use for dermatological diseases in Germany. Only a few indications and pharmaceuticals have as yet been included in the processing procedure by the Federal Joint Committee. The large proportion of the necessary treatment in off-label use refers to the jurisprudence, in particular the Federal Social Court. According to this an off-label use can be justified in exceptional cases, and from the sociolegal perspective can even be demanded by patients, if the existing indications represent a serious life-threatening disease or one which permanently reduces the quality of life, a suitable therapy under approved conditions is not available and there is a well-founded prospect of successful treatment. For appropriate prescription in off-label use it is necessary to carry out an appropriate and thorough evaluation and documentation of previous treatment and of the degree of suffering on the side of the patient and to have knowledge of the international literature on studies involving the selected substance. Off-label use is involved in approximately 5-15% of necessary pharmaceutical prescriptions in dermatology and affects some 30 drugs and several hundred indications in routine treatment. Currently the CVderm is constructing a databank for dermatology called E-skin for simplification of off-label use in dermatology (http://www.arzneimittelleitfaden.de). Prescriptions for off-label use are an integral component of qualified dermatological treatment. Despite regulatory and legal hurdles off-label use can be implemented with knowledge of the juridical and formal conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150820/"}

Depending on the disease and the drug, three main designs can be used for randomized controlled trials assessing topical drugs: the classical individual parallel design, the cluster randomized design, and designs allowing within-individual comparisons, including the cross-over design (in which patients are randomized to a sequence of interventions) and the within-person design (also called the split-body design). Within-person design can be used to compare different drugs concomitantly in the same patient. Randomization does not concern patients but rather lesions or body sites within patients, and the drugs to be compared are applied to the different lesions (or sites). This design considerably reduces interobservation variability, and thus, the number of patients to be included in the trial (sample size). However, this design has major methodological constraints, especially the need to resolve the problem of a possible carry-across effect.

The aim of this work was to develop evidence-based recommendations on topical treatments and phototherapy in psoriasis for daily clinical use. A scientific committee selected clinically relevant questions on efficacy and safety of topical agents and phototherapy in psoriasis. This selection was made using the Delphi method. A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The articles selected for analysis were reviewed and the level of evidence was appraised according to the Oxford Levels of Evidence. An Expert consensus meeting took place in June 2011, including 42 dermatologists. Recommendations for use of topical treatments and phototherapy were made during interactive workshops where the evidence was presented and discussed. Agreement among participants was assessed on a 10-point scale. The participants systematically assessed the impact of the recommendations on clinical practice. A total of 3555 references were identified, among which 312 articles were included in the systematic reviews. Three recommendations were issued on phototherapy including both PUVA and narrow-band UVB. The recommendations related to administration schedule, clearance rate and risk of side-effects. The mean agreement between participants was good varying from 8.5 to 9.5. Six recommendations were issued on topical treatments focusing on administration schedule, clearance rate, risk of side-effects, cost-effectiveness and measures to improve treatment adherence.

Numerous immunomodulatory mechanisms for hdIVIg have been proposed, and they are discussed alongside treatment protocols and adverse effects. Increasing use of this therapy has helped to establish its excellent safety record, without the many adverse effects of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. This safety record makes hdIVIg an attractive therapeutic option; however, in view of the time required to administer the infusions, the cost, and the urgent need for controlled trials of hdIVIg in patients with specific dermatological disorders such as pemphigus, patients must be carefully selected. Unfortunately, current dermatological uses of hdIVIg have been limited to either uncontrolled trials or anecdotal case reports, except for a single controlled trial of hdIVIg as adjunctive therapy in patients with dermatomyositis, which documented a significant benefit. Further trials in dermatomyositis should be established to confirm these data and to clarify the dose and frequency of therapy required for patients with dermatomyositis.

Aim.  To assess whether fasting during Ramadan influence the use of topical treatments for skin disease in Muslim patients. This was a prospective, anonymous, questionnaire survey undertaken in a dermatology centre in a tertiary hospital in the UK. Patients were asked if they would use topical treatment while fasting, and whether they would consider this a breach of their fast. We found that more than one-third of the people interviewed would not use topical treatment while fasting, and around the same number (> 30%) would also consider this a breach of their fast. Although the majority of these patients thought that using steroid-based topical products was not acceptable, a significant proportion extended this opinion to use of any cream or emollient, and even to light therapy. Gender, age, or educational level were not useful predictors of patient opinion, but there was a significant association with birthplace and likelihood of using topical treatment during Ramadan; patients born outside the UK were significantly (P < 0.01) less likely than those born in the UK to use topical treatment in the fasting period. Our study indicates that fasting may be a significant and a hitherto unrecognised cause of non-compliance with topical treatment in Muslim patients in the UK, with potential health, quality and cost implications.

Retrospective observational study in a tertiary hospital (University Hospital of La Coruña, Spain). Patients with dermatological conditions being treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg/8 weeks after the induction dose) were included in the study. The concentrations of infliximab and anti-infliximab antibodies were quantified by two sandwich-type ELISA immunoassays. The patients were classified into three groups based on the efficacy: good, partial or non-efficacy at the time of each blood assessment. The development of adverse reactions was also evaluated. Plasma levels of infliximab and anti-infliximab antibodies, clinical response and infusion reactions. 17 patients (45 assessments) were included. The good/partial efficacy rate was significantly higher in the case of >0.05 than <0.05 μg/mL infliximab concentration (93.3 vs. 40.0 %, p < 0.001). Anti-infliximab antibodies were only detected in five samples.

The results obtained show that the presence of infliximab concentrations higher than 0.05 μg/mL are correlated with a good clinical response and the absence of toxicity.

The current evidence for the different therapies has many limitations due to lack of sufficient studies on the different Leishmania species with differing virulence. So far there is no international gold standard for the optimal management. The aim of the German joint working group on Leishmaniasis, formed by the societies of Tropical Medicine (DTG), Chemotherapy (PEG) and Dermatology (DDG), was to establish a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of CL and MCL in Germany, based on evidence (Medline search yielded 400 articles) and, where lacking, on consensus of the experts. As the clinical features do not necessarily reflect the involved Leishmania species and, as different parasite species and even geographically distinct strains of the same species may require different treatments or varying dosages or durations of therapy, the guidelines suggest for Germany to identify the underlying parasite prior to treatment. Because of relevant differences in prognosis and ensuing therapy species should be identified in i) New World CL/MCL (NWCL/ MCL) to distinguish between L. mexicana-complex and subgenus Viannia, ii) in suspected infections with L. mexicana-complex to distinguish from L. amazonensis, and iii) in Old World CL (OWCL) to distinguish between L. infantum and L. major, L. tropica, or L. aethiopica. A state-of-the-art diagnostic algorithm is presented. For recommendations on localized and systemic drug treatment and physical procedures, data from the accessible literature were adjusted according to the involved parasite species and a clinical differentiation into uncomplicated or complex lesions. Systemic therapy was strictly recommended for i) complex lesions (e. g. > 3 infected lesions, infections in functionally or cosmetically critical areas such as face or hands, presence of lymphangitis), ii) lesions refractory to therapy, iii) NWCL by the subgenus Viannia or by L. amazonensis, iv) in MCL and v) in recalcitrant, or disseminating or diffuse cutaneous courses. In e. g. infection with L. major it encompasses miltefosine, fluconazole and ketoconazole, while antimony or allopurinol were here considered second choice. Local therapy was considered appropriate for i) uncomplicated lesions of OWCL, ii) L. mexicana-complex and iii) pregnant women. In e. g. infection with L. major it encompasses perilesional antimony, combined with cryotherapy, paromomycin 15 %/in methylbenzethoniumchlorid 12 % and thermotherapy.

The methodology followed PRISMA guidelines and included seven bibliographical databases, searching articles published from 1 January 1994 until 16 November 2021. Articles were reviewed independently by two assessors, and an adjudicator resolved any opinion differences. Of 3220 screened publications, 454 articles meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion, describing research on 198 190 patients, were analysed. DLQI scores were primary endpoints in 24 (5.3%) of studies. Most studies were of psoriasis (54.1%), although 69 different diseases were studied. Most study drugs were systemic (85.1%), with biologics comprising 55.9% of all pharmacological interventions. Topical treatments comprised 17.0% of total pharmacological interventions. Nonpharmacological interventions, mainly laser therapy and ultraviolet radiation treatment, comprised 12.2% of the total number of interventions. The majority of studies (63.7%) were multicentric, with trials conducted in at least 42 different countries; 40.2% were conducted in multiple countries. The minimal clinically importance difference (MCID) was reported in the analysis of 15.0% of studies, but only 1.3% considered full score meaning banding of the DLQI. Forty-seven (10.4%) of the studies investigated statistical correlation of the DLQI with clinical severity assessment or other PRO/quality of life tools; and 61-86% of studies had within-group scores differences greater than the MCID in 'active treatment arms'.

Thirteen per cent had a high risk of bias from blinding and 10.1% had a high risk of bias from unknown outcomes of all participants in the studies. In 18.5% of the studies the authors declared that they followed an intention-to-treat protocol; imputation for missing DLQI data was used in 34.4% of studies.

Aspects of prescribing viewed positively by nurses include continuity of care, increased satisfaction, and the belief that patients receive improved information about prescriptions. There is some evidence, however, that nurses feel ill-prepared to prescribe due to poor understanding of pharmacology, physical assessment and diagnosis. This paper reports a study assessing the extent to which independent extended supplementary nurse prescribers feel prepared to prescribe medicines for patients with dermatological conditions. A convenience sample of 1187 qualified independent extended supplementary nurse prescribers was sent a postal questionnaire. A total of 868 completed questionnaires was returned, and 638 of these nurses prescribed medicines for skin conditions. The data were collected in 2005. A total of 605 (94.8%) participants used independent extended prescribing and 234 (36.7%) supplementary prescribing. The majority were highly experienced and worked in primary care. In general, their prescribing programme had met their needs when prescribing medicines for patients with dermatological conditions. However, the needs of those who had undertaken a diploma-level module in dermatology and/or dermatology study days, and those working in both primary and secondary care, were met to a statistically significantly greater extent during the programme than for those nurses without this preparation, or those working in either primary or secondary care.

To optimize the treatment of psoriasis in Germany, the Deutsche Dermatologi sche Gesellschaft (DDG) and the Berufsverband Deutscher Dermatologen (BVDD) have initiated a project to develop evidence-based guidelines for the management of psoriasis. They were first published in 2006 and updated in 2011. The Guidelines focus on induction therapy in cases of mild, moderate and severe plaque-type psoriasis in adults including systemic therapy, UV therapy and topical therapies. The therapeutic recommendations were developed based on the results of a systematic literature search and were finalized during a consensus meeting using structured consensus methods (nominal group process).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22386073/"}

Data from the 1989 to 1991 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to estimate the number of visits with a topical corticosteroid preparation prescribed and to identify prescribers with specific characteristics. In the United States, topical corticosteroids are prescribed or recommended at an average of 14 million visits per year to office-based health practitioners. Forty percent of these visits were to dermatologists. Dermatologists were 3.9 times more likely to prescribe very high potency steroids than were other physicians. Physicians other than dermatologists were 8.4 times more likely than dermatologists to prescribe combination agents containing moderate- or high-potency topical corticosteroids and an antiinfective agent.

Those using topical dermatological drugs on prescription generally scored lower than the other groups with skin problems: in particular, they evaluated personal health as poorer (general health perceptions), perceived more limitations in daily activities (role limitation because of emotional health problems) and felt more tired and worn out (vitality).

The guidelines consider a systematic Cochrane review on interventions for HE, which is based on a systematic search of the published literature (including hand-searching). In addition to the evidence- and consensus-based recommendation on the treatment of HE, the guidelines cover mainly consensus-based diagnostic aspects and preventive measures (primary and secondary prevention). Treatment recommendations include non-pharmacological interventions, topical, physical and systemic treatments. Topical corticosteroids are recommended as first line treatment in the management of HE, however continuous long-term treatment beyond six weeks only when necessary and under careful medical supervision. Alitretinoin is recommended as a second line treatment (relative to topical corticosteroids) for patients with severe chronic HE. Randomized control trials (RCT) are missing for other used systemic treatments and comparison of systemic drugs in \"head-to-head\" RCTs are needed. The guidelines development group is a working group of the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) and has carefully tried to reconcile opposite views, define current optimal practice and provide specific recommendations, and meetings have been chaired by a professional moderator of the AWMF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften; Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany). No financial support was given by any medical company. The guidelines are expected to be valid until December 2017 at the latest.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25640512/"}

The treatments used by GPs and dermatologists in juvenile psoriasis were investigated. A questionnaire was sent to 229 GPs and 73 dermatologists. Questions were addressed about the prevalence of childhood psoriasis and treatments used in this disease. Seventy-three questionnaires were completed. The response rate was 17.0% for GPs and 46.6% for dermatologists. Almost one-third of all GPs have seen one or more patients with juvenile psoriasis under the age of 11 in their own patient population, in contrast to more than 80% of the dermatologists. Extrapolating the results implied an estimated prevalence of childhood psoriasis of 0.17% in the overall Dutch population. Topical corticosteroids were used by 46.2% of GPs and by 91.2% of dermatologists. Vitamin D analogues were prescribed by GPs and dermatologists in 15.4% and 73.5% of cases, respectively. Systemic medication for juvenile psoriasis was only used by 20.6% of dermatologists. Calculated for the Dutch population, there should be approximately 27,500 children with psoriasis in The Netherlands. Topical corticosteroids were the first-choice treatment for both GPs and dermatologists, whereas vitamin D analogues were used as a second-choice topical therapy.

Methods Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1990-1996) were used to characterize the use of medication at physician office visits for psoriasis vulgaris. Corticosteroid agents in the years 1990-1994 were classified by relative potency. Results There were 1.0 million yearly visits for psoriasis. Dermatologists were responsible for 95% of these office visits. Topical corticosteroids were the only medication listed at 50% of psoriasis visits, and were used in combination with another medication in an additional 26% of visits. High and superpotent corticosteroid agents accounted for 55% of all topical corticosteroid agents listed. Topical calcipotriene was the most commonly used noncorticosteroid treatment, and its use in combination with corticosteroids increased from 17% to 84% between 1994 and 1996. s 80% or more of people with psoriasis do not see a physician for the disease in any given year.

The hair of 27 children was divided into two sections sagitally, and each comb was randomly assigned to one half of the hair, and the lice and eggs removed by the combs were counted. In 96% of subjects, the Lice Meister comb removed more eggs than the Lady Jayne comb, with an average of three to four times more hatched, dead, and live eggs removed. The Lice Meister comb removed more lice than the Lady Jayne comb in 10 subjects, the same in eight subjects, and less in nine subjects.

The Pearson correlation between drug expenditure and population was 0.25 and 0.35 for the correlation between expenditure and homogeneous production (p=0.32 and p=0,15, respectively), both Pearson coefficients confirming the lack of correlation and arelevant degree of variability in drug expenditures. The quantitative analysis of variability performed through Pearson correlation has confirmed the existence of drug expenditure variability among comparable dermatology departments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24128098/"}

We performed a cross-sectional study inviting all dermatologists in Berlin and Brandenburg to give self-estimates of their own prescription behavior of anti-psoriatic drugs. The results were compared with the results from a consecutive 8-months cohort study with the same participants documenting their actual treatment choices during every visit of a psoriasis patient on a standardized documentation sheet. Differences between self-estimates and documented prescription patterns were analyzed with respect to systemic anti-psoriatic drugs and UV treatment. Fifty-one dermatologists participated. They documented an average of 91 patient visits each. Absolute differences between the self-estimates and the documented actual prescription behavior ranged from -2.5% to 1.4% for systemic treatments. For psoralen plus ultravioloet A (PUVA) treatment, the absolute difference was 3.3% and for ultraviolet B (UVB) 4.7%. Self-estimates were surprisingly exact.

With respect to exacerbating factors, 67% of students identified stress, 10% identified lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol consumption), and 25% claimed poor facial hygiene exacerbated acne. Diet was stated to be an important factor by 41% of students, of whom 12% specifically mentioned chocolate. Persistence of these misconceptions among medical graduates is likely to perpetuate misinformation in the community.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11309030/"}

Proponents of the practice state that in-office dispensing is beneficial for the patient and the physician and can be ethically accomplished with the patient remaining the primary concern of the care provider. This requires the maintenance of professionalism and the sale of efficacious, reasonably priced products that are not misrepresented. Opponents believe that in-office dispensing undermines the physician- patient relationship and may produce an inherent conflict of interest. In academia, additional concerns include how students and residents perceive this activity. Does selling products negatively affect professionalism in an academic environment? In an academic teaching environment there is a paramount need to model ethical behavior to medical students and residents. We will discuss the opposition and rationalization for the practice of in-office dispensing in academic teaching settings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22902225/"}

The aim of this paper was to review current literature to assess topical steroid phobia prevalence, populations most at risk, reasons behind steroid phobia, and interventions to reduce it. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid (Journals@Ovid, MEDLINE), ScienceDirect, and Web of Science was performed. Studies ranged from May 2000 to February 2021. In total, 37 articles met the inclusion criteria. There was inter-study variation in the way steroid phobia is defined, from concern to irrational fear. The worldwide prevalence of topical steroid phobia ranges from 31 to 95.7% and does not differ with patient race/ethnicity or dermatological condition. Female patients and caregivers, and those who have experienced side effects of topical corticosteroids are most likely to express steroid phobia. Reasons for steroid phobia include lack of education, fear of side effects, polypharmacy, misinformation, negative experience with topical steroids, and frequently changing of clinics. Successful interventions to address steroid phobia include patient education in the form of educational videos followed by individualized oral education based on concerns, and demonstrations of application of topical steroids. Multiple interventions address topical corticosteroid phobia and improve adherence of topical corticosteroids in the management of dermatological conditions. Providers should screen patients for steroid phobia, especially in populations particularly at risk. Interventions using patient education should be individualized based on concerns expressed during screening. Further research should investigate if reducing steroid phobia can in fact improve long-term adherence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34287768/"}

Pro-drugs are chemical derivatives of an active drug which is covalently bonded to an inactive pro-moiety in order to overcome pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. A pro-drug relies upon conversion within the body to release the parent active drug (and pro-moiety) to elicit its pharmacological effect. The main drawback of this approach is that the pro-moiety is essentially an unwanted ballast which, when released, can lead to adverse effects. The term 'co-drug' refers to two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same disease bonded via a covalent chemical linkage and it is this approach which is reviewed for the first time in the current article. For topically applied co-drugs, each moiety is liberated in situ, either chemically or enzymatically, once the stratum corneum barrier has been overcome by the co-drug. Advantages include synergistic modulation of the disease process, enhancement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetic properties and the potential to enhance stability by masking of labile functional groups. The amount of published work on co-drugs is limited but the available data suggest the co-drug concept could provide a significant therapeutic improvement in dermatological diseases. However, the applicability of the co-drug approach is subject to strict limitations pertaining mainly to the availability of compatible moieties and physicochemical properties of the overall molecule.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18393881/"}

To investigate the relationships between free drug samples and dermatologists' local and national prescribing patterns and between the availability of free drug samples and prescription costs. Cross-sectional study investigating prescribing practices for acne, a common dermatologic condition for which free samples are often available. The settings were, first, the offices of nationally representative dermatologists from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (an IMS Health Incorporated database) and, second, an academic medical center clinic without samples. Participants were ambulatory patients who received a prescription from a dermatologist for a primary initial diagnosis of acne vulgaris or rosacea in 2010. National trends in dermatologist prescribing patterns, the degree of correlation between the availability of free samples and the prescribing of brand-name medications, and the mean cost of acne medications prescribed per office visit nationally and at an academic medical center without samples. On a national level, the provision of samples with a prescription by dermatologists has been increasing over time, and this increase is correlated (r = 0.92) with the use of the branded generic drugs promoted by these samples. Branded and branded generic drugs comprised most of the prescriptions written nationally (79%), while they represented only 17% at an academic medical center clinic without samples. Because of the increased use of branded and branded generic drugs, the national mean total retail cost of prescriptions at an office visit for acne was conservatively estimated to be 2 times higher (approximately $465 nationally vs $200 at an academic medical center without samples). Free drug samples can alter the prescribing habits of physicians away from the use of less expensive generic medications.

Principles of rational use of systemic antibiotics in dermatology].", "text": "Antibiotics are frequently prescribed and extremely valuable drugs, because they are curative. However, their often incorrect use is the main reason for the increase of multiresistant pathogens. Inappropriate prescription of broad spectrum antibiotics for skin and soft tissue infections favors the selection and spread of multiresistant bacteria not only in the skin, but also in remote visceral organs (e.g. in the intestines), due to their systemic distribution and effects in the body (so-called collateral damage). For this reason basic knowledge and special prudence when using antibiotics are just as desirable as an awareness of responsibility for the public welfare. This article intends to convey basic knowledge on the indications and selection of suitable antibiotics as well as on the development of bacterial resistance and it gives recommendations for allergological procedures when patients report alleged drug reactions to antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics for soft tissue infections are indicated when the infection spreads within the tissue so that it is no longer accessible for local antiseptics. In addition to the clinical symptoms, important parameters are high blood sedimentation rates (BSR) and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis with neutrophilia and fever (not always present in elderly or immunosuppressed patients). Certain constellations, such as the presence of severe underlying diseases, perfusion disorders or a particular localization (e.g. infection of the face) may necessitate early or parenteral administration. There is no need for systemic administration of antibiotics for uncomplicated wounds without soft tissue infections. Due to their curative effects, the decisive criterion for the use of antibiotics is their sufficient antimicrobial efficacy at the site of infection. An inappropriate administration increases both the selection pressure and costs of treatment and can have fatal consequences in serious situations. In dermatological patients the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin V, penicillin G and cephalosporins of groups 1 and 2 are the antibiotics most commonly indicated for skin and soft tissue infections. If the patient's history arouses the suspicion of incompatibility to these antibiotics, allergological diagnostics should be carried out in order to avoid as often as possible the alternative use of antibiotics which result in more undesired effects and development of resistance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549481/"}

We performed an extensive literature search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies included in the review were those that analysed systemic treatments using biologics and SMIs in subjects under 18 years of age. We extracted data on participant demographics, treatment regimens, effectiveness outcomes, adverse effects, and follow-up details. The risk of bias in the studies was determined using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB2). From an initial pool of 1,454 studies, 49 articles fitting the inclusion criteria were identified, encompassing 6372 cases. The review found that biologics such as Dupilumab, along with investigational JAK inhibitors like Abrocitinib and Upadacitinib, exhibited considerable efficacy in treating various conditions, particularly atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Dupilumab specifically demonstrated significant improvements in both disease severity and quality of life. While most reported adverse events were mild to moderate, some serious adverse events were noted with certain treatments. Biologics and SMIs show great promise as therapeutic options in paediatric dermatology, offering better efficacy compared to traditional treatments.

By 1961, however, there were mounting reports of phocomelia and other severe congenital abnormalities associated with maternal use of thalidomide, and the drug was withdrawn from the market and its availability highly restricted. A few years later, thalidomide would find use in dermatology after it was reported that leprosy patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) experienced rapid and dramatic improvement after taking the drug as a sedative. Additional data quickly confirmed thalidomide's efficacy in ENL, and today it is the drug of choice in the condition. In subsequent decades, the drug has been successfully tried in treatment of a variety of apparently unrelated dermatologic disorders. Meanwhile, thalidomide has been shown to possess a range of biologic actions, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha, possibly relevant to its clinical efficacy. Dermatologic disorders in addition to ENL in which thalidomide's effectiveness is well documented include aphthous stomatitis, discoid lupus erythematosus, actinic prurigo, Behçet's disease, and prurigo nodularis.

We aimed to assess the reliability of a mobile telephone application (MDi-Psoriasis) designed to help the dermatologist make decisions on how to treat patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. We analyzed interobserver agreement between the advice given by an expert panel and the recommendations of the MDi-Psoriasis application in 10 complex cases of moderate to severe psoriasis. The experts were asked their opinion on which treatments were most appropriate, possible, or inappropriate. Data from the same 10 cases were entered into the MDi-Psoriasis application. Agreement was analyzed in 3 ways: paired interobserver concordance (Cohen's κ), multiple interobserver concordance (Fleiss's κ), and percent agreement between recommendations. The mean percent agreement between the total of 1210 observations was 51.3% (95% CI, 48.5-54.1%). Cohen's κ statistic was 0.29 and Fleiss's κ was 0.28. Mean agreement between pairs of human observers only, excluding the MDi-Psoriasis recommendations, was 50.5% (95% CI, 47.6-53.5%). Paired agreement between the recommendations of the MDi-Psoriasis tool and the majority opinion of the expert panel (Cohen's κ) was 0.44 (68.2% agreement).

For this reason, the selection presented covering the period from November 2009 to October 2010 is to a very large extent based on controlled trials, either because they contribute important information or because they raise great hope for a significant number of patients. For the first time in cutaneous oncology, a treatment (ipilimumab) has significantly increased overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (phase III), although this gain remains modest (4-6 months) and adverse immunological effects are frequent (30-40%). A phase I trial with treatment specifically targeting the mutant BRAF protein has shown an objective response in 81% of the patients treated in the metastatic phase of melanoma, thus allowing its development to be pursued. Grouping two studies in a rare tumor such as dermatofibrosarcoma also gives hope with imatinib as a neoadjuvant treatment when the initial tumor is inoperable, with, however, an inconsistent response of approximately 50% and only if the tumor presents reorganization of chromosomes 17 and 22. Cutaneous inflammatory diseases are still dominated by dual therapies in psoriasis, with, notably, an effectiveness trial on etanercept at different doses not showing a difference in efficacy depending on dose for the joint component of psoriasis, but also by the publication of a direct comparison of two dual therapies, ustekinumab versus etanercept. In atopic dermatitis, a controversial article invites one to reflect upon the progress made in the management of children by clinical nurses, as in the Netherlands and in Great Britain, in an attempt to contend with the shortage of dermatologists. Since the use of biotherapies is not the prerogative of psoriasis, infliximab was assessed in a phase II trial in Verneuil disease without demonstrating significant efficacy on the main criterion, but it did show a tendency to reduce the score used. This trial suffered from a weakness both in methodology and statistical power, thus precluding any conclusion. The rarity of therapeutic trials on drug eruptions warrants their mention. A French phase II study gives a glimpse of a trend toward efficacy in terms of survival in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis with cyclosporine. As for infectious dermatosis and sexually transmitted infections, a French multicenter study has shown significantly higher efficacy with ivermectin than with malathion in treating pediculosis without increasing the side effects. Today, however, this systemic treatment cannot be a first-line treatment outside of certain specific situations. A large cohort study (somewhat unsatisfactory in its methodology) has not demonstrated the teratogenicity of antiherpes treatments in 830,000 infants. In prevention of HIV transmission, no microbicidal gel had shown efficacy to date. This has now been accomplished in South Africa with a 1% tenofovir gel. The results of a preliminary trial on therapeutic vaccination against HPV16 proposed to women who are carriers of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia opens the way for wide vaccine therapy of cutaneous virus-induced neoplasia.

Among the 39 responding dermatologists (15 women, 24 men), 54% saw fewer than 10 psoriatic patients per week, 23% 10-20 patients, and 23% more than 20 patients. About half of the dermatologists treat their patients with an initial MTX dose of <7.5 mg/week (range 5-17.5 mg/week), an average dose of <10 mg/week (range 5-25 mg/week), and a maximum dose of <20 mg/week (range 7.550 – mg/week) with 71.8% prescribing the medication orally and 28.2% intramuscularly. Subcutaneous injection was preferred by none of the dermatologists as a usual route of administration. Nearly 5% of the dermatologists believe that liver biopsy should be performed prior to treatment with MTX in all patients, and another 5% consider this procedure prior to treatment only in patients with risk factors. About 44 and 33% of the dermatologists do the liver biopsy after 1.0-1.5 g and 3.54 g total cumulative doses, respectively.

Currently, skin diseases are considered a major global health issue, impacting individuals of all ages. Skin conditions can vary broadly, ranging from common issues like acne and eczema to more serious diseases such as psoriasis, melanoma, and other types of skin cancer. In recent years, computational methods have appeared as powerful tools for explaining the lurking mechanisms of skin diseases and the advancement of the discovery regarding updated therapeutics. This review spotlights the notable researches that have been performed in using computational approaches such as virtual screening, molecular modelling, and molecular dynamics simulations to discover potential treatments for dermatological conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, skin cancer, and tyrosinase-related disorders. Moreover, using in silico methods, researchers have explored the molecular interactions between cosmetic actives and skin targets, providing insights into the binding affinities, stability, and efficacy of these compounds. This computational exploration allows the identification of potential off-target effects and toxicity profiles, ensuring that only the most promising candidates proceed to clinical testing. In addition, the use of molecular dynamics simulations helps to understand conformational changes and interaction dynamics over time, further refining the selection of effective cosmetic actives.

More recently, research efforts have focused on the role of drug uptake through appendages and the use of penetration enhancement systems (chemical and physical) to force chemicals through the skin. Much of this research has concerned the delivery of active drug moieties from specifically designed delivery vehicles or transdermal therapeutic systems to treat dermatological or systemic conditions. The complexity of topical dosage forms and of desired skin protection properties makes it difficult to formulate general guidelines for the development and the use of protective topical dermatological formulations. At present it appears that a product is designed for each specific environmental condition or threat. It seems unlikely that this will change until there are considerable advances in the engineering technology of topical formulations.

Objectives To compare methotrexate dosing and monitoring practices in dermatology and rheumatology, assess adverse drug reactions, and analyse the financial impact of rigorous monitoring. Methods This observational, electronic medical record-based retrospective chart review included psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients started on methotrexate at the dermatology and rheumatology departments at a tertiary care centre in 2020-2021. Patients with concurrent hepatotoxic/myelotoxic medications, inadequate follow-up, or abnormal baseline laboratory tests were excluded. Data regarding demographics, relevant medical histories, clinical variables, methotrexate dosing, frequency of laboratory monitoring, adverse events, and resource utilization were recorded and analysed. Descriptive statistics (means/percentages) and inferential tests (Chi-Square Test or Mann- Whitney Test) were used based on data normality (p<0.05 considered significant). Results The study included 100 psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients each. The psoriatic arthritis patients were given higher methotrexate doses initially but underwent less frequent laboratory monitoring compared to psoriasis patients. The incidence of hepatotoxicity was comparable between the two groups. However, leukopenia was observed more frequently in psoriatic arthritis patients. Methotrexate monitoring under dermatologists cost 44% more than that under rheumatologists over 6 months (Rs 4766.08± 1631.9 vs Rs 3290.32± 1207.8). Limitations The single centre, small sample size, retrospective chart review, and convenience sampling in this study may all limit the generalisability of the findings. Conclusion Current methotrexate guidelines in dermatology recommend lower doses and more frequent monitoring than rheumatology guidelines. Insights from this study and comparison with rheumatology practices and existing literature highlight the potential for designing large-scale, multicentric, non-inferiority studies that could eventually help develop more efficient and streamlined methotrexate monitoring protocols for dermatology and rheumatology, ultimately improving patient adherence, safety and affordability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40587530/"}

Due to the fact, that these products are in direct contact to the target tissue, their vehicle and ingredients are able to profoundly modulate the characteristics of the skin and some of its functions. This makes products for the skin absolute unique and versatile delivery systems.

These treatments can be associated with a variety of local and systemic side effects, as well as to very often unsatisfactory results. The purpose of this critical review of the literature is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the synthesis of new analogues of the Vitamin D3 Tacalcitol, which is formulated in ointment form at a concentration of 4 microg/g, for the treatment of mild and/or moderate psoriasis (involvement of <20% of the surface of the skin) and to evaluate whether this drug can be used in the treatment of other skin conditions. Based on existing data in the literature, Tacalcitol is an effective drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis and is also able to ensure that the effects last over time, even after treatment has stopped. Tacalcitol is also well tolerated because the onset of side effects, such as local irritation, pruriginous or burning sensations, were reported in only a small percentage of the subjects who were treated. Lastly, the marked regulatory effects it has on the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, as well as on the immunocompetent cells, has led to suggestions that Tacalcitol may be used in other keratinisation disorders and in some hyperproliferative skin diseases. Evaluation of the effective indications to use in these conditions still requires further data confirming its effectiveness, opening the way to wider use of this molecule in dermatology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16116820/"}

Objective: To review the literature and assess available randomized-controlled trials using collagen supplementation for treatment efficacy regarding skin quality, anti-aging benefits, and potential application in medical dermatology. Evidence Review: A literature search was conducted with PubMed using search criteria (collagen) AND (supplement OR food OR nutrition). No lower limit on the year of publication was set. Inclusion criteria were: randomized, placebo-controlled trials using collagen supplementation in human subjects related to dermatology and written in English. Findings: Eleven studies with a total of 805 patients were included for review. Eight studies used collagen hydrolysate, 2.5g/d to 10g/d, for 8 to 24 weeks, for the treatment of pressure ulcers, xerosis, skin aging, and cellulite. Two studies used collagen tripeptide, 3g/d for 4 to 12 weeks, with notable improvement in skin elasticity and hydration. Lastly, one study using collagen dipeptide suggested anti-aging efficacy is proportionate to collagen dipeptide content. Conclusions and Relevance: Preliminary results are promising for the short and long-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density. Collagen supplementation is generally safe with no reported adverse events.

To evaluate these compendia for dermatologic conditions, with a focus on less common conditions that often require systemic treatment. This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 1, 2018, through September 30, 2018. To identify diseases for which dermatologists may often need access to off-label systemic treatments, a list of 22 chronic, noninfectious, nonneoplastic diseases with at least 4 systemic therapies (including 1 in the first-line therapies and less than 25% approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) were selected for evaluation.

A search of AHFS and DRUGDEX compendia was performed to evaluate for inclusion of the evidence-based therapies. In addition, the references cited in the compendia to justify inclusion of the therapy were examined qualitatively. Percentage of treatment options included in each compendium, stratified by level of evidence and position on the therapeutic ladder. Concordance between the 2 compendia was assessed using Cohen κ. Overall, 73 of 238 treatments (30.7%) evaluated were included in either compendium.

Discrepancies in which a medication was included in one compendium but not in the other compendium occurred for 53 of the 238 medications (22.3%) evaluated. Literature use did not follow a discernible pattern and was often based on decades-old sources.

This review exhaustively analyzes the various pregnancy dermatoses (pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, impetigo herpetiformis, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, and the papular dermatoses of pregnancy [prurigo of pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, and the new classification, atopic eruption of pregnancy]) in an attempt to shed light over this confusing and disputed domain, while subsequently offering an algorithmic approach to their diagnosis and management. While for pemphigus gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and impetigo herpetiformis, specific diagnostic tests such as histopathology, immunofluorescence, or laboratory investigations will confirm the diagnosis, the identification of the other types of pregnancy dermatoses is based only on clinical criteria. In this context, the review argues for the inclusion of the whole group represented by the papular dermatoses of pregnancy within the broad spectrum of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, separating each of these entities by focusing on their onset: early-onset polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (comprising prurigo of pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, and atopic eruption of pregnancy) and late-onset polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.

Instinctively, we try to treat a skin injury or irritation with cooling or soothing substances. Even animals lick their wounds, trusting instinctively in the healing power of saliva. When did this archaic pattern of treatment take the gigantic leap from folk medicine to modern drug therapy? This text illustrates the evolution of topical dermatological vehicles, their application (guidelines) and future use. In particular, a phenomenon that has so far been ignored in product development and clinical testing is the vehicle metamorphosis. In clinical and experimental situations, most dermatological vehicles undergo considerable changes after they have been removed from the primary container and are applied to the skin. Subsequently, the initial structural matrix, and the quantitative composition of the vehicle, will most likely change during and after the mechanical shear associated with application of the product and/or evaporation of ingredients. This natural, but highly dynamic process will generate mini-environments for the active moiety that are difficult to predict and that are crucial to the fate of the active moiety. Despite the reasonable wishes of formulators, clinicians, patients and customers, there are still no universal vehicles. Each drug, at each concentration, requires a different vehicle for optimized therapy. Stability and compatibility of excipients and active moiety are crucial for any commercially available pharmaceutical or cosmetic formulation, together with local and systemic safety of all components. Nonetheless, more diverse and molecularly complex classes of new dermatological vehicles are continuously being researched and refined. The scientific progress has been remarkable when one considers the simple emulsion mixtures that were commonplace in dermatological therapy and still persist to this day in commercial products. It is to be hoped that the result of these research endeavors will be the emergence of more innovative topical formulations, applying engineered bioavailability control systems, with broader applications in topical therapeutic and cosmetic vehicles.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15724099/"}

In the case of psoriasis there is a range of treatments available, with varying degrees of efficacy and risk of adverse events. To examine the extent to which the attributes of a treatment affect dermatologists' choice of drug therapy and explore the magnitude and nature of the trade-offs between the risks and benefits of treatment. A postal questionnaire was sent to members of the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD). The questionnaire used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit dermatologists' preferences for the treatment of psoriasis. In all, 227 dermatologists completed the questionnaire. The results indicated that time to moderate improvement, time to relapse, risk of hypertension, liver damage, skin cancer and skin irritation were all important factors affecting dermatologists' choice of treatment. Comparing the coefficients for the different side-effects indicated that the dermatologists considered the risk of liver damage to be the most important side-effect, followed by the risk of skin cancer. The time to achieve a moderate (50%) improvement in psoriasis was prioritized over the time to relapse. This study has provided novel insight into the trade-offs that dermatologists face when selecting treatment for psoriasis patients. Future research should explore the extent to which dermatologists' preferences for treatment match those of psoriasis sufferers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17107395/"}

The transcription factor NRF2 is a central regulator of cytoprotection and stress resistance. NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles. These electrophiles oxidize specific cysteine residues of the NRF2 inhibitor KEAP1, leading to KEAP1 inactivation and, subsequently, NRF2 activation. As oxidative stress is associated with inflammation, the NRF2 pathway plays important roles in the pathogenesis of common inflammatory diseases and cancer in many tissues and organs, including the skin. The electrophile and NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an established and efficient drug for patients suffering from the common inflammatory skin disease psoriasis and the neuro-inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of DMF and other NRF2 activators. Recent evidence suggests that electrophiles not only activate NRF2, but also target other inflammation-associated pathways including the transcription factor NF-κB and the multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are central regulators of inflammation and are involved in many inflammatory conditions. Most importantly, the NRF2 and inflammasome pathways are connected at different levels, mainly antagonistically.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053878/"}

A panel of dermatologists from Latin America employed an online procedure to answer questions on this topic: What is used, by whom, when, how, and why? Before the meeting, a survey was completed by dermatologists from Latin America on OTC products for acne recommended by the panel in their clinical practice. The survey information and a literature review on Latin American acne guidelines and clinical studies were used to address this topic. The survey responders' choices on OTC products for monotherapy comprised alpha-hydroxy acid and beta-hydroxy acid-containing serum, ceramides-containing foaming cleanser, a soap-free exfoliating cleanser, adapalene, and benzoyl peroxide-containing products. The clinicians recommended OTC cleansing products mainly for younger patients at a starter level and for women with adult acne. The use of these OTC products is similar to practice described in therapeutic acne guidelines and algorithms for Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal, Europe, and the United States. Advisors agreed that OTC products and skincare recommendations, in addition to the use of prescription medications, are a crucial part of successful acne therapy. Participants noted that the use of quality OTC products could improve acne symptomatology and severity.

However, there are few studies on this subject. To increase the knowledge about the dermatological consequences of this practice in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. A representative sample of 368 adult women presenting at our dermatological centre was selected. Each woman was questioned about her cosmetic use of bleaching products. Next, the following data were recorded in 425 women who used bleaching products: names and types of products used; modalities of the skin bleaching practice; skin diseases motivating the dermatological visit, with recording of their clinical features; and results of a full skin examination. The active substances of the bleaching products were determined mainly by reading the indications on their packages; with products of unknown composition, a pharmacological analysis of samples was done. A statistical analysis was performed. Of the 368 women questioned, 194 (52.7%) were current users of bleaching products. Concerning the 425 users enrolled, products were applied on the whole body in 92% of users, with a median duration of use of 4 years. The active principles used included hydroquinone (used by 89% of users), glucocorticoids (70%), mercury iodide (10%) and caustic agents (17%); 13% of users used products of unknown composition. In the samples that were analysed, hydroquinone was found at concentrations of between 4% and 8.7%. Concerning steroids, superpotent (class 1) glucocorticoids predominated. The main skin complaints in bleaching products users included dermatophyte infections (n = 105) and scabies (n = 69), both often unusually extensive and severe; acne (n = 42), often severe; eczema (n = 41); irritant dermatitis (n = 14); and dyschromia (n = 26, including 14 cases of exogenous ochronosis). The skin examination noted features apparently disregarded by users: striae (noticed in 39% of users), and macular hyperchromia involving the face, mainly the periocular area (33%). The statistical analysis showed that glucocorticoid use was associated with the presence and severity of infectious skin diseases, and of acne. More than half of the adult women presenting at our dermatology centre were using bleaching products. Most skin diseases observed in bleaching products users appeared to be induced, aggravated or modified by this practice.

Data from ten patients with sarcoidosis treated with thalidomide between January 1998 and March 1999 were collected from delivery authorizations and analyzed. All ten patients had chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis resistant to conventional therapy. Six patients had an associated visceral localization and disease duration of 2 to 18 years (median 6 years). We considered that regression was complete when erythema and infiltration had totally disappeared, that regression was incomplete when cutaneous signs remained, and that treatment had failed when no effect was observed or when the disease worsened. Disease regression was noted in 7 patients for a daily dose of 1.84 mg/kg for 2.8 months. Skin lesions totally regressed in 3 patients, an incompletely in 4. Treatment failed in 3 patients. Patients were treated for 10 months (2 to 21 months). The daily dose of thalidomide was gradually reduced in 5 of 7 patients for whom treatment was effective. Three of these 5 patients relapsed and thalidomide was again given and was effective again at the same dose and after the same delay. We observed improved kidney function in one patient, improvement in nasal infiltration in one other and complete regression in 3 patients who achieved long lasting reduction in angiotensin convertase level. When treatment failed, the daily dose was 1.15 mg/kg and the treatment had to be stopped for 2 patients. Side effects were minor, excepting 2 cases of neuropathy. This open study of 10 patients treated with thalidomide showed the efficacy of a 1.84 mg/kg daily dose in 7 out of 10, but complete regression of the lesions was obtained in only 3 patients.

Clinically, it manifests as chronic-recurrent xerosis, pruritus, and erythematous lesions. Its pathophysiology is complex, making the selection of appropriate treatment options a task. To share insights gained from a literature review and discussions with experts in dermatology on key factors related to the prevention, treatment, and management of AD in relation to the skin microbiome. Results from an expert panel were summarized and discussed to provide updated recommendations for the treatment and maintenance of AD. Evidence supports a strategy for managing inflammatory skin diseases with a selenium-rich post-biotic thermal water and biomass containing moisturizer. The moisturizer helps to restore homeostasis of the skin, re-populate a diverse microbiome, encourage the growth of commensal bacteria, and improve barrier function and symptoms of AD. Normalization of skin microbiome diversity using a topical moisturizer containing post-biotic aqua and biomass may offer a valuable option for the treatment and maintenance of inflammatory skin diseases. Clinicians should discuss the benefits of this treatment in the context of a full AD management program that covers prevention, active treatment, and maintenance.

PDT is used in several medical specialties as an organ-specific therapy for different entities. In this review we focus on the current dermatological procedure of PDT. In the most widely used PDT protocol in dermatology, ROS production occurs by accumulation of the endogenous photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX after treatment with the metabolic precursors 5-methylaminolevulinic acid (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). To date, current approved dermatological indications of PDT include actinic keratoses (AK), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and in situ squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) also known as Bowen disease (BD). With regards to AKs, PDT can also treat the cancerization field carrying an oncogenic risk. In addition, an increasing number of pathologies, such as other skin cancers, infectious, inflammatory or pilosebaceous diseases are being considered as potentially treatable entities with PDT. Besides the known therapeutic properties of PDT, there is a modality used for skin rejuvenation and aesthetic purposes defined as photodynamic photorejuvenation. This technique enables the remodelling of collagen, which in turn prevents and treats photoaging stygmata. Finally we explore a new potential treatment field for PDT determined by the activation of follicular bulge stem cells caused by in situ ROS formation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27422482/"}

Efficacy of treatment was assessed clinically using the Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI), the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) and the pruritus visual analogue scale. In parallel, blood microcirculation in the skin was measured as an objective parameter for skin inflammation. Skin hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were monitored as parameter relevant for the barrier function. Treatment with pimecrolimus cream 1% resulted in a quick and marked improvement of signs and symptoms of AD and a significant reduction of microcirculation from 33.90 to 15.55 AU (P < 0.0001). Skin hydration increased continually from 42.86 to 52.69 AU (P = 0.002) and TEWL decreased from 35.30 to 21.50 g/m(2)/h (P = 0.001), indicating restoration of skin barrier.

The prevailing perception of a limited commercial potential of dermatological drug products has restricted innovation and encouraged a more conservative development approach. For example, the focus was on repurposing/reformulation of existing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) specifically for the topical delivery route. However, the situation is quite different today catalyzed in part by the blockbuster success of Dupixent (dupilumab), the first monoclonal antibody treatment for atopic dermatitis which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2017. Dupixent's success not only encouraged the development of other biologics but also inspired the (re-)development of new dermal drug products that can reap the many benefits of topical administration. We have also witnessed a shift toward outsourcing development efforts (and associated risks) towards small- to mid-size pharmaceutical companies which often require support of contract research and development/manufacturing organizations (CRO and CDMO). Such trends also emphasize the need of greater expertise in topical formulation design, as well as associated commercial and regulatory considerations. Today, we believe that topical drug products remain not only an essential but also commercially viable class of dermatological therapeutics.

Whereas it has been shown that dermatologists prefer using more intensive therapy for AD than generalists, actual drug utilization has not been quantified. The purpose of this study is to characterize visits for and treatment of AD in the office-based setting. National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 1990 to 1997 was analyzed to determine the use of topical corticosteroids (including their relative potencies), oral antibiotics, and oral antihistamines in the treatment of AD. There were an estimated 900,000 outpatient visits per year for AD. If in some visits to generalists the diagnosis for AD was miscoded as contact dermatitis, there may have been as many as 3 million outpatient visits per year for AD. Topical corticosteroids were used in 67% of visits with a mean potency rank of 4.5 (4.3, 4.8 95% CI). Dermatologists saw 48% of all visits for AD (63 yearly visits/physician) and allergists saw 10% of visits (30 yearly visits/physician). Other physicians saw from 0.1 to 2 yearly visits per physician. Dermatologists were the most likely to use topical corticosteroids (81% of visits) and high-potency corticosteroid agents (22% of visits). Dermatologists and allergists were the only physicians to prescribe ultrahigh-potent corticosteroid agents (12% and 9% of visits, respectively) and were more likely than other physicians to use multiple-agent regimens (21% and 27% of visits treated with a corticosteroid agent, respectively). Dermatologists and allergists have more expertise in the management of AD than other physicians, as suggested by their higher per capita visits and greater use of complex topical corticosteroid regimens.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11685667/"}

Consultant physician members of the paediatric dermatology societies and interest groups of eight European countries were invited to participate in a web-based survey. The multiple-response format questionnaire collated data on clinical practice in general, as well as detailed information on the use of systemic agents in refractory paediatric atopic eczema. In total, 343/765 members (44·8%) responded to the invitational emails; 89·2% were dermatologists and 71% initiate systemic immunosuppression for children with severe atopic eczema. The first-line drugs of choice were ciclosporin (43·0%), oral corticosteroids (30·7%) and azathioprine (21·7%). Ciclosporin was also the most commonly used second-line medication (33·6%), with methotrexate ranked as most popular third choice (26·2%). Around half of the respondents (53·7%) replied that they routinely test and treat reservoirs of cutaneous infection prior to starting systemic treatment.

Neoral is a microemulsion preconcentrate formulation that has self-emulsifying properties and immediately forms a microemulsion in aqueous fluids, allowing rapid and consistent absorption of cyclosporin from the gastrointestinal tract. Benefits in dermatology are likely to be more patients responding at lower doses, a faster onset of action and a more predictable response to a given dose allowing for fewer dose adjustments.

{"id": "30561009", "title": "Dermatology today and tomorrow: from symptom control to targeted therapy.", "text": "For many decades and until recently, medical approach to dermatologic diseases has been based on the physician's ability to recognize and treat symptoms. Nowadays, advances in the understanding of the biology of diseases and in technologies for intervening against them have allowed physicians to diagnose and treat underlying disease processes rather than simply addressing the symptoms. This means that rather than addressing 'the disease in humans', physicians can now address the particular pathologic (biologic, molecular) disturbance as it presents in the individual patient, i.e., physicians now can practice something much closer to 'personalized medicine', leading to greater benefits for the patients and the health of society in general. The deeper understanding of ultraviolet radiation, the importance of photoprotection and increased knowledge about signalling pathways of melanoma and carcinoma have led to more complete care for the dermatologic patient. The current popularity for excessive exposure to the sun, without adequate application of the appropriate photoprotection remedies, is the origin of melanoma, but also for the weakening of the structure and functions of the skin. Indeed, fragility of the skin can affect humans around the world. In the senior population, this skin fragility is accompanied by pruritus, whereas atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory disease with highest prevalence in children and adolescents. Acne, the number one reason for dermatologic consultations worldwide, increases its prevalence in adolescents and in females. Senescent alopecia affects humans after menopause and andropause. The articles in this publication present an overview of the current advanced understanding of the diagnosis and therapeutic approaches in 6 fields of dermatology - dermatopaediatry and gerontodermatology, oncodermatology, hair loss, atopic dermatitis, photoprotection and acne - and thereby serve as a useful compendium of updated information and references for all healthcare professionals who see patients with presentations of the symptoms of these diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30561009/"}

The study protocol was prospectively published on the PROSPERO database, and the study followed PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made using MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsycINFO databases and records were combined into an Endnote database. Records were filtered for duplicates and selected based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Of 157 patients were included in the study. Median PASI was 4.2 (IQR 2.6-6.9), and the median FDLQI was 12 (IQR 7-17). The correlation coefficient between PASI and FDLQI was 0.44 (P < 0.001). Burden of care was the highest scoring item on the FDLQI, followed by emotional impact. 146 patients were treated with topical therapy with a mean improvement in PASI of 3.92. 19 patients underwent phototherapy, and 19 underwent systemic therapy. In this largest study to date studying the impact of PASI on FDLQI, disease severity was found to be strongly associated with adverse quality of life of family members of paediatric psoriasis patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33586132/"}

Topical therapy is usually the first line of management. It is believed that successful topical treatment requires pharmaceutical formulation from a sufficient dosage to exert therapeutic effects by penetrating the stratum corneum and then diffusing to the target area. However, many factors can affect this process including the physicochemical properties of the active compound, the composition of the formulation base, and the limitations and conditions of the skin barrier, especially in inflammatory skin. This article briefly reviews the available data on these issues and provides opinions on strategies to develop a suitable formulation for inflammatory skin disease treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34199951/"}

Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if there is chemical, microbiological, and/or clinical evidence, from a scientific perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug development. We compile and emphasize the most important part of ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants against problem skin diseases as well. Different kinds of key phrases such as \"Indian traditional ethnodermatology\", \"ethnodermatology\", \"ethnobotany\", \"skin diseases\", \"Ayurveda dermatology\", \"pharmacological activity\" were searched in online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/), PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants' uses have been found across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against particular skin diseases. The knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells. Complementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today, ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be intensified.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34656666/"}

The motivation to accomplish organotypic structures was driven by the clinics to enable transplantation of in vitro grown tissue substitutes and by the cosmetics industry as alternative test substrates in order to replace animal models. Today a huge variety of 3D human skin models exist, covering a multitude of scientific and/or technical demands. This review summarizes and discusses different approaches of skin model development and sets them into the context of drug development. Although human skin models have become indispensable for the cosmetics industry, they have not yet started their triumphal procession in pharmaceutical research and development. For drug development these tissue models may be of particular interest for a) systemically acting drugs applied on the skin, and b) drugs acting at the site of application in the case of skin diseases or disorders. Although quite a broad spectrum of models covering different aspects of the skin as a biologically acting surface exists, these are most often single stand-alone approaches. In order to enable the comprehensive application into drug development processes, the approaches have to be synchronized to allow a cross-over comparison. Besides the development of biological relevant models, other issues are not less important in the context of drug development: standardized production procedures, process automation, establishment of significant analytical methods, and data correlation. For the successful routine use of engineered human skin models in drug development, major requirements were defined. If these requirements can be accomplished in the next few years, human organotypic skin models will become indispensable for drug development, too.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24378581/"}

As skin conditions and diseases may affect all ages from cradle to grave, a disproportionate burden will clearly fall on the elderly and may significantly impact on quality of life (QoL). With a reduced ability of the skin to regenerate, the elderly are at an increased risk of skin breakdowns from even the simplest insults. It is therefore vital that skin care in the late adulthood is seen as a priority among both clinicians and caregivers. The scientific literature on diagnosing and assessing age-related skin conditions and diseases is vast; however, when it comes to preventive care and treatment, the scientific data available is less profound, and the recommendations are often based on personal experience, opinions or at best on consensus documents rather than on scientific data retrieved from controlled clinical trials. In addition to the absence of the scientific data, the imprecise terminology to describe the topical products, as well as the lack of understanding the essence of the vehicle, contributes to vague and often unhelpfully product recommendations. This paper aims to elucidate some basic principles of skincare, the choice of skincare products and their regulatory status.

Current treatments for severe cases include broad immune-suppressants, which are associated with significant adverse effects, precluding long-term use, with rapid hair loss following treatment termination. As a result of the extent of the disease in severe cases, topical contact sensitizers and intralesional treatments are of limited use. The pathogenesis of AA is not yet fully understood, but recent investigations of the immune activation in AA skin reveal Th1/IFN-γ, as well as Th2, PDE4, IL-23, and IL-9 upregulations. Tissue analyses of both animal models and human lesions following broad-acting and cytokine-specific therapeutics (such as JAK inhibitors and ustekinumab, respectively) provide another opportunity for important insights into the pathogenesis of AA. As reviewed in this paper, numerous novel therapeutics are undergoing clinical trials for AA, emphasizing the potential transformation of the clinical practice of AA, which is currently lacking. Dermatologists are already familiar with the revolution in disease management of psoriasis, stemming from better understanding of immune dysregulations, and atopic dermatitis will soon follow a similar path. In light of these recent developments, the therapeutic arena of AA treatments is finally getting more exciting.

Although eight patients achieved a complete response with a median time of 12·3months (range 36 days to 1·9 years), six of these patients ultimately relapsed. One patient, who had unisystem disease limited to the skin, initially showed progression of her cutaneous lesions with nitrogen mustard treatment. Although subsequently the cutaneous lesions completely regressed, concomitant systemic involvement was noted. Four other patients similarly experienced improvement of their skin lesions with treatment, but also exhibited progression of the LCH systemically. The patients were treated with other therapies prior and adjunctive to nitrogen mustard. However, five patients had progression to other organs, despite regression of skin lesions, which supports that the treatment effect in the skin is related to topical nitrogen mustard.

However, the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied therapies is dependent on several characteristics, including percutaneous penetration and permeation of active ingredient and lack of side effects, especially local tolerability reactions. Importantly, the ultimate performance of a topical product includes collectively the effects of the active ingredient and the impact that specific additives have on vehicle characteristics, such as penetration, permeation, epidermal barrier properties, relative irritancy, allergenicity potential, and patient acceptance/preference of the vehicle formulation used. Foam vehicles have evolved over time with the emergence of a menu of alcohol-based and aqueous-based variations that provide various advantages depending on clinical circumstances and the disease being treated. Aqueous-based foams have gained widespread acceptance and preference, especially due to favorable skin tolerability and the cosmetic elegance of the products. In this manuscript, data are presented supporting the efficacy, tolerability, and safety, of specific aqueous-based foam vehicles for calcipotriene used to treat plaque psoriasis, and for tazarotene used to treat acne vulgaris. Discussions include both vehicle-based properties that are relevant to clinical practice, and outcomes from the large-scale pivotal clinical trials that review efficacy and safety results and patient reported outcomes. The latter also discusses several practical subject assessments about use of the foam vehicle. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(2 Suppl):s100-107.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30811153/"}

A PubMed search was performed, using as key words \"topical,\" \"extemporaneous,\" \"compounding,\" and names of each generic drug, to identify all clinical reports (1966-2009). Although many systemic drugs are used topically, randomized controlled trials were limited to a few agents. Many of the reports consist only of small case series or are anecdotal in nature. As the level of evidence is limited, larger prospective trials are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.

In this supplement, we focus on the fourth category, the iatrogenic origin of fragile skin and the role that dermo-cosmetics can have in restoring the natural protective function of the skin following treatments for skin diseases and medical interventions. We present epidemiological data on the prevalence of fragile skin in three different geographical regions, and the results of two randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy and tolerability of dermo-cosmetics in combination with topical acne treatment and following physical skin damage. Overall, we found that prevalence across the three regions (23% in Germany, 41% in UAE, 56% in Taiwan) reflected previous global estimates (24-53%) across skin types, with significant associations found with environmental and lifestyle factors, such as stress, humidity and pollution. The iatrogenic effects of topical acne treatments can result in poor compliance or use of over-the-counter moisturizers, which may reduce treatment efficacy. Dermo-cosmetics were found to aid in restoration of fragile skin caused by the acne topical retinoid treatment adapalene 0.1% gel, by reducing transepidermal water loss and improving skin hydration, as well as reducing the side-effects such as skin irritation that are frequently associated with topical retinoids. Additionally, dermo-cosmetic products were found to accelerate wound closure following skin damage in a laser ablation model and reduced the duration of post-procedural side-effects such as itching and burning.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805934/"}

The recommendations are based on an exhaustive literature review as well as on the personal experience of the members of an European panel of acne specialists. The EEP agreed with the decision made by the CPMP that oral isotretinoin should be administered as 2nd line therapy in those cases of severe acne, which were resistant to or which did not respond successfully to an initial combination regimen with systemic antibiotics and topical treatments (topical retinoids +/- benzoyl peroxide).

These targeted biologic agents have altered the landscape in dermatotherapy aiming to offer higher therapeutic efficacy and an alternative in patients who either failed on conventional systemic regimens or have no other therapeutic options. In the last two decades, the number of the commercially available biologic agents and the extent of their use have dramatically increased; today, these compounds represent a substantial part of modern dermatologic armamentarium. Due to the immunosuppressive potential of biologics, serious concerns were raised about their safety profile, already during the pre-approval period. These concerns did not subside after the incorporation of the postmarketing experience, particularly after the withdrawal of a biologic agent (efalizumab) due to its serious and even fatal side effects.

Both short-term (acute) and long-term side effects should be well known by the physician. The pros and cons of oral and parenteral therapy for various disorders and in various situations should be recognized. For long-term therapy, an intermediate-acting agent such as prednisone in single, early morning doses is most commonly used to minimize suppression of the HPA axis. Alternate-morning doses produce even less suppression if the disease process will respond. A through patient history, including general medical history and medications the patient is taking, is important to anticipate any potential problems. Weight and blood pressure should be checked initially and every 1 to 3 months thereafter. Blood glucose, electrolytes, and lipid studies, including triglycerides, should be done approximately every 6 months. An ophthalmology examination should be performed every year, and stool examination for occult blood and chest radiography can be obtained as indicated. Bone density studies might be necessary in patients who are at high risk for osteoporosis. Specific acute situations may dictate other studies. The patient on long-term GCS should be kept as active as possible, as mild-to-moderate exercise helps prevent certain side effects, such as osteoporosis. The dose of oral GCS is best given with food to prevent gastrointestinal irritation, and agents to decrease gastric acidity might be needed in certain situations. Exposure to infections should be prevented, where possible, and treatment initiated at the first sign of systemic or cutaneous infection. Pain should be evaluated early, especially abdominal pain or bone pain; MRI is indicated if aseptic necrosis of bone is suspected. Both trauma and severe sun exposure should be avoided. Consultation with other specialists is strongly recommended when the situation dictates. Diet is one of the most important strategies to minimize side effects from long-term GCS therapy. Vegetable protein should be increased in the diet, and fats and carbohydrates limited. Adequate calcium is imperative, and calcium supplementation is recommended for high-risk osteoporosis patients. Small amounts of vitamin D may be necessary to increase absorption of calcium. Restriction of sodium is also important, as is maintainance of dietary potassium. Supplemental potassium may be necessary in some patients, and a thiazide diuretic might be useful in patients with hypertension, edema, or osteoporosis. Vitamin C can be given to promote wound healing. A good doctor-patient relationship is important in managing the patient on long-term GCS.

In the new born, the architectural and biochemical structure of the stratum corneum is identical to that of infants and adults. However, 60 p. cent of new born exhibit physiologic desquamation, demonstrating a transitory functional deficit in the stratum corneum, justifying emollient treatment. After this physiological desquamation period, emollients are reserved for atopic infants or those presenting keratinization disorders. In the premature, the epidermis and particularly the stratum corneum are immature; trans-epidermal water loss is elevated and the skin is dry or even fissural. The interest of applying emollients to the skin of premature new born was recently demonstrated.

No surveys of physicians have addressed this issue by proposing new information system technologies that augment prescription medication price transparency and measuring how receptive physicians are to using these novel solutions in their daily clinical practice. Our research aims to investigate these topics with a survey of physicians in dermatology. Members of the North Carolina Dermatology Association were contacted through their electronic mailing list and asked to take an online survey. The survey asked several questions about dermatologists' attitudes and beliefs about drug costs. To measure their knowledge of prescription medications, the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost was used as an authoritative price that was compared to the survey takers' price estimates of drugs commonly used in dermatology. Physicians' willingness to use four distinct information system technologies that increase drug price transparency was also assessed. Dermatologists believe drug costs are an important factor in patient care and believe access to price information would allow them to provide a higher quality of care. Dermatologists' knowledge of the costs of medicines they commonly prescribe is poor, but they want to utilize information system technologies that increase access to drug pricing information.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a group of pattern recognition receptors, are involved in the recognition of invading pathogens, initiation of immune responses and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of TLRs in the pathophysiology of several skin conditions, which mandates the development and study of therapeutic strategies that target TLRs. With regards to the role of TLRs in pathogenesis of diverse cutaneous conditions, recent advances, as well as the future prospects of therapeutic implications of TLRs in cutaneous disorders is reviewed in this article. Although non-specific therapeutic strategies seem to reduce the symptoms in majority of patients, a considerable proportion remain untreated or have to deal with inevitable adverse effects of such therapies. Since TLRs regulate many patholophysiological processes, they could be good candidates for more specific therapeutic approaches.

Although originally developed to facilitate glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a number of studies showed that these agents effectively inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and tissue inflammation. Many of the initial cell growth inhibition studies were conducted with malignant epithelial cells from various sites; however, in addition to malignant epithelial cells, other studies showed that rapidly proliferating epidermal keratinoctyes in culture were also sensitive to the growth-inhibiting action of these moieties. Additional studies subsequently demonstrated that some patients with plaque psoriasis responded to treatment with one or another member of the thiazolidinedione family. Due to the potential therapeutic benefit of these compounds in diseases such as psoriasis, studies have been conducted to elucidate mechanisms by which growth inhibition is achieved. Interference with a number of growth-influencing signalling pathways has been demonstrated. Of interest, some of the growth-inhibiting effects are seen under conditions in which PPAR-gamma activation may not be responsible for the activity. Based on therapeutic potential, additional ongoing studies are aimed at developing novel thiazolidinediones that may have better efficacy than the currently available agents.

Treatment recommendations for 4 clinical nail psoriasis scenarios were developed based on the evidence reviewed in this study and expert opinion of the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation. Treatment of nail psoriasis should balance consideration of the extent of skin disease, psoriatic arthritis, and severity of nail disease with concomitant impairment of quality of life. All patients should be evaluated for onychomycosis because this may complicate psoriatic nail disease. For disease limited to the nails, high-potency topical corticosteroids with or without calcipotriol are initial options. For patients with significant nail disease for whom topical therapy has failed, treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, intralesional corticosteroids, ustekinumab, methotrexate sodium, and acitretin are recommended. For patients with significant skin and nail disease, adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab are strongly recommended, and methotrexate, acitretin, infliximab, and apremilast are recommended. Finally, for a patient with significant nail, skin, and joint disease, adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, infliximab, methotrexate, apremilast, and golimumab are recommended.

A multiple case study was conducted with 10 practice settings across England in which nurses prescribed medicines for patients with dermatological conditions.

Listening and explanation of treatments were aspects of nurse communication that were rated highly by patients. Listening and dealing sensitively with emotions were also aspects of the videotaped consultations that were rated highly by assessors.

However, over the last decade, considerable advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis have paved the way for a number of new treatments. Most notable are the drugs that target the Th2-polarized immune system, which is thought to play a key role in many of the signs and symptoms characteristic of this disease. In this article, we briefly review the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, while noting that each patient's disease phenotype is likely due to a unique interplay of several disease-specific dysregulated pathways. Lastly, we cover emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis, focusing on those that target specific components of the immune system, which are altered in atopic dermatitis. The hope is that these new biologics or small-molecule antagonists, which have high specificity for their target molecules, will decrease the undesirable side effects caused by off-target effects commonly observed with current immunosuppressive agents that are characterized by broad biological actions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27371134/"}

We report a case of rosacea fulminans occurring at the onset of pregnancy and discuss a possible triggering role of endocrine factors, as well as therapeutic options. A 32-year-old woman with no previous history of dermatological disease consulted for rosacea fulminans appearing within the first three weeks of her first pregnancy, which required hormonal stimulation with recombinant FSH (follitropin alpha, Gonal F) and an LHRH inhibitor (cetrorelix, Cetrotide). She did not use topical corticosteroids or any other medication and had no other abnormalities at clinical examination. The skin disease lasted throughout pregnancy despite different treatments. After delivery, moderate improvement was observed within two weeks. Treatment with isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg/day was started three months after delivery and led to the disappearance of the papular and pustular lesions within three weeks, with persistence of the erythema for six months. The patient had never previously presented from acne or rosacea and the question of the responsibility of hormonal changes induced by stimulating ovulation or pregnancy can be raised. However, since her rosacea lasted throughout pregnancy, a causal role of the drugs used for ovarian stimulation appears unlikely. We suggest that pregnancy was the major triggering factor in this case. The recurrence of the skin disease on a subsequent pregnancy would constitute a strong argument to support this hypothesis and rule out simple co-incidence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929918/"}

In contrast, photo-excitation of carotenoids that possess energy states below that of singlet oxygen, such as β-carotene, lutein, loroxanthin and violaxanthin, did not enhance cell death. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photo-excited fucoxanthin or neoxanthin was confirmed using a reporter assay for ROS production with HeLa Hyper cells, which express a fluorescent indicator protein for intracellular ROS. Fucoxanthin and neoxanthin also showed high cellular penetration and retention. Electron spin resonance spectra using 2,2,6,6-tetramethil-4-piperidone as a singlet oxygen trapping agent demonstrated that singlet oxygen was produced via energy transfer from photo-excited fucoxanthin to oxygen molecules. These results suggest that carotenoids such as fucoxanthin, which are capable of singlet oxygen production through photo-excitation and show good penetration and retention in target cells, are useful as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy for skin disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22185691/"}

Despite advancing knowledge on its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, some major unknowns still remain, including systematic evidence-based guidelines useful both for clinical assessment and therapeutic management. Topical treatment is regarded as a first-line option for mild to moderate rosacea and includes traditional and new FDA-approved prescription drugs, as well as off-label alternative topical agents.<b>Areas covered</b>: Since improved awareness of rosacea pathogenetic mechanisms has led to the development of new potential therapeutic agents, a search was performed on the <i>ClinicalTrial.gov</i> registry. The results identified several investigational topical drugs able to target one or more of the pathogenetic factors of rosacea.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The main unmet needs in the topical treatment of rosacea remain the management of vasomotor flushes and telangiectasias, as well as of troublesome symptoms such as burning and/or stinging. No single agent effective on all rosacea phenotypes is available so far, and preventive treatments capable of halting disease progression have not been identified yet.

Phytoconstituents, renowned for their diverse pharmacological attributes, present considerable promise in the management of various dermatological conditions. This review delineates the integration of phytoconstituents into ethosomal formulations, which are advanced lipid-based carriers specifically designed to enhance transdermal delivery. We discuss the advantages conferred by ethosomes, including their capacity to improve the stability and bioavailability of phytochemicals, facilitate deeper skin penetration, and provide controlled release profiles. Recent advancements in the formulation of ethosomes encapsulating a variety of phytoconstituents are highlighted, with a focus on their physicochemical properties, therapeutic efficacy, and safety profiles. Furthermore, the review examines the mechanisms by which ethosomes enhance the delivery of bioactive compounds to targeted skin layers, particularly in the context of treating conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Challenges associated with formulation stability and scalability are also addressed, along with potential future research directions in this domain. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying existing gaps, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of phytoconstituent-based ethosomes as a promising strategy for the development of effective and safe topical therapies for skin disorders. Ultimately, this review underscores the potential of these innovative formulations to improve patient outcomes and contribute significantly to the advancement of dermatological treatment options.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39870257/"}

It has recently been reported that azelaic acid is effective in treating these conditions and that it possesses anti-enzymatic and antimitochondrial activity, including cytochrome-P450 reductase and 5 alpha-reductase in microsomal preparations with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We therefore investigated the effects of azelaic acid on human neutrophil functions, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and ROS generation. ROS generation in a cell-free system was also assessed. The results revealed that neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis as well as ROS generated in a xanthine-xanthine-oxidase system were not significantly changed in the presence of azelaic acid. However, azelaic acid markedly decreased O2- and OH. generated by neutrophils. It may be concluded that the reported clinical effectiveness of azelaic acid is partly due to its inhibitory action on neutrophil-generated ROS, leading to a reduction both in oxidative tissue injury at sites of inflammation and in melanin formation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1867478/"}

Dose-independent teratogenicity is the most serious. Therefore, off-label prescriptions require strict criteria. To communicate the experience and recommendation of Brazilian dermatologists on oral use of the drug in dermatology. Eight experts from five universities were appointed by the Brazilian Society of Dermatology to develop a consensus on indications for this drug. Through the adapted DELPHI methodology, relevant elements were listed and an extensive analysis of the literature was carried out. The consensus was defined with the approval of at least 70% of the experts. With 100% approval from the authors, there was no doubt about the efficacy of oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne, including as an adjunct in the correction of scars. Common and manageable common adverse events are mucocutaneous in nature. Others, such as growth retardation, abnormal healing, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease have been thoroughly investigated, and there is no evidence of a causal association; they are rare, individual, and should not contraindicate the use of the drug. Regarding unapproved indications, it may represent an option in cases of refractory rosacea, severe seborrheic dermatitis, stabilization of field cancerization with advanced photoaging and, although incipient, frontal fibrosing alopecia. For keratinization disorders, acitretin performs better. In the opinion of the authors, indications for purely esthetic purposes or oil control are not recommended, particularly for women of childbearing age.

However, it is important to ensure that guidelines are: (1) developed in areas in which they are needed the most; and (2) translated effectively into everyday clinical practice. To evaluate the need for guidelines in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, the success of the dissemination activities undertaken to date, and the potential benefits of educational interventions in encouraging guideline compliance. All dermatologists working in the Berlin-Brandenburg region of Germany were invited to attend a workshop on the psoriasis treatment guidelines. Participants could take part in a survey examining the general need for psoriasis guidelines and the success of previous dissemination activities. A total of 42% of survey participants had not received a copy of the guidelines prior to the workshop. Of those who had received a copy, only 15% had studied the guidelines in detail. In total, 76% of survey participants felt that physicians' low levels of confidence in administering systemic treatments had resulted in these treatment options being used less frequently than they should. Seventy-nine per cent of survey participants believed that the guidelines would be helpful in improving physicians' confidence and ultimately lead to an increased use of systemic treatments. The results of the present study indicate that there is a great need for guidelines on the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in Germany, especially in light of dermatologists' low levels of confidence administering systemic treatments.

However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of phototherapy in elderly patients and how phototherapy is currently being utilized to treat them. To investigate the safety, efficacy and utilization of phototherapy in elderly patients. In January 2014, we analysed all patients recently referred for, currently receiving or recently having completed a course of phototherapy at a university teaching hospital in England (UK). In total, 249 patients were identified; 37 (15%) were over the age of 65 years (the WHO definition of an elderly or older person). The dermatoses being treated were psoriasis (51%), eczema (11%), nodular prurigo (11%), pruritus (11%), Grover disease (5%) and others (11%). One patient with dementia was deemed not safe to embark on phototherapy, and five patients were yet to start. The remaining 31 elderly patients received 739 individual phototherapy treatments: 88% narrowband (NB)-UVB and 12% systemic, bath and hand/foot psoralen UVA (PUVA). The acute adverse event (AE) rate was 1.89%, all occurring in those receiving NB-UVB. No severe acute AEs occurred. Of those who completed their course of phototherapy, 80% achieved a clear/near clear or moderate response, while just two patients (8%) had minimal response and two (8%) had worsening of the disease during treatment. Of those receiving NB-UVB for psoriasis, 91% achieved a clear or near-clear response. In this small survey, the first of its kind to focus on elderly patients, phototherapy appears to be well-tolerated, safe and efficacious in the short term.

In addition to magnification, other technological advances have been made over the last century to improve our visual assessment of the skin. Examination of skin under ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with Wood's light, gained traction for its utility in assessing superficial cutaneous infections and pigmentary changes. During Wood's light examination, UV light is directed at the skin and fluorescence is detected by our eyes. The variable fluorescent characteristics of endogenous and exogenous cutaneous chromophores help us better diagnose skin disease. UV fluorescent photography is based on the same concept as the Wood's light, but also allows image analysis and documentation of the captured image. In addition to UV-induced fluorescence, the differential reflection and absorption of UV light captured in the UV spectral range can also provide a new contrast for diagnosing skin diseases during UV reflectance photography.

For the final evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of a topically applied dermatological medicinal product not only the active agent but the whole galenic formulation as well has to be taken into account as the extent of penetration of the active compound might be influenced by changing the non-active substances. Furthermore the vehicle itself - independent of the active agent - influence the dermatological disorder, often in dependence on the stage of the dermatopathy.

Using PDT implies the understanding of light dosimetry and calculation of light dose using different light sources and photosensitizers. The number of PDT sensitisers under investigation is rapidly increasing. The PDT itself, being a relatively new modality, quickly spreads its list of applications covering new indications in different areas of medicine. Though the main part of this list is made up of dermatological conditions, the use of PDT in other disciplines is also discussed to make dermatologists familiar with different aspects of the issue.

This study demonstrates the therapeutic effect of a novel topical iodine preparation as a postexposure treatment against SM-induced lesions in the fur-covered guinea-pig skin model. Iodine treatment 15 min after SM exposure resulted in statistically significant reductions of 48, 50, and 55% in dermal acute inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis, respectively, whereas, the epidermal healing markers, hyperkerathosis and acanthosis, were significantly elevated by 72 and 67%, respectively, 2 days after treatment. At the interval of 30 min between SM exposure and iodine treatment, there was a significant degree of healing or recovery, albeit to a lesser extent than that observed in the shorter interval. Although the epidermal healing markers were not elevated, the parameters indicative of active tissue damage, such as subepidermal microblisters, epidermal ulceration, dermal acute inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis, were significantly reduced by 35, 67, 43, 39, and 45%, respectively. At the 45-min interval between exposure and treatment, there was also a certain degree of healing or recovery expressed as significant reductions in dermal subacute inflammation, subepidermal microblister formation, and epidermal ulceration, whereas, acanthosis was statistically elevated, indicating an increased healing potential. At the 60-min interval, iodine was less efficacious; nevertheless, a significant reduction in the incidence of subepidermal microblisters and an expansion of the acanthotic area were observed. Gross ulceration was significantly decreased at intervals of 15 and 30 min between exposure and treatment. The local anesthetic, lidocaine, did not alter the therapeutic effect of iodine. SM was not affected chemically by iodine as measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. These findings suggest that the iodine preparation functions as an antidote against skin lesions induced by SM.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11076694/"}

However, its prescription has become increasingly less frequent in dermatology practice. Little knowledge about its exact mechanism of action, lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry, the advent of new drugs, and the toxicity caused by the use of high doses of the drug are some possible explanations for that. Consequently, there are few scientific studies on the pharmacological aspects, dosage and efficacy of this drug. Also, there is no conventional standard on how to manipulate and prescribe the saturated solution of potassium iodide, which leads to unawareness of the exact amount of the salt being delivered in grams to patients. Considering that dosage is directly related to toxicity and the immunomodulatory features of this drug, it is essential to define the amount to be prescribed and to reduce it to a minimum effective dose in order to minimize the risks of intolerance and thus improve treatment adherence. This review is relevant due to the fact that the saturated solution of potassium iodide is often the only therapeutic choice available for the treatment of some infectious, inflammatory and immune-mediated dermatoses, no matter whether the reason is specific indication, failure of a previous therapy or cost-effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793210/"}

It must be considered today as a true public health problem and the most widespread metabolic bone disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Under physiological conditions, there is a balance between bone formation and bone resorption necessary for skeletal homeostasis. In pathological situations, this balance is altered in favor of osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption. During chronic inflammation, the balance between bone formation and bone resorption may be considerably affected, contributing to a net prevalence of osteoclastogenesis. Skin diseases are the fourth cause of human disease in the world, affecting approximately one third of the world's population with a prevalence in elderly men. Inflammation and the various associated cytokine patterns are the basis of both osteoporosis and most skin pathologies. Moreover, dermatological patients also undergo local or systemic treatments with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants that could increase the risk of osteoporosis. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to bone health in these patients.

The relationship between doctor and patient, the nature of disease, drug prices and the possibility of adverse side effects are also significant. Lack of involvement of patients in the treatment process is particularly evident in chronic diseases that require prolonged and regular treatment. Interpersonal skills of the clinician and a possibility to establish a good relationship between doctor and patient have strong influence on adherence. In the Internet age, patients often gain on their own information about their disease, which can both positively and negatively affect the healing process. For this reason, one of the factors that increase the compliance is a proper education of patients. In addition, the doctor may use several other useful methods to enhance the therapeutic effect.

Among nondermatologic medications, studies have shown a role for robust generic market competition in reducing drug prices. The association between competition and the costs of topical dermatologic generic drugs has not been evaluated. To characterize the association between changes in drug price and the number of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved manufacturers among the most commonly used topical dermatologic generic products. This retrospective cost analysis of the most commonly prescribed topical dermatologic generic drugs used cumulative annual claims data from the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public User File to identify 597 dermatologist-prescribed drugs with more than 10 claims. The number of manufacturers and the price per unit were identified from the FDA Orange Book and the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) database, respectively, for 2013 through 2016. Drugs that were nondermatologic, were not topically administered, were missing NADAC data, were lacking a generic formulation, or had fewer than 400 claims were excluded. Primary outcomes included per-unit drug price and number of FDA-approved manufacturers. Pricing measures were adjusted for inflation and are reported in 2016 dollars. The present analysis included 116 topical dermatologic generic formulations, representing 70.5% of the total Medicare Part D dermatologist-coded claims from 2015. Drug formulations with 1 to 2 manufacturers during the study period sustained a median percentage increase in price of 12.7%, whereas those with more than 6 manufacturers had a median percentage decrease in price of 20.5%. Formulations with 1 to 2 manufacturers had a 20.6%, 19.5%, and 33.2% higher percentage increase in price than those with 3 to 4 manufacturers, 5 to 6 manufacturers, and more than 6 manufacturers, respectively. There was a statistically significant inverse association between the percentage change in drug price and median number of manufacturers (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.26; P = .005). The negative association between the change in drug price and the median number of manufacturers of generic topical dermatologic drugs indicates a role for market competition in controlling the costs of generic drug prices within dermatology.

ATRA has been used successfully in differentiated therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia, skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and also in the treatment of acne and psoriasis. However, its usefulness is limited by the rapid emergence of acquired ATRA resistance involving multifactoral mechanisms. A key mechanism of resistance involves ATRA-induced catabolism of ATRA. Thus, a novel strategy to overcome the limitation associated with exogenous ATRA therapy has been to modulate and/or increase the levels of endogenous ATRA by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent ATRA-4-hydroxylase enzymes (particularly CYP26s) responsible for ATRA metabolism.

Consideration should be given to feasibility issues (32%) and the addition of care pathways (41%) to improve the GL. In this survey, we identified inadequate basic AD care mainly due to patient costs and lack of time for counselling as real-life challenges.

With the present state of technology a modern dosage form allowing chemical engineering can be devised. Liposomes which consist of lipid bilayers engulfing an aqueous solution fulfill the sophisticated requirements. With a lipid and an aqueous compartment these liposomes can contain lipophilic and hydrophilic medicaments. The lipid composition and the incorporation of charged carrier protein molecules can be varied, affecting the rate of drug release to the skin. In this way active substances are either retained on the skin (pertinent to sunscreening agents) or liberated from the liposome depot to the skin layers (corticosteroids). The highly organized membrane structures containing lysine or hydrolysine can be fixed to the skin enzymatically avoiding temporal removal from the skin and supporting depot function and protective film function. Studying the surface lipid and epidermal lipid composition, lipid membranes can be composed which do not cause hypersensitivity reactions and form a substitute in case of deficient barrier function of the skin.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4000006/"}

Surprisingly, the comparison of the therapeutic success of treatments with recombinant proteins directed against defined immunological structures shows that those that directly affect T cells (alefacept, efalizumab, Hu-max-CD4, OKTcdr4a) were clearly less effective than those targeting TNF-alpha (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab).

Overall, 19 human and 6 basic science studies were included spanning over 40 years of research. Oral PLE was administered at daily doses ranging from 120 mg to 1080 mg. No adverse effects were reported in laboratory studies. In humans, side effects (gastrointestinal complaints and pruritus) were mild to moderate and found only in very small numbers of patients overall (16/1016 [2%]). This review concludes PLE is well tolerated at all doses administered and associated with a negligible risk of side effects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25738847/"}

Skin lesions are often difficult to treat locally and much is to be gained by developing more targeted treatments to avoid the use of systemic immunosuppressant drugs. Recent data on the function of microenvironmental factors could help improve such therapies. Vitamins A and D and their metabolites have strong effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses, and can suppress inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration and function, as well as the ability to increase regulatory tasks within the skin. Combinatorial therapy that includes these metabolites, cytokines, chemokines or other agents could help to alter the local microenvironment and sway immune responses as needed, depending on the origin of the skin inflammation. Here, I argue that microenvironmental factors might be used to improve topical treatments in chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, where T cells play a pathogenic role.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20413166/"}

The majority of individuals have psoriasis in limited areas and topical products are the mainstay of therapy according to existing guidelines. It is known that medication adherence rates are lower for topical treatment than for systemic treatment. Poor medication adherence is a major multidimensional problem for patients with chronic disorders as it is associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes, increased risk for development of concomitant diseases and inefficient use of health resources. Despite four decades of adherence research and the large number of studies that have identified the importance of medication non-adherence, there are relatively few studies reporting and designing effective strategies to improve adherence. The aim of this article was to report and describe non-adherence in the topical treatment of psoriasis, the factors that might contribute to this phenomenon, and which interventions have so far been developed for the management of chronic conditions. This article proposes that given that the barriers to medication adherence are complex and varied, solutions to improve adherence and thus clinical outcomes must be multifaceted and must also provide the possibility to be tailored according to each patient's individual needs. Such an individualized and comprehensive adherence-enhancing intervention would probably enable the successful long-term management of this disabling chronic condition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24684738/"}

The disease can be triggered by hormonal changes (including a change from one contraceptive to another), or it can be induced by certain nonhormonal medications, emotional stress, and various underlying diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome. In many cases acne becomes a chronic skin condition with undulating activity, including improvement and relapse phases, and is often experienced as a major psychological burden. It is, therefore, even more important to provide an effective as well as a safe and tolerable treatment.

To review all patients who received grenz rays in order to determine which conditions have been treated successfully and to estimate remission times. Patient notes were reviewed, and follow-up was supplemented by subsequent dermatology clinic letters and telephone consultation. For scalp psoriasis, clearance was achieved with 13 courses, marked improvement with 19, minimal improvement in 3 and no change with 1. Treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis/hyperkeratotic eczema showed clearance with 7 courses, marked improvement with 9, minimal change with 2 and no change with 4. Of the courses for nail dystrophies (mainly psoriasis), clearance occurred with 1, marked improvement with 7, minimal change with 8 and no change with 11. In addition to immediate outcomes, the remission times were also evaluated. For scalp psoriasis, only 8 of the initial 32 patients still had clearance or marked improvement at the most recent follow-up. For nail dystrophy, 3 of 8 patients remained in remission, while for hyperkeratotic eczema/psoriasis, 7 of the initial 16 patients who had clearance or marked improvement had sustained this improvement, and only 1 patient with palmoplantar pustulosis still had clearance at the most recent follow-up. Grenz ray therapy is an effective treatment for some chronic inflammatory skin conditions that are resistant to routine therapies.

This inflammation concerned the arteries of the deep dermis and of the superficial hypodermis. There were no neutrophils or eosinophils. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of any extracutaneous signs. The clinical peculiarity of macular arteritis is the non-infiltrated and painless character of the primary lesion, in contrast with the classic lesions described in vasculitis, which are palpable and sometimes painful. In all cases described, the course is indolent with no associated systemic signs. The distinguishing histopathological characteristic is the presence of an intense lymphocytic infiltrate all around the arterial wall, associated with hyalinised necrosis and thrombosis of the vascular lumen. The histological picture is unusual and does not correspond to classical arterial abnormalities, in particular periarteritis nodosa.

The class of nuclear hormone receptors that form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor includes members that are well established targets of current dermatological therapeutics such as the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as well as more recently discovered receptors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and the liver X receptor (LXR). After ligand activation (often lipid metabolites), these intracellular receptors exert their functions by binding to specific response elements in regulatory sequences of target genes, preferentially those involved in differentiation, energy expenditure and lipid metabolism. A number of selective activators has been developed by combinational chemistry, initially for their anti-diabetic and lipid lowering properties as well as their ability to regulate bile acid and drug metabolism. However, these activators also have marked effects on cutaneous homeostasis. Therefore, these compounds have important implications for dermatological therapy. In this review, the clinical implications of the more recently discovered members of the nuclear hormone receptor family are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16285300/"}

Several recent studies on calcium hydroxyapatite in filling treatments and facial volumetry, in esthetics, but also in HIV patients, have been published. It was also tested in accentuated melomental folds where it is superior to hyaluronic acid. In aging of the skin of the dorsal aspect of the hands, hyaluronic acid provides slightly better results than collagen. Filler rhinoplasty can correct minor deformations of the nose. Lipofilling is advantageous for linear scleroderma of the face, at least in the forehead region, and adipocyte stem cells may be a future solution for facial aging or lipoatrophy. The risk of local and/or general sarcoid reactions related to interferon in patients having undergone filling injections has been reported. In the field of laser treatment, fractionated photothermolysis has motivated much more research and seem particularly valuable in treating acne scars, aging of the dorsal aspect of the hands, and, more anecdotally, in colloid milium and pearly penile papules. Laser is also useful in preventing surgical scars where a mini-diode can also be used. For axillary hyperhidrosis, subdermic Nd-YAG laser competes with botulinum toxin, with longer-lasting results. Solutions are appearing for treatment of red or white striae cutis distensae.

{"id": "17312367", "title": "Limitations of skin protection.", "text": "Skin protection products and gloves are essential constituents of personal protective equipment at workplaces, which can be used in a complementary way, each offering particular benefits and disadvantages. In many workplace situations, both measures are being used either in an alternating or in a combined manner, typically in professions with exposures to mild irritants and a high wet-work load, such as hairdressers, healthcare workers or employees in the food-processing industry. Skin protection creams can be used to reduce unnecessarily long glove usage in order to reduce occlusion-related effects on the skin barrier. Whenever rotating machines are used, these products are the only option due to safety regulations. However, some particular requirements can be postulated for skin-protective products claimed especially to be used in combination with gloves. Reduction of glove-induced perspiration, of stratum corneum swelling, and postocclusive barrier impairment are intended attributes of such products, which have been already successfully implemented in some commercially available products. On the other hand it has to be proven that the ingredients do not interfere with the glove material, neither in the way of degrading the material, thus making it permeable for harmful substances, nor by enhancing the potential release of rubber allergens. Examples out of the literature are reviewed showing that skin products can exhibit unpredictable effects on the allergen release of rubber materials, if not thoroughly tested for this purpose beforehand. Some raw materials should be avoided in protection products, though they are of established value when used in afterwork emollients to accelerate barrier recovery. Usage of moisturizers, in contrast to special barrier products, at the workplace together or even under gloves is therefore judged critically, although selected products showed beneficial effects in particular experimental settings. Another future option is the implementation of 'active gloves' that are intended to gradually release ingredients that help to strengthen and preserve skin barrier integrity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17312367/"}

The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the long-term prognosis of AIBDs that started during childhood. We conducted a monocentric retrospective study, in the French dermatology centre, by including all children affected by AIBDs. The long-term outcome was obtained through a phone call questionnaire. Sixty-three patients were included from January 1993 to December 2015, 34 female and 29 males: 27 Linear immunoglobulin A disease (LAD), 12 bullous pemphigoid (BP), 12 pemphigus, 8 herpetiform dermatitis (DH) and 4 epidermolysis bullosa aquisita (EBA). The mean age was 4.7 years old. Twenty-five patients were lost during the follow-up. For the 38 remaining patients, the mean follow-up duration for all pathologies was 6.6 years. Twenty-nine of them had at least one relapse. Late relapses were observed in two cases of DH and six cases of pemphigus (7-34 months). The mean treatment duration was 30.6 months with variability according to the AIBDs. Topical corticosteroids were used alone, effectively, for seven patients and in association with other treatment in 19 patients in complete remission. Complete remission was noted in 34/38 children with a follow-up of 4.4 years (0.08-19.5). The mean duration to complete remission was 30.5 months (6-114 months). Late nasal synechiae were reported in one EBA only. There was no significant associated comorbidity, but an association with a primary immune deficiency (PID) was observed in two cases. Childhood AIBDs appear to be of good overall prognosis but a long-term follow-up is mandatory, as relapses can be late, except for BP. The use of topical corticosteroids is frequently effective alone or in association.

It is recognised as one of the most prevalent skin diseases, affecting 2% to 3% of Caucasian populations. Major advances in understanding of disease pathogenesis indicate that patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. A wide range of systemic drugs have been developed in recent years for treatment of psoriasis and comorbidities. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is one of the classical agents and is still one of the most frequently used systemic treatments for psoriasis worldwide. Low-dose MTX is also effective in treatment of psoriatic arthritis. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but MTX is suggested to act primarily as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drug. A favourable efficacy and safety profile has been established for MTX in a large number of clinical trials, as well as in common practice. This review summarises the nature of the disease and our present knowledge about MTX in the treatment of psoriasis, including combination therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21044448/"}

Safe and effective long-term treatments are needed. Biologic treatments that inhibit the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis have helped meet this need. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of biologic therapies used for psoriasis. A literature search was performed using PubMed and the keywords '(PASI-75 OR efficacy) AND psoriasis AND (adalimumab OR alefacept OR etanercept OR infliximab OR ustekinumab).' Randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled studies on US FDA-approved biologics were selected. Studies assessing the proportion of subjects achieving 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) within a 12-week period were included. Studies on pediatric populations and psoriatic arthritis were excluded. The weighted average of PASI-75 for each reported regimen was calculated to determine the efficacy of biologic agents used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Tolerance and secondary efficacy measures were also examined for the selected studies. FDA-approved regimens of adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, and alefacept were effective in treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Weighted average PASI-75 scores for infliximab, ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, and alefacept were 78.6%, 72.1%, 70.5%, 48.1%, and 21%, respectively.

Based on the current evidence, methotrexate and biologics should not be discontinued for psoriasis patients with low disease activity. However, the doses of these medications could be tapered by reducing the maintenance dose or increasing the between-dose intervals. If the disease recurs, methotrexate and biologics should be restarted at their standard doses, and for cyclosporine, the dose can be maintained or discontinued progressively.

We ultimately conclude that the benefits of drug sampling outweigh the risks, but give recommendations on how drug sampling can be done ethically and effectively, including limiting personal use, not selling samples, properly documenting sample release, teaching patients about proper use, teaching students and residents ethical use of samples, working with pharmaceutical representatives in an ethical manner, prescribing the drug that is best for the patient, and securing samples appropriately to prevent theft and misuse.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20172623/"}
{"id": "23614646", "title": "Psoriasis clinical implications and treatment: a review.", "text": "Psoriasis is a common skin disorder affecting the population worldwide. It is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder leading to keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Psoriasis has genetic predisposition that is further aggravated by certain stimulating factors. In spite of significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the exact etiology of the disease remains unknown. The clinical manifestations of this disease include various forms that affect different parts of the body. Treatment options vary according to the mode of application or severity of the disease. Earlier treatments have included application of emollients or keratolytic agents to hydrate the skin or shed off the skin. But later treatments have been modified to treat the underlying T-cell proliferation. Hence, topical treatments like coal tar, vitamin D, retinoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors for treating mild psoriasis, systemic treatments including methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, hydroxyurea, as well as light therapy for severe psoriasis have become more prominent. Current treatment modalities are associated with the risk of serious side effects from prolonged treatment. Combinations of these therapies have provided effective and rapid modalities to suppress the disease and reduce the side effects of treatment. In addition, newer carrier systems for conventional drugs are being developed to improve the effectiveness of treatment and reduce the side effects. Development of biologics and gene therapy have revolutionized the treatment of this skin disease. Although an array of therapies to suppress the psoriatic condition exists, none are curative.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23614646/"}

Four major clinical subtypes of rosacea can be identified: erythemato-telangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous and ocular rosacea. Still, it is currently unclear whether these subtypes develop consecutively or if any subtypes may occur individually as part of a syndrome. Rosacea is characterized by facial flushing, erythema, chronic inflammation, edema and fibrosis. Several trigger factors can worsen the disease or cause recurring episodes of inflammation. Although some aspects in the pathophysiology of rosacea have been characterized in more detail during the past years, the precise interplay of the various dysregulated systems is still poorly understood. In early disease manifestations and milder stages, dysfunction of neurovascular regulation and the innate immune system seem to be driving forces in rosacea pathophysiology. A disturbed chemokine and cytokine network further contributes to disease progression.

Crisaborole, a nonsteroidal topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor (PDE4i), has been utilized in treating AD. Crisaborole regulates the production of inflammatory cytokines, which are usually overactive among AD patients. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of crisaborole in treating AD in patients aged ≤18 years. <b>Methods</b> A literature search was performed across PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria involved primary studies evaluating the effect of crisaborole in treating dermatitis, articles exploring the use of crisaborole in AD patients below 18 years (>two years), and articles published in English between 2000 and 2022. However, the studies evaluating AD in adult patients, those reporting treatments other than crisaborole, those published before 2000, and articles written in languages other than English were excluded from this analysis. Furthermore, secondary data sources such as case reports, newspaper articles, magazines, and other systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. The risk of bias in the manuscripts was assessed using the Cochrane tool. The I-square test statistic was used to determine heterogeneity, and Egger's test was used to evaluate publication bias. <b>Results</b> Ten studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Most of the studies exhibited a low risk of bias with no publication bias. Meta-analysis indicated a significant difference in the number of patients attaining Investigator Static Global Assessment (ISGA) success at day 29, with significantly higher patients in the crisaborole group than in the vehicle group (odds ratio (OR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 77%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001). Similarly, pruritus improvement was significant between the two cohorts at day 29, indicating significantly higher heterogeneity (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.63; I<sup>2</sup> = 91%; <i>p</i> = 0.02).

In regards to the immediate type allergic response, there is no debate about the importance of histamine. In addition, histamine has immunomodulatory functions, some of which are related to the histamine H2 receptor. However, with the discovery of the histamine H(4) receptor in the year 2000, the role of histamine as an immunomodulator became more obvious. The histamine H(4) receptor is expressed on several hematopoietic cells; along with the chemotaxis of immune cells, this recently characterized receptor modulates also the cytokine and chemokine secretion of some hematopoietic cells. Highly selective histamine H(4) receptor antagonists display promising results in animal models of allergic inflammatory diseases and also in in vitro studies on animal and human cells. These first results indicate that the histamine H(4) receptor is an interesting new pharmacological target for the treatment of allergic inflammatory disorders. This review summarizes the most important immunomodulatory functions of histamine and points to some possible indications in dermatology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136675/"}

Its exact pathogenesis is still unknown, but several trigger factors in genetically predisposed individuals might initially lead to an immunologically triggered release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a profound dysregulation of the connective tissue metabolism and ultimately to induction of fibrosis. To date, there are no specific serological markers available for localized scleroderma. Within the last years, several validated clinical scores have been introduced as potential outcome measures for the disease. Given the rarity of localized scleroderma, only few evidence-based therapeutical treatment options exist. So far, the most robust data is available for ultraviolet A1 phototherapy in disease that is restricted to the skin, and methotrexate alone or in combination with systemic corticosteroids in more severe disease that additionally affects extracutaneous structures.

Studies have shown that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a key mediator in the pathogenesis. Targeted biologics have changed the outcome for patients in a variety of diseases including psoriasis. Ixekizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A and it has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and recently also psoriatic arthritis. <b>Areas covered</b>: In this review, we summarize the latest clinical study results on ixekizumab. Long-term Phase III study data on efficacy and safety are now available for both plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, new indications for ixekizumab are under investigation. <b>Expert commentary</b>: Overall, the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab are promising. In plaque psoriasis, the efficacy of ixekizumab was superior to etanercept and ustekinumab, while the efficacy was comparable to adalimumab in psoriatic arthritis. The safety profile has also been found very tolerable and similar to other biologics; however, vigilance regarding non-invasive <i>Candida</i> infections is necessary. Also, caution is advised when treating patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, since ixekizumab could cause exacerbations. Long-term studies in real-life treatment settings are needed to decide the actual potential and safety of ixekizumab.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30589394/"}

More commonly encountered in patients with a past negative experience, this effect stems from highly active processes in the central nervous system, mediated by specific neurotransmitters and modulated by psychological mechanisms such as expectation and conditioning. The magnitude of nocebo effect in clinical medicine is being increasingly appreciated and its relevance encompasses clinical trials as well as clinical practice. Although there is hardly any reference to the term nocebo in dermatology articles, the phenomenon is encountered routinely by dermatologists. Dermatology patients are more susceptible to nocebo responses owing to the psychological concern from visibility of skin lesions and the chronicity, unpredictable course, lack of 'permanent cure' and frequent relapses of skin disorders. While finasteride remains the prototypical drug that displays a prominent nocebo effect in dermatologic therapeutics, other drugs such as isotretinoin are also likely inducers. This peculiar phenomenon has recently been appreciated in the modulation of itch perception and in controlled drug provocation tests in patients with a history of adverse drug reactions. Considering the conflict between patients' right to information about treatment related adverse effects and the likelihood of nocebo effect stemming from information disclosure, the prospect of ethically minimizing nocebo effect remains daunting.

{"id": "29240856", "title": "Combining Topical Psoriasis Treatment to Enhance Systemic and Phototherapy: A Review of the Literature.", "text": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects millions of people in the United States as well as worldwide. While there is currently no cure for psoriasis, many treatment options are available. Topical therapies are the mainstay for the majority of patients who have limited or mild psoriasis. Among these medications, topical vitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriene) and corticosteroids (eg, betamethasone), and these drugs in combination, are the most widely prescribed psoriasis drugs and are the cornerstone of topical therapies. For patients with more severe disease, phototherapy, conventional systemic agents, and biologics are often indicated. Currently, the goal of treatment is to control the clinical symptoms of the skin, reduce systemic disease potential, and improve the patient's quality of life. Despite the availability of various therapeutic options for psoriasis, many patients go untreated, and even among those who are treated, many do not achieve complete resolution of the disease. The new consensus is to treat to a target of 1% or less of body surface area involvement. Innovative treatment strategies are needed to meet this goal and patients' desire to achieve clear skin. Combination therapies are widely used by physicians, and adjunctive topical therapies used with other antipsoriatic regimens have been demonstrated to provide many clinical benefits. This article reviews the most recently published clinical evidence of adjunctive use of topical agents with biologics, conventional systemic agents, and phototherapy, to better establish the role of topical agents in combination therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29240856/"}
{"id": "35929658", "title": "S2k guideline: Rosacea.", "text": "This updated and upgraded S2k guideline deals with the diagnosis and treatment of rosacea, which is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease mostly affecting the face. Initially, rosacea is characterized by recurrent erythema, telangiectasia and flushing. Later, the inflammatory component predominates, with persistent erythema with follicular papules, papulopustules and pustules. The development of phyma, which usually occurs on the acral localizations, is the most severe manifestation. For the treatment of rosacea, the interdisciplinary guideline committee, with representatives of the German Dermatological Society (DDG), the Professional Association of German Dermatologists (BVDD), the German Opthalmological Society (DOG), the Society for Dermopharmacy (GD), the Swiss Society for Dermatology and Venereology (SGDV) and the German Rosacea Aid e. V., recommends the avoidance of trigger factors and topical applications of metronidazole, azelaic acid or ivermectin. For symptomatic treatment of persistent centrofacial erythema, the topical vasoconstrictors brimonidine or oxymetazoline can also be used. Systemic therapy is recommended for therapy-resistant and severe forms of rosacea papulopustulosa. The drug of choice is low-dose doxycycline. Alternatively, low-dose isotretinoin can be recommended. Ocular rosacea should be treated with lid margin hygiene. For topical treatment, ciclosporin eye drops, azithromycin, ivermectin or metronidazole are suggested.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35929658/"}

To discuss the evolving pathophysiology of rosacea, factors involved in promoting the chronic vascular and inflammatory abnormalities seen in rosacea, and the available drug therapies for the condition. Chronic inflammation and vascular changes are believed to be underlying factors in the pathophysiology of rosacea. Aberrant cathelicidin expression, elevated kallikrein 5 (KLK5) proteolytic activity, and altered toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression have been reported in rosacea skin leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Until recently, drug therapies only targeted the inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and transient erythema associated with these inflammatory lesions of rosacea. Brimonidine tartrate gel 0.5% was recently approved for the treatment of persistent (nontransient) facial erythema of rosacea, acting primarily on the cutaneous vascular component of the disease.

Yet, what are the differences between diols in clinical efficacy, safety and other characteristics? The objective of this overview was to compare the efficacy, safety, chemical and pharmaceutical characteristics of pentane-1,5-diol with other aliphatic diols used in pharmaceutical formulations in dermatology. A survey of the literature was carried out based on searches limited to aliphatic diols. Pentane-1,5-diol was found to be safe and more effective than several other diols with respect to drug delivery-enhancing potency, pharmaceutical and cosmetic properties, antimicrobial spectrum and toxicity. Results from formal clinical trials with pentane-1,5-diol verify its efficacy and safety. These characteristics together with its low cost make pentane-1,5-diol an attractive substance for use in pharmaceutical formulations for topical administration.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18363524/"}

Conversely, in transwomen (men to women), feminising hormones may reduce acne but cause skin dryness and irritation which may be further exacerbated if mild acne persists, requiring topical treatments. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues suppress endogenous sex hormones, thus avoiding the onset of acne in prepubertal individuals. To identify the specific issues of acne in transgender patients and propose suitable medical care for dermatologists. A group of five experts on acne reviewed and discussed 68 publications regarding the issue of acne in transgender patients. Key words included \"acne+transgender\", \"acne+transgender+treatment\", \"transgender+skin diseases+treatment\", \"transmen+acne+treatment,\" and \"transwomen+acne+treatment\". The gender affirming process in transgender patients requires a multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, psychiatrists, cardiologists and dermatologists, especially if the hormonal treatment causes or worsens acne. Treatment of \"transgender\" acne differs from \"classic\" acne treatment. The administration of masculinizing hormones frequently causes moderate to severe acne which requires the administration of oral treatments involving specific conditions of use and, conversely, the use of feminising hormones reduces the risk of more severe forms of acne. However, mild to moderate acne may persist, requiring topical treatments that may further increase skin dryness and irritation. The risk of relapse after stopping treatment may be very high and justifies a maintenance topical treatment. The use of ceramide-enriched emollients is mandatory in all patients.

Although normally presenting to physicians at an early stage and with an indolent course, mycosis fungoides can have a varied presentation. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has created guidelines for the treatment and staging of mycosis fungoides. Although comprehensive, in practice these guidelines do not provide specific treatment regimens for lesions located in difficult locations and those recalcitrant to the recommended therapy. Because of this, suggestions based on the practices and decisions made at the multidisciplinary cutaneous lymphoma clinic at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, are presented here. Lesions located in areas such as the face and intertriginous zones are often challenging to treat because first-line therapies are often inappropriate, with the locations increasing the possibility of side effects. Additionally, lesions located in the bathing suit distribution are often nonresponsive to first-line therapies for reasons still undetermined. Finally, although well-described, erythroderma secondary to mycosis fungoides is challenging to treat, with controversy surrounding various methods of control. This article both highlights difficult clinical scenarios and reviews the recommended treatment as provided by the NCCN guidelines and provides alternative therapy for lesions that are either difficult to treat because of the location or are recalcitrant to the recommended therapy. With suggestions for the apparent gaps in guidelines, providers can better treat patients who present with more complicated conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30993584/"}

The importance of urea in dermatology is twofold: it primarily has a physiological key role for the maintenance of skin hydration, and it secondarily has been used for more than a century in different topical preparation and concentration in various skin conditions. One of the first uses of urea was the topical treatment of wounds because of its antibacterial and proteolytic properties.

Because the skin remains is one of the principal routes for HD exposure and damage, the study of HD-induced skin lesions is of major interest. Blister formation is a characteristic of HD-induced skin lesions in humans. Attempts have been made to find an animal model that produces cutaneous microblisters after exposure to the naturally occurring liquid as well as vaporized HD. Weanling pigs were exposed to three different doses of liquid HD. Histopathologic findings showed microblister formation as well as variable apoptosis and/or necrosis of epidermal keratinocytes and vascular endothelium. Pig skin is morphologically similar to human skin. In the pig, the epidermal lipids, the density of hair follicles, the presence of sweat glands, the proliferation kinetics, and the antigenicity are all closer to human skin than are rodent models.

The lesions are classified as erythrosquamous, due to the erythema which develops asa result of involvement of the vasculature, and the involvement of the epidermis with scale formation. The diagnosis of psoriasis can usually be established on clinical grounds. If the clinician is in doubt, a small cutaneous punch biopsy and subsequent histopathological examination can be performed. There are multiple therapeutic options for psoriasis. First-line therapy for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis is the application of topical agents, followed by phototherapy (UVB) for more extensive disease.

Despite its efficacy, limitations such as incomplete responses and pain have motivated the exploration of protocol enhancements. This review examines the clinical and biological rationale for light fractionation-dividing the total light dose into two separate exposures with a dark interval-as a strategy to improve PDT outcomes. We reviewed preclinical and clinical studies evaluating fractionated illumination using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or methyl aminolevulinate (MAL). The findings consistently demonstrate superior efficacy of fractionated schemes, particularly with ALA, showing higher complete response rates in AK, superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC), and Bowen's disease (BD), and improved long-term tumor control compared to single illumination. The better outcomes are attributed to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation following tissue reoxygenation during the dark interval and greater susceptibility of partially damaged cells to subsequent illumination. Fractionated PDT also shows a favorable safety and cosmetic profile. These results support considering light fractionation protocols as a standard approach for optimizing PDT efficacy in dermatologic oncology, particularly in lesions with limited depth and high recurrence risk.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40869373/"}

It can be caused by the withdrawal of corticosteroids and, among its extra-cutaneous manifestations, liver abnormalities are frequently under-reported or attributed to drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and laboratory data, treatment options, and disease outcome in patients with AGPP and to search for significant differences between subgroups of these patients. This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical files from inpatients with AGPP observed in our department between 1973 and 2008. Statistical tests were performed at a significance level of 5%. This was an inpatient, single-center study. Outcome measures were a previous history of psoriasis, corticosteroid use before admittance, mortality rate, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and abnormalities in liver enzymes. A total of 34 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of whom 61% were men and 65% had a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris. Topical corticosteroids were applied by 50% of patients before admittance. Skin lesions remitted with methotrexate, etretinate, or acitretin treatment in all but two patients who died of sepsis. Abnormalities in liver enzymes were present in 47% of patients. Patients without a previous history of psoriasis had a significantly younger age at the first episode of AGPP. In the comparison between the groups of patients with and without liver abnormalities, a male preponderance and higher leukocyte counts were found in the former, with a positive correlation between the absolute neutrophil count and total bilirubin also being observed. Previous use of retinoids or methotrexate was not associated with these hepatic alterations. Limitations of the data were that this was a single-center, retrospective study with a small sample size. Withdrawal of systemic or topical corticosteroids can precipitate or worsen AGPP and these agents should not be used in these patients. Liver abnormalities can be considered an extra-cutaneous manifestation of AGPP. As in other series, no association between the use of drugs and changes in liver tests was found and therefore the deleterious withdrawal of efficient drugs, namely acitretin and methotrexate, should be avoided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21495733/"}

Conventional pharmacotherapies currently available can only provide minor advantages. Nanomedicines based on nanotechnology can potentially improve the efficacy and safety of psoriasis medications. Apoptosis plays an important pathogenetic role in many chronic inflammatory diseases, including those of dermatological interest, in particular, regarding psoriasis. In this regard, treatments with antioxidant properties could be appropriate therapeutic options. We reviewed the available studies on the efficacy of antiapoptotic therapies in psoriasis. We'll look at phytochemicals in this review, which are natural components found in plants with antiapoptotic activity that are frequently used to treat psoriasis. For improved topical treatment, we also take into consideration the advantages of loading phytoconstituents as medicines into lipid based nanocarriers. The utilization of herbal nanomedicines in psoriasis, as well as nano delivery carrier system for phytoconstituents with improved therapeutic profiles and decreased toxicity, are the subjects of this review. The study's purpose is to find more effective herbal nanomedicines for treating psoriasis. In the treatment of psoriasis, phytoconstituents that have shown antipsoriatic potential in recent years, as well as phytoconstituents loaded based nanomedicines, have a lot of promising roles to be explored. Furthermore, very few patents have been found in the field of nanotechnology utilizing lipid-based nanocarrier system for the treatment of psoriasis. Therefore, this review greatly compels the researcher to validate the process development of lipid-based drug delivery system for the patentability of the product.

Although the different types of psoriasis are present in both children and adults, the individual course of the disease and its distribution shows differences. The overall rate of comorbidity in psoriatic persons younger than 20 years seems to be twice as high as in persons without psoriasis. Treating children with psoriasis still remains challenging and represents one of the most rewarding endeavours in contemporary dermatology, since psoriasis can present with both joint and skin symptoms. An interdisciplinary approach with pediatricians, dermatologist and rheumatologists might be crucial.

People with acne find the condition especially difficult to manage because of the disease's chronicity and variability in response to treatment. Acne is the result of pores clogged with shed skin cells combined with sebum in the hair follicle. Successful treatment of acne is important because acne has the potential to result in lasting physical and emotional scarring. For many years, physicians have agreed that although cleansing is not effective on its own, effective cleansing is an important part of any acne treatment regimen. However, patients have not been satisfied with the types of cleansers available. In addition to containing dyes and perfumes that can irritate and exacerbate acne, these cleansers often are too harsh and can result in excessive drying of the skin, which leads to overcompensation by the oil glands and ultimately to more oil on the surface of the skin. This study examined the use of a daily facial cleanser formulated for normal to oily skin in subjects with mild facial acne. The cleanser was studied for 2 weeks in the absence of additional treatments to eliminate the confounding effects of various treatments. Subjects were monitored for skin barrier function through transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and corneometry, sebum level, and lesion counts. The results of the study indicate that the facial cleanser is gentle and does not damage the skin barrier or result in sebum overcompensation; additionally, the cleanser is effective at deep-pore cleansing, which may help to manage some acne-associated symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16910029/"}

These factors interrupt the natural cycling process in the sebaceous gland follicle and support the transition of microcomedones to comedones and inflammatory lesions. Proinflammatory lipids and cytokines are mediators for the development of acne lesions. Bacterial antigens can potentate the inflammatory phenomena. Acne is predominantly treated with combination therapy. Selecting a treatment regimen depends on the exact classification of acne type and severity. The development of scars is the main criterion for the choice of systemic therapy. Retinoids for mild comedonal acne and the combination of retinoids with antibiotics and/or benzoyl peroxide for mild to moderate papulopustular acne are the drugs of first choice for topical treatment. The use of topical antibiotics is not recommended any more because of the development of resistant bacterial strains. Systemic antibiotics, in combination with topical retinoids and/or benzoyl peroxide, for moderate papular/nodular acne and isotretinoin for severe nodular/conglobate acne are the columns of systemic acne treatment. Systemic anti-androgens are used in women against moderate papulopustular acne. Due to advances in the understanding of the underlying inflammatory mechanisms in recent years the development of new therapeutic agents with good efficacy and better side effect profile should be expected in the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25113333/"}

PRP occurs equally in men and women. In some patients, associated autoimmune diseases, infections, or malignancies are possible trigger factors. PRP shows a bimodal age distribution, peaking in the first as well as in the fifth to sixth decade. Its classification into five subgroups is based on age at onset, clinical course, morphologic features, and prognosis. More than 50% of patients are best classified as type I with adult-onset PRP. This form is also characterized by high spontaneous remission rates (80%) within 1-3 years. Clinically, the classical adult (type I) and classical juvenile (type III) forms appear to be the same except for the patient's age. Recently, the designation of a new category of PRP (type VI) has been proposed that is characterized by the presence of HIV infection with different clinical features and a poorer prognosis. Typical morphologic features of PRP are erythematosquamous salmon-colored plaques with well demarcated islands of unaffected skin. Often, keratoderma of the palms and soles is present. In patients with extensive disease, ectropion is a dreaded complication. Histology shows hyperkeratosis, alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in a checkerboard pattern, and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis. Descriptions and therapeutic experiences are mainly based on case reports. Mostly, systemic retinoids, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressive agents as well as UV light therapy are applied, with varying response rates. In recent years, treatment with so-called 'biologics' is becoming more and more popular for treating recalcitrant PRP.

Within this broad use of light and drugs, in recent years the concept of photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged. PDT is a promising modality for the management of various tumors and nonmalignant diseases, based on the combination of a photosensitizer that is selectively localized in the target tissue and illumination of the lesion with visible light, resulting in photodamage and subsequent cell death. Moreover, the fluorescence of photosensitizing compounds is also utilized as a helpful diagnostic tool for the detection of neoplastic tissue. Intensive basic and clinical research culminated in the worldwide approval of PDT for bladder, esophageal, and lung cancer. The expanding use of this relatively new therapeutic modality in dermatology at many centers around the world has revealed its efficacy for the treatment of cutaneous precancer and cancer, as well as selected benign skin disorders.

In this rapidly changing field, new atopic dermatitis-targeted monoclonal antibodies will be reviewed in light of the recently discovered pathomechanisms of the disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29870461/"}

To describe the symptoms, clinical signs and frequency of adverse cutaneous reactions to skin care products on the face in males vs females of various ages. All outpatients diagnosed with adverse cutaneous reactions to skin care products on the face examined by dermatologists at the Dermatology Hospital of South Medical University between November 1, 2016 and October 31, 2017, employing a questionnaire and an interview, were eligible. The associations of adverse cutaneous reactions with age and sex were analysed. A total of 433 outpatients, accounting for 0.12% of all outpatients, were assessed. Of these, 223 patients, including 204 females and 19 males, aged 4 to 75 years, were eventually diagnosed with adverse reactions to skin care products on the face. Eighty-two per cent of patients experienced pruritus, 80% showed erythema, and 48% showed visible swelling. The incidence rates of both xerosis and oedema correlated positively with age, whereas acne-like lesions were negatively associated with age, but not with sex. Our results indicate that pruritus, xerosis and erythema are common adverse cutaneous reactions to facial skin care products. These reactions vary with age, but not with sex.

The liposomes were characterized in terms of their structure, composition, zeta potential, Na-HA-entrapment capacity and stability. In particular, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy were utilized to probe appearance, size and size distribution and lamellarity. The work was then extended to gels using the gelling agents poloxamer (PXM 188 or 407) and Carbopol or Ultrez 21 (U-21), yielding liposome-loaded gel formulations (i.e. lipogelosomes). The in vitro release kinetics of Na-HA from liposomes, lipogelosomes and commercial Na-HA reference formulations were studied via a flow-through cell method. Among the liposomal formulations tested, L6, comprising of Na-HA-loaded phospholipon 100H:stearylamine:cholesterol (7:1:2), displayed optimal traits. The mean particle size, zeta potential and entrapment capacity of L6 were determined as 1900 nm, -20.9 mV and 15.0%. The optimum lipogelosome, LG4, was obtained by incorporating liposome L6 into a U-21 gel at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w). In clinical trials, in-house formulations were applied twice daily to 15 female volunteers. The two-week benefits were assessed against a commercial product; and in all cases, changes of skin humidity, sebum content, pH and wrinkle depth were promising. In particular, the LG4 lipogelosome-based formulation had significantly improved skin hydration and compliance, as evidenced by a moisture content gain of 30.4%.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24724824/"}

In addition to active acne lesions, some patients may develop sequelae such as scarring, macular/postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, or erythema. The tendency of Asian skin to develop sequelae because of its increased susceptibility to irritation, cultural preferences for lighter skin phototypes, and differences in skincare regimens may all contribute to the increased burden of acne. Moreover, many Asia-Pacific countries do not have their own guidelines for acne management, and those that do often have no schedule in place for regular updates. In this article, we provide a critical review of the published guidance for the management of acne and its sequelae in the Asia-Pacific region, identifying gaps in current recommendations that could be addressed to enhance standards of acne care in Asia-Pacific countries. Along with highlighting the importance of a comprehensive skincare regimen to increase treatment efficacy and adherence, we discuss topical retinoids and retinoid combination options in the acne armamentarium that may be beneficial for sequelae prevention and management, such as adapalene 0.3% ± benzoyl peroxide 2.5%, tretinoin 0.05%, tazarotene 0.1%, and trifarotene 0.005%.

A retrospective case-controlled review of patient records was designed to investigate the number of courses of antimicrobials and other therapies in dogs that received oclacitinib (Apoquel®), compared with those who received an anti-pruritic treatment that was not oclacitinib. The target population included canine patients with a presumptive diagnosis of allergic dermatitis presenting between 2008 and 2018 to general practices contributing to the VetCompass Australia database. Patient records of interest were identified using search terms relating to allergic dermatitis, resulting in over 700,000 observations. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to determine whether cases were prescribed fewer antimicrobial courses than controls, after adjusting for the presence of concurrent skin infections or infectious agents in ears. Our results indicate that fewer antimicrobial courses were prescribed in the cases compared to the controls.

This article reviews the scientific data and clinical studies supporting the use of topically applied vitamin C for treating photoaged skin. Other innovative uses for vitamin C cosmeceuticals are also discussed. A significant body of scientific research supports the use of cosmeceuticals containing vitamin C. Cutaneous benefits include promoting collagen synthesis, photoprotection from ultraviolet A and B, lightening hyperpigmentation, and improvement of a variety of inflammatory dermatoses. Because of the diverse biologic effects of this compound, topical vitamin C has become a useful part of the dermatologist's armamentarium.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16029672/"}

{"id": "40056037", "title": "MOAT: MobileNet-Optimized Attention Transfer for Robust and Scalable Dermatology Image Classification.", "text": "In recent times, dermatological disease is a common health issue around the world. Timely and accurate dermatological disease detection is mandatory for proper treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. Prior to this, various detection and classification methodologies were developed for the early prediction of skin disease using dermatology images. However, they have struggled with poor detection accuracy and require high computational time. This research proposes a novel MobileNet-Optimized Attention Transfer framework for the accurate classification of skin disease. In this study, the MobileNet model is deployed for feature extraction, which integrates the self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. The attention mechanisms prioritize essential features within the images and allow the model to identify the subtle patterns associated with various skin conditions. For hyperparameter tuning, an Optical Microscope Algorithm with an initial search strategy is applied. The algorithm iteratively fine-tunes the parameters to balance global and local search and prevent the model from converging on suboptimal configurations. The performance of the proposed method is validated using the Skin Cancer ISIC dataset and the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset and compared to existing skin disease classification methodologies in terms of some common assessing metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the MobileNet-Optimized Attention Transfer framework effectively classified the dermatological disease and achieves a high accuracy of 98.89%, a lower mean squared error of 0.186, and a low computational time of 1.53 s compared to existing methodologies. This result indicates that the proposed framework is a scalable, adaptable solution for clinical applications, aiding dermatologists with reliable diagnostic support and enabling early intervention.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40056037/"}

Patients with psoriasis aged 16-17 years were asked to complete both the DLQI and CDLQI. Fifty-six patients were included. There was a high correlation between DLQI and CDLQI scores (r = 0·90, P < 0·001). The mean DLQI score (5·41 ± 5·20) was lower than the mean CDLQI (6·61 ± 5·74) (P < 0·001). The major part of this difference (∆0·61) was caused by the low score regarding sexual difficulties in the DLQI (0·11 ± 0·49) and the high score concerning sleep in the CDLQI (0·71 ± 0·93).

The following comments are based on expert opinion and a literature review. Low-dose MTX (< 0.4 mg/kg per week) has a slow onset of action and has moderate to good efficacy, together with an acceptable safety profile. The mechanism of action is anti-inflammatory, rather than immunosuppressive. For pretreatment, consider testing full blood count (FBC), liver and renal function, non-fasting lipids, hepatitis serology, HbA1c and glucose. Body mass index and abdominal circumference should also be measured. Optional investigations in at-risk groups include an HIV test, a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and a chest X-ray. In patients without complications, repeat the FBC at 2-4 weeks, then every 3-6 months and the liver/renal function test at 3 months and then every 6 months. There is little evidence that a MTX test dose is of value. Low-dose MTX rarely causes clinically significant hepatotoxicity in psoriasis. Most treatment-emergent liver toxicity is related to underlying metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Alcohol itself is not contraindicated, but should be limited to < 20 gm/day. [Correction added on 6 January 2017, after first online publication: '20 mg/day' has been corrected to '20 gm/day'.] Although MTX is a potential teratogen post-conception, there is little evidence for this pre-conception.

A previous Delphi panel established areas of consensus on GPP, although patient perspectives were not included and aspects of treatment goals remained unclear. To identify and achieve consensus on refined, specific treatment goals for GPP treatment via a Delphi panel with patient participation. Statements were generated based on a systematic literature review and revised by a Steering Committee. Statements were categorized into overarching principles, and short- and long-term treatment goals. A global panel of 30 dermatologists and 3 patient representatives voted in agreement or disagreement with each statement. Consensus was defined as ≥ 80% approval by the panellists. Consensus was reached in the first round of voting and ≥ 90% agreement was reached for 23 of 26 statements. In summary, GPP requires a timely, tailored treatment plan, co-developed by patients and physicians, that involves a multidisciplinary approach and addresses the complexity, heterogeneity and chronicity of the disease. Short-term treatment goals should include pustule clearance within 7 days and prevention of pustule recurrence, reduction of cutaneous symptom burden (-4 or more points on the Itch and Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale), improvement in systemic symptoms (e.g. resolution of fever within 3 days of treatment initiation and reduced fatigue), prevention of life-threatening complications and progressive improvement of inflammatory biomarkers. In patients with comorbid psoriatic diseases, treatment decisions should prioritize GPP. Long-term treatment goals should include minimizing disease activity through flare prevention and symptom control between flares, sustained disease control, management of comorbidities and improvement in quality of life (QoL). Small differences in perception between patients and physicians regarding the importance of certain treatment goals (e.g. avoiding hair and/or nail loss to improve QoL), reflect the complexity of assessing treatment goals and emphasize the need for a patient-centred approach. In the first global Delphi panel in GPP to include patient perspectives, consensus between dermatologists and patients was achieved on overarching principles of treatment, and short- and long-term treatment goals for GPP. These findings provide valuable insights for developing guidelines that consider the perspectives of patients and physicians in the treatment of GPP.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39844356/"}

Under these circumstances, keratinocytes show liposomal alterations of the cell structure, proliferation, and lipid fluidity. Animal experiments and clinical studies have pointed out that, in comparison with a conventional formulation, a liposomal way of application can enhance the penetration of various substances as well as their toposelective enrichment in the skin, since the dermal-vascular absorption is diminished.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2183509/"}

Although to date the compound is not approved as a drug by the FDA or EMA, physicians have continued to use DPCP because of its proven effects in these dermatological conditions. The use of the drug has been highly variable because of differences in compounding, and as a result, the literature reports vary widely in the concentrations used for sensitization and challenge treatment with DPCP. The efficacy of DPCP has generally been ascribed to immunological reactions by the host. Inducing inflammation with a contact sensitizer is counterintuitive to treating AA, an autoimmune disorder. We have hypothesized that the body's attempt to downregulate the inflammation caused by the contact sensitizer may also ameliorate AA. Studies using microarray and miRNA profiling may provide information about how DPCP induces inflammation in human skin at different times. Gene targets and microRNAs identified through these data may be modulated by an RNA interference approach to enhance DPCP efficacy and response rates.

Gender differences in disease depend on hormonal status and may involve functions of the skin, immune responses and metabolic pathways, and have to do also with indications and response to treatments. Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disease. The prevalence of psoriasis in the population is balanced between males and females, but early onset psoriasis is slightly more prevalent in males, with the latter suffering from a more severe disease. In general, male and female patients receive identical drugs at equivalent dosages. However, females receive systemic treatments less frequently compared to males. Males are more satisfied with their psoriasis treatment and respond better to biologics. Females have a significant higher rate of adverse events and drug-related discontinuation rate compared to males. About conventional systemic treatments for psoriasis during pregnancy, only cyclosporine is suggested when the benefits exceed the potential side effects, whereas methotrexate is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and in the three months before fatherhood and motherhood. Among the biologics, only certolizumab pegol is considered safe in pregnant patients, as it does not cross the maternal-placental barrier.

Included patients had histologically proven sarcoidosis and received anti-TNF between January 2004 and January 2016. We extracted data for patients with skin involvement at anti-TNF initiation. Response to treatment was evaluated for skin and visceral involvement using the ePOST (extra-pulmonary Physician Organ Severity Tool) severity score (from 0 [not affected] to 6 [very severe involvement]). Epidemiological and cutaneous features at baseline, efficacy, steroid-sparing, safety, and relapses were recorded. The overall cutaneous response rate (OCRR) was defined as complete (final cutaneous ePOST score of 0 or 1) or partial response (ePOST drop ≥2 points from baseline but >1 at last follow-up).

To characterize AD treatment in the United States, ambulatory visits from the 2006-2015 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were analyzed. For each medication prescribed, a grade was assigned on the basis of the American Academy of Dermatology treatment guidelines for topical and systemic medications. Considering all visit prescriptions, I calculated a composite grade, analogous to the US academic grading system (scores A-F). I noted prescribing differences across specialty groups. Systemic corticosteroids were more likely to be prescribed by family and general physicians and less likely by pediatricians. Dermatologists were more likely than other specialties to prescribe nonsedating antihistamines, which lack a guideline base supporting their use. Depending upon modeling of care assumptions, all physician specialty visits earned mean guideline-based grades of B or C in their care of AD patients. The clinical, social, and demographic factors influencing prescribing behavior cannot be completely assessed by using extant data. This preliminary study demonstrates that physicians might benefit from reviewing guidelines of care; there might be an educational gap in the implementation of these guidelines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30287314/"}

Patients with nail involvement experience pain, functional impairment and social stigma, with significant restriction of daily activities and quality of life. Nail psoriasis is also considered a risk factor for the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Management of nail psoriasis is deemed challenging and as a result, it is often left untreated by physicians. Assessing the severity of nail disease can also be difficult in clinical practice. While the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index is used widely in trials, it is time-consuming and rarely used in the clinic, highlighting the need to develop a simplified disease severity score for nail psoriasis. All patients should be advised to keep their nails short, wear gloves for wet and dirty work, and regularly apply emollient to the nail folds and nail surface. Patients with mild nail psoriasis, without signs of severe cutaneous psoriasis or PsA, may benefit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail involvement. Evidence suggests that all anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, anti-interleukin (IL)-17, and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies available for plaque psoriasis and PsA are highly effective treatments for nail psoriasis.

This Special Communication examines Kodachrome's contributions to the field of dermatology, as well as its lessons for improving inclusive representation of patients of all skin tones in 21st century dermatologic curricula. Kodachrome's color quality, its slide transparency format, and its broad commercial availability democratized the creation, sharing, and teaching of visual information about skin disease in the 20th century. Kodachrome's usefulness as a complement to bedside teaching modernized medical school curricula, dermatologic conferences, and the American Board of Dermatology certifying examination, which inspired the Kodachrome-style of didactic that remains central to dermatologic training programs today. However, Kodachrome film was also the product of a prejudiced era when color film technology and photographic best practices were optimized for white skin. These biases are still evident in industry standards, photographic techniques, and the historically unjust representation of skin of color in educational resources. Kodachrome film contributed substantially to shaping 20th-century medical education; however, its legacy is a reminder that diverse and inclusive image representation in dermatologic curricula is vital to counteracting implicit biases, correcting assumptions about disease epidemiology, and providing high-quality care for patients of all skin tones. Historical biases that have harmed representations of racial and ethnic minorities in dermatologic curricula are being addressed through improvements in digital photographic technologies, photographic best practices that serve a broader range of skin tones, inclusive skin color representation in contemporary educational resources, and skin-of-color specific curriculum for learners.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35704331/"}

New drugs used to modulate inflammatory diseases.", "text": "Since its discovery, the understanding of the roles for TNF-alpha in human biology and disease has grown. Receptors for TNF are found on virtually all cell types, and many physiologic processes seem to be altered by TNF-alpha. The understanding of how TNF-alpha is involved in the pathophysiology of diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, has allowed the development of new drugs that can interfere with excess TNF-alpha and thus has allowed novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As the role of TNF-alpha in other diseases becomes better understood, such TNF-alpha-modulating drugs may find further applications. In the skin, TNF-alpha is prominent cytokine that seems to be important in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and inflammatory skin conditions. Modulating TNF-alpha activity in the skin may provide therapeutic benefits for a variety of skin conditions (Table 4). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels are elevated in skin lesions of psoriasis. A few reports have already suggested that etanercept and infliximab may offer a therapeutic effect in patients with psoriasis. Clinical studies evaluating the true efficacy of these drugs in psoriasis are under way. Specifically, the authors and others are involved in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of etanercept for psoriasis. Thalidomide has been used off-label with some success to treat a number of dermatologic diseases, including several inflammatory skin conditions. Etanercept and infliximab might perhaps prove efficacious for inflammatory skin conditions as well. Finally, it is possible that drugs targeting TNF-alpha may have yet-unrecognized serious side effects. Because TNF-alpha seems to be a central cytokine in UVR-induced apoptosis, the chronic use of TNF-alpha-altering drugs might increase the risk for skin cancers. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha also plays some role in cutaneous wound healing; the effect these drugs might have on this process is also unknown at this time. Certainly, much is already [table: see text] known about TNF-alpha and how it plays many central roles. This understanding has allowed the development of useful new drugs for intractable disease.

{"id": "29782305", "title": "Tatami Mats: A Source of Pitted Keratolysis in a Martial Arts Athlete?", "text": "Dear Editor, Pitted keratolysis (PK), also known as keratosis plantaris sulcatum, is a non-inflammatory, bacterial, superficial cutaneous infection, characterized by many discrete superficial crateriform ''pits'' and erosions in the thickly keratinized skin of the weight-bearing regions of the soles of the feet (1). The disease often goes unnoticed by the patient, but when it is noticed it is because of the unbearable malodor and hyperhidrosis of the feet, which are socially unacceptable and cause great anxiety to many of the patients. PK occurs worldwide, with the incidence rates varying based on the environment and occupation. The prevalence of this condition does not differ significantly based on age, sex, or race. People who sweat profusely or wash excessively, who wear occlusive footwear, or are barefoot especially in hot and humid weather are extremely prone to this condition (2). Physicians commonly misdiagnose it as tinea pedis or plantar warts. Treatment is quite simple and straightforward, with an excellent expected outcome if treated properly. We report a case of a 32-year-old male patient with skin changes of approximately one-year duration diagnosed as plantar verrucae, who was referred to our Department for cryotherapy. The patient presented with asymptomatic, malodorous punched-out pits and erosions along with hyperkeratotic skin on the heel and metatarsal region of the plantar aspect of both feet. The arches, toes, and sides of the feet were spared (Figure 1). Except for these skin changes, the patient was healthy and denied any other medical issues. He was an athlete active in martial arts and had a history of sweating of feet and training barefoot on the tatami mat for extended periods of time. The diagnosis of PK was established based on the clinical findings (crateriform pitting and malodor), negative KOH test for hyphae, and a history of prolonged sweating in addition to contact of the skin with tatami mats, which are often a source of infection if hygiene measures are not adequately implemented. Swabs could have been helpful to identify causative organisms, but they were not crucial for the diagnosis and treatment. The patient was prescribed with general measures to prevent excessive sweating (cotton socks, open footwear, and proper hygiene), antiseptic potassium permanganate foot soaks followed by clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide 5% in a gel vehicle twice daily. At the one-month follow-up visit, the skin changes, hyperhidrosis, and malodor were entirely resolved (Figure 2). Pitted keratolysis is common among athletes (3,4). The manifestations of PK are due to a superficial cutaneous infection caused by several bacterial Gram-positive species including Corynebacterium species, Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus congolensis, Actynomices keratolytica, and Streptomyces that proliferate and produce proteinase and sulfur-compound by-products under appropriate moist conditions (5-7). Proteinases digest the keratin and destroy the stratum corneum, producing the characteristic skin findings, while sulfur compounds (sulfides, thiols, and thioesters) are responsible for the malodor. Athletes and soldiers who wear occlusive footwear for prolonged periods of time or even barefooted people that sweat extensively and spend time on wet surfaces such as laborers, farmers, and marine workers are more prone to this problem (3,4,8-11). Martial arts athletes are at greater risk of skin infections due to the constant physical contact that can lead to transmission of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens directly but also indirectly through contact with the mat and the skin flora of an another infected individual. A national survey of the epidemiology of skin infections among US high school athletes conducted by Ashack et al. supported the prevalent theory that contact sports are associated with an increased risk of skin infections. In this study, wrestling had the highest skin infection rate of predominantly bacterial origin (53.8%), followed by tinea (35.7%) and herpetic lesions (6.7%), which is consistent with other literature reporting (12). Being barefoot on the tatami mat in combination with excessive sweating and non-compliance with hygiene measures makes martial arts athletes more susceptible to skin infections, including PK. The diagnosis is clinical, by means of visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. Dermoscopy can be useful, revealing abundant pits with well-marked walls that sometimes show the bacterial colonies (13). Cultures, if taken, show Gram-positive bacilli or coccobacilli. Because of the ease of diagnosis on clinical findings, biopsy of pitted keratolysis is rarely performed. Skin scraping is often performed to exclude tinea pedis, which is one of the main differential diagnosis, the others including verrucae, punctate palmoplantar keratoderma, keratolysis exfoliativa, circumscribed palmoplantar hypokeratosis, and basal cell nevus syndrome. If unrecognized and left untreated, skin findings and smelly feet can last for many years. Sometimes, if unrecognized, PK can be mistreated with antifungals, or even with aggressive treatment modalities such as cryotherapy. Appropriate treatment includes keeping feet dry with adequate treatment of hyperhidrosis, preventive measures, and topical antibiotic therapy. Topical forms of salicylic acid, sulfur, antibacterial soaps, neomycin, erythromycin, mupirocin, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide, clotrimazole, imidazoles, and injectable botulinum toxin are all successful in treatment and prevention of PK (14,15). Topical antibiotics are the first line of medical treatment, among which fusidic acid, erythromycin 1% (solution or gel), mupirocin 2%, or clindamycin are the most recommended (14). As in our case, a fixed combination of two approved topical drugs - clindamycin 1%-benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, had been already demonstrated by Vlahovich et al. as an excellent treatment option with high adherence and no side-effect (16). The combined effect of this combination showed signiﬁcantly greater effect due to the bactericidal and keratolytic properties of benzoyl peroxide. Additionally, this combination also lowers the risk of resistance of causative microorganisms to clindamycin. Skin infections are an important aspect of sports-related adverse events. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, dermatologists are not the only ones who should be aware of the disease, but also family medicine doctors, sports medicine specialists, and occupational health doctors who should educate patients about the etiology of the skin disorder, adequate prevention, and treatment. Athletes must enforce the disinfecting and sanitary cleaning of the tatami mats and other practice areas. Keeping up with these measures could significantly limit the spread of skin infections that can infect athletes indirectly, leading to significant morbidity, time loss from competition, and social anxiety as well.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29782305/"}

The goal was to improve patient care by collecting and categorizing data in terms of prescription practice and associated challenges in interdisciplinary cooperation. Overall, 351 pharmacists (23.5 %) and 53 dermatologists (28.4 %) participated in this survey. The most common reason (83 %) stated for prescribing a CP was the possibility to prescribe large quantities of a given topical medication; CPs were most commonly prescribed for psoriasis and various types of dermatitis.

The disease is chronic and recurrent, and the leading symptom is skin pruritus that in the mechanism of the vicious circle is accompanied by scratching that causes generalized infections. The overall problems lead to a decrease in the quality of life of the child and its parents and to an increased risk of psychosomatic diseases. The complex pathomechanism of AD is due to chronic inflammation of the skin, in which various cell phenotypes are involved. The management is comprehensive and it is aimed at reducing inflammation, improving the skin barrier function, reducing the symptoms of dryness and itching of the skin and secondarily improving the quality of life. The treatment includes intensive skincare, anti-inflammatory treatment based on the proactive use of topical glucocorticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Periods of exacerbation of lesions require intensified treatment. In particularly severe, recurrent cases, treatment options can be extended to systemic immunosuppressive drugs, with awareness of their adverse effects. Previous year has brought significant progress in the current treatment of AD in the form of biological treatment. Cytokines and other mediators that play an important role in the pathogenesis of skin inflammation have become a target for new forms of therapy.

The data were examined and independently analyzed by more than two of the authors. Rosacea is a complex inflammatory condition involving the pilosebaceous unit. Its underlying mechanism involves an interplay of the microbiome, innate immunity, adaptive immunity, environmental triggers, and neurovascular sensitivity. The latest classification of rosacea includes three dermatologic subgroups and a fourth subgroup, ocular rosacea. Ocular rosacea clinically displays many features that are analogous to the cutaneous disease, such as lid margin telangiectasia and phlyctenulosis. The role of environmental triggers in the exacerbation of ocular rosacea appears to be understudied. While lid hygiene and systemic treatment with tetracycline drugs remain the mainstay of treatment for ocular rosacea, newer dermatologic targets and therapies may have potential application for the eye disease. Ocular rosacea appears to embody many of the manifestation of the dermatologic disease. Hence, the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms of the ocular and cutaneous disease are likely to be shared. Better understanding of the ocular surface microbiome and the immunologic mechanisms, may lead to novel approaches in the management of ocular rosacea.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32586107/"}

It has a high impact on the quality of life of the affected patients. It is now recognized that in some patients, acne shows characteristics of a chronic disease. Because of a lack of current recommendations/guidelines in Switzerland, a group of hospital and private practice based dermatologists, specialized in acne, as well as an experienced general practitioner revised the available literature on acne and its treatment. The group subsequently developed several consensus statements regarding grading, treatment and monitoring of acne. The first version of the recommendations was published in 2020 and is now being updated. The experts agreed that acne severity should be determined by a subjective method and that, for short-term therapy, treatment success is defined as an approximately 50 % reduction of inflammatory lesions within 3 months. The choice of induction treatment is based on the severity of the disease. Its main component is a topical retinoid alone or - in more severe case - in combination with benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Only in moderate to severe forms of acne or if a more rapid resolution of inflammatory lesions is desired, a systemic antibiotic should be added to induction treatment. For severe acne with a tendency to scarring, systemic retinoids are the induction treatment of choice in the absence of contra-indications. Maintenance therapy is indicated in all patients with acne, independent of disease severity. The choice of maintenance therapy should always be based on acne severity, duration of disease, current treatment and history of relapse. The preferred options for maintenance therapy are topical retinoids with/without BPO. While treating acne, a special focus should lie on the prevention of scars. For this reason, patients should be evaluated 3 months after treatment initiation to determine whether they have responded or whether further therapeutic options should be considered. The expert group also recommends counselling patients on nutrition, psychological aspects, stress, use of contraceptives, skin care, use of cosmetics and use of other drugs (like steroids). Monitoring of patients with acne should particularly focus on adherence to treatment and quality of life. Patients with severe forms of acne (acne with a tendency of scarring, patients with acne conglobata or acne fulminans), patients with insufficient treatment response after 3 months and patients with frequent relapses should be referred to a dermatologist.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40772752/"}

Unlike all-trans retinoic acid (RA), MDI 301 does not induce expression of proinflammatory cytokines or induce expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in human skin. In the present study we examined topical MDI 301 treatment for ability to improve the structure and function of skin in three models of skin damage in rodents and for ability to improve abrasion wound healing in these models. MDI 301 was applied daily to the skin of rats treated with the potent corticosteroid, clobetasol propionate, to the skin of diabetic rats (8 weeks posttreatment with streptozotocin) and to the skin of aged (14-16-month-old) rats. In all three models, subsequently induced abrasion wounds healed more rapidly in the retinoid-treated animals than in vehicle-treated controls. Immediately after complete wound closure, tissue from the wound site (as well as from a control site) was put into organ culture and maintained for 3 days. At the end of the incubation period, culture fluids were assessed for soluble type I collagen and for MMPs-2 and -9.

Stress, streptococcal infection and drugs including beta-blockers, antimalarials and lithium may precipitate or exacerbate psoriasis. Psoriasis, especially when severe, predisposes to metabolic syndrome, and patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia. Additionally, psoriasis sufferers appear at increased risk of uveitis, inflammatory boweldisease, lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, COPD and venous thromboembolism. Psoriasis should be assessed on the basis of: severity, impact on physical, psychological and social wellbeing, symptoms of arthritis and the presence of comorbidities. Poor response to topical therapy may be as much to do with lack of compliance as with lack of efficacy. The number of treatments each day should be kept to a minimum, and patients should be reviewed after four weeks when initiating or changing topical therapy to improve adherence to treatment and assess response. The majority of patients with psoriasis can be managed in primary care, although specialist care may be necessary at some point in up to 60% of cases.

In addition, human studies, although limited due to differences in the cannabinoids used, disease models, and delivery method, have consistently shown significant reductions in both scratching and symptoms in chronic pruritus. Clinical studies have shown a reduction in pruritus in several dermatologic (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asteatotic eczema, prurigo nodularis, and allergic contact dermatitis) and systemic (uremic pruritus and cholestatic pruritus) diseases.

It is characterized by distinct erythematous plaques shielded with conspicuous silvery scales that shows up in different areas of the skin. Knowledge of pathophysiology, especially the pathogenesis of psoriasis, has significantly progressed in the recent decade. Advancement in molecular knowledge leads to better understanding of the disease, thus influencing the development of efficient treatment modalities. However, even with the availability of various options of treatment most of the efficient treatment modalities are costly. Expenses of health care bring about major financial weight to the patients as well as to health care systems. Thus, it was important to review the available current treatment options and those which are under development, in terms of efficacy, safety and cost to assist in selecting the most appropriate treatment for psoriasis patients. Literatures were searched by using key words psoriasis, topical treatment, systemic treatment, biologics and phototherapies, on Embase, Medline, Jstor, Cochrane and Merck Index databases. Life-style choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and stress are recognised as risk factors and triggers associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis poses psycho-social and economic burden on affected patients that sometimes leads to depression, reduced social interaction and suicidal tendencies in patients. Depending on the type, severity and extent of the disease, comorbidities, patient preference, efficacy and safety profile, numerous treatment modalities and therapeutic agents are available such as topical, systemic, biologic and phototherapeutic treatments. However, it was found that among all the current available treatments for psoriasis, biologic agents and phototherapeutic modalities are the most commonly employed treatment modalities for moderate to severe psoriasis.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on topical agents for the treatment of melasma on March 4th, 2019 using PRISMA guidelines. Clinical recommendations were based on the American College of Physicians guidelines. Results: After screening, we identified 35 original RCTs using azelaic acid, cysteamine, epidermal growth factor, hydroquinone (liposomal-delivered), lignin peroxidase, mulberry extract, niacinamide, Rumex occidentalis, triple combination therapy, tranexamic acid, 4-n-butylresorcinol, glycolic acid, kojic acid, aloe vera, ascorbic acid, dioic acid, ellagic acid and arbutin, flutamide, parsley, or zinc sulfate for melasma.

Subcutaneous application had full bioavailability, but neither oral nor transdermal application resulted in measurable plasma concentrations or pigmentation response. Two trials in human volunteers showed that neither MC1R variants nor fair skin reduced the afamelanotide-induced increase in skin pigmentation. A controlled-release formulation optimizes administration in man and is effective at a lower dose than the daily saline injections. Promising therapeutic results were published in polymorphic light eruption, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), solar urticaria, Hailey-Hailey disease and vitiligo. In 2014, afamelanotide was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP. No late effects were reported in volunteers 25 years after the first exposure or after continuous long-term application of up to 8 years in EPP patients, and an immunogenic potential has been excluded. Generally, adverse effects were benign in all trials.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28063031/"}

Four mixed-breed dogs, three 9-month-old male littermates and one 6-month-old female, were presented for generalized patchy alopecia, scarring and ulcerative dermatitis. Microscopic skin lesions were consistent with a severe ischaemic dermatopathy. A complete remission of skin lesions could not be achieved in any dog with glucocorticoids alone, nor when these were combined with adjuvant immunosuppressants. Oclacitinib treatment was then initiated at the dosage of 0.4-0.7 mg/kg twice daily, along with a tapering regimen of oral prednisolone. A full clinical remission was achieved within four weeks of starting this combination therapy, with prednisolone being stopped within eight weeks thereof. Remission was maintained in two dogs with lower doses or dosing frequencies of oclacitinib, whereas the two others required persistent twice daily administration of this JAKinib. Oclacitinib was a useful immunosuppressive adjuvant to oral glucocorticoids for the treatment of refractory or severe cases of ischaemic dermatopathy in these four dogs.

A total of 108 systematic reviews of research and review articles were conducted to make the manuscript comprehensible. The role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of the disease is discussed for a better understanding of the selection of pharmacotherapy. The older and newer therapeutic moiety with its mode of administration for psoriasis treatment has been discussed.

Emphasis has also been paid on advanced nanocarriers for dermatologic applications. For a better therapeutic outcome, proper selection of drug moiety with its appropriate administration is the major requisite. With the advent of nanotechnology, the development of nanocarrier for dermatologic application has been successfully demonstrated in positioning the systemically administrated drug into topical targeted delivery.

There are two main subtypes of AE, i.e. the IgE-associated (\"extrinsic atopic eczema\") and the non-IgE-associated type (\"intrinsic atopic eczema\") with different prognosis concerning the development of respiratory diseases (\"atopy march\"). The role of allergens varies: while in early childhood food allergens may play a role, mites and microbial antigens may become more relevant in adolescence and adulthood. Recently, it was demonstrated that Filaggrin is a major gene for atopic eczema. The altered skin structure and a deficiency in antimicrobial peptides favour colonization with Staphylococcus aureus; their enterotoxins with superantigenic activity stimulate activation of T cells and macrophages. Also sensitization to the yeast Malassezia spp. occurs almost exclusively in AE patients. So far, AE skin lesions are orchestrated by the local tissue expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with activation of T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, keratinocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils which lead to the skin inflammatory responses. From the therapeutic point of view, a step wise approach using emollients as a basic treatment is recommended. Modern topical corticosteroids of moderate to medium potency applied once per day and only on several days per week offer an efficient anti-inflammatory treatment with moderate side effects. Topic immunomodulatory drugs (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) have in addition substantially improved the treatment of AE. Proactive treatment approaches also in disease-free intervals may reduce exacerbations and total drug use.

This article aims to comprehensively evaluate the anti-psoriatic activity, efficacy, and safety profiles of curcumin and its novel formulations, as well as to discuss future directions for enhancing their use as an alternative treatment for psoriasis. Curcumin exerts its anti-psoriatic effects through multi-targeted actions, including inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhancing skin barrier proteins, thereby alleviating psoriasis lesions. However, both oral and topical curcumin formulations face challenges, such as low bioavailability and limited skin penetration, underscoring the need for novel formulations to improve therapeutic outcomes. Clinical findings suggest that oral curcumin may provide greater efficacy and better tolerance as an adjunctive therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis, while topical formulations may help reduce severity and improve well-being in mild to moderate cases.

The average duration of the skin disease before request for consultation was 10.3 ± 26.9 months (mean ± standard deviation), the majority had first onset of their disease or acute recurrence of previously known skin diseases. With respect to medical complaints, 39.7% of patients reported severe itch and 7.7% indicated severe pain. For most cases (84.0%), topical treatment and for almost one-third (32.5%) we recommended systemic treatment. The predominant number of cases was only presented once (92.0%) and further treatment of the skin disease could be managed by the medical staff inhouse. Only few consultations could not be solved virtually and were referred to local physicians for face-to-face consultations or procedures.</i> <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> <i>Teledermatological care for prisoners effectively supports the inhouse medical resources of prisons.

{"id": "40474034", "title": "Is There a Place for Biologics in Acne?", "text": "Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a multifactorial pathogenesis involving follicular hyperkeratinization, sebaceous gland dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis-particularly involving Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis-and complex immune-mediated mechanisms, on which T helper cell 1 (T<sub>h</sub>1) and T<sub>h</sub>17 pathways are central players. This evolving understanding has led to the exploration of biologic therapies targeting cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-17, and IL-23. However, clinical trials to date have not demonstrated efficacy of biologics in moderate to severe acne. In contrast, some case reports and studies suggest clinical improvement with TNFα and IL-17A inhibitors in severe, treatment-resistant acne, although these presentations often overlap with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), raising questions about diagnosis and underlying disease mechanisms. Furthermore, in various monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes where \"acne-like\" lesions are part of the clinical spectrum, biologic therapies have shown effectiveness. These observations suggest that in such contexts, the lesions may reflect HS or HS-like pathology rather than true acne, potentially explaining the therapeutic benefit of biologicals in this context. This review synthesizes current insights into the immunopathogenesis of acne and critically evaluates the rationale, evidence, and limitations of biologic therapy in its treatment. While biologics hold promise in defined inflammatory dermatoses, their role in the management of acne vulgaris remains unproven and may be limited to specific phenotypes that overlap with autoinflammatory or HS-related conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40474034/"}

{"id": "19221635", "title": "Chronic pruritus: targets, mechanisms and future therapies.", "text": "Pruritus (itch) is an unpleasant sensation inducing the desire to scratch. Chronic pruritus (>6 weeks' duration) is a major and distressing symptom of many diseases of dermatological, systemic, neurological or psychogenic origin. Frequently, the underlying cause of pruritus cannot be identified and causal therapy is not possible. Furthermore, chronic pruritus is frequently refractory to conventional symptomatic therapies. Recent research has revealed new neuronal mechanisms in the skin and brain, suggesting novel therapeutic targets. The efficacy of the corresponding innovative therapies has been proven in recent studies and case series. For example, topical or systemic application of specific agonists such as cannabinoids or calcineurin inhibitors can influence neuroreceptors on sensory nerve fibers of the skin and suppress pruritus. Itch-selective neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord can be targeted to inhibit the transmission of pruritus to the somatosensory cortex. Anticonvulsants, antidepressants and micro-opioid receptor antagonists interfere with the sensation of pruritus in the central nervous system. Chronic pruritus of any origin leads to considerable psychosocial burden and impairs quality of life. Psychoeducational interventions, stress training, training in social competence and relaxation techniques are therefore important elements in the treatment of chronic pruritus. Increasing knowledge of the neurobiology of chronic pruritus offers new therapeutic strategies. Currently, several clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of new substances addressing neuroreceptors and cytokines in the skin and central nervous system. The present review aims to provide an overview of current neurophysiological and neurochemical therapeutic models in chronic pruritus.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19221635/"}

An independent panel of 45 clinical experts from Japan indicated their agreement to each statement using a 10-point Likert scale (Round 1; strong consensus, ≥70% of responses = 7-10 and median value ≥8). The steering committee reviewed Round 1 results and refined the statements for Round 2, as necessary. In Round 2, the panel indicated their agreement to each statement using a 3-point scale (strong consensus, ≥70% of responses and median value of 3) and were shown Round 1 responses before voting. Forty-five clinicians participated in Round 1 and 41 of those (91%) participated in Round 2. Consensus was achieved on the criteria of eligibility for systemic treatment among patients with limited skin involvement as disease involvement at special or difficult to treat areas, psoriasis-induced psychological distress, uncontrolled symptoms (e.g., scaling, bleeding, pruritus, insomnia) affecting their social life, psoriatic arthritis, or failure of topical therapy. Consensus on criteria for topical failure were persistent symptoms (e.g., itchiness, pain) and plaques, poor patient satisfaction with treatment, a need to increase medication quantity or application time after treatment with two topicals for 4 weeks; or if the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score of >3 or Physician Global Assessment Score of ≥2 after 8 weeks treatment.

We aimed to ultrasonographically monitor disease activity in patients with morphea treated with MTX, assessing its effectiveness using an Ultrasound Morphea Activity Score (US-MAS). A retrospective cohort of 22 patients was studied between July 2014 and July 2019. The morphea of each patient, treated with MTX, was confirmed by histology and all patients had at least two CDU examinations. The US-MAS is based on published ultrasound signs of disease activity validated by histology. A weight-adjusted average MTX dose (mg/kg/wk) was used to standardize dosage, weight, and time between CDU examinations. The difference in US-MAS between two CDU examinations was determined. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon and Fisher exact tests, the Spearman correlation coefficient, and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. To create two groups, we determined the median of the sample as the cut-off point for MTX dose (0.265 mg/kg/week). Significance was set at p≤0.05; Results: In all cases, CDU examinations showed subclinical signs of activity beyond the visible lesional borders, either in the same or adjacent corporal segments. A negative correlation was found between the change in US-MAS and MTX dose (Spearman coefficient, -0.45; p = 0.035). The group dosed at ≥0.265 mg/kg/wk showed a non-significant change in US-MAS (2-point decrease). No case became inactive.

{"id": "12113650", "title": "Topical use of dexpanthenol in skin disorders.", "text": "Pantothenic acid is essential to normal epithelial function. It is a component of coenzyme A, which serves as a cofactor for a variety of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are important in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins, gluconeogenesis, sterols, steroid hormones, and porphyrins. The topical use of dexpanthenol, the stable alcoholic analog of pantothenic acid, is based on good skin penetration and high local concentrations of dexpanthenol when administered in an adequate vehicle, such as water-in-oil emulsions. Topical dexpanthenol acts like a moisturizer, improving stratum corneum hydration, reducing transepidermal water loss and maintaining skin softness and elasticity. Activation of fibroblast proliferation, which is of relevance in wound healing, has been observed both in vitro and in vivo with dexpanthenol. Accelerated re-epithelization in wound healing, monitored by means of the transepidermal water loss as an indicator of the intact epidermal barrier function, has also been seen. Dexpanthenol has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect on experimental ultraviolet-induced erythema. Beneficial effects of dexpanthenol have been observed in patients who have undergone skin transplantation or scar treatment, or therapy for burn injuries and different dermatoses. The stimulation of epithelization, granulation and mitigation of itching were the most prominent effects of formulations containing dexpanthenol. In double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials, dexpanthenol was evaluated for its efficacy in improving wound healing. Epidermal wounds treated with dexpanthenol emulsion showed a reduction in erythema, and more elastic and solid tissue regeneration. Monitoring of transepidermal water loss showed a significant acceleration of epidermal regeneration as a result of dexpanthenol therapy, as compared with the vehicle. In an irritation model, pretreatment with dexpanthenol cream resulted in significantly less damage to the stratum corneum barrier, compared with no pretreatment. Adjuvant skin care with dexpanthenol considerably improved the symptoms of skin irritation, such as dryness of the skin, roughness, scaling, pruritus, erythema, erosion/fissures, over 3 to 4 weeks. Usually, the topical administration of dexpanthenol preparations is well tolerated, with minimal risk of skin irritancy or sensitization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12113650/"}

Its etiology is unknown, and currently there is no cure. Rosacea can be associated with severe symptoms, including transient erythema (flushing), nontransient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectases, leading to substantial discomfort and an unattractive appearance. This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study conducted over 12 weeks with a 4-week follow-up period evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of azelaic acid (AzA) foam in a 15% concentration compared to vehicle alone in patients with papulopustular rosacea (PPR). Primary efficacy variables assessed were investigator global assessment (IGA) dichotomized into success and failure, and nominal change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline to end of treatment. Results indicated that the new foam formulation of AzA is effective and well-tolerated in a population of patients with PPR.

In the law of private health insurance, a skin disease is defined as an anomalous condition of the skin requiring medical treatment that exists independently of the subjective judgement of the insured person and needs to be objectively confirmed by a medical evaluation. In contrast, in the law of the social health insurance, the Federal Court of Social Justice defines disease as irregular physical or mental condition, deviating from the perception of a healthy human being that requires medical treatment or leads to inability to work. Substantial bodily disfigurement may be regarded as an irregular physical condition. In the law of the statutory accident insurance, occupational skin diseases are defined under clause 5101 of the occupational disease regulation as serious or repeatedly relapsing skin diseases that have forced a person to refrain from any work activities causal for the development, the aggravation or the recurrence of the disease. The Federal Court of Social Justice interprets the term \"skin disease\" from the protective purpose of the law, i.e. the protection against the economic and health consequences of the exposure to harmful agents and a thereby forced change of profession.

Therefore, this literature review aimed to investigate the differences between oral and subcutaneous MTX described in the scientific literature in terms of intestinal absorption and bioavailability, efficacy, safety, patient satisfaction and quality of life, treatment adherence, and economic outlook. Thirty-two articles were included in the review, notably including evidence-based guidelines on the management of psoriasis, as well as randomized clinical trials and real-world studies. Only European guidelines recommend the use of subcutaneous MTX over oral MTX; hence, the use of subcutaneous MTX is reported almost exclusively in European countries. Despite the paucity and heterogeneity of the literature, findings from the review suggest that subcutaneous MTX may overcome some limitations of the oral route in terms of intestinal absorption, bioavailability, and safety. Moreover, subcutaneous MTX may provide higher efficacy with a faster, or even greater, response in psoriatic patients and better adherence to treatment. In conclusion, subcutaneous MTX tends to be advantageous with regard to psoriasis management, similar to other chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis; however, this comes with a higher cost.

In this study, we harness the power of machine learning classifiers to enhance diagnostic accuracy by predicting skin diseases based on histopathological features extracted from biopsy samples. We evaluated the performance of six widely used classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes. A thorough analysis of performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, was conducted to ascertain each model's effectiveness. Among these classifiers, the SGD Classifier stood out, achieving an exceptional accuracy of 99.09 % and an F1-score of 98.77 %, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in handling complex multi-class classification tasks. To further enhance model performance and interpretability, we employed advanced feature selection techniques, which identified the most relevant attributes influencing the predictions. Notably, features such as the Koebner phenomenon, erythema, and itching were consistently highlighted across multiple classifiers, underscoring their significance in the diagnostic process. This analysis not only emphasizes the critical role of feature selection in improving model efficiency but also facilitates a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms associated with skin diseases. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the application of machine learning in dermatology, paving the way for the development of reliable and automated diagnostic tools. Future work will aim to refine feature selection methodologies, expand the dataset to enhance generalization, and explore advanced deep learning techniques to further improve classification accuracy and clinical applicability. Ultimately, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the integration of machine learning in healthcare, with the potential to transform the landscape of dermatological diagnosis and patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40037169/"}

While atopic dermatitis treatments can be highly effective when used as directed, oftentimes patients do not respond as expected, raising concern for nonadherence versus nonresponse. This chapter aims to describe what is currently known about adherence in atopic dermatitis and to discuss strategies to improve adherence in order to improve treatment outcomes. Whether intentional or unintentional, nonadherence to treatment can limit patient outcomes of this disease for a variety of reasons. These include frustration with medication efficacy, inconvenience, and fear of side effects. Other factors include forgetfulness, financial burden of treatment, lack of trust in the physician, dislike of prescribed medication, or lack of understanding of disease or treatment. Several interventions have been studied with the aim of improving adherence in atopic dermatitis-such as educational workshops for patients and caregivers, earlier follow-up visits, and text messages reminders-however, these are often limited by sample size and power. Further research is needed to study both specific patterns of nonadherence in atopic dermatitis, as well as methods to improve them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38724793/"}

The key factors responsible for the pathophysiology of this disease are immunological disorders and defects in epidermal barrier properties. Pruritus, intense itching, psychological stress, deprived physical and mental performance, and sleep disturbance are the hallmark features of this dermatological disorder. Preventive interventions such as educational programs, avoidance of allergens, and exclusive care toward the skin could play a partial role in suppressing the symptoms. Based on the available clinical evidence, topical corticosteroids (TCs) are among the most commonly prescribed agents; however, these should be selected with care. In cases of steroid phobia, persistent adverse effects or chronic use, topical calcineurin inhibitors can be considered as a promising adjunct to TCs. Recent advances in the pharmacotherapeutic paradigm of atopic diseases exploring the therapeutic dominance of nanocarrier-mediated delivery is also discussed in this evidence-based review with regard to the treatment of AD. The present review summarizes the available clinical evidence, highlighting the current and emerging trends in the treatment of AD and providing evidence-based recommendations for the clinicians and health care professionals.

We identified 39 patients with ACH with a mean age of 54.4 years at onset, of whom 22 (56.4%) were female. A total of 115 systemic treatment courses were analyzed with methotrexate as the most common therapy (27.0%). Overall, effectiveness of systemic treatments was low (excellent response rate: 14.8%). Among non-biologics, excellent response was noted in 21.1% (4/19) of treatment courses with methotrexate, followed by acitretin (13.3%; 2/15).

{"id": "19614856", "title": "Scalp psoriasis: European consensus on grading and treatment algorithm.", "text": "The scalp is a common site of involvement of psoriasis and, for many patients, is a challenging aspect of their disease. This can be attributed not only to the scaling, itching and cosmetic embarrassment that go with scalp psoriasis, but also to the fact that the scalp skin is relatively inaccessible, making topical therapies difficult to apply. The proximity of sensitive facial skin can also limit the use of potentially irritating topical treatments. Nevertheless, the specific challenges of scalp psoriasis are often neglected by treatment guidelines. This paper summarizes the discussions that took place at an international conference of experts convened in Geneva, Switzerland, in March 2008. The objective of the meeting was to review the available treatments for scalp psoriasis in terms of efficacy, safety, convenience, and the implications for patient compliance with treatment. In addition, definitions of mild, moderate and severe scalp psoriasis were agreed. This paper presents a treatment algorithm that includes recommendations for patients in all three categories. It considers the role of potent topical corticosteroids, vitamin D3 derivatives, salicylic acid preparations, and photo- and radiotherapy, as well as systemic therapies, including newer biological agents, for patients with widespread psoriasis with scalp involvement. Data from clinical trials indicate that a potent topical corticosteroid in a short-contact formulation is the most appropriate treatment for most patients with scalp psoriasis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19614856/"}

While the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) has traditionally been used to assess disease severity and treatment response, achieving substantial improvement in QoL has become an increasingly important therapeutic goal. Recent advances in biologic therapies have enabled higher rates of PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses; however, PASI 75 is no longer considered sufficient for optimal patient outcomes. Calculating PASI improvement rates in daily practice remains challenging, shifting focus toward absolute PASI values as a practical indicator of disease control. In this study, we analyzed 235 psoriasis patients treated with biologics at Nagoya City University Hospital, evaluating 3526 data points collected over a maximum of 288 weeks. We found that PASI positively correlated with DLQI (r = 0.5696, p < 0.001), and that an absolute PASI score of ≤2.2 was associated with DLQI remission (AUC = 0.8140). Notably, 82.6% of patients achieving PASI 100 also achieved DLQI 0/1 status. However, 1.0% of patients with a PASI score of 0 still reported a DLQI ≥10, suggesting that factors beyond skin lesions, such as stigma or residual damage, may contribute to impaired QoL. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating absolute PASI values to guide treatment decisions and achieve DLQI remission. Additionally, the psychosocial burden of psoriasis must be addressed to ensure comprehensive care and sustained improvements in QoL.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40135780/"}

Thus, there is a huge need for locally applied, locally acting drugs for inflammatory skin diseases with better risk-benefit profiles compared to topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Drug repositioning is a complex process, but offers advantages, in particular for indications with lower revenues. In this viewpoint, the neuroendocrine system of the skin is described as an attractive drug target because it contributes significantly to neutralizing external noxious agents prior to inducing immune or vascular changes leading to the clinical signs of skin inflammation, for example, itch and erythema. In addition, epidermis and dermis are accessible for topically applied products which may act locally without pharmacodynamically relevant systemic exposure limiting adverse events. Moreover, since numerous drugs have been evaluated for various CNS diseases, some failed and some approved, this resource should be exploited for repurposing as anti-inflammatory drugs for topical application, for example, cannabidiol, fingolimod or asimadoline.

Critical to proper management are correct diagnosis, identification and treatment of any underlying disorder, and the appropriate choice of topical and systemic therapy.

Although there is no single successful treatment for PG, certain type of PG lesions are recognized to respond more readily to accepted therapies than others. Local treatment may be sufficient for mild disease, while systemic immunosuppressive therapy is necessary for severe cases. The treatments with the best clinical evidence are oral or pulse intravenous corticosteroids, and cyclosporine. Surgical therapy is useful in selected cases in conjunction with immunosuppression. Wound stabilization is obtained only through control of the systemic and local inflammatory process. Emerging therapies include use of platelet-derived growth factor and cell culture grafts when re-epithelialization is slow, and the TNF-alpha blocking agent infliximab for refractory disease. Despite advances in therapy, the long-term outcome for patients with PG remains unpredictable, because relapses are common.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16372799/"}

The survey was designed to capture the details of precautions taken by dermatologists to prevent pregnancy among isotretinoin users. Ultimately, 134 dermatologists completed the questionnaire (84% response rate). Their mean age was 39 ± 9.5 years. A total of 82 were female (65%). The median number of FCBP for whom isotretinoin was prescribed by each dermatologist during the previous 12 months was two (range from 0 to 30). Of the 792 total FCBP, seven were reported to have become pregnant (incidence rate of 8.8/1000) while on isotretinoin. Out of those seven, three women terminated the pregnancy (elective abortions: 42.7%). The majority of the dermatologists (79%) always obtained written consent and discussed teratogenic risks (98%); 44% provided written information about potential isotretinoin teratogenicity, and 30% offered printed information on contraception. Survey results also revealed that 62% recommended double contraception for FCBP, 60% always recommended pregnancy testing prior to therapy, but only 16% requested monthly pregnancy tests. In general, 62.4% avoided isotretinoin prescription to FCBP, which was independent of dermatologists' gender, years of experience, or having a previous incident of isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy.

This comprehensive review explores the intricate interplay between psoriasis and cardiovascular system, delving into genetic links, immune pathways, and adipose tissue dysfunction beyond conventional CVD risk factors. The pathophysiological connections unveil unique signatures, distinct from other inflammatory skin conditions, in particular psoriasis-specific genetic polymorphisms in IL-23 and TNF-α have consistently been linked to CVD. The review navigates the complex landscape of psoriasis treatments, addressing challenges and future directions in particular relevance to CVDs in psoriasis. Therapeutic interventions, including TNF inhibitors (TNFi), present promise in reducing cardiovascular risks, and methotrexate could constitute a favourable choice. Conversely, the relationship between IL-12/23 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk remains uncertain, while recent evidence indicates that Janus kinase inhibitors may not carry CVD risks. Emerging evidence supports the safety and efficacy of IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors in patients with CVDs, hinting at evolving therapeutic paradigms. Lifestyle modifications, statins, and emerging therapies offer preventive strategies. Dedicated screening guidelines for CVD risk assessment in psoriasis are however lacking. Further, the impact of different disease phenotypes and treatment hierarchies in cardiovascular outcomes remains elusive, demanding ongoing research at the intersection of dermatology, rheumatology, and cardiology. In conclusion, unraveling the intricate connections between psoriasis and CVD provides a foundation for a holistic approach to patient care.

However, adherence to treatment in dermatology has been little studied. This article reviews recent publications in the field. These are dominated by questionnaire-based studies, which tend to over-estimate adherence. Reduced adherence to dermatological treatment is noted in 34-45% of patients. It is likely that the percentage of patients who practice truly optimal treatment in their daily life is even lower considering the variable practice of self-treatment. Self-reported psychiatric morbidity contributes to poor adherence to dermatological treatment, while a well-functioning doctor-patient interaction is a major determinant of good adherence, as is patient satisfaction. In conclusion, adherence to dermatological treatment is unsatisfactory and there is a need for intervention and change in clinical routines. The therapeutic and economic benefits may be considerable. The immediate challenge is to stimulate a change in patient behaviour and improve self-treatment at home.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16710573/"}

The primary outcome was the TOA defined as the time until a 25% reduction in the mean number of inflammatory lesions had been achieved. A systematic literature search in Medline and Embase was carried out. Clinical trials that evaluated head-to-head comparisons of treatments in patients suffering from mild-to-moderate papulopustular acne were included. Abstract and full-text screening and data extraction were done independently by two investigators. With respect to inflammatory lesions, different concentrations of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or adapalene did not seem to influence the TOA. BPO seemed to act more quickly than isotretinoin and tretinoin. Adapalene showed a shorter TOA than isotretinoin. Conflicting results were seen when comparing adapalene with tretinoin, with a tendency for adapalene to be faster. Clindamycin/BPO seemed to act more quickly than adapalene. Inconsistent results were seen for the comparison of clindamycin/BPO and BPO alone with a slight indication of a shorter TOA for clindamycin/BPO. Adapalene/BPO and clindamycin/BPO showed comparable TOA. When interpreting the data, the different study designs and the limited study quality need to be taken into account.

Calcipotriol ointment (50 micrograms/g) and placebo (vehicle of calcipotriol ointment) were applied to all patients twice daily for up to 12 weeks. The patients were allowed to use up to 120 g of calcipotriol ointment per week. At the end of the treatment regimen, calcipotriol ointment had an effect on the improvement of the ichthyoses, although to a variable degree. No therapeutic effect was detected in palmoplantar keratoderma or keratosis pilaris. Eight of 12 patients with Darier's disease had to be withdrawn because of skin irritation or a worsening of the disease. Skin irritation occurred in 18 cases (26%) only on the calcipotriol-treated side, and in one case (1%) only on the placebo-treated side. Nine cases (13%) had irritation on both sides.

Ciclosporin remains one of the most effective and rapidly acting treatments currently available for psoriasis. Virtually all the diverse manifestations of this disease can respond. The main side effects are nephrotoxicity and hypertension. There is considerable variation between individuals in susceptibility to these so careful monitoring is required. Ciclosporin should be used in single or intermittent short courses for all except the most severe cases as this is safer than continuous treatment. The rate of improvement depends very much on the dose, which ranges from 2 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. Ciclosporin can be combined with any topical treatment and a useful dose-sparing effect can be achieved in this way if patients are compliant. In severe cases ciclosporin is often used in combination with other systemic antipsoriatic drugs in order to spare the dose of each agent and reduce toxicity.

Eight studies pertain to the role of the cutaneous microbiome in acne, identifying C. acnes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis as key contributors through overproliferation, commensalism, or dysbiosis. Eleven studies discuss current acne treatments, including doxycycline (1), topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) (4), isotretinoin (2), sulfacetamide-sulfur (SSA) (2) and aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) (2), identified as modulating the cutaneous microbiome as a mechanism of efficacy in acne treatment. Seven studies discuss new treatments with topical probiotics, plant derivatives, and protein derivatives, which contribute to acne clearance via modulation of dysbiosis, inflammatory markers and diversity indexes. A meta-analysis of the effects of existing therapeutics on the cutaneous microbiome identified benzoyl peroxide as the only treatment to facilitate significant change in diversity. Despite the heterogeneity of study types and microbiome classifications limiting the analysis, this review underscores the complexity of microbial involvement in acne pathogenesis. It delineates the effects of acne therapeutics on microbial diversity, abundance, and composition, emphasizing the necessity for personalized approaches in acne management based on microbiome modulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39269130/"}
{"id": "36970858", "title": "An update on therapeutic options for palmoplantar pustulosis: a narrative review and expert recommendations.", "text": "Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease belonging to the localized form of pustular psoriasis. It is characterized by sterile pustule formation in palms and soles and a recurrent disease course. Although we have many treatments for PPP, there is no authoritative guidance. A thorough search of PubMed was conducted to identify studies in PPP from 1973 onwards, with additional references to specific articles. Any treatment methods were outcomes of interest, including topical treatment, systemic treatment, biologics, other targeted treatments, phototherapy, and tonsillectomy. Topical corticosteroids are suggested as first-line therapy. Oral acitretin has become the most applied systemic retinoid recommended in PPP without joint involvement. For patients with arthritis, immunosuppressants like cyclosporin A and methotrexate are more recommended. UVA1, NB-UVB, and 308-nm excimer laser are effective phototherapy options. The combinations of topical or systemic agents and phototherapy may enhance the efficacy, particularly in recalcitrant cases. Secukinumab, ustekinumab, and apremilast are the most investigated targeted therapies. However, heterogeneous reported outcomes in clinical trials provided low-to-moderate quality evidence of their efficacy. Future studies are required to address these evidence gaps. We suggest managing PPP based on the acute phase, maintenance phase, and comorbidities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36970858/"}
{"id": "11806166", "title": "Recent advances in dermatology.", "text": "Novel therapies for dermatologic diseases are now widely available to the clinician. The topical immune modulators tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are likely to change the way in which inflammatory dermatoses are treated. Antiviral and antitumor effects of imiquimod, another immune-response modifier, are being studied to determine the ways in which it may affect the treatment of cutaneous viral infections and skin cancers. New topical treatments for onychomycosis and the current lack of effective treatments for nondermatophyte onychomycosis indicate the need for more effective treatment for this common disease. Exciting developments in skin substitutes and growth factors for acute and chronic wound care hold much promise for the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11806166/"}
{"id": "28259230", "title": "Vulvovaginal Issues in Mature Women.", "text": "Mature women often present with symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy and vulvar dermatoses, causing noncoital pain, dyspareunia, and sexual changes. Diagnosis of these conditions can be challenging, and long-term management is required to decrease morbidity and enhance quality of life. Vaginal estrogen therapies remain safe and effective for treating symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy. A vulvar biopsy is easy to perform and generally well tolerated when indicated for the diagnosis of lichen simplex chronicus, lichen sclerosus, and lichen planus. Therapy with moderate- to high-potency corticosteroids is effective for these frequently debilitating conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28259230/"}
{"id": "31241020", "title": "Psoralen Derivatives: Recent Advances of Synthetic Strategy and Pharmacological Properties.", "text": "Psoralen or furocoumarin is a linear three ring heterocyclic compound. Psoralens are planar, tricyclic compounds, consisting of a furan ring fused to a coumarin moiety. Psoralen has been known for a wide spectrum of biological activities, spanning from cytotoxic, photosensitizing, insecticidal, antibacterial to antifungal effect. Thus, several structural changes were introduced to explore the role of specific positions with respect to the biological activity. Convenient approaches utilized for the synthesis of psoralen skeleton can be categorized into two parts: (i) the preparation of the tricyclic ring system from resorcinol, (ii) the exocyclic modification of the intact ring system. Furthermore, although psoralens have been used in diverse ways, we mainly focus in this work on their clinical utility for the treatment of psioraisis, vitiligo and skin-related disorder.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241020/"}

To confirm the lower irritation potential of adapalene gel 0.1% compared to tretinoin gel 0.025% among volunteers of various ethnic origins and to explore the difference in the irritant susceptibility among ethnic groups. The study was a single-centre, randomized, investigator-masked and intra-individual comparison. Healthy volunteers applied adapalene and tretinoin daily to the face for 21 days and to the forearms for 4 days, and were then evaluated for the level of irritation. The irritation potential of adapalene gel 0.1% was significantly lower than that of tretinoin gel 0.025% in all tolerability assessments, irrespective of the volunteers' ethnic origins. The between-treatment differences were similar among various ethnic groups. Statistically significant but small inter-ethnicity differences were observed in the evaluation of facial signs, with Caucasians being less susceptible than Chinese, Asian Indians and Malays. Adapalene gel 0.1% was significantly better tolerated than tretinoin gel 0.025% among various ethnic groups. The patients' ethnic origins had no impact on the difference between adapalene and tretinoin treatments in terms of tolerability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19634042/"}
{"id": "16822381", "title": "The ocular manifestations of atopic dermatitis and rosacea.", "text": "Atopic dermatitis and rosacea are chronic diseases that have both dermatologic and ocular manifestations. The occurrence of ocular disease is often proportionately higher than that of dermatologic disease. Even if the skin abnormalities appear well controlled, these patients require ophthalmic evaluation as well. Optimal management usually requires a team approach that includes internists, dermatologists, and ophthalmologists. Both disorders are characterized by acute exacerbations and require maintenance therapy for control. Exacerbations need aggressive treatment to limit ocular signs and symptoms and to reduce ocular inflammation that can lead to permanent visual loss. Topical corticosteroid use, although at times needed, should be minimized for both disorders. Future research will continue to emphasize the use of steroid-sparing and immune-modulating agents that have the potential to provide long-lasting anti-inflammatory control with a more favorable side-effect profile.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16822381/"}
