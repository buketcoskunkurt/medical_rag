The regulation of the skin barrier depends on a multitude of molecular and immunological signaling pathways. By examining the regulation of a healthy skin barrier, including maintenance of the acid mantle and appropriate levels of ceramides, dermatologists can better formulate solutions to address issues that are related to a disrupted skin barrier. Conversely, by understanding specific skin barrier disruptions that are associated with specific conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, the development of new compounds could target signaling pathways to provide more effective relief for patients. We aim to review key factors mediating skin barrier regulation and inflammation, including skin acidity, interleukins, nuclear factor kappa B, and sirtuin 3.

The objective of this study was to develop a dermatology digital tool kit designed to describe, evaluate, recognize, and manage (DERM) common dermatological conditions in primary care residency education and to evaluate potential improvement in clinical confidence. A total of 14 family medicine (FM) and 33 internal medicine (IM) residents were given the DERM tool kit to complete over 7 weeks. Effects on residents' self-reported comfort with dermatology and resources used were measured by voluntary anonymous surveys distributed before and after DERM completion. A response rate of 100% (14/14) for FM residents and 52% (17/33) for IM residents was achieved. The majority of residents (61%) recalled minimal dermatology education-less than 2 weeks-in medical school and 71% agreed that there is not enough dermatology in their residency curriculum. A statistically significant increase in resident comfort with describing (P=0.002), recognizing and diagnosing (P&lt;0.001), and managing (P=0.001) dermatologic conditions was observed postcompletion. Residents reported they would recommend this tool to other primary care residents.

AST included dupilumab and upadacitinib. Variables of interest gathered at enrollment included demographics, vIGA and Body Surface Area (BSA), patient-reported outcomes, and all recorded therapeutics. Of 3,076 patients, 436 qualified for inclusion, 52 were AST-treated adolescents and 141 AST-treated adults. Both groups had increased likelihood of AST initiation if they had private insurance and higher BSA, vIGAxBSA, or Patient-Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis scores. Adults were more likely to start AST based on minority/ethnicity, more severe vIGA, higher patient-reported outcomes, or if treated at a community clinic. Substantial numbers of adolescent and adult patients (47 and 58%, respectively) with severe disease were AST-naïve. Disease severity and patient access to AST are major factors driving AST initiation. However, some patients are undertreated.

The method, called the determinants of dermal exposure ranking method (DERM), is a combination of checklists and expert rating assessment. Thus, determinants are listed in a form, which is used to check their presence and to assess them using a simple algorithm based on two factors, the type of transport process (T value) and the area of body surface exposed (A value). In addition, the type of clothing worn during applications is included as a protection factor. We applied the DERM to real pesticide applications, characterizing dermal exposure and comparing DERM estimates with earlier developed semiquantitative visual scores based on fluorescent tracer, the total visual score (TVS) and contaminated body area (CBA). DERM showed a very good level of agreement with both the TVS (r = 0.69; P = 0.000) and the CBA (r = 0.67; P = 0.000). DERM allowed identification of the determinants that had the highest effect on exposure and the farmers with the highest exposure. In conclusion, DERM provided information on the determinants responsible for dermal exposure in a group of subsistence farmers. This can be useful to design monitoring and preventive programs, define priorities for intervention and prioritize and select most adequate measurement strategies. DERM promises to be a low-cost easy-to-use method to assess dermal exposure to pesticides in developing country conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18611914/"}

However, there is a severe lack of dermatologists, particularly in rural Chinese areas. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence (AI) tools can assist in diagnosing skin disorders from images, the database for the Chinese population is limited. This study aims to establish a database for AI based on the Chinese population and presents an initial study on six common skin diseases. Each image was captured with either a digital camera or a smartphone, verified by at least three experienced dermatologists and corresponding pathology information, and finally added to the Xiangya-Derm database. Based on this database, we conducted AI-assisted classification research on six common skin diseases and then proposed a network called Xy-SkinNet. Xy-SkinNet applies a two-step strategy to identify skin diseases. First, given an input image, we segmented the regions of the skin lesion. Second, we introduced an information fusion block to combine the output of all segmented regions. We compared the performance with 31 dermatologists of varied experiences. Xiangya-Derm, as a new database that consists of over 150,000 clinical images of 571 different skin diseases in the Chinese population, is the largest and most diverse dermatological data set of the Chinese population. The AI-based six-category classification achieved a top 3 accuracy of 84.77%, which exceeded the average accuracy of dermatologists (78.15%). Xiangya-Derm, the largest database for the Chinese population, was created. The classification of six common skin conditions was conducted based on Xiangya-Derm to lay a foundation for product research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34546174/"}

In the following text, the word \"tattooing\" refers to body tattooing, permanent makeup (PMU), microblading, and medical micropigmentation. The major consumer risks related to unsafe tattoo and PMU equipment are reconsidered. Such health risks mainly include the danger of non-sterile needles or needle cartridges, cross contamination of equipment and lack of biocompatibility. Even though state-of-the-art tattoo equipment will support the tattooist to reduce such health risks, also today unsafe equipment still might affect consumer health due to malpractice advertising and fraudulent CE certificates by questionable manufacturers and suppliers not being transparent to parlors and artists. For artists, it is therefore of growing importance to understand how to distinguish well-made safe tattoo equipment from fraudulent unsafe products.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37263215/"}

Changes in scheduling would allow patients with suspicious skin lesions access to more immediate care. The objective was to introduce a method for decreasing dermatology appointment wait times to allow patients with a high-risk skin lesion to be seen in a more efficient manner. A telephone screening method was developed to allow for the most suspicious lesions to be seen within 72 hours if the patient wished to do so; appointment time slots were left open in physician schedules to accommodate these patients; and wait time, procedure, and treatment data were collected and compared against national wait time data. A total of 233 patients were seen during this study. A total of 146 of these patients were diagnosed with a cancerous or precancerous lesion. This was 63% of the total study population. The mean wait time in actual working days was 7.44 for this same period. This program substantially decreased patient anxiety, increased patient satisfaction, increased public relations for the practice, and increased public awareness of skin cancer. The Derm Access strategy can be implemented in any practice to reduce wait times for suspicious skin lesions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17199657/"}

To compare the diagnostic performance of the standard method of skin biopsy processing with the practice of EVD with DD. This retrospective study compares the diagnostic performance in 6526 skin biopsy specimens examined from 2008 to 2010 with a standard method of processing with 8584 biopsy specimens examined in 2015 with EVD and DD. Data were analyzed from January 1 to March 31, 2016. A total of 15 110 skin biopsy specimens were included. The biopsy specimens from 2008 to 2010 were processed in a hospital-based general pathology laboratory; the biopsy specimens from 2015 were processed in a private dermatopathology laboratory. Biopsy specimens from both periods were diagnosed by the same dermatopathologist. The primary outcome measures were clinicopathological characteristics, usefulness of EVD with DD, and turnaround times (TATs). Use of EVD with DD increased the detection of positive section margins in nonmelanoma skin cancer from 8.4% to 12.8%. The most significant increase was seen in Bowen disease, invasive squamous cell carcinoma, and a superficial type of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). With EVD and DD, a specific clinicopathologic diagnosis was made in 27.7% of nevi compared with only 10.3% using the standard method. The incidence of moderately and severely dysplastic nevi increased from 1.0% to 7.2% and from 0.6% to 1.4%, respectively. The detection of ulceration in melanomas with thicker than 1 mm increased from 24.0% to 31.3%. The number of nevi-associated melanomas increased from 15.5% to 33.3%. The number of collision lesions from 0.07% to 1.07%. The TAT for nevi decreased from 2 days to 1 day, for melanomas from 5 days to 2 days, and for BCC from 2 days to 1 day. Ex vivo dermoscopy and DD with adapted sectioning in a dermatopathology setting allows a more accurate and less time consuming histopathologic diagnosis of skin tumors. These findings suggest that pathologists involved in skin tumor evaluation should be encouraged to learn dermoscopy and replace random transverse cutting with lesion-specific and DD-guided cutting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28030717/"}

Safer and more effective treatments are needed. In this study, Dibenzolium (DIB), a potent NADPH oxidase inhibitor, was evaluated for its anti-tumor effects. KK-47 (non-invasive), T24 and 5637 (invasive) cells were used in experiments. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and wound healing assays and western blotting were conducted. In addition, DIB was intratumorally administered to mice bearing KK-47, T24 and 5637 tumors, and tumor size and weight were observed over time. After removing tumors, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was conducted. Cell proliferation was significantly suppressed in all cell lines, and apoptotic cells increased in the KK-47 and T24 cell lines after DIB. Wound healing was suppressed in all cell lines by DIB. In KK-47 and T24, DIB increased the protein expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. In vivo, DIB safely suppressed tumor growth in all cell lines-bearing mice. Cleaved-Caspase-3 and E-cadherin expression increased in KK-47 and T24 tumors after DIB. In conclusion, DIB inhibited tumor growth by inducing apoptosis through the Caspase-3 pathway and reduced migration and invasion by suppressing epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in bladder cancer similarly shown as our previous study of prostate cancer.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39462108/"}

Accordingly, human whole blood (n = 5) was anticoagulated with heparin, treated with different wound dressings and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Different parameters for coagulation and hemocompatibility were evaluated before and after incubation. Consequently, Jelonet, Xenoderm, and Matriderm showed higher TAT-III concentrations, Jelonet, Xenoderm, EZ Derm, and Matriderm were higher β-thromboglobulin; EZ Derm and Burntec showed higher SC5b-9 concentrations after incubation with whole blood. Our ex vivo study provided initial insights into the hemocompatibility and immunogenicity of different burn wound dressings.

Time to healing was 8.1 days with alginate and 11.3 days with porcine xenograft (P less than 0.001). Quality of healed skin was consistently good with the alginate, and better than under the xenograft in 95 per cent of patients (P less than 0.001). Hypertrophic scarring was not observed under alginate dressings but occurred in 25 per cent of xenograft-dressed sites (P less than 0.01).

Historically, keratoacanthomas were thought to originate on hair-bearing skin or sun-exposed surfaces. However, recent reports demonstrate that they can occur on the mucous membranes, subungual regions, and palms and soles. We report a 74-year-old man who developed a KA on the left palmar surface after minor trauma, for which he underwent Mohs' micrographic surgery. A literature review for the terms: keratoacanthoma, palm, palmar, volar, plantar, and sole resulted in only four reported cases of solitary or giant KA of the palms and soles; excluding our patient, all of the cases occurred on the plantar foot. A number of reports describe palmar KA in the context of multiple lesions occurring simultaneously. However, to our knowledge, our patient represents the first reported case of a solitary palmar KA in the literature. The features of follicular and non-follicular keratoacanthomas (KAs) and their association with trauma are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29770284/"}

Melanoma cells have a distinct repertoire of mutations from other cancers, a high plasticity and degree of mimicry toward vascular phenotype, stemness markers, versatility in evading and suppress host immune control. They exert a significant influence on immune, endothelial and various stromal cells which form tumor microenvironment. The metastatic stage, the leading cause of mortality in this neoplasm, is the outcome of a complex, still poorly understood, cross-talk between tumor and other cell phenotypes. There is accumulating evidence that Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is emblematic for advanced melanomas. This work aimed to present an updated status of IL-8 in melanoma tumor cellular complexity, through a comprehensive analysis including data from other chemokines and neoplasms. The multiple processes and mechanisms surveyed here demonstrate that IL-8 operates following orchestrated programs within signaling webs in melanoma, stromal and vascular cells. Importantly, the yet unknown molecularity regulating IL-8 impact on cells of the immune system could be exploited to overturn tumor fate. The molecular and cellular targets of IL-8 should be brought into the attention of even more intense scientific exploration and valorization in the therapeutical management of melanoma.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35011682/"}

A total of 116 of 153 patients presented with at least one irAE (75.8%). The most frequent irAEs were dermatological (derm irAEs, 50%), asthenia (38%), and gastrointestinal (29%). Most irAEs appeared within the first 90 days, while 11.2% appeared after discontinuation of the therapy. Mild grade 1−2 derm irAEs tended to appear within the first 2 months of therapy with a median time of 65.5 days (IQR 26-139.25), while grade 3−4 derm irAEs appeared later (median 114 days; IQR 69-218) and could be detected at any time during therapy.

{"id": "20424648", "title": "The mismeasure of dermal absorption.", "text": "The results of dermal absorption experiments are routinely and often exclusively reported in terms of fractional absorption. However, fractional absorption is not generally independent of skin loading conditions. As a consequence, experimental outcomes are commonly misinterpreted. This can lead in turn to poor estimation of exposures under field conditions and inadequate threat assessment. To aid interpretation of dermal absorption-related phenomena, a dimensionless group representing the ratio of mass delivery to plausible absorptive flux under experimental or environmental conditions is proposed. High values of the dimensionless dermal number (N(DERM)) connote surplus supply (i.e., flux-limited) conditions. Under such conditions, fractional absorption will generally depend on load and should not be assumed transferable to other conditions. At low values of N(DERM), dermal absorption will be delivery-limited. Under those conditions, high fractional absorption is feasible barring maldistribution or depletion due to volatilization, washing, mechanical abrasion or other means. Similar logic also applies to skin sampling and dermal toxicity testing. Skin surface sampling at low N(DERM) is unlikely to provide an appropriate measure of potential dermal dose due to depletion, whereas dermal toxicity testing at high N(DERM) is unlikely to show dose dependence due to saturation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20424648/"}

The objective of this study was to compare the performance of an artificial intelligence model trained on a standard adult-predominant dermoscopic dataset before and after the addition of additional pediatric training images. The performances were compared using held-out adult and pediatric test sets of images. We trained two models: one (model A) on an adult-predominant dataset (37,662 images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration) and the other (model A+P) on an additional 1,536 pediatric images. We compared performance between the two models on adult and pediatric held-out test images separately using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We then used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps and background skin masking to understand the contributions of the lesion versus background skin to algorithm decision making. Adding images from a pediatric population with different epidemiological and visual patterns to current reference standard datasets improved algorithm performance on pediatric images without diminishing performance on adult images. This suggests a way that dermatologic artificial intelligence models can be made more generalizable. The presence of background skin was important to the pediatric-specific improvement seen between models.

Specialist dermatology services are concentrated in the capital cities and larger urban centers on the coast. This has meant access to these services for Australians in rural and remote areas has been limited to those able to travel the often long distances to their nearest dermatologist. Due to a considerable shortage of dermatologists, waiting times to see one are more than six months. The challenge was to provide a dermatology service that overcame these twin obstacles of distance and demand. Telecommunication infrastructure in Australia is good and most towns have at least one general practitioner. More than 75% of all general practices are equipped with computers and have broadband internet access.Dermatology is a specialty with few life threatening disorders. However short delays in diagnosis and management of a skin condition rarely have any serious impact on a patient's long-term health. At the same time many skin problems are distressing, and difficult to diagnose and treat. Many skin conditions last for considerable periods of time and patients need ongoing care. Due to the highly visual nature of the specialty, most skin conditions can be diagnosed from an image especially if there is some history available. This often requires a trained specialist. Paradoxically, any needed investigations such as skin biopsy or blood tests can be performed by any qualified doctor. Dermatological treatments can be instituted and monitored by these same practitioners without any specialist training. These factors make tele-medicine an ideal solution to the problems of isolation from and excess demand for specialist dermatological services. In 2004 the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) in a joint initiative with Queensland Divisions of General Practice (QDGP) set up Tele-Derm with funding from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing under the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program (MSOAP).Tele-Derm was set up as an online consultation service combined with a central portal for online dermatology education, resources, links, discussions and professional development activities. It was set up with the belief that a teledermatolgy service must offer ongoing education as well as a specific case consultation service. If the remote doctor does not have the skills to perform required procedures such as biopsy and excision then the patient will still need to travel. The common misconception about tele-dermatology is that this form of consultation is not as good as a face-to-face one with a dermatologist. But, in the majority of cases it is [1]. In any event Tele-Derm is not trying to provide a service that is necessarily better then the traditional mode of delivery. It wishes to provide a service where none currently exists. To this end, Tele-Derm provides teleconsultation and online education in dermatology to doctors Australia wide.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18305334/"}

Such data have important implications for the design of gene therapy approaches for inherited skin diseases. Reversal of the phenotype depends on three elements: the number of cells involved; the degree of gene reversal; and the specific timing of the reversion. If reversion occurs in somatic cells, revertant mosaicism may occur. This is the situation in which a patient's skin is generally affected by the genodermatosis, but islands of normal skin stand out. These reflect the presence of revertant cells that are sufficient to restore a normal local skin phenotype. Reversion of the original mutation may also be partial, in which case the phenotype may display no, or only limited, improvement. Nevertheless, the phenotype may ameliorate with age if the reverted cells preferentially expand in time or if the time of onset of reversion is after birth. In essence, the complexities of naturally occurring rescue processes are important to understand because the inherent mechanisms may provide clues and insight into optimal therapeutic gene manipulation, and the possibility of mimicking nature in the management of patients with diverse genodermatoses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14616831/"}

Although both high and low efficacy agonists produce antinociception, low efficacy agonists such as morphine produce limited MOPr internalization suggesting that MOPr internalization and signaling leading to antinociception are independent. This hypothesis was tested in awake, behaving rats using DERM-A594, a fluorescently labeled dermorphin analog, and internalization blockers. Microinjection of DERM-A594 into the vlPAG produced both antinociception and internalization of DERM-A594. Administration of the irreversible opioid receptor antagonist beta-chlornaltrexamine (beta-CNA) prior to DERM-A594 microinjection reduced both the antinociceptive effect and the number of DERM-A594 labeled cells demonstrating that both effects are opioid receptor-mediated. Pretreatment with the internalization blockers dynamin dominant-negative inhibitory peptide (dynamin-DN) and concanavalinA (ConA) attenuated both DERM-A594 internalization and antinociception. Microinjection of dynamin-DN and ConA also decreased the antinociceptive potency of the unlabeled opioid agonist dermorphin when microinjected into the vlPAG as demonstrated by rightward shifts in the dose-response curves. In contrast, administration of dynamin-DN had no effect on the antinociceptive effect of microinjecting the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline into the vlPAG. The finding that dermorphin-induced antinociception is attenuated by blocking receptor internalization indicates that key parts of opioid receptor-mediated signaling depend on internalization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20394808/"}

The aim of this article is to summarize the novel knowledge about the use of electroporation for antitumor treatments and to present a new application of electrochemotherapy with a well-known plant derived antitumor drug betulinic acid. For the review we have searched the databases of scientific and medical research to collect the available publications about the use of electrochemotherapy in the treatment of various types of cancer. By the utilization of the available knowledge, we investigated the effect of electroporation on the penetration of a topically applied betulinic acid formulation into the skin by ex vivo Raman spectroscopy on hairless mouse skin. Raman measurements have demonstrated that the penetration depth of betulinic acid can be remarkably ameliorated by the use of electroporation, so this protocol can be a possibility for the treatment of deeper localized cancer nodules. Furthermore, it proved the influence of various treatment times, since they caused different spatial distributions of the drug in the skin. The review demonstrates that electrochemotherapy is a promising tool to treat different kinds of tumors with high efficiency and with only a few moderate adverse effects. Moreover, it presents a non-invasive method to enhance the penetration of antitumor agents, which can offer novel prospects for antitumor therapies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29141562/"}

To test the hypothesis that this model of AT-Derm is driven by dysregulated Tie2-signalling, we have bred AT-Derm transgenic (TG) animals with TG-animals engineered to overexpress Angiopoietin-1 or -2, the cognate Tie2 ligands. These two ligands act to antagonize one another in a context-dependent manner. To further evaluate the role of Ang1-driven-Tie2 signalling, we examined the ability of Vasculotide, an Ang1-mimetic, to modulate the AT-Derm phenotype. AT-Derm+Ang2 animals exhibited an accentuated phenotype, whereas AT-Derm+Ang1 presented with a markedly reduced skin disease, similarly VT-treated AT-Derm animals present with a clear decrease in the skin phenotype. Moreover, a decrease in several important inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in the number of eosinophils was noted in VT-treated animals. Bone marrow differentiation in the presence of VT produced fewer CFU-G colonies, further supporting a role for Tie2-signalling in eosinophil development. Importantly, we demonstrate activation of Tie2, the VT-target, in lung tissue from naïve animals treated with increasing amounts of VT. The AT-Derm phenotype in these animals is driven through dysregulation of Tie2 receptor signalling and is augmented by supplemental Ang2-dependent stimulation. Overexpression of Ang1 or treatment with VT produced a similar amelioration of the phenotype supporting the contention that VT and Ang1 have a similar mechanism of action on the Tie2 receptor and can both counteract the signalling driven by Ang2. Our results also support a possible role for Tie2-signalling in the development of eosinophilic diseases and that activation of Tie2 may directly or indirectly modulate the differentiation of eosinophils, which express Tie2. In summary, these data support the hypothesis that this AT-Derm mouse model is driven by dysregulation of the Tie2 signalling pathway and increased Ang2 levels can aggravate it, whereas it can be reversed by either Ang1-overexpression or VT treatment. Moreover, our data supports the contention that VT acts as an Angiopoietin-1 mimetic and may provide a novel entry point for Tie2-agonist-based therapies for atopic diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27236199/"}

This approach enables treating to a desired tissue temperature and depth to provide a safe, effective, reproducible, and durable treatment of acne. We designed and built a 1726 nm laser system with a 40 W maximum power output, a highly controlled air-cooling device, and a thermal camera in the handpiece, which permits real-time temperature monitoring of the epidermis. IRB-approved safety and efficacy trials demonstrated SG damage at depth, resulting in safe, efficacious, and durable clinical outcomes. Bioheat transfer and light transport modeling confirmed that the pulsing protocols could produce therapeutic temperatures at various SG depths, while protecting the epidermis and dermis with bulk air-cooling. Similarly, we employed clinical observations and photothermal modeling to identify pain mitigation opportunities while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Biopsies were subsequently taken for histological evaluation. Clinical and histological data, confirmed with modeling, demonstrated that multi-pulse laser delivery with bulk air-cooling selectively increased SG temperature compared to surrounding dermis and at depths unachievable by a single pulse. Subjects showed an average 71% ILC reduction at 3 months posttreatment. We identified two different pulsing protocols with similar selective photothermolysis (SP) of the SG with very different pain responses. Thus, changing the pulsing protocols allowed for pain mitigation and eliminated the need for injectable anesthetic. Histology confirmed the selective damaging of the SG at depth and the preservation of the surrounding dermis and the epidermis. The multi-pulse 1726 nm laser with bulk air-cooling, thermal monitoring, treat-to-temperature (and depth) control, and a unique pulsing protocol, is capable of selectively damaging SGs at depth without damage to the surrounding dermis or the epidermis. The system offers two different protocols that were developed with different levels of discomfort allowing for two different methods for pain mitigation (injectable vs. topical anesthesia).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39780333/"}

The way that the condition affects sleep has not yet been fully elucidated; it is clear that the symptoms of the disease such as pruritus and scratching can affect sleep but other factors, such as changes in the immunological system related to the disease can also have an effect. We argue that this relationship may be bi-directional, with changes to the skin barrier (barrier dysfunction, alterations in its microbiome and oxidative stress) and immunological function caused by the condition impairing sleep and leading to imbalanced inflammatory pathways that exacerbate AD and other associated conditions such as impetigo.

Selective ablation of mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-expressing neurons in the RVM using saporin conjugated to the MOR agonist dermorphin-saporin (derm-sap) attenuates stress and injury-induced behavioral hypersensitivity, yet the effect of RVM derm-sap on the functional integrity of the descending inhibitory system and the properties of RVM neurons remain unknown. Three classes of RVM neurons (on-cells, off-cells, and neutral cells) have been described with distinct responses to noxious stimuli and MOR agonists. Using single unit recording in lightly anesthetized rats, RVM neurons were characterized after microinjections of derm-sap or saporin. Derm-sap treatment resulted in a reduction in on-cells and off-cells when compared to saporin controls (P < 0.05). The number of neutral cells remained unchanged. After derm-sap treatment, RVM microinjections of the glutamate receptor agonist homocysteic acid increased tail-flick latencies, whereas the MOR agonist DAMGO had no effect. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray produced analgesia in both derm-sap and saporin controls with similar thresholds. Microinjection of kynurenic acid, a glutamate receptor antagonist, into the RVM disrupted periaqueductal gray stimulation-produced analgesia in both saporin-treated and derm-sap-treated rats. These results indicate that MOR-expressing neurons in the RVM are not required for analgesia produced by either direct or indirect activation of neurons in the RVM.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26335909/"}

To review all documented patients with JEB in whom an SCC developed, both from our epidermolysis bullosa (EB) center and those reported in the literature. A search in our EB registry documenting all JEB patients visiting our EB referral center from 1990 through 2010 revealed 7 JEB patients who developed 1 or more SCCs. A systematic literature search revealed 8 relevant articles documenting a total of 7 patients who developed an SCC. In our EB registry we found 7 patients with JEB who developed an SCC; these were all adults classified with non-Herlitz type JEB. The frequency of developing an SCC among adult JEB patients (n = 28) in our center was therefore 25%. In the literature, we found 7 case reports of JEB complicated by SCC (also classified as JEB, non-Herlitz type), bringing the total number of documented cases to 14. The first SCC in JEB patients developed at an average age of 50 years (median, 52 years; range, 28-70 years). In 9 of 14 cases, multiple primary SCCs occurred, with a total of 45 SCCs.

Three patients (21%) developed metastases and died on average 8.9 years after diagnosis of the initial SCC. This study was retrospective and the statistical analyses were based on a small number of patients. From their third decade, adult patients with JEB have an increased risk (1:4) of developing SCC on their lower extremities.

This was a retrospective study of patients seen in a combined Derm-Rheum Clinic (February 2018 to June 2020) in a Tertiary University Hospital. Consecutive patients with suspicious musculoskeletal symptoms or a known diagnosis of PsA referred to the Derm-Rheum Clinic were examined and followed simultaneously by experienced dermatologists and rheumatologists. Among 151 patients with psoriasis (PSO) with suspicious musculoskeletal complaints, 129 (85%) with a final diagnosis of PsA were included (56% females, mean age: 55 years, median disease duration: 14.2 years). In 62% of these patients (n = 94), PsA was diagnosed for the 1st time. At initial evaluation, 95% had peripheral arthritis, 45% nail involvement, 23% axial involvement, 12% enthesitis and 6% dactylitis with a median DAPSA and PASI scores of 20.5 and 1.6, respectively. 31% of the patients were not receiving any systemic treatment, 45% were on biologics, 29% on non-biologics and 10% on targeted synthetic agents (apremilast). At last visit (median interval time: 15 months), only 8% did not receive any systemic therapy (p < 0.001 compared to 1st visit), 62% were on biologics (p = 0.009 compared to 1st visit), 46% on non-biologics (p = 0.01 compared to 1st visit) and 10% remained on apremilast. The median DAPSA and PASI scores decreased significantly to 5.3 and 0, respectively. In conclusion, about 2/3 of patients with PSO and musculoskeletal complaints referred to a combined Derm-Rheum Clinic were diagnosed for the 1st time with PsA.

Desensitized receptors are thought to be unable to couple to G-proteins, preventing downstream signaling; however, the changes to the receptor itself are not well characterized. In the current study, confocal imaging was used to determine whether desensitizing conditions cause a change in agonist-receptor interactions. Using rapid solution exchange, the binding kinetics of fluorescently labeled opioid agonist, dermorphin Alexa594 (derm A594), to MORs was measured in live cells. The affinity of derm A594 binding increased after prolonged treatment of cells with multiple agonists that are known to cause receptor desensitization. In contrast, binding of a fluorescent antagonist, naltrexamine Alexa594, was unaffected by similar agonist pretreatment. The increased affinity of derm A594 for the receptor was long-lived and partially reversed after a 45 min wash. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin did not alter the increase in affinity of the derm A594 for MOR. Likewise, the affinity of derm A594 for MORs expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from arrestin 1 and 2 knock-out animals increased after treatment of the cells with the desensitization protocol. Thus, opioid receptors were \"imprinted\" with a memory of prior agonist exposure that was independent of G-protein activation or arrestin binding that altered subsequent agonist-receptor interactions. The increased affinity suggests that acute desensitization results in a long-lasting but reversible conformational change in the receptor.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23447620/"}

Some of these illumination sources include light-emitting diode lights, xenon light, and many others. This case study examines the occurrence of a photosensitivity reaction in a patient by considering the length, duration, and type of light during surgery. Our patient is a four-year-old male who presented to University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) with phimosis and umbilical hernia.

The findings in this case demonstrate a novel finding of a sunburn-like rash caused by the OR lights.

However, the specific contribution of the patch compartment to COC-induced stereotypy following repeated exposure is unknown. To elucidate the involvement of the patch compartment to the development of stereotypy following repeated COC exposure, we determined if destruction of this sub-region altered COC-induced behaviors. The neurons of the patch compartment were ablated by bilateral infusion of the neurotoxin dermorphin-saporin (DERM-SAP; 17 ng/μl) into the striatum. Animals were allowed to recover for eight days following the infusion, and then were given daily injections of COC (25mg/kg) or saline for one week, followed by a weeklong drug-free period. Animals were then given a challenge dose of saline or COC, observed for 2h in activity chambers and sacrificed. The number of mu-labeled patches in the striatum were reduced by DERM-SAP pretreatment. In COC-treated animals DERM-SAP pretreatment significantly reduced the immobilization and intensity of stereotypy but increased locomotor activity. DERM-SAP pretreatment attenuated COC-induced c-Fos expression in the patch compartment, while enhancing COC-induced c-Fos expression in the matrix compartment. These data indicate that the patch compartment contributes to repetitive behavior and suggests that alterations in activity in the patch vs matrix compartments may underlie to this phenomenon.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26100338/"}

However, the precise ancestral relationship between primary tumors and their metastases is not well understood.

In six of eight patients, we found that genetically distinct cell populations in the primary tumor metastasized in parallel to different anatomic sites, rather than sequentially from one site to the next. In five of these six patients, the metastasizing cells had themselves arisen from a common parental subpopulation in the primary, indicating that the ability to establish metastases is a late-evolving trait. Interestingly, we discovered that individual metastases were sometimes founded by multiple cell populations of the primary that were genetically distinct. Such establishment of metastases by multiple tumor subpopulations could help explain why identical resistance variants are identified in different sites after initial response to systemic therapy. One primary tumor harbored two subclones with different oncogenic mutations in CTNNB1, which were both propagated to the same metastasis, raising the possibility that activation of wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (WNT) signaling may be involved, as has been suggested by experimental models.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26286987/"}

To quantitatively monitor the local changes in the carotid vessel-wall-plus-plaque thickness (VWT) and compare the VWT distributions for different patients or for the same patients at different ultrasound scanning sessions, a mapping technique is required to adjust for the geometric variability of different carotid artery models. In this work, we propose a novel method called density-equalizing reference map (DERM) for mapping 3D carotid surfaces to a standardized 2D carotid template, with an emphasis on preserving the local geometry of the carotid surface by minimizing the local area distortion. The initial map was generated by a previously described arc-length scaling (ALS) mapping method, which projects a 3D carotid surface onto a 2D non-convex L-shaped domain. A smooth and area-preserving flattened map was subsequently constructed by deforming the ALS map using the proposed algorithm that combines the density-equalizing map and the reference map techniques. This combination allows, for the first time, one-to-one mapping from a 3D surface to a standardized non-convex planar domain in an area-preserving manner. Evaluations using 20 carotid surface models show that the proposed method reduced the area distortion of the flattening maps by over 80% as compared to the ALS mapping method. The proposed method is capable of improving the accuracy of area estimation for plaque regions without compromising inter-scan reproducibility.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905128/"}

To elucidate the involvement of the patch compartment to the development of METH-induced stereotypy, we determined if destruction of this sub-region altered METH-induced behaviors. Animals were bilaterally infused in the striatum with the neurotoxin dermorphin-saporin (DERM-SAP; 17 ng/μl) to specifically ablate the neurons of the patch compartment. Eight days later, animals were treated with METH (7.5 mg/kg), placed in activity chambers, observed for 2 h and killed. DERM-SAP pretreatment significantly reduced the number and total area of mu-labeled patches in the striatum. DERM-SAP pretreatment significantly reduced the intensity of METH-induced stereotypy and the spatial immobility typically observed with METH-induced stereotypy. In support of this observation, DERM-SAP pretreatment also significantly increased locomotor activity in METH-treated animals. In the striatum, DERM-SAP pretreatment attenuated METH-induced c-Fos expression in the patch compartment, while enhancing METH-induced c-Fos expression in the matrix compartment. DERM-SAP pretreatment followed by METH administration augmented c-Fos expression in the SNpc and reduced METH-induced c-Fos expression in the SNpr. In the medial prefrontal, but not sensorimotor cortex, c-Fos and zif/268 expression was increased following METH treatment in animals pre-treated with DERM-SAP. These data indicate that the patch compartment is necessary for the expression of repetitive behaviors and suggests that alterations in activity in the basal ganglia may contribute to this phenomenon.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23625147/"}

To determine the experiences, motivations, and future plans of residents in combined med/derm residency programs. We surveyed residents at all United States institutions with both categorical and combined training programs in spring of 2012. Respondents used visual analog scales to rate clinical interests, self-assessed competency, career plans, and challenges. The primary study outcomes were comfort in taking care of patients with complex disease, future practice plans, and experience during residency. Twenty-eight of 31 med/derm residents (87.5%) and 28 of 91 (31%) categorical residents responded (overall response rate 46%). No significant differences were seen in self-assessed dermatology competency, or comfort in performing inpatient consultations, cosmetic procedures, or prescribing systemic agents. A trend toward less comfort in general dermatology was seen among med/derm residents. Med/derm residents were more likely to indicate career preferences for performing inpatient consultation and taking care of medically complex patients. Categorical residents rated their programs and experiences more highly. Med/derm residents have stronger interests in serving medically complex patients.

Modified hydrothermal heating method was used to prepare titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>Nps). Size, shape, phase, band gap energy, surface and elemental composition of Nps were deciphered by application of various modern techniques including x-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Antimicrobial action of nanoparticles was evaluated against representatives of gram-positive (mono-derm) and Gram negative bacteria (di-derm) responsible for promoting dental caries. The zones of inhibition were calculated by disc diffusion method for each bacterial strain. Characterization revealed that TiO<sub>2</sub>Nps were having an average size of 54nm, showing anatase-rutile phase having spherical, with very few- irregularly shaped particles. TiO<sub>2</sub>Nps contained only pure titanium and oxygen in the EDX image but organic compounds in FTIR scan. Results of antimicrobial action indicated their potent bactericidal action against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20mm), Escherichia coli (19mm) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (19nm)</i> while comparatively less activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus (16mm)</i>..

To investigate the influence of IMDDs on the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity and side-effects following ChAdOx1-S[recombinant] vaccination. This prospective cohort study included 127 patients with IMDDs and 97 participants without immune-mediated diseases who received ChAdOx1-S[recombinant]. SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity and side-effect profiles were assessed at 1 month postvaccination and compared between groups. Immunological (primary) outcomes were the percentages of participants who tested positive for neutralizing antibodies [seroconversion rate (SR)] and those who developed T-cell-mediated immunity demonstrated by an interferon-γ-releasing assay (IGRA) [positive IGRA rate (+IGRA)]. Reactogenicity-related (secondary) outcomes were the unsolicited adverse reactions and worsening of IMDD activity reflected by the uptitration of immunosuppressants during and within 1 month of vaccination. Overall, the SR for the IMDD group was similar to that of participants without immune-mediated conditions (75·6 vs. 84·5, P = 0·101), whereas + IGRA was lower (72·4 vs. 88·7, P = 0·003). Reactogenicity was similar between groups. No severe adverse reaction was reported. By stratifying the participants in the IMDD group according to individual disease, the immunogenicity of the vaccine was lowest in patients with autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBD) (SR 64·5%, +IGRA 62·9%) and highest in patients with psoriasis (SR 87·7%, +IGRA 80·7%). The reverse trend was found for vaccine-related reactions. Immunosuppressants were uptitrated in 15·8% of cases; 75% of these were patients with AIBD. Among participants with IMDDs, ChAdOx1-S[recombinant] showed good immunogenicity among patients with psoriasis, but demonstrated lower levels of immunogenicity for patients with AIBD.

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence neural network (Deep Ensemble for Recognition of Melanoma [DERM]) to identify malignant melanoma from dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions and to show how this compared to doctors' performance assessed by meta-analysis. DERM was trained and tested using 7,102 dermoscopic images of both histologically confirmed melanoma (24%) and benign pigmented lesions (76%). A meta-analysis was conducted of studies examining the accuracy of naked-eye examination, with or without dermoscopy, by specialist and general physicians whose clinical diagnosis was compared to histopathology. The meta-analysis was based on evaluation of 32,226 pigmented lesions including 3,277 histopathology-confirmed malignant melanoma cases. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to examine and compare the diagnostic accuracy. DERM achieved a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.94), and sensitivity and specificity of 85.0% and 85.3%, respectively. Avoidance of false-negative results is essential, so different decision thresholds were examined.

This study examined strategies for compromising the integrity of DNNs under stringent conditions, specifically by inducing the misclassification of medical images of disease with minimal pixel modifications. This study used the following three publicly available datasets: the chest radiograph of emphysema (cxr) dataset, the melanocytic lesion (derm) dataset, and the Kaggle diabetic retinopathy (dr) dataset. To attack the medical images, we proposed a method termed decrease group differential evolution (DGDE) for generating adversarial images. Under this method, a noise matrix of the same size as the input image is first used to attack the image sample several times until the initial adversarial perturbation s0 is obtained. Next, a subset s1 is randomly picked from the initial adversarial perturbation s0 that is still able to cause the samples to be misclassified by the classifier. A new subset s2 is subsequently randomly selected from the adversarial perturbation subset s1, which can still cause the adversarial samples to be misclassified by the classifier. Finally, the adversarial perturbation subset sn with the minimum number of elements is obtained by continuous reduction of the number of perturbed pixels. In this study, the DGDE method was used to attack the images of the cxr dataset, the derm dataset, and the dr dataset; and the minimum number of pixels required to be considered a successful attack was 11, 7, and 7, respectively, while the maximum number of pixel changes was 55, 35, and 21, respectively. The average number of pixel changes was 30, 18, and 11, respectively, in the cxr dataset, the derm dataset, and the dr dataset, respectively, while the percentages of the average number of pixel changes among the total number of pixels of the image were 0.0598%, 0.0359%, and 0.0219, respectively. Unlike the traditional differential evolution (DE) method, the proposed DGDE method modifies fewer pixels to generate adversarial samples by introducing a variable population number and a novel crossover and selection strategy. However, the success rate of the initial attack on different image datasets varied greatly. In future studies, we intend to identify the reasons for this phenomenon and improve the success rate of the initial attack.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39698721/"}

Recently, we found that morphine activated ERK in opioid-tolerant but not in naïve rats, suggesting that morphine activation of μ-opioid receptors is altered following repeated morphine administration. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that μ-opioid receptor activation of ERK in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is dependent on dynamin, a protein implicated in receptor endocytosis. Rats were made tolerant to repeated microinjections of morphine into the vlPAG. The effects of dynamin on ERK activation and antinociception were assessed by microinjecting myristoylated dominant-negative dynamin peptide (Dyn-DN) or a scrambled control peptide into the vlPAG. Microinjection of a fluorescent dermorphin analogue (DERM-A594) into the vlPAG was used to monitor μ-opioid receptor internalization. Morphine did not activate ERK and Dyn-DN administration had no effect on morphine-induced antinociception in saline-pretreated rats. In contrast, morphine-induced ERK activation in morphine-pretreated rats that was blocked by Dyn-DN administration. Dyn-DN also inhibited morphine antinociception. Finally, morphine reduced DERM-A594 internalization only in morphine-tolerant rats indicating that μ-opioid receptors were internalized and unavailable to bind DERM-A594. Repeated morphine administration increased μ-opioid receptor activation of ERK signalling via a dynamin-dependent mechanism. These results demonstrate that the balance of agonist signalling to G-protein and dynamin-dependent pathways is altered, effectively changing the functional selectivity of the agonist-receptor complex.

The corresponding antigens are known to be present in the stratum corneum of desquamating stratified epithelium (K1/10, Cat.D) and/or in eccrine sweat (Cat.D, Derm.). The two major bands were identified as consistent with keratin 1 and 10. The pro-form and the active form of the cathepsin-D have also been identified from two other bands. Dermcidin could not be detected in the western blot. In addition, these antibodies have been tested on latent fingermarks left on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, as well as on whitened and non-whitened paper. The detection of fingermarks was successful with all three antibodies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19147311/"}

The role that these two processes have in the development of tolerance and dependence to opioids has been a controversial subject that has been studied in a variety of model systems. Here, we examine desensitization and internalization of endogenous MORs simultaneously in primary cultures of locus ceruleus neurons using fluorescently tagged peptide agonists. With the use of two fluorescent opioid peptides, dermorphin-Bodipy Texas Red and dermorphin-Alexa594 (Derm-A594), desensitization was measured electrophysiologically and trafficking was followed by the accumulation of intracellular fluorescent puncta. Blocking endocytosis with concanavalin A eliminated the accumulation of fluorescent puncta but desensitization induced by Derm-A594 was unaffected. Likewise, after treatment with concanavalin A, there was no change in either desensitization or recovery from desensitization induced by [Met]5enkephalin. The results demonstrate that desensitization and the recovery from desensitization are not dependent on receptor internalization and suggest that the activity of endogenous MORs in primary neurons can be modulated at the level of the plasma membrane.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16611829/"}

The accumulation of CD30-positive T-cells leads to the development of papulonodular lesions, which typically follow a protracted course and often resolve spontaneously in a matter of days to weeks. This case report describes a 44-year-old male patient who initially presented to the dermatology office with recurrent nodules under the right eye. He was diagnosed with periocular dermatitis initially, but when his condition failed to improve with minocycline, he was subsequently diagnosed with papulopustular rosacea and impetigo. However, despite multiple treatment trials, he still experienced recurrent flares with nodules that would arise only under the right eye and subsequent pain, swelling, and inflammation, which subsided as the lesions resolved. Histopathology of one of the lesions revealed a CD30-positive atypical lymphoid infiltrate, consistent with a diagnosis of LyP. Due to its close resemblance to other lymphoproliferative diseases, a diagnosis of LyP requires characteristic histological findings and a compatible clinical presentation, as neither alone is sufficient for diagnosis. This case report highlights the importance of integrating both clinical presentation and histopathologic findings to establish a diagnosis of LyP, especially when it arises in an uncommon anatomic site. LyP typically follows a benign course, but all patients diagnosed with LyP should have regular visits with a hematologist/oncologist to monitor for potential progression to malignant lymphoma.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40827152/"}

To overcome this obstacle, six new fluorescent opioid peptides were developed. Dermorphin (DERM), deltorphin (DELT), TIPP, and endomorphin were conjugated to BODIPY TR or Alexa Fluor 488, two fluorescent dyes with distinct hydrophobic properties. In membrane binding assays the fluorescent conjugates DERM-A488 or -BTR, DELT-A488 or -BTR, and TIPP-A488 displayed good binding affinity and selectivity for mu- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes. Furthermore, the fluorescent conjugates of dermorphin and deltorphin were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to hyperpolarize locus coeruleus neurons (DERM-A488 or -BTR) and inhibit calcium currents in NG108-15 (DELT-A488). Both of these responses were antagonized by naloxone. In conjunction with confocal fluorescent microscopy the trafficking of these fluorescent ligands was monitored in real-time. The internalization of these ligands by mu- and delta-opioid receptors was found to be naloxone-sensitive and temperature-dependent. Interestingly, once these ligands were internalized the fluorescent puncta that formed became distributed in one of two patterns. In Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing either mu- or delta-opioid receptors the intracellular puncta were concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell, whereas they were distributed throughout the cytoplasm in cells derived from either NG108-15 or SH-SY5Y cells. In summary, we have demonstrated that these novel, fluorescent opioid peptide conjugates permit real-time visual tracking of receptor-ligand complexes, including their internalization and trafficking, in living cells.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11093798/"}

We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage. The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p<0.001).

The histological work-up 1-7 days later showed material-dependent differences in the wound reaction. Under Corethium 2, a heavy layer of wound exudate formed on the first day both on fresh and granulating wound surfaces. Beneath this layer granulation tissue formed that was of regular thickness and well vascularized, filling the defect. Reepithelialization of the wound surface was not hindered by the material. In contrast, a strong connection was established between the wound base and the covering material when using the three foam substances Coldex, Epigard and SYSpur-derm, through the formation of granulation tissue. This process was dependent on the age of the wound. Thickening of the granulation tissue under the covering material was suppressed by the foam substances. Reepithelialization of the surface of the wound was disturbed by the growth of granulation tissue. The netlike structure of Epigard and the properties of the cover layer (fluid-resistant and protective against bacteria) make it possible for the granulation tissue to infiltrate evenly in the whole area of the wound covering and permit growth within the material right up to the surface. In addition to granulation tissue, epithelium also grows into the foam and spreads evenly. Epigard is suitable for long-term covering of large wounds. SYSpur-derm has a different fine structure than Epigard, which hinders the growth of granulation tissue, so that there are only cone-shaped connections between the wound base and the covering material. Rapid desiccation of the wound exudate cannot be prevented. Leukocytes and granulation tissue cannot spread in the foam. With SYSpur-derm an intermediate layer of wound exudate was observed more frequently than with Epigard. SYSpur-derm should be changed regularly in order to remove the detritus and exsudate from the wound. In comparison with polyurethane foam material the polyvinyl-alcohol foam (Coldex) was more complicated to handle, did not adapt as well to the wound, and dried up within a few hours. Between the base of the wound and Coldex, an intermediate layer often formed and, because of the rapid drying-out process, there was appreciably less infiltration with leukocytes and granulation tissue than with SYSpur-derm. With Coldex, as a rule the granulation tissue was more generously vascularized than in the other three materials.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3077419/"}

Tissue engineering and the use of functional biomaterials might be an alternative regenerative strategy and fulfill clinical needs. Decellularized extracellular matrices have generated interest as functional biologic scaffolds, but there are few studies on cartilage regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the biological influence of a newly developed decellularized human dermal extracellular matrix on two human primary cultures. Normal human articular chondrocytes (NHAC-kn) and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) from healthy donors were seeded in polystyrene wells as controls (CTR), and on decellularized human dermis batches (HDM_derm) for 7 and 14 days. Cellular proliferation and differentiation, and anabolic and catabolic synthetic activity were quantified at each experimental time. Histology and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate morphology and ultrastructure. Both cell cultures had a similar proliferation rate that increased significantly (p < 0.0005) at 14 days. In comparison with CTR, at 14 days NHAC-kn enhanced procollagen type II (CPII, p < 0.05) and aggrecan synthesis (p < 0.0005), whereas hMSC significantly enhanced aggrecan synthesis (p < 0.0005) and transforming growth factor-beta1 release (TGF-β1, p < 0.0005) at both experimental times. Neither inflammatory stimulus nor catabolic activity induction was observed. By comparing data of the two primary cells, NHAC-kn synthesized significantly more CPII than did hMSC at both experimental times (p < 0.005), whereas hMSC synthesized more aggrecan at 7 days (p < 0.005) and TGF-β1 at both experimental times than did NHAC-kn (p < 0.005). The results obtained showed that in in vitro conditions HDM_derm behaves as a suitable scaffold for the growth of both well-differentiated chondrocytes and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, thus ensuring a biocompatible and bioactive substrate.

The pVAS scores and yeast counts were significantly reduced on D28 compared with D0 in both groups (P < 0.05). CADESI-04 was significantly decreased on D28 in the emollient bathing group (P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in each endpoint score between the groups. In healthy dogs, TEWL was significantly increased after bathing in both groups (P < 0.01). An emollient bathing product can be effective for Malassezia overgrowth in dogs with atopic dermatitis. Bathing with shampoo products might affect skin barrier function even when using an emollient product.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33844368/"}

This paper evaluates dermal exposure models to ﬁnd the most appropriate. Eight models (i.e., COSHH, DERM, DREAM, EASE, PHED, RISKOFDERM, STOFFENMANAGER and PFAM) were evaluated according to a multi-criteria analysis and from these results five models (i.e., DERM, DREAM, PHED, RISKOFDERM and PFAM) were selected for the assessment of dermal exposure in the case study of the potato farming system in the Andean highlands of Vereda La Hoya, Colombia. The results show that the models provide different dermal exposure estimations which are not comparable. However, because of the simplicity of the algorithm and the speciﬁcity of the determinants, the DERM, DREAM and PFAM models were found to be the most appropriate although their estimations might be more accurate if specific determinants are included for the case studies in developing countries.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25938911/"}

Assessment of the residual reprogramming factors after the generation of hiPSC lines is required, but an ideal system has been lacking. Here, we generated hiPSC lines from normal human dermal fibroblasts with piggyBac transposon bearing reprogramming transgenes followed by removal of the transposon by the transposase. Under this condition, we compared the phenotypes of transgene-residual and -free hiPSCs of the same genetic background. The transgene-residual hiPSCs, in which the transcription levels of the reprogramming transgenes were eventually suppressed, were quite similar to the transgene-free hiPSCs in a pluripotent state. However, after differentiation into keratinocytes, clear differences were observed. Morphological, functional, and molecular analyses including single-cell gene expression profiling revealed that keratinocytes from transgene-free hiPSC lines were more similar to normal human keratinocytes than those from transgene-residual hiPSC lines, which may be partly explained by reactivation of residual transgenes upon induction of keratinocyte differentiation. These results suggest that transgene-free hiPSC lines should be chosen for therapeutic purposes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25024429/"}

Closing the combined full thickness helical rim and posterior ear defects, however, represents a reconstructive challenge because of the lack of available freely mobile skin anteriorly, superiorly, and inferiorly to the defect. The choice of the bilobed flap circumvents this challenge by rotating the skin and recruiting the tissue from the post-auricular sulcus, the lower pole of the posterior ear, and, if necessary, from the superior area of the neck adjacent to the posterior ear. This bilobed flap also enables an inconspicuous closure of the donor site and provides sufficient blood supply to ensure flap viability in a simple one-stage repair. Herein, we describe two cases in which we used the bilobed flap to rotate skin from the post-auricular surface to reconstruct full thickness skin defects involving the helical rim and posterior ear, with excellent cosmetic results.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062603/"}

Apart from intensive supportive therapy, no generally accepted specific treatment regimen exists. The role of corticosteroids in SJS/TEN is controversial. It is possible that high-dose pulse therapy with corticosteroids might be an improvement on long-term lower dose therapy, by combining higher efficacy with a diminished risk both of infection and of delayed wound healing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone pulse therapy with respect to mortality and healing time of patients with SJS/TEN. A small, uncontrolled series of consecutive inpatients with SJS/TEN was treated with dexamethasone pulse therapy. The efficacy of this treatment was assessed retrospectively using SCORTEN. Twelve patients were included over a period of 10 years. One patient died, while SCORTEN predicted a fatal outcome of 4 patients. Stabilization was reached after 2.3 days on average, total re-epithelialization after 13.9 days. The results of this study bear no statistical relevance due to the small number of patients. In conclusion, short-term dexamethasone pulse therapy, given at an early stage of the disease, may contribute to a reduced mortality rate in SJS/TEN without increasing healing time. A larger controlled trial is warranted to investigate further the use of dexamethasone pulse therapy in SJS/TEN.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17340021/"}

We aimed to study the characteristics of wet work exposure in nursing. Trained observers monitored the duration and frequency of different wet work activities in 45 randomly chosen nurses from different wards during a morning shift, using a method of continuous observation based on labour-observation techniques. Wet work in intensive care units accounted for 24% of the overall morning shift duration, with a frequency of 49 incidents. This was 16% in dialysis wards, with a frequency of 30 incidents, and 9% on regular wards, with a frequency of 39 incidents. The wet work activities had short mean duration cycles. The mean duration of occlusion by gloves was 3.1 min on regular wards and 6.7 min in intensive care units. The characteristics of wet work in nurses differed substantially, depending on the ward. According to the German regulation TRGS 531, our observations classify nursing as a wet work occupation, due to the frequency of wet work rather than its duration. The mean duration of occlusion in our observations was short, which makes an occlusion-induced irritating effect doubtful. Reduction in wet work exposure in nursing on regular wards could focus on the reduction of the frequency of hand-washing and patient-washing.

They all completed a questionnaire, underwent a standard interview and physical examination. Workers whose history indicated possible contact allergy were patch tested and prick tested. Workers reported a high exposure to skin irritants, especially when carrying out tasks that caused the hands and feet to become wet from perspiration and having contact with process water. Atopic dermatitis was seen in 3% of the workers. Contact dermatitis was seen in 26% of the workers and 36% were diagnosed with mycosis of the feet. All cases of contact dermatitis and mycosis could be attributed to occupational exposure to skin irritants. No cases of relevant contact allergy were seen. Occupational dermatitis in paper mills is primarily related to the exposure to skin irritants. Occupational physicians should be aware of the risk of occupational dermatitis in paper mill workers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15757984/"}

Pediatric HZ is rare but can follow a natural varicella infection, particularly in unvaccinated children. We report a case of a 10-year-old immunocompetent boy with a history of natural varicella infection at two years old and a delayed vaccination schedule who developed HZ following a viral illness. He presented with a painful, pruritic vesicular rash in a T4-5 dermatomal distribution, and his symptoms resolved with symptomatic management. This case underscores the critical role of routine varicella vaccination in preventing primary varicella infections and reducing the risk of HZ. While pediatric HZ is often mild, clinicians should remain vigilant for its occurrence and potential complications, particularly in unvaccinated children or those with incomplete immunization histories. Early recognition and management are essential to optimize patient outcomes and mitigate complications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40255789/"}

Dose-related cutaneous side-effects and diarrhoea may be a significant obstacle to treatment compliance. We present two cases with long-lasting acneiform eruptions, complicated by significant impetiginization, resulting in hospitalization in one case. The other patient suffered from sleep-disturbing, itching crusts on the scalp. As the use of EGFR inhibitors is increasing, clinicians should be aware of their side-effects.

One hundred and five patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were studied where the effects of chlorpheniramine, 4 mg and cyproheptadine, 4 mg administered twice daily were compared with cetirizine, 10 mg given once daily for 4 weeks or earlier till the relief of symptoms and regression of lesions. Local therapy consisted of calamine lotion in all cases. Out of 35 patients receiving chlorpheniramine excellent response was achieved in 9 (25.7%) cases by subjective evaluation (SE) and 11 (31.4%) by objective evaluation (OE). Out of 35 cases, 7 (20%) and 10 (28.5%) cases treated with cyproheptadine have shown excellent response by SE and OE respectively. Out of 35 patients taking cetirizine 25 (71.4%) had shown excellent response by SE and 22 (62.8%) cases by OE. Drowsiness was an important side effect observed in 19 (54.2%) cases receiving chlorpheniramine, 22 (62.8%) patients taking cyproheptadine and 1 (2.8%) case getting cetirizine.

The release rate of the two active ingredients from MZL dermatological preparations, Exorex and Athru-Derm and four comparator products was determined using an enhancer cell system, whilst specific penetration characteristics of the MZL formulation were elucidated using confocal and electron microscopy. The latter properties were explored at both the organ level, using human skin, as well as at a cellular level using a melanoma cell line. While the in vitro release rates for all formulations was high, coal tar and diclofenac release from Exorex and Athru-Derm respectively was, at nearly all time intervals, significantly higher than from comparator products. Microscopy revealed the presence of spherical liposomal type structures in both the MZL lotion and a comparator gel. In the MZL lotion, the majority of these structures, referred to here as emzaloid particles, were in the order of magnitude of about 50 nm to 1 microm in diameter with a small minority exceeding these dimensions. After application of Athru-Derm to human skin, intact emzaloid particles of submicron dimensions were detected in the epidermis in association with the cell membranes. The affinity of the MZL lotion for cell membranes was further demonstrated with melanoma cells; in addition, the formulation was seen to penetrate even to the nucleus of viable cells. Overall the data suggest that the oil/water base in MZL formulations is a highly efficient transdermal vehicle able to transport a wide range of indication- specific actives to their site of action.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10953256/"}

They were submitted to three laboratories, and the results were analysed. The cultured bacteria and reported sensitivities were compared across the laboratories. Fifteen dogs were included in the study (8 male neutered, 7 female spayed), with an age range of 2 to 17 years. Only 3/14 dogs had total agreement with the bacteria species grown across laboratories; however, the same staphylococcus species was grown in 12/14 dogs. Sensitivity agreement between laboratories was calculated using Cohen's kappa and Fleiss' kappa coefficient when the same bacteria were reported. There was almost perfect agreement of the sensitivity results. Four antibiotics were more likely to have disagreement: gentamicin (40%), doxycycline (26.6%), enrofloxacin (26.6%) and clindamycin (13%). Staphylococcus species and their sensitivities were reliable and reproducible, which agree with recent studies; however, the additional bacteria reported varied considerably, which may lead to the choice of a broader spectrum antibiotic. To ensure appropriate antibiotic stewardship, all culture results should be compared to cytology results and interpreted with an understanding of the causes of canine pyoderma; any discrepancies should encourage consultation with a microbiologist.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40847806/"}

To ensure local control with this procedure, it is important to obtain clear surgical margins. Here, we aimed to estimate the confidence in intraoperative evaluation of the retroareolar margin (IERM) and the necessity of removing the intra-nipple ducts. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated 224 BC (infiltrating carcinoma 178, ductal carcinoma in situ 46) patients, who underwent NSM. IERM was determined via cytology and frozen sections. Following gland removal, the intra-nipple ducts were excised and embedded in paraffin for analysis. The retroareolar tissue was also paraffin-embedded and reanalyzed for definitive evaluation of retroareolar margins (DERM). The IERM predictive capacity in relation to DERM and the frequency of intra-nipple duct involvement were estimated. IERM classified the sub-nipple areolar complex area as cancer-free in 219 cases (97.8%). The condition of clear retroareolar margin was confirmed by DERM in 216 cases (98.6%). The IERM accuracy was estimated as 98.6%. Ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> was detected in intra-nipple ducts using paraffin sections in 1.8% of the cases, despite clear IERM (4/219). In conclusion, IERM affords high accuracy and its results are suitable to manage the nipple-areolar complex.

Using intrathecal dermorphin-saporin (Derm-sap) to selectively destroy MOR-expressing dorsal horn neurons, we sought to determine the role of these neurons in (1) normal baseline reflex nocifensive responses to noxious thermal stimulation (hotplate, tail flick) and to persistent noxious chemical stimulation (formalin) and (2) the antinociceptive activity of intrathecal and systemic morphine in the same tests. Lumbar intrathecal Derm-sap (500 ng) produced (1) partial loss of lamina II MOR-expressing dorsal horn neurons, (2) no effect on MOR-expressing dorsal root ganglion neurons, and (3) no change in baseline tail-flick and hotplate reflex nocifensive responses. Derm-sap treatment attenuated the antinociceptive action of both intrathecal and systemic morphine on hotplate responses. Derm-sap treatment had two effects in the formalin test: (1) increased baseline nocifensive responding and (2) reduced antinociceptive action of systemic morphine. We conclude that MOR-expressing dorsal horn neurons (1) are not essential for determining nocifensive reflex responsiveness to noxious thermal stimuli, (2) are necessary for full antinociceptive action of morphine (intrathecal or systemic) in these tests, and (3) play a significant role in the endogenous modulation of reflex nocifensive responses to persistent pain in the formalin test.

The reactivities immunoglobulin (Ig)G autoantibodies towards malondialdéhyde (MDA)-modified T.Ag, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-modified T.Ag, native T.Ag and native derm were checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Evaluation of oxidized proteins exhibited high levels of MDA bound to proteins and carbonyl groups, as well as reduced thiol level in plasmas of AITD patients by comparison to healthy controls (p < 0.05). The ELISA test showed that AITD patients' plasmas' reactivity to native T.Ag was significantly increased to the reactivity towards native derm, whereas, no differences were found in the reactivity to native T.Ag and derm in controls plasmas. In addition, treatment of T.Ag by oxidants revealed enhanced reactivity of IgG circulating autoantibodies against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-oxidized T.Ag compared to native ones (p < 0.001) in plasmas of both AITD.

Notably, the emergence of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus pseudintermedius</i> has become a serious problem. In this context, bacteriophages and their lytic enzymes, endolysins, have received considerable attention as therapeutics for infectious diseases in place of antibiotics. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antibiotic-resistance patterns of staphylococcal species isolated from canine skin at a primary care animal hospital in Tokyo, Japan and evaluate the lytic activity of the staphylococcal bacteriophage phiSA012 and its endolysin Lys-phiSA012 against isolated antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal strains. Forty clinical staphylococcal samples were isolated from infection sites of dogs (20 from skin and 20 from the external ear canal). Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was determined by a disk diffusion method. The host range of phiSA012 was determined by using a spot test against staphylococcal isolates. Against staphylococcal isolates that showed resistance toward five classes or more of antimicrobials, the lytic activity of phiSA012 and Lys-phiSA012 was evaluated using a turbidity reduction assay. Twenty-three <i>S. pseudintermedius</i>, 16 <i>Staphylococcus schleiferi</i>, and 1 <i>Staphylococcus intermedius</i> were detected from canine skin and ear infections, and results revealed 43.5% methicillin resistance in <i>S. pseudintermedius</i> and 31.3% in <i>S. schleiferi</i>. In addition, the prevalence multidrug resistance (MDR) <i>S. pseudintermedius</i> was 65.2%. PhiSA012 could infect all staphylococcal isolates by spot testing, but showed little lytic activity by turbidity reduction assay against MDR <i>S. pseudintermedius</i> isolates. On the other hand, Lys-phiSA012 showed lytic activity and reduced significantly the number of staphylococcal colony-forming units.

The sample from northern Sweden was identified via the Swedish melanoma register. Data regarding pathways in health care were retrieved from patient records. In our unselected population of 71 people diagnosed with skin melanoma of SSM and NM types, 75% of patients were primarily treated by primary health-care centres (PHCs). The time interval (delay) from primary excision until registration of the histopathological assessment in the medical records was significantly longer in PHCs than in hospital-based and dermatological clinics (Derm). Thicker tumors were more common in the PHC group. Older patients waited longer times for wide excision. Most MM are excised rapidly at PHCs, but some patients may not be diagnosed and treated in time. Delay of registration of results from histopathological assessments within PHCs seems to be an important issue for future improvement. Exploring shortcomings in MM patients' clinical pathways is important to improve the quality of care and patient safety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24516469/"}

From the nationwide Swedish Medical Birth Register, we assembled pregnancies with births in women with SSc and in comparator women from the general population 1998-2021. We classified pregnancies according to the timing of SSc diagnosis at birth: post-SSc; after SSc diagnosis (n=94), and pre-SSc; 0-3 years (n=39) or >3 years (n=839) before diagnosis of SSc. We used regression models estimating relative risks (RR) of APO in post-SSc, and odds ratios (OR) in pre-SSc pregnancies with 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively. For post-SSc pregnancies, RR of preeclampsia (3.8; 1.8-7.8), preterm birth (3.3; 1.8-6.1), and caesarean delivery (2.5; 1.8-3.5) were increased. By contrast, there were no indications of increased proportions of maternal or neonatal death, nor stillbirth. Stratifying on parity, risks were considerably higher among primiparous post-SSc women; RR of preeclampsia (7.5; 3.5-16.1) and of preterm birth (5.1; 2.5-10.5). We also noted increased odds of APO in pre-SSc pregnancies, with the highest estimates in the 0-3 years pre-SSc pregnancies. Contemporary women with SSc displayed markedly increased risks of several APO after SSc diagnosis; the risk of some APO was already increased before diagnosis, particularly within 3 years. Our findings suggest that both preclinical and overt SSc have a substantial impact on pregnancy outcomes, especially in the first pregnancy, highlighting the importance of specialized care and close monitoring.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40629500/"}

Mutations in COL7A1 are responsible for the most devastating form of EB in adults, which is characterized by cocooned \"mitten\" deformities of the hands. This report shows in vivo reversion of an inherited COL7A1 mutation in a patient with recessive dystrophic EB who was homozygous for the frameshift mutation COL7A1:c.6527insC,p.2176FsX337. The patient exhibited a patch of clinically healthy revertant skin on her left forearm. The second-site mutation c.6528delT, which is present in revertant keratinocytes, resulted in correction of the reading frame. As the new CCC codon codes for the same amino acid proline as the wild-type codon CCT, the revertant cells expressed wild-type type VII collagen polypeptide, leading to restoration of skin function. We hypothesize that, on careful examination, revertant mosaicism might be found to be more common in patients with type VII collagen-deficient EB. Furthermore, the revertant keratinocytes might offer the possibility to explore cell-based therapeutic strategies, by culturing in vitro and subsequently grafting as part of bioengineered dermo-epidermal substitutes on affected skin.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20574443/"}

This technique is a surgical procedure aimed at removing excess skin and subcutaneous fat from the chest and flanks. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 12 patients who underwent lateral body lift. Demographic and surgical data were collected and analyzed for potential factors influencing outcome. In this group of 12 patients, 10 were female and two were male. In the subjective satisfaction score (1 representing the lowest satisfaction score and 5 representing the highest score) measured 12 months after surgery, 10 patients indicated the maximum value of the scale. Only two indicated the levels of satisfaction 4. The mean improvement of the pinch test was calculated as 7 cm in the 12<sup>th</sup> postoperative month. Among the 12 patients included in this subgroup analysis, four (33%) experienced minor complications, all of which resolved without requiring surgical intervention. Notably, all four of these patients had a history of massive weight loss, and three of them hadn't undergone simultaneous liposuction. Female patients ranged in age from 33 to 62 years, with an average age of 45 years and an average BMI of 25. All female patients underwent lateral body lift as an extended L-type brachioplasty. The two male patients were aged 28 and 50 and had an average BMI of 25. The most common adverse event was wound dehiscence in the armpit area, managed successfully with secondary intention healing. This type of procedure has been used in male and female patients. In most of the female cases, bra-line back lift would provide similar results, and scar could be hidden under the bra. Nevertheless in most of the massive weight loss cases, including females, skin excess along the horizontal access could be targeted more efficiently by using the lateral chest excision. Lateral body lift (Zip-Shark) has been described as another additional procedure of choice to achieve simultaneous lifting of the soft tissues in the back, abdomen, pectoral area, and upper arms.

{"id": "29562628", "title": "Delay-Aware Energy-Efficient Routing towards a Path-Fixed Mobile Sink in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks.", "text": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) involve more mobile elements with their widespread development in industries. Exploiting mobility present in WSNs for data collection can effectively improve the network performance. However, when the sink (i.e., data collector) path is fixed and the movement is uncontrollable, existing schemes fail to guarantee delay requirements while achieving high energy efficiency. This paper proposes a delay-aware energy-efficient routing algorithm for WSNs with a path-fixed mobile sink, named DERM, which can strike a desirable balance between the delivery latency and energy conservation. We characterize the object of DERM as realizing the energy-optimal anycast to time-varying destination regions, and introduce a location-based forwarding technique tailored for this problem. To reduce the control overhead, a lightweight sink location calibration method is devised, which cooperates with the rough estimation based on the mobility pattern to determine the sink location. We also design a fault-tolerant mechanism called track routing to tackle location errors for ensuring reliable and on-time data delivery. We comprehensively evaluate DERM by comparing it with two canonical routing schemes and a baseline solution presented in this work. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that DERM can provide considerable energy savings while meeting the delay constraint and maintaining a high delivery ratio.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29562628/"}

The use of skin substitutes as temporary or permanent coverings has been a subject of research and study since 1500 BC. Temporary coverage of the burn wound can decrease the metabolic rate, fluid loss, pain, and colonization. The aim of this study is to review clinical experience with Biobrane and aldehyde-treated porcine skin (E.Z. Derm) as biosynthetic skin substitutes for the treatment of excised burn wounds. Methods. Fifty-two patients (42 males and 10 females) with deep dermal and full-thickness burns were selected for this retrospective study. Half of these patients were treated with Biobrane (this part of the study covered the period Jan. 1995/Dec. 1999) and the other half were treated with E.Z. Derm (Jan. 2000/Dec. 2005). The mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 30%. The excisional therapy was carried out in stages, each procedure being limited to 7-15% TBSA. All the patients underwent either tangential excision or excision down to the muscle fascia. The male/female ratio was 3:1 and the patients' ages ranged between 5 and 67 yr (mean, 35 yr). Data collection included: initial observation (age, sex extent of burn, depth of burn, photograph), skin substitute observation (adherence, presence of fluid collection, rejection, infection, photograph), and follow-up wound evaluation. Results. Both Biobrane and E.Z. Derm reduced pain, decreased evaporative water and heat loss, and limited bacterial growth. Both decreased exudative protein loss, protected the underlying vessels and nerves, and enhanced the healing of partial-thickness wounds. Both promoted the development of granulation tissues to be ready for autografting, and neither presented antigenicity or transmitted diseases. Porcine skin showed limited wound adhesion and limited control of infection compared to Biobrane. Conclusion. Biobrane and E.Z. Derm protected excised burn wounds from bacterial contamination and dehydration. It can be concluded that Biobrane has the potential for long-term adherence (10 days). Aldehyde-treated porcine skin (E.Z. Derm) is a reliable tool for short-term use and should not remain on the wound more than 3-4 days.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21991074/"}

Within a typical 3-hr shift, a mean frequency of 68 episodes of wet work was observed, which classifies office cleaning as wet work. Skin exposure to irritants was markedly different among cleaners who did the same cleaning activities. Reduction in skin irritation can be achieved by training the workers. Because this group of workers, who have a low level of education, has a high risk of developing irritant hand dermatitis, a special effort on training and instruction should be made.

Among these cases, 9.45% of them have nadir zero, 68% of patients have clinical documented infections, ORL in 47% of cases. According to the study, 12% of cases have documented microbiological fever, the sites was urinary in 33% of cases, blood in 33% of cases, derm in 30% of cases. The microbe was staphylococcus negative coagulase in 37.5% essentially in blood and derm, the Escherichia coli in 20.8% essentially in urinary and blood. First line antibiotherapy was cefotaxim associated with amikacine in 93.5%, second line antibiotherapy was association of imipenam and amikacine in 82% of cases. Among these cases,7% of them have received anti-staphylococcus, and antifungic treatment in 50% of cases. The thermic defervescence was obtained in median delay of 2.8 days. We have noted nine deaths (22% of cases). Recent surveys indicate that neutropenia remains a prevalent problem associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and costs. The colony-stimulating have used effectively in a variety of clinical settings to prevent or treat febrile neutropenia and to assist patients receiving dose-intensive chemotherapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18178025/"}

The metal levels (Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Average levels of Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb were higher than the allowable concentrations set by national and international agencies. Principal component analysis indicated significant anthropogenic contributions of Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb in the water reservoir. Noncarcinogenic risk assessment was then evaluated using Hazard Quotient (HQ(ing/derm)) and Hazard Index (HI(ing/derm)) following USEPA methodology. For adults and children, Cd, Co, Cr, and Pb (HQ(ing) > 1) emerged as the most important pollutants leading to noncarcinogenic concerns via ingestion route, whereas there was no risk via dermal contact of surface water. This study helps in establishing pollutant loading reduction goal and the total maximum daily loads, and consequently contributes to preserve public health and develop water conservation strategy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24744690/"}

Bone loss may be a result of pathology, trauma, or surgical procedure. Extensive studies on the process of bone repair have been undertaken, and several techniques for the correction of bone defects have been proposed. Amongst them is the use of several types of grafts, the use of membranes, and the combination of both techniques. There is evidence in the literature of the positive effect of LLLT on the healing of soft tissue wounds. However, its effect on bone healing is not completely understood. Five randomized groups were studied: group I (control); group IIA (Gen-ox); group IIB (Gen-ox + LLLT); group IIIA (Gen-ox + Gen-derm); and group IIIB (Gen-ox + Gen-derm + LLLT). Bone defects were created at the femur and were treated according to the group. The animals of irradiated groups were irradiated every 48 h for 15 days; the first irradiation was performed immediately after the procedure. The animals were irradiated transcutaneuosly at four points around the defect. At each point, a dose of 4 J/cm2 was given (phi approximately equal to 0.6 mm, 40 mW), and the total dose per session was 16 J/cm2. The animals were humanely killed at 15, 21, and 30 days after surgery. The specimens were routinely processed to wax, serially cut, stained with H&E and Picrosirius stains, and analyzed under light microscopy. The results showed more advanced repair of the irradiated groups when compared to the non-irradiated ones. The repair of the irradiated group was characterized by both increased bone formation and on the amount of collagen fibers around the graft within the cavity, as early as the 15th day after surgery, considering the osteoconductive capacity of the Gen-ox and the increment of the cortical repair in specimens with Gen-derm membrane.

The dose 10 mg/kg produces similar changes both in young and in mature (2-month-old) animals. In the young animals given hydrocortisone in dose 5 mg/kg of the body mass, the mean summational area and extension of the granular endoplasmic reticulum membranes in the fibroblast section diminishes, the summational area of the mitochondrial section decreases in the section of one cell, and the derm with less thickness, in comparison with the derm of intact animals, is formed, while in mature animals, given hydrocortisone in a small dose, all the parameters mentioned do not significantly differ from the control. Hydrocortisone in dose 20 mg/kg decreases all quantitative parameters of dermal fibroblasts both in young and mature animals.

A theoretical model, based on the steady state Schrodinger equation and Maxwell-Bolzmann distribution of energy, is proposed to describe passive transport of ions through a biological membrane channel in a time independent field. Constant height (V2) and length(L) of the potential energy barrier and effective mass of ions are used in the model. This model shows that an ion may go through or be reflected from a channel whether its energy is lower or higher than the barrier. This is a departure from classical theory. Based on a published I-Vm (channel current-transmembrane voltage) curve from an activated K+ channel in a human erythrocyte membrane [Palle Christophersen, 1991], calculations with our model show that more than 99% of the channel current is contributed by ions with higher energy than the potential barrier. The current can be amplified 10,000 times while V2 is reduced from 0.45 eV (channel closed) to 0.20 eV (channel opened) at Vm = 0.07 V. In contrast, the current changes only 1.5% while L is narrowed from 90 A to 30 A at Vm = 0.07 V, V2 = 0.20 eV.

The narcotized animals were cooled up to 18 degrees C of rectal temperature, kept at this temperature during 2h and then warmed up to 37 degrees C. Early terms of the posthypothermia period were characterized by less density of the population of intraepidermal lymphocytes and a simultaneous increase of their amount in the papillary and reticular layers of the derm without any changes in the hypodermis. Subsequently the lymphocyte population density in the derm was decreased, a little later their amount in the hypodermis was decreased. A simultaneous increase of the amount of lymphocytes took place in the area of postcapillary venules of the paracortical zone of LN. At the late post-hypothermal period the quantity of lymphocytes in the skin was restored. In the B-zones of LN less sizes of lymphoid nodules were noted as well as decreased population density (PD) of mitotically dividing cells, blasts and lymphocytes with pyknotized nuclei. A simultaneous increase of PD of plasmocytes took place in cerebral cords and elevated activity of alkaline phosphomonoesterase was noted in these cells. At the late posthypothermia period the area occupied by cerebral cords on the section was increased and correspondingly the area occupied by the cortical substance was decreased.

The skin histology was consistent with eosinophilic fasciitis and her complete blood count was notable for a peripheral eosinophilia. Because of the location of the fibrosis and the time proximity in relation to her infusions, a relationship between the iron infusions and eosinophilic fasciitis was made.

The NCvB also provides warning signals, which this centre believes should be known to health and safety policymakers and professionals so that they may respond with appropriate action. The report gives 4 different alerts: on the importance of health and safety awareness during vocational training, on scientific evidence in support of zero tolerance for intimidation and violence, on health and safety consultation regarding conception and pregnancy, which should focus on both men and women, and on the poor working conditions at the bottom end of the labour market.

This manifestation can represent extensive tumor development from any of the intra-abdominal or pelvic structures. Therefore, SMJN carries a poor prognosis, with a two-year survival rate of only 13.5 percent regardless of the etiology of primary cancer. In this case, a 67-year-old man with metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix involving the umbilicus presenting more than five years after the initial cancer diagnosis is reported. The features of patients with metastatic appendiceal carcinoma presenting as SMJN are also reviewed. With the inclusion of our patient, there are six patients who have documented SMJN due to appendiceal carcinoma: two men, two women, and two patients without demographic data. The patients ranged from the ages of 31 to 68 years, with a median age of 56.5 years at cancer diagnosis and 59 years at SMJN diagnosis. In 75 percent of the cases, SMJN was the initial clinical manifestation of a previously unsuspected appendiceal carcinoma and presented clinically one to seven months (median of five months) before the pathologic confirmation of the metastatic appendiceal carcinoma. The likelihood of SMJN presenting as the initial clinical feature of appendiceal cancer may increase in patients with extensive intraperitoneal metastasis in the form of pseudomyxoma peritonei or carcinomatosis. Therefore, the observation of a solitary umbilical nodule should prompt an investigation for an underlying primary neoplasm, as the prognosis after tumor metastasis to the umbilicus is poor.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29719746/"}
{"id": "12482045", "title": "Dexamethasone pulse therapy in pemphigus.", "text": "Pulse therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids was introduced 20 years ago as a treatment modality for autoimmune disease and transplant rejection. The most popular dermatological indication for pulse therapy is severe pemphigus. We reviewed the sequelae of 14 patients with pemphigus who were treated by pulse therapy. Seven of them reached complete remission, although three of them needed a new pulse course due to disease flare-up. Adverse events were minor and confined to 60% of all patients: temporary facial flushing during pulse administration, sleep disturbances during the first night after pulse administration, and mood changes occurred during the week of pulse therapy. The study showed the possibility of oral instead of an intravenous mute of dexamethasone pulse administration, which makes double-blind placebo-controlled trials ethically feasible. Fifty per cent of the patients reached complete remission. This retrospective study does not allow claims on the steroid-sparing effect.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12482045/"}

Identification of the targeted autoantigen is usually attempted by immunoblotting. Although immunoblotting works well for human IgG, the method is less successful for IgA and often no or only faint signals are obtained. To improve the method of immunoblotting for diagnosis of IgA-mediated bullous dermatoses. Eleven sera, selected from patients with linear deposition of IgA along the epidermal basement membrane zone in vivo, were tested by immunoblotting for antigen specificity using different primary incubation temperatures. No reliable information regarding IgA antigen specificity was obtained when the primary incubation was undertaken at room temperature. In 10 of 11 sera, IgA bound to the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP180) when the primary incubation temperature was increased to 37 degrees C. Primary incubation at room temperature may result in false-negative results in the IgA-BP180 immunoblot assay.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11899154/"}

We present two cases of APP with diagnostic problems: a 65-year-old woman that suffered from intermittent APP with remission and exacerbation for many years, and an 83-year-old man with lesions that developed after atenolol treatment. In both cases, the patients were thought to have drug provocation, and therefore acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) was diagnosed. Only a thorough analysis of the course of the disease and histopathological examination allowed correct diagnosis.

We report the case of a 76-year-old male who presented with a recurrent rash initially suggestive of Sweet's syndrome. Following a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome due to the identification of a pathogenic variant in the UBA1 gene. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges clinicians face when confronting rare syndromes with nonspecific clinical features. The absence of formal diagnostic criteria and its overlap with more common inflammatory and haematologic diseases complicates prompt diagnosis and management.

However, it may be false negative in immunocompromised patients like HIV-infected. We examined the pattern of TST results in 523 newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients. CD4, CD8 and absolute lymphocyte counts were done by flowcytometry in 63 of these cases. 56 (44.10%), 15 (11.81%) and 56 (44.10%) of the 127 cases with tuberculosis and 293 (73.99%), 41 (10.35%) and 62 (15.66%) of the 396 cases without any clinical evidence of tuberculosis showed TST results of 0-4, 5-9 and = or > 10 mm respectively. Significantly more (P<0.05) number of cases with TST of = or > 10mm and significantly lesser (P<0.05) number of cases with TST of 0-4 mm are likely to develop tuberculosis. The average CD4+lymphocyte count was found to be significantly lower in cases with nil TST results than with = or >10mm. HIV infected cases associated with tuberculosis with induration on TST had average CD4 counts of 129.5 as compared to 246.3/cmm in those without tuberculosis. In India where both these diseases are endemic, tuberculosis may develop during early HIV infection, while the body's immunity is still largely unimpaired and TST shows = or >10mm results in almost 45% of our cases. In another 45% with TST of 0-4mm, the CD4+ lymphocyte count is likely to be lower than 200/cmm. In those with nil induration, TST of 5-9 mm cannot be taken as an independent marker for suspecting tuberculosis in the HIV infected. Hence we recommend that all cases with TST of = or >10mm and cases with nil induratrion with CD4+ count of <200/cmm should be considered as high-risk for developing tuberculosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27407872/"}

Mutations in the gene DSP encoding desmoplakin have been associated with various phenotypes affecting skin and/or heart. One of these phenotypes, lethal acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa (LAEB), is characterized by extensive postnatal shedding of epidermis leading to early demise and is caused by recessive mutations in the gene DSP resulting in truncation of the desmoplakin C-terminus. Here we describe two infants born to the same consanguinous parents who suffered extensive epidermal dislodgment and died shortly after birth. In addition, universal alopecia, anonychia, malformed ears and cardiomyopathy were observed. As the clinical diagnosis was LAEB, DSP mutation analysis was performed. A homozygous deletion (c.2874del5) abrogating the donor splice site of exon 20 was found. The deletion is predicted to cause read-through in intron 20 with subsequent recognition of a premature termination codon, resulting in desmoplakin lacking its rod domain and C-terminus (p.Lys959MetfsX5). Electron microscopic analysis of skin biopsies showed absence of the desmosomal inner dense plaque and lack of tonofilament insertion. This is the second report of LAEB. These findings suggest DSP mutations as the aetiology of LAEB and cardiomyopathy as part of the phenotype. Furthermore, they indicate that in addition to the desmoplakin C-terminus, the rod domain is dispensable for intrauterine development but is essential for the inner dense plaque of desmosomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20302578/"}

We review and compare the efficacy of several commonly used topical anesthetics and provide a look into the future. EMLA remains the most widely used topical anesthetic given its proven efficacy and safety by several clinical trials. There has been a recent release of several new topical anesthetic agents with some demonstrating efficacy after a 30-minute application time. A reservoir of anesthetic is located and stored in the upper skin layers during application, providing additional anesthetic benefit 30 minutes after removal.

He enjoyed a sterling professional reputation, with one exception. During the 1860s, his name appeared in a wide variety of cosmetic advertisements endorsing commercial products such as Pears soap, which is still marketed today, as well as hair washes and pomades. Questions were raised in The Lancet about the propriety of Wilson's involvement with such commercial products. Wilson denied in a letter to The Lancet any connection with these advertisements; nonetheless, some confusion has lingered over the years about whether Wilson received any financial compensation from the Pears Soap Company in return for his product endorsements, and whether he enjoyed a business relationship with cosmetic companies that added to his wealth. This contribution presents a comprehensive review of Erasmus Wilson's relationship with cosmetic companies and his struggle to distance himself from them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920823/"}

The pathogenesis remains unclear. To clarify the pathogenesis of JEB-lo. Two patients with JEB-lo, a brother and a sister, were examined using electron microscopy (EM), immunofluorescence (IF) antigen mapping and molecular analysis. We found subtle changes in IF antigen mapping and EM. The most remarkable changes were loss of the apical-lateral staining of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against type XVII collagen (Col17), and a broadened distribution of mAb staining against the ectodomain of Col17, laminin-332 and type VII collagen. Mutation analysis of COL17A1, encoding Col17, showed a compound heterozygosity for a novel mutation c.1992_1995delGGGT and the known mutation c.3908G>A in both patients. The deletion c.1992_1995delGGGT results in a premature termination codon and mRNA decay, leaving the patients functionally hemizygous for the missense mutation c.3908G>A (p.R1303Q) in the noncollagenous 4 domain of Col17.

Seventeen dogs with AD whose clinical presentation showed a Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index, 4th iteration (CADESI-04) score of <40. The dogs were randomly assigned to either the FB bathing group or the shampoo group. The treatments were administered once a week as per the instructions, in a trial totalling 4 weeks. Evaluations were conducted on Day (D)0 and D28 to assess the outcomes of the trial. The severity of AD was measured using the CADESI-04 and the pruritus Visual Analog Scale (PVAS). The skin barrier function parameters, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration were measured before and after the treatment. Both treatment groups demonstrated a decreasing trend in CADESI-04 scores, yet the FB group exhibited significant improvement in comparison to the shampoo group after 1 month of trial. There were no significant changes in PVAS scores in either group. No significant difference was found in skin barrier function parameters between the two treatments, although TEWL slightly decreased in the FB group and slightly increased in the shampoo group after treatment.

Soil contaminated with Hg (PERI = 100) and Cd (PERI = 145.50) posed an ecological risk significantly. Pollution load index (PLI) value is greater than 1, while degree of contamination (C<sub>deg</sub>) value is less than 32 which indicated that the soil is polluted and considerably contaminated with metals and metalloid, respectively. In terms of the average daily dosage (ADD) of soil, children received the highest doses of all metals (ADD<sub>ing</sub> = 1.315 × 10<sup>-7 </sup>- 2.470 × 10<sup>-3</sup> and ADD<sub>derm</sub> = 9.939 × 10<sup>-7 </sup>- 5.292 × 10<sup>-11</sup>), whereas ADD<sub>ing</sub> (1.409 × 10<sup>-8 </sup>- 2.646 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) was found greater in adults. For all metals except for Ba, the hazard quotient (HQ) trend in both children and adults was observed to be HQ<sub>ing</sub> > HQ<sub>derm</sub> > HQ<sub>inh</sub> of soil. Children who are at the lower edge of cancer risk had a lifetime cancer risk (LCR) of 2.039 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for Cr from various paths of soil exposure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36790726/"}
{"id": "15479202", "title": "Skin protection in nursing work: promoting the use of gloves and hand alcohol.", "text": "Nursing has been identified as a wet-work occupation, with a high prevalence of occupational irritant contact dermatitis. Reduction of exposure to skin irritants contributes to the prevention of occupational skin disease in nurses. The role of the use of soap and water, hand alcohol and gloves in prevention programmes is discussed. 2 additional measures for reducing exposure to skin irritants are postulated: use of hand alcohol instead of soap and water in disinfection procedures when the hands are not visibly dirty; use of gloves in wet activities such as patient washing to prevent the hands from becoming wet and visibly dirty. We investigated the effectiveness of these recommendations in a model. Mean daily wet-work exposure during nursing work was modelled: regular model. We also modelled exposure to skin irritants in combination with the implementation of these recommendations: prevention model. The hands of healthy volunteers were exposed to the regular or the prevention model over 3 weeks for 5 days a week. The change in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) on the back of the hands was measured after 3 weeks of exposure to these wet-work simulations. An increase in TEWL occurred with the regular model, while mean TEWL decreased in the prevention model. Skin irritation from occlusion by gloves appeared to be more pronounced in the regular model compared to the prevention model. The results of this study justify the conclusion that in nursing work, hand alcohol is the preferred disinfectant. Although the prevention model implies increased occlusive exposure, this has no additional irritant effect, probably because of the absence of soap exposure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15479202/"}
{"id": "15186383", "title": "Irritant hand dermatitis: severity of disease, occupational exposure to skin irritants and preventive measures 5 years after initial diagnosis.", "text": "Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is often chronic; its aetiology frequently being related to occupational exposure. Management of ICD involves persistent reduction in exposure to skin irritants such as water, detergents and prolonged occlusion by gloves. The aim of this study was to determine the severity of hand dermatitis 5 years after initial diagnosis and to find out what factors were related to this outcome. A questionnaire survey was carried out on severity of hand dermatitis, exposure to skin irritants and preventive measures, 5 years after initial ICD diagnosis. Of a cohort of 201 patients with ICD, 172 received the questionnaire and 124 (72%) responded. 5 years after initial diagnosis, 50% still had medium and 32% severe hand dermatitis. Patients with severe ICD and high exposure showed low levels of prevention and difficulty in changing their occupational exposure. Use of emollients was predominantly therapeutic rather than preventive. Occupation was changed in 57% of cases, of which 46% was permanent. In this population, ICD is a chronic disease; implementation of secondary preventive measures appears to fail. In occupations with high exposure to skin irritants, implementation of permanent exposure reduction is more difficult, compared to occupations with a medium level of exposure. High exposures might have led to change of occupation; medium exposures could have been reduced to low levels. In occupations with high exposure, women were overrepresented.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15186383/"}

There are, however, significant differences between Caucasian and Asian faces, reflecting not only cultural disparities, but also distinctive treatment goals. Unlike aesthetic patients in the West, who usually seek to improve the signs of aging, Asian patients are younger and request a broader range of indications. Members of the Asia-Pacific Consensus group-comprising specialists from the fields of dermatology, plastic surgery, anatomy, and clinical epidemiology-convened to develop consensus recommendations for Asians based on their own experience using cohesive polydensified matrix, hyaluronic acid, and calcium hydroxylapatite fillers. The Asian face demonstrates differences in facial structure and cosmetic ideals. Improving the forward projection of the \"T zone\" (i.e., forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin) forms the basis of a safe and effective panfacial approach to the Asian face. Successful augmentation may be achieved with both (1) high- and low-viscosity cohesive polydensified matrix/hyaluronic acid and (2) calcium hydroxylapatite for most indications, although some constraints apply. The Asia-Pacific Consensus recommendations are the first developed specifically for the use of fillers in Asian populations. Therapeutic, V.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26505699/"}

Randomised, double-blind parallel group study of 8 weeks' duration. Outpatient clinic in a university hospital. Forty-four adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (objective SCORAD > 25). Initial phase (2 weeks): 3% tetracycline 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide vs. 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide twice daily all over the body. MAINTENANCE PHASE: (6 weeks) 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide once daily for 2 weeks, followed by every other day for 2 weeks. In the last 2 weeks, two applications a week were done. An emollient was used additionally once daily. Primary outcomes were the disease severity scores assessed by objective SCORAD and SASSAD at week 2. Secondary outcomes were the objective SCORAD and SASSAD at weeks 4 and 8, and Staphylococcus aureus colonization at weeks 0 and 2. No significant differences in disease severity outcomes were found between the two groups. Both groups showed clinically relevant improvements in disease severity compared with baseline at weeks 2 and 4. At week 8, there was some worsening in disease severity in both groups, but the disease severity was still significantly lower than at the beginning of the study. Improvement of bacterial colonization was seen in 14 (63.6%) out of the 22 patients in the 3% tetracycline 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide group and in 5 (22.7%) out of the 22 patients in the 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide group. The addition of tetracycline was effective on skin colonization by S. aureus but did in our patients with atopic dermatitis not result in a significantly different improvement compared with the group treated without tetracycline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18384552/"}

While typically presenting in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, NAE can also present secondary to nutritional deficiency or systemic disease. We present a case of NAE in a 66-year-old patient with no history of HCV infection status post gastric bypass who had a three-month history of eating only mushroom soup. The patient underwent a punch biopsy and was tested for a variety of nutritional deficiencies. Biopsy demonstrated partial necrosis of the upper epidermis, with subjacent re-epithelialization, squamatization, and vacuolopathy of the basal epidermis. He was treated with zinc replacement therapy after initial trials of tacrolimus and clobetasol were unsuccessful. At follow-up, he had significant improvement of the lesions. This case provides an example of an atypical presentation of NAE in the absence of HCV infection that presented as a complication of gastric bypass-associated nutritional deficiency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39100037/"}

Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer was utilized to detect the concentration of PTEs by following some sequential analytical procedure. Concentration of PTEs followed the reducing trend of Zn > Cr > Pb > As > Cu > Cd with the mean value of 61.04 > 49.15 > 26.58 > 10.28 > 6.28 > 1.59 mg/kg, respectively. The principle component and cluster analyses justified the anthropogenic source of the studied PTEs. The mean values of contamination factor (CF), geo-accumulation index (<i>I</i><sub><i>geo</i></sub><i>)</i> and enrichment factor (EFc) showed that Pb and Cd were highly responsible for sediment (uncontaminated to moderate) contamination. Pollution load index (PLI) indicated higher pollution of sediments near the port areas. Potential ecological risk index (PERI) indicated low to moderate risks due to the contaminated sediment. However, the contamination of sediment was not associated with the non-carcinogenic (HQ<sub>derm</sub> and HI < 1) and carcinogenic (CR<sub>derm</sub> < 10<sup>-6</sup>) risks due to the dermal contact. Although the risks were within the tolerable limit, regular monitoring is suggested to reduce the risk of PTEs contamination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38665555/"}
{"id": "31112591", "title": "Classification of skin lesions using transfer learning and augmentation with Alex-net.", "text": "Skin cancer is one of most deadly diseases in humans. According to the high similarity between melanoma and nevus lesions, physicians take much more time to investigate these lesions. The automated classification of skin lesions will save effort, time and human life. The purpose of this paper is to present an automatic skin lesions classification system with higher classification rate using the theory of transfer learning and the pre-trained deep neural network. The transfer learning has been applied to the Alex-net in different ways, including fine-tuning the weights of the architecture, replacing the classification layer with a softmax layer that works with two or three kinds of skin lesions, and augmenting dataset by fixed and random rotation angles. The new softmax layer has the ability to classify the segmented color image lesions into melanoma and nevus or into melanoma, seborrheic keratosis, and nevus. The three well-known datasets, MED-NODE, Derm (IS & Quest) and ISIC, are used in testing and verifying the proposed method. The proposed DCNN weights have been fine-tuned using the training and testing dataset from ISIC in addition to 10-fold cross validation for MED-NODE and DermIS-DermQuest. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision measures are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and the existing methods. For the datasets, MED-NODE, Derm (IS & Quest) and ISIC, the proposed method has achieved accuracy percentages of 96.86%, 97.70%, and 95.91% respectively. The performance of the proposed method has outperformed the performance of the existing classification methods of skin cancer.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31112591/"}

Here, we report an eco-friendly hydrogel platform integrating recombinant humanized collagen type III (PCIII) expressed in Pichia pastoris with 4-arm PEG-SS via a one-step green crosslinking strategy. The engineered PEG-PCIII hydrogels exhibit tunable mechanics, enzymatic degradability, and rapid self-gelation through amine-NHS ester conjugation, while curcumin loading endows it with adjustable antioxidant activity. In vivo evaluation in a full-thickness skin defect model demonstrates that the curcumin-loaded hydrogel (PEG-PCIII-cur) orchestrates a pro-regenerative microenvironment, significantly enhancing VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, fibroblast-driven granulation tissue formation, and hair follicle neogenesis while optimizing collagen I/III stoichiometry for functional repair. Demonstrating accelerated functional wound repair with optimized collagen deposition in vivo, this strategy provides a highly promising platform integrating biosafety, structural resilience, and oxidative stress mitigation for future development in refractory wound management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40907913/"}
