Features include physical and sexual abuse as well as psychological abuse and controlling behaviors such as reproductive coercion or stalking. Intimate partner violence can occur in both heterosexual and same-sex relationships, though the risk may be higher in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning couples. Pregnancy remains an especially risky time for escalating abuse and also provides a window of opportunity for screening and intervention. Victims experience many consequences of abuse, including physical injuries, traumatic brain injury, and chronic conditions such as headaches, insomnia, pelvic pain, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Homicide is an especially devastating consequence, with 40-45% of female victims killed by an intimate partner, and homicide remains an important cause of pregnancy-related death. Routine screening is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) should remain vigilant for signs of abuse in their patients. Often the cycle of abuse makes it difficult for women to break free, and ob-gyns should continue to provide supportive care regardless of a woman's readiness to leave an abusive relationship.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31403968/"}

The program was designed to provide young women with accurate information on their health and well-being. Equipped with this information, we believe that young women would be poised to make better decisions for their future. We discussed community engagement and outreach to target schools in the surrounding Jamaica Hospital Medical Center community. In the midst of the pandemic, when educational systems moved toward virtual and electronic platforms, the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center obstetrics and gynecology team established a virtual program to promote the health and wellness of young women in middle and high schools. To accomplish these objectives, the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center obstetrics and gynecology team created seven modules that cover the following topics: Module 1-an informational session that addresses female hygiene and other health-related topics for young women and girls. This session allowed the team to assess the knowledge of our cohort. Module 2-a tutorial on the anatomy of the female body to empower young women and girls to understand how their bodies work. Modules 3 and 4-two sessions focused on puberty and the associated changes young women and girls should expect. Module 5-a session focused on sexually transmitted infections and their long-term effects, both physically and emotionally. Module 6-a session focused on physical and mental health wellness (including topics that resonate with our cohort such as body image and eating disorders). Module 7-a session focused on breast health, specifically gauged to the needs of our cohort.Each module required a commitment of at least 60 minutes, and, in some instances, a module had to be split into two sessions to ensure that the subject matter of that module was sufficiently covered. These modules were collaboratively developed from feedback provided by obstetricians in the community and educators at our target schools. The modules included interactive elements such as Poll Everywhere, videos, and diagrams that facilitated thoughtful and academic discussions. We successfully implemented this pilot program in two classes (one middle school class and one high school class), with the curriculum adjusted to cater to its audience. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both the students and their educator liaisons. We recognize that this program is an important engagement tool to be shared with other communities to inform a wider audience of young women and girls.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35512311/"}

Historically, these investors have played an outsized role in highly reimbursed specialties such as dermatology and anesthesia. Private equity is relatively new to women's health; when it has invested in this sector, it has typically done so in fertility services. In recent years, however, private equity firms have ventured into general obstetrics and gynecology, drawn by its promise of steady returns, its fragmented landscape, and the potential to integrate related laboratory, ultrasound, and fertility services into obstetric care. Obstetrics and gynecology practices may soon face the prospect of acquisition by private equity firms offering professional management, centralized back-office functions, streamlined customer service, and the capital needed to reach a broader patient base. However, physicians may have concerns about the tradeoffs that accompany private equity acquisitions. Private equity-owned practices have been known to increase the use of lucrative services, deploy advanced practice professionals in place of physicians, and circumvent conflict-of-interest laws, potentially distorting clinical care and driving up costs for consumers. Furthermore, firms generally aim to exit their investment within a 3- to 7-year timeframe, and short-term growth plans may leave physician-owners with uncertain long-term management. As private equity makes headway into women's health, physicians and policymakers must pay closer attention to how this activity can change practice patterns and transform local health care markets while also demanding transparency in the process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33156192/"}

Suboptimal integration of physiotherapy in modern obstetrics and gynecology especially in low resource settings is partly due to issues related to the awareness and attitudes of referring physicians. This study assessed the awareness and attitude levels towards physiotherapy in women's health among obstetricians/gynecologists and factors associated with its utilization in Ghana. A cross-sectional study was conducted among obstetricians/gynecologists working at a tertiary hospital in Ghana using an \"Awareness and Attitude Questionnaire\" adapted from a standardized questionnaire. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was performed and logistic regression was used to assess the association between doctors' awareness level of physiotherapy's role in women's health and years of clinical practice. Sixty-one (61) respondents comprising 7 consultants, 20 senior residents and 34 junior residents, with age median age of 35 years (range: 29-65 years) were recruited. There were more males than females (82% versus 18%) with a mean (SD) duration of practice of (9.41 ± 4.71) years. The participants reported a considerable awareness of physiotherapists' role in obstetrics (between 72.1% for intrapartum to 91.8% for postnatal) but wide variation in gynecology (from 19.7% in PID to 95. 1% in uterine prolapse). Consultants were more (71.4%) aware of the role of physiotherapy in antenatal care and gynecology while senior residents had more awareness in intrapartum and postnatal care. Junior residents generally showed lowest awareness levels. Duration of clinical practice (≥ 10years) was not significantly associated with doctors' awareness regarding the importance of physiotherapy in childbirth. There were mixed findings concerning doctors' attitudes toward physiotherapy: (1) 41% indicated that physiotherapists have been effective in their inter-professional relationship; (2) none of the doctors strongly agreed that physiotherapy may not contribute significantly to the complete well-being of gynecological patients. The main factors influencing utilization of physiotherapy were the perceived notion of non-availability of physiotherapists to cover various wards and physiotherapists not attending ward rounds with doctors to facilitate more education on the scope of physiotherapy practice. Although obstetricians/gynecologists showed appreciable awareness and attitudes towards physiotherapy, there remains a considerable gap in provider education to ensure optimal utilization of physiotherapy in contemporary obstetrics and gynecology. Further research is recommended to assess implementation challenges associated with regular utilization of physiotherapy services in women's health in the hospital.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38082319/"}

The US (n = 12,479) and the UK (n = 3,745) were responsible for the most RCTs, followed by Italy (n = 2,676) and China (n = 2,338). The largest percentage increase in annual publications was seen in Iran (n = 5 to n = 113, +2,160 %) and the Western Pacific Region (n = 16 to n = 171, +968.8 %). GDP was significantly correlated with the number of published RCTs in 2019 for the 25 most prolific countries (p < 0.001), but not with the proportion of RCTs funded. Despite growing contributions from the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions, most RCTs are still produced in a small nucleus of high-income countries. Increased international collaboration may benefit both high- and low-income countries.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36108449/"}

Obstetrics and gynecology physicians involved in patient care and medical education were invited to participate in online focus groups. We attempted to recruit participants from a diversity of subspecialties and regions of the United States. Eighteen physicians participated in five sessions conducted July-October 2023. Using an iterative process, two independent researchers coded transcripts to identify themes and subthemes. An additional reviewer resolved discrepancies. Eight themes were identified: dichotomy of care in restrictive versus protective states, loss of the patient-physician relationship, moral distress to physicians, legal concerns for physicians, new issues for training programs, loss of patient care experiences for trainees, loss of access to care for patients, and disappointment and frustration with policy makers. Themes were grouped into their effects on patients, trainees, physicians, and society overall, reflecting negative changes in patient care, training, and physician morale. This qualitative study found that physicians see the Dobbs ruling as having negative effects on patients, trainees, and physicians.

In addition, generational changes have contributed to increasing subspecialization, more desiring part-time employment, and earlier retirement. This article reviews data regarding changes in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Residency education is focusing more on a core curriculum in general obstetrics and gynecology, while subspecialty fellowship training has grown in popularity. There are no recent data to describe whether OB-GYNs are working fewer hours, yet more are employed in larger practices at mostly metropolitan locations. A team-based care model that incorporates nonphysician clinicians and digital conversion of clinical data has been encouraged to increase accessibility, improve comprehensiveness, commit to more continuity of care, and reduce redundancy. Compared with other medical specialists, OB-GYNs retire slightly earlier, especially females who will represent the field more. The specialty is moving toward a more comprehensive women's health care practice model that is more patient-centered, efficient, cost controlling, team-based, and adaptable to the needs of a diverse population.

Using McNemar's tests, the authors compared pre- and post-OSCE proportions of students reporting comfort levels with interactions involving terminally diagnosed patients, domestic violence, breast feeding, and other areas relevant to women's health. The proportion of students reporting comfort with each communication domain increased between pre- and post-OSCE assessments. The greatest improvements were observed for discussions related to domestic violence (41% gain), terminal illness (37% gain) and postpartum depression/psychosis (23% gain). Ninety-four percent felt that this Women's Health OSCE was a valuable learning experience. The authors conclude that this Women's Health OSCE was a successful addition to the medical student clinical curriculum as measured by student satisfaction and self-reported improved comfort levels with challenging communication paradigms. Future studies will investigate the effect that this learning activity has on competency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24156621/"}

This five-module (screening for fetal aneuploidy, prenatal diagnostic testing, prenatal carrier screening, pedigrees, and cancer genetics), interactive, case-based curriculum is linked to Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology objectives and can stand alone or work as part of an ultrasound or obstetrics rotation. Each module, containing objectives, assigned readings, and cases with answers, is used in a small-group format and can be completed in 20-30 minutes prior to the start of a clinical day. Modules were implemented at two academic centers with first-year OB-GYN residents. Qualitative real-time feedback and summative quantitative feedback from OB-GYN residents were obtained. Twenty-one OB-GYN residents completed the curriculum, which was well received by trainees and program directors. All residents (100%) felt the curriculum increased knowledge of prenatal genetics and felt more comfortable counseling patients after completion. Seventy-three percent enjoyed the discussion/case-based format; associated articles were found helpful by 100% of trainees. Facilitators enjoyed teaching the curriculum and felt learner knowledge improved dramatically. These low-cost modules were easy to implement and resulted in increased knowledge and confidence in prenatal and cancer genetics. Designed to stand alone and take as little as 20 minutes, the modules provide a helpful adjunct to a women's health rotation or didactic curriculum.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30800997/"}

The experience is directed to familiarise students with basic clinical management of gynaecological conditions, also develop communication and related core examination and procedural skills. Similarly, midwifery training encompasses independent care of low-risk pregnant women and assist in care of high-risk pregnancy in partnership with obstetricians. Although its necessary to acquaint most learners with core clinical skills in obstetrics and gynaecology, learning opportunities on patients can be limited, due to the intrusive nature of women's health examination. Simulation Based Education (SBE) can facilitate learning hands-on clinical examination and procedural skills, using realistic part-task and high-fidelity simulators prior to approaching patients. This can apply to both medical and midwifery undergraduate training, further creating opportunities for professional interaction and shared learning space to facilitate interprofessional education. IPE has been shown to improve professional relationships in practicing clinicians. This learning pedagogy can be applied in the undergraduate setting as well, to decrease risk of conflict and appreciate roles of other interprofessional staff in future clinical practice. In this chapter we highlight some challenges faced by medical and midwifery undergraduates in their learning from a global perspective.

The aim of this article is to report on the development, logistics, and successful implementation of our innovative curriculum. Based on results from a targeted needs-assessment, we designed a curriculum for both IM and OG residents to address curricular deficiencies in an efficient and effective manner. Procurement of support was achieved by reviewing overlapping competency requirements and results of the needs-assessment with the program directors. The curriculum consists of six ambulatory clinical cases which lead residents through a discussion of screening, diagnosis, prevention, and management within a modified PBL format. Residents select one learning objective each week which allows them to serve as content experts during case discussions, applying what they learned from their literature review to guide the group as they decide upon the next step for the case. This format helps accommodate different experience levels of learners, encourages discussion from less-vocal residents, and utilizes theories of adult learning. Sixty-five residents have participated in the curriculum since it was successfully implemented. IM residents report that the cases were their first opportunity to discuss the health concerns of younger women; OG residents felt similarly about cases related to older women. Implementation challenges included resident accountability. Residents identified the timing of the sessions and clinical coverage requirements as barriers to conference attendance. Interdisciplinary modified PBL conferences focusing on shared curricular needs in ambulatory women's health are well-received by both IM and OG residents. This format utilizes theories of adult learning and maximizes limited time and resources by teaching IM and OG residents concurrently, and can be successfully implemented at a large academic medical center.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19743908/"}

Effective contraception has become available to all women, and access to safe abortion has been secured through legislation. The majority of women are now in paid employment and women's position in society is dramatically improved. The decrease in mortality has affected women and men differently. Women live longer than men, but they tend to be afflicted by chronic non-lethal diseases. Issues which earlier were kept out of the public debate on women's health are now part of that debate. The improvements in women's health are not only a consequence of changing living conditions and better health services; they are also linked to changing attitudes to sexuality, love and marriage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10827497/"}

It imposes a significant symptom burden on patients and financial burden on the health care system. In most cases, acute cough is caused by a benign viral infection that will resolve without intervention. When needed, there are few evidence-based interventions to hasten the resolution of cough symptoms. Patients may request antibiotics or prescription cough syrups; however, these medications have little evidence of benefit and can be potentially harmful to the patient. It can be challenging for the clinician to provide reassurance while minimizing unnecessary prescriptions. The health care provider also must be alert to signs and symptoms that could signal a high-risk diagnosis that requires urgent evaluation. This monograph provides a review of the differential diagnosis for acute cough, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of cough, and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Also, it highlights warning signs and symptoms that should trigger an emergent referral and special clinical considerations in more vulnerable patient populations, including pregnant patients and geriatric patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022121/"}

Our data is derived from a single-site, qualitative study conducted at an urban academic OB/GYN residency program in the midwestern U.S. between 2018 and 2019. 36 residents, 9 from each post-graduate year, were randomly selected to complete a semi-structured interview on their perceptions of patient pain surrounding OB/GYN procedures. Grounded theory analysis of the OB/GYN residents' interviews revealed the idealized obstetrical patient is quiet and easily controlled. Residents praised women whom they believed were suppressing their labor pain, a racialized and classed concept that furthers misconceptions about the \"obstetric hardiness\" of Black women and the hypersensitivity of wealthy White women. Participants' conceptions of \"bad\" patients included those with less cultural health capital due to low health literacy and socioeconomic status, which impeded the patients' ability to participate in shared decision-making. Despite acknowledging the importance of patient autonomy regarding pain control during labor, the interviewed residents positioned themselves as the ultimate authority. Their subjective assessment of patients' pain inherently invoked their personal biases, such as conflating low socioeconomic status and race. Some participants posited an inverse relationship between hardship and pain, while others questioned whether those with low health literacy exaggerate their pain due to fear of the clinical encounter or to secure medical attention. Both framings have concerning implications for inadequate pain control and the unintentional perpetuation of obstetric violence and obstetric racism within the profession.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36155358/"}

The 4 levels of reflection students demonstrated were: listing, where students only state the clinical experience; describing, where students describe the clinical experience, including what they did well and what they did not; applying, where students discuss what they need to change and how to develop, and integrating, where students apply reflection to future clinical practice. Few respondents demonstrated the ability to reflect to the level of integration except with facilitated discussion. The range of experiences on which students reflected was appropriate. The information obtained from the emergent themes has been useful for programme development. At the end of the process students were still not reflecting at the level of integration.

As stated by the American and European Menopause Societies (NAMS and EMAS), hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is no longer believed to be protective for CVD; on the contrary, women benefit just as much as men from statins to lower their risk of heart disease. At the onset of menopause, women exhibit an increase in cholesterol and an increased risk of CVD. Unfortunately, hyperlipidemia is largely undertreated in women, although the rate of hypercholesterolemia among women is similar to that of men. More aggressive intervention is recommended for persons with multiple risk factors and/or monogenic dyslipidemias. In women affected by familial hypercholesterolemia in the homozygous and compound forms, treatment such as lipoprotein apheresis is also suggested. There is evidence for the use of these techniques even in pregnancy. An update on the most recent guidelines issued by AHA, EAS, NAMS and EMAS for the prevention of CVD in women along with a brief overview on the use of lipoprotein apheresis in women during pregnancy is reported.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23551672/"}

In an effort to address the health care needs of women on Hawai'i Island, the University of Hawai'i Obstetrics and Gynecology Residency Program established a 4-week required gynecology rotation in the town of Hilo. Between July 2019 and June 2020, third- and fourth-year obstetrics and gynecology residents provided outpatient gynecologic care and participated in gynecologic surgeries at Hilo-based medical facilities. A total of 9 residents participated in this Hilo-based rotation. This retrospective study extracted data from post-rotation evaluations. Eight out of 9 participating residents (89%) felt that the rotation slightly or far exceeded their expectations. After the rotation, 7 residents (78%) reported an interest in practicing in a rural community, while only 3 residents (33%) reported having this interest prior to the rotation.

CHCs close to \"deserts\" had more NP visits than those that were not. There was also a dose-response effect by MCD classification, with NP visits 3 times higher at CHCs located near areas without any outpatient and inpatient access to maternity care.

The ability to create clinical simulations through virtual reality (VR) may facilitate the accomplishment of these goals. The purpose of this paper is 2-fold: (1) to review the circumstances and equipment in industry, science, and education in which VR has been successfully applied, and (2) to explore the possible role of VR for training in obstetrics and gynecology and to suggest innovative and unique approaches to enhancing this training. Qualitative assessment of the literature describing successful applications of VR in industry, law enforcement, military, and medicine from 1995 to 2000. Articles were identified through a computer-based search using Medline, Current Contents, and cross referencing bibliographies of articles identified through the search. One hundred and fifty-four articles were reviewed. This review of contemporary literature suggests that VR has been successfully used to simulate person-to-person interactions for training in psychiatry and the social sciences in a variety of circumstances by using real-time simulations of personal interactions, and to launch 3-dimensional trainers for surgical simulation. These successful applications and simulations suggest that this technology may be helpful and should be evaluated as an educational modality in obstetrics and gynecology in two areas: (1) counseling in circumstances ranging from routine preoperative informed consent to intervention in more acute circumstances such as domestic violence or rape, and (2) training in basic and advanced surgical skills for both medical students and residents. Virtual reality is an untested, but potentially useful, modality for training in obstetrics and gynecology.

Obstetricians and gynecologists play a major role in delivering primary care to women and many of the services recommended by the Committee are part of the core set of obstetrics and gynecology services. The women's health amendment to the ACA (Federal Register, 2010) requires that new private health plans cover - with no cost-sharing requirements - preventive healthcare services for women. Congress requested that a review be conducted to ascertain whether there were any additional needed preventive services specific to women's health that should be included. The IOM Committee on Preventive Services for Women recommended eight clinical measures specific to women's health that should be considered for coverage without co-payment. The US Department of HHS reviewed and adopted these recommendations, and, as a result, new health plans will need to include these services as part of insurance policies with plan years beginning on or after 1 August 2012.

In 2014, with Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology's guidance, these divisions were referred to as academic specialists divisions and the faculty within as academic specialists to emphasize that they provide specialized women's health care in academic settings. The divisions comprised approximately 30% of departments' full-time faculty (median 12). In 27% of the departments, these divisions contributed more than half of departmental revenue, and 49% contributed 26-50%. Nearly 90% of divisions provided a sizeable proportion of the department's total teaching efforts. Compensation relied more on clinical productivity than on seniority, quality, academic contributions, or academic rank. Subsequently, five performance domains were identified to help divisions define divisional excellence: clinical, education, research, service & advocacy, and academic environment. Furthermore, excellent divisions were characterized as those with outstanding clinicians and educators who emphasize scholarly productivity. Although academic specialists contribute significantly to their departments' financial, clinical, and educational productivity, many have limited opportunities for scholarly activity.

The professional liability crisis is among the most potent factors affecting the types and numbers of services that obstetricians and gynecologists will provide in the future. The setting for obstetrics and gynecology practice is likely to be affected by advances in technology and trends in delivery and reimbursement systems. Two factors with potential to affect the organization of practice are the high numbers of women entering the specialty and increasing practice expenses, largely associated with liability costs. Other factors affecting future patterns of delivery include the anticipated aging of the female population and the changing social and economic roles of women. In particular, the feminist movement has focused more attention on women's health care and is expected to have a continuing impact on the delivery of obstetric and gynecologic care. The Council concludes that the most salient issues for the specialty in the future will be the following: (1) the direction of the professional liability crisis, (2) medical practice competition, (3) the feminization of poverty, (4) ethical issues arising from technological and social imperatives, (5) the changing gender profile of the specialty, and (6) the impact of the feminist movement on women's health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3316730/"}

Patient satisfaction with a sincere effort to provide quality of care remains the underlying theme with respect to obstetrical and gynecological patient care. These are basic tenets. What is the future of obstetrics/gynecology with respect to managed health care? It does make sense to have a planned and well-coordinated approach to delivery of obstetrical as well as gynecological care with the goal of \"quality\" delivered at a \"lower cost\" having an overall positive impact on OB/GYN health care delivery. Currently, there are a number of states which have specific legislation enabling a patient to proceed to secure gynecological without going through a \"gatekeeper.\" As we approach the year 2000 and beyond, clearly the prediction is that this will be an ever-increasing goal and objective of state medical societies to provide easy access for women's health care. Thus, we have awakened into a new era that is hallmarked by efficient, quality medical care provided by a physician who initially trained to be a subspecialist and now is an ambulatory primary care physician.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9199849/"}

An anonymous electronic survey was sent to all OBGYN residency applicants to US programs retrospectively evaluating 5 new recommended standards for the application process. This 15-item survey assessed the importance of the proposed standards and their impact on applicants' anxiety. The OBGYN residency application process is marked by increasing application numbers and no standardization for managing interview offers. The Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics (APGO) received a 5-year Reimagining Residency grant from the American Medical Association to improve the transition from undergraduate medical education (UME) to graduate medical education (GME) within OBGYN. The multiphase project, \"Transforming the UME to GME Transition for Obstetrics and Gynecology- Right Resident, Right Program, Ready Day One (RRR),\" began with Standardizing the OBGYN Application and Interview Process (SOAIP). This group recommended 5 new standards for all US OBGYN residency programs and applicants. Applicants for US OBGYN residency programs for the 2019 to 2020 application cycle completed the survey, with a 904/2508 (36.0%) response rate, including 762 complete responses (30.4%). Applicants reported that all 5 of the new standards would cause the least self-perceived anxiety (range 76.8% - 96.5%). The impact of the standards on perceived anxiety varied by student group, with International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and students with USMLE Step I scores <200 describing lesser impact compared to others. Despite these differences, all 5 standards were consistently noted to cause the least anxiety for all groups. Despite varying degrees of effects in different groups, the new OBGYN residency application standards caused the least anxiety for all subgroups of applicants. Implementing universal standards for the OBGYN residency application process was favorably perceived by applicants and caused the least anxiety for applicants.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35525780/"}

The students' theoretical knowledge and fetal image recognition skills were tested before and after the course. After the course, the students were asked to answer a course evaluation questionnaire. To standardize the teaching procedure, we used Peyton's 4-Step Approach to teach the skills needed for a German Society of Ultrasound in Medicine Level 1 ultrasound examiner. The multiple-choice question scores after the course showed statistically significant improvement (50 vs. 80 %; P < 0.001). The questionnaire revealed that students were satisfied with the course, felt that it increased their ultrasound knowledge, and indicated that they wanted more sonographic hands-on training in both obstetrics and gynecology and other medical fields.

In 2019 to 2020, the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) outlined standard dates for residency interview offers. A cross-sectional survey of applicants queried adherence to standardized interview offers, the number of interviews offers received, interviews completed, and application characteristics. Based on data that applicants in OBGYN with a mean number of 12 contiguous ranks are highly likely to match, factors associated with accepting an excessive percentage of interview offers were investigated in applicants with at least 12 interviews, using multiple logistic regression. All OBGYN applicants were sent an anonymous electronic survey distributed through the Electronic Residency Application Service in February 2020, with the subset of US MD senior respondents selected for this analysis. There were a total of 1292 US MD senior applicants into OBGYN in 2020, with 505 (39%) providing their interview information through the survey. Three hundred and sixty (71%) of US MD senior respondents received at least 12 interviews. Applicants receiving at least 12 interview offers completed a median of 83% of their interviews, and excessive interviewing was defined as completing greater than this median percentage. Receiving most interview offers on standardized interview offer dates resulted in less excessive interviewing despite controlling for number of programs applied to, applying as a couple, and United States Medical Licensing Exams Step 1 score. The standardization of interview offer dates may mitigate interview inflation by altering applicant behavior. This promising pilot data suggests that applicants may be able to make more informed decisions about which interview offers to accept when all offers are received on predetermined dates.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33153934/"}

The most common reason for article retraction is scientific misconduct. Unfortunately, article retraction often occurs years after publication, allowing inaccurate data to be widely distributed to readers. There exists a great need for validated screening criteria for obstetric journals to use when reviewing randomized controlled trials for scientific misconduct. This study aimed to compare retracted obstetric randomized controlled trials with nonretracted randomized controlled trials with regard to their inclusion of 7 quality metrics: prospective trial registration, trial registration number, ethics approval statement, name of the approving committee, statement of informed consent, adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, and a data sharing statement. Obstetric randomized controlled trials retracted between 1995 and 2021 identified through Retraction Watch were compared with nonretracted randomized controlled trials published between 2018 and 2020 with regard to inclusion of the 7 quality metrics. The main outcome was the difference in prospective trial registration. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of individual criteria met and the screening performance of quality criteria in predicting article retraction. A total of 150 randomized controlled trials were identified, of which 14 (9.3%) were retracted and 136 (90.7%) nonretracted. Retracted randomized controlled trials were less likely than nonretracted randomized controlled trials to be prospectively registered (14.3% vs 80.1%; P<.001). The median number of quality criteria met was lower for retracted randomized controlled trials (3 vs 6; P<.01). Using a cutoff of ≤4 criteria was associated with 85.7% (95% confidence interval, 57.2-98.2) sensitivity and 92.0% (95% confidence interval, 86.2-96.0) specificity in distinguishing the retracted randomized controlled trials from nonretracted studies.

Given these controversies and new changes, we investigated high-risk, class I recalls in women's health from 2002 through 2016. Class I recalls for medical devices are defined by the Food and Drug Administration as the most serious recall events and are designated for situations when there is a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. We defined a recall event as a group of unique Food and Drug Administration recalls that share a similar reason for recall and occurred within a 1-month time frame. In total, 7 class I recall events were identified encompassing 83 unique recalls affecting >88,000 medical devices in distribution. Recalls involved a broad range of devices used in women's health including diagnostic assays for chlamydia and gonorrhea, a laparoscopic tissue morcellator, and obstetrical/gynecological surgical kits. Four of 7 (57%) recall events were due to postmarketing problems such as improper packaging and labeling while the remaining 3 (43%) recalls were due to premarketing problems (eg, software issues). Additionally, 3 of 7 (43%) recall events were cleared via the 510(k) pathway, while the remaining were essentially exempt from any form of premarket approval. Two recall events involved sterility concerns of 71 surgical kits used in obstetrics and gynecological surgeries representing the majority of affected devices (78,423) in distribution. Class I medical device recalls are rare but serious events. Most recalled devices in women's health had minimal preapproval regulation and were recalled due to both premarketing and postmarketing reasons. Future regulatory efforts to improve postmarketing surveillance may mitigate the potential impact and frequency of class I recalls, but do not replace the need for a higher burden of proof for both safety and efficacy prior to medical device approval.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28500861/"}

Procedural cases of obstetrics and gynecology residents are tracked in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education database, with a minimum requirement of 15 operative vaginal deliveries before graduation. Nowadays, it is unknown whether the decreasing numbers of operative vaginal deliveries are affecting the delivery case volume and experience of obstetrics and gynecology residents. This study aimed to analyze the trends in the number and route of obstetrical deliveries, including operative vaginal deliveries, performed by graduating obstetrics and gynecology residents in the United States as logged within the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education database. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case log data were examined for graduating obstetrics and gynecology residents between 2003 and 2019. Delivery case volume numbers for spontaneous vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, forceps-assisted vaginal delivery, and vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery were extracted and analyzed over time using linear regression. To compare the variability in logged cases, residents at the 70th percentile for number of cases logged were compared with residents at the 30th percentile for number of cases logged for each delivery type (spontaneous vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, forceps-assisted vaginal delivery, and vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery). Overall, obstetrical delivery data for 20,268 obstetrics and gynecology residents were collected from 2003 to 2019. Over this period, the mean number of spontaneous vaginal deliveries significantly decreased over time by 20% from 320.8±138.7 to 256.1±75.6 (slope, -2.6; P<.001); however, no significant difference was noted in the reported cesarean delivery cases, with an 8% increase from 191.8±80.1 to 206.8±69.7 per graduating resident (slope, 0.136; P=.873). Notably, the mean reported cases of forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries decreased by 75% from 23.8±21.9 to 6±6.8 per graduating resident (slope, -0.851; P<.001). Similarly, the mean logs of vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery decreased by 37% from 23.8±17.1 to 15±9.5 (slope, -0.542; P<.001). The ratio of reported resident case logs comparing the volume at the 70th percentile with the volume at the 30th percentile demonstrated a significant decrease over time for spontaneous vaginal delivery (slope, -0.015; P<.001), cesarean delivery (slope, -0.015; P<.001), and vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery (slope, -0.033; P<.001) but was significantly increased for forceps-assisted vaginal delivery (slope, 0.07, P=.0065). In the reported Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs, we identified that the reported number of obstetrical deliveries performed by obstetrics and gynecology residents in the United States is changing, with a significant decline recognized from 2003 to 2019 in logged numbers of spontaneous vaginal deliveries, vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries, and forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries, without a difference in reported cesarean delivery cases per graduating resident. Furthermore, substantial variation is seen among resident volume nationwide, with the difference in high- and low-volume resident forceps-assisted vaginal delivery experience increasing over time.

Amenorrhea, infertility, hyperemesis gravidarum, and preterm birth have been linked to eating disorders (EDs). This study aimed to evaluate obstetrician-gynecologists' ED-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Questionnaires were sent to 968 Fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists between November 2007 and March 2008. Data were analyzed separately for generalists (provide obstetric and gynecologic care) and gynecologists only (treat only gynecologic patients). A majority of obstetrician-gynecologists assess body weight, exercise, body mass index, and dieting habits. Less than half assess ED history, body image concerns, weight-related cosmetic surgery, binging, and purging. Over half (54%) of generalists believed ED assessment falls within their purview. Most (90.8%) generalists agreed or strongly agreed that EDs can negatively impact pregnancy outcome. A majority rated residency training in diagnosing (88.5%) and treating (96.2%) EDs as barely adequate or less. Most knew low birth weight (91%) and postpartum depression (90%) are associated with maternal EDs, though over a third was unsure about several consequences. Some gender differences emerged; females screen for more ED indicators and are more likely to view ED assessment as within their role. Despite the consequences of EDs and the fact that most physicians agree EDs can negatively impact pregnancy, only about half view ED assessment as their responsibility. Only some weight- and diet-related topics are assessed, and there are gaps in knowledge of ED consequences. Obstetrician-gynecologists are not confident in their training regarding EDs. Improvement in knowledge and altering obstetrician-gynecologists' view of their responsibilities may improve ED screening rates.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19743910/"}

The issue concerns mainly the risk of contamination and the need for specific procedures to ensure a high degree of protection against infectious diseases, even if a disposable barrier cover is used. As there are no referenced quality criteria for these disposable probe covers, it is crucial to verify that they are CE marked. The use of condoms as probe covers is not recommended even though they present a lower rate of disruption compared to commercial probe covers. The global rate of probe cover perforation is of 1 to 9%. To date, there are no case reports of contamination by ultrasound examination, be it vaginal or abdominal. Nevertheless, every patient must be regarded as a potential source of infection. The French recommendations consider endovaginal ultrasound probes as semi-critical instruments and thus require intermediate-level disinfection. Because of the risk of disruption, American as well as Canadian and Australian recommendations insist on high-level disinfection of the probe. Every operator should follow reasonable hygiene rules and appropriate precautions should be taken in order to reassure the patients about the risks of contamination during any ultrasound examination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19081685/"}

By focusing on prenatal care, I look at ways in which Japanese gynaecologists formulate ideas about women's accountability for pregnancy outcomes and show how these ideas shape the practical strategies through which pregnancy is managed in medical institutions. While interrogating the perspectives these professionals bring into play, I am interested in the relationships between biomedicine, culture and the embodiment of women's roles. My findings reveal a broad range of physiological phenomena for which women are held accountable and a host of instructions they are expected to follow once they engage in prenatal care. Medical narratives render the pregnant body as the physical and mental environment that creates the foetus and highlights women's behaviour and health (rather than genes and chromosomes) as the major factors of foetal health. I show how the embodied mode of maternal responsibilities expected of women is mutually constituted by four interconnected realms of discourse and practice: the medical realm, cultural conceptions of self, national reproductive politics and the gendered division of labour.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17381816/"}

Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of a 2-year menopause medicine curriculum in improving OB/GYN residents' knowledge and self-assessed competency in menopause topics. We developed a menopause medicine-teaching curriculum for OB/GYN residents at our academic hospital-based residency program. The 2-year curriculum was composed of year 1: four 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab with cases presentations, and year 2: three 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab. Core topics included menopause physiology, hormone therapy, breast health, bone health, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disease. Pre- and posttests assessed resident knowledge and comfort in core topics, and a pre- and postcurriculum survey assessed utility and learning satisfaction. From July 2011 to June 2013, 34 OB/GYN residents completed the menopause curriculum annually with an average attendance at each module of 23 residents. Pre-/posttest scores improved from a mean pretest score of 57.3% to a mean posttest score of 78.7% (P < 0.05). Before the curriculum, most residents did not feel comfortable managing menopause patients with 75.8% reporting feeling \"barely comfortable\" and 8.4% feeling \"not at all comfortable.\" After the 2-year curriculum, 85.7% reported feeling \"comfortable/very comfortable\" taking care of menopause patients. The majority of residents (95.2%) reported the menopause curriculum was \"extremely useful.\" A 2-year menopause medicine curriculum for OB/GYN residents utilizing lectures and a lab with case studies is an effective modality to improve resident knowledge required to manage menopause patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26484842/"}

In addition to funding the majority of clinical research, organizing it to generate an evidence base that favors their innovations, and influencing the regulation of pharmaceutical drugs and devices, companies still spend substantial resources on direct attempts to shape the attitudes, dispositions, and prescribing behavior of physicians. This article sheds new light on our picture of the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians by examining a novel form of physician-directed communication produced by one prominent corporation. An interpretive, thematic analysis of ORGYN - the unique, full-length magazine published by the Organon Corporation between 1990 and 2003 - reveals two overarching messages it communicated to physicians during that period. First, it offered a compelling picture of the \"good work\" obstetricians and gynecologists do, which involves enabling women of reproductive age to control their fertility through contraception and infertility treatment, and providing symptom relief and preventive benefits to older women by increasing compliance with hormone therapy regimes. Second, it included pharmaceutical technology in every aspect of the doctor's work, portraying pharmaceutical corporations as the physician's \"natural partner\", and women patients as passive, disempowered objects of medical practice. Through these consistent messages, the print magazine ORGYN represented one important set of mechanisms by which a pharmaceutical corporation helped drive and sustain medicalization. The article ends with a consideration of the implications of ORGYN's messages for companies, doctors, women patients, and the study of medicalization.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21435768/"}

Using a staggered difference-in-differences design and county-level data, we found that TRAP laws were associated with an average reduction of 4.67 percent in the density of OB-GYNs per 100,000 women ages 15-44 during the period 1993-2021, between <i>Casey</i> and the <i>Dobbs v.

The objective of the current survey was to gain insights into the teaching methods, resources, and challenges at German medical universities in the field OB/GYN. This aims to document the current state of medical education and derive potential suggestions for improvements in the era of competency-based learning. The survey was conducted with teaching coordinators from the majority of OB/GYN departments at German universities.

The study received 30 responses from 41 universities. Differences were observed in the work environment of teaching coordinators concerning release from clinical duties for teaching purposes and specialized academic training. Overall, medical education and student motivation were perceived positively, with noticeable gaps, particularly in practical gynecological training. Deficiencies in supervision and feedback mechanisms were also evident. Subfields such as urogynecology and reproductive medicine appear to be underrepresented in the curriculum, correlating with poorer student performance.

Patient exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and other stressors is ubiquitous, and preconception and prenatal exposure to toxic environmental agents can have a profound and lasting effect on reproductive health across the life course. Prenatal exposure to certain chemicals has been documented to increase the risk of cancer in childhood; adult male exposure to pesticides is linked to altered semen quality, sterility, and prostate cancer; and postnatal exposure to some pesticides can interfere with all developmental stages of reproductive function in adult females, including puberty, menstruation and ovulation, fertility and fecundity, and menopause. Many environmental factors harmful to reproductive health disproportionately affect vulnerable and underserved populations, which leaves some populations, including underserved women, more vulnerable to adverse reproductive health effects than other populations. The evidence that links exposure to toxic environmental agents and adverse reproductive and developmental health outcomes is sufficiently robust, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine join leading scientists and other clinical practitioners in calling for timely action to identify and reduce exposure to toxic environmental agents while addressing the consequences of such exposure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24084567/"}

With increasing educational demands and limited hours in residency programs, dedicated time for training and achieving competency in ultrasound has diminished substantially. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine assembled a multi-Society Task Force to develop a consensus-based, standardized curriculum and competency assessment tools for obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound training in residency programs. The curriculum and competency-assessment tools were developed based on existing national and international guidelines for the performance of obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound examinations and thus are intended to represent the minimum requirement for such training. By expert consensus, the curriculum was developed for each year of training, criteria for each competency assessment image were generated, the pass score was established at or close to 75% for each, and obtaining a set of five ultrasound images with pass score in each was deemed necessary for attaining each competency. Given the current lack of substantial data on competency assessment in ultrasound training, the Task Force expects that the criteria set forth in this document will evolve with time. The Task Force also encourages use of ultrasound simulation in residency training and expects that simulation will play a significant part in the curriculum and the competency-assessment process. Incorporating this training curriculum and the competency-assessment tools may promote consistency in training and competency assessment, thus enhancing the performance and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound examination in obstetrics and gynecology.

The final analysis included 28 of 31 societies representing 27 countries (response rate 90%). The median formal duration of training was 5 years (range 4-7). There were mandatory requirements in addition to medical school graduation before specialisation could be started in 20 (71%) countries. The job opportunities after completion of training varied and included academic fellowships (n=21 [75%]), clinical fellowships/junior consultancy (n=21 [75%]), consultancy (n=11 [40%]), and private practice (n=23 [82%)]. Training and working as a specialist abroad was uncommon (≤20% in 21 [78%] and 26 [96%] countries respectively). Exams during ObGyn training were offered in 24 (85%) countries. Unemployment after completion of training was rare (<5% in 26 [93%] countries). Assessment of ObGyn specialists took place in 20 (71%) countries. The study illustrates that there are organisational variations in ObGyn training in Europe; A) The requirements to obtain a training post vary causing differences in the qualifications of trainees starting training. B) The duration of training varies. And C) newly trained specialists carry varying levels of responsibility. The results suggest that the content, organisation, and outcome of training differ across Europe. Differences due to political, social and cultural reasons are expected.

To determine the depth of knowledge that obstetric and gynaecology trainees have with regards to the PAG services provided at their Hospital, reflecting how widely PAG services have had an impact on trainees. The national survey was distributed to all deaneries in the UK for circulation to all their trainees via e mail during Nov 2017-March 2018. 28% of the trainees said there was a PAG clinic at their hospital, 46.9% did not have a clinic and 24.7% were unsure. 41.6% of the respondents were aware of BritSPAG, however only 10.4% were aware of the BritSPAG clinical standards for service planning with regards to PAG clinics. Nearly half were aware of the PAG specialist centre for their region but only 6.5% were aware of the BritSPAG UK map of services. A large majority (93.24%) didn't believe that trainees in O&G received adequate exposure to PAG in their training. This study represents the largest and first national survey to seek obstetric and gynaecology trainees' thoughts on the provision of PAG training in the UK today. Given that only 28% of trainees answering said that they were aware of a PAG clinic at their hospital, this indicates not only that many hospitals did not have a dedicated PAG clinic but more worryingly five of the trainees were not aware of the existence of a confirmed PAG clinic at their hospital, and therefore are potentially losing out on training opportunities.

It carries with it both short- and long-term sequelae for women that can affect both their physical and psychological wellbeing. Every day obstetric providers treat patients who have been assaulted. Timely identification can interrupt the cycle of violence, prevent further injury and initiate the help-seeking process. The objectives of this study were to survey how often Nigerian obstetrician-gynaecologists see these patients in their practice and to describe the demographics and management of their most recent case so as to give an idea of the extent of the problem. This is especially important as abuse is grossly under-reported because the victims are afraid to report it because of male dominance in society and the fear of losing their homes. We used a self-administered questionnaire survey of 138 practising obstetricians and gynaecologists in Nigeria. Questions were asked about the yearly estimation of cases seen and how recently a case was seen. The type of abuse, risk factors and management of their most recent case was also documented. Most (98.6%) obstetricians surveyed had previously managed a case of violence. The mean estimate of abused women seen was 7.0 per year. Details of the last case managed were recollected by 91.3% of respondents. The majority (51.6%) of patients were pregnant. The assailant was the husband in 69.8% of cases and the most common factor for abuse was as a result of women requesting money for the family needs from their husbands. The most common type of abuse was physical (79.4%), with 34.9% of patients sustaining cuts. Treatment and counselling were the forms of management in most cases. The police were informed in 9.5% of cases and one obstetrician had to give evidence in court. Of the pregnant abused women, 73.8% had live births. Better job opportunities and female empowerment can reduce the risk of violence. Obstetricians should screen routinely for battery, provide education about violence, assess the danger, review safety plans and refer women appropriately.

There were no differences between residents and those in practice within and between cities. Comprehensive care was most often defined as excluding chronic medical care issues and most likely as focusing on screening and referring women. The OBGYN recognized their common role as the exclusive clinician for women was, in part, a consequence of patients' nonadherence with primary care referrals. Barriers and strategies were identified within each thematic area. Additional training, development of referral networks, and access to local and practice specific data are needed to support an increased role for the OBGYN in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. Establishment of evidence-based screening and referral recommendations, specific to women across the age spectrum, may enable clinicians to capitalize on this important prevention opportunity.

Obstetric providers may feel poorly equipped to address this issue comfortably and effectively. We designed this didactic module for obstetric residents with previous experience taking patient histories and delivering clinical care. The module was delivered with a faculty member and three additional facilitators with expertise in communication skills training. The session included 60 minutes of background information followed by a 15-minute presentation of a communication template for assessing trauma history. Using a practice case, residents had 45 minutes to practice in small groups, with the facilitators serving as the patient in the role-play. In the 2015-2016 academic year, 21 obstetric residents participated in this module. All residents (100%) endorsed favorable beliefs regarding the importance of assessing trauma history and using trauma-informed care. On average, three-fourths (77%) demonstrated basic awareness of issues related to trauma in medical populations. Most residents (>85%) reported a high sense of efficacy in delivering trauma-informed care in some areas, while fewer (64%) reported efficacy specifically in educating patients about signs and symptoms of traumatic stress. The module was well received overall, with participants indicating that clinical training in trauma-informed communication was needed to enhance their sense of efficacy in this area. This learning exercise provided training in a critical communication skill while highlighting areas for further development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32704539/"}

To explore how Catholic obstetrician-gynecologists integrate their religious values and professional obligations related to family planning services. In this qualitative investigation, in 2018, US-based obstetrician-gynecologists were recruited through an online survey and were invited to participate in audio-recorded telephone interviews using a semistructured interview guide. Participants were obstetrician-gynecologists who self-identified as Catholic and reported providing reproductive health care as follows: (1) provide natural family planning only (low practitioners), (2) provide additional contraceptive methods (moderate practitioners), and (3) provide family planning services including abortion (high practitioners). The study purposively sampled those with higher self-reported religiosity. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to February 2019. The primary outcome was understanding how participants describe integration of Catholic values with family planning service provision. The telephone interviews explored their integration of Catholic values and professional obligations, and 3 coders analyzed the responses using grounded theory. Among the 34 Catholic obstetrician-gynecologists interviewed (27 women [79.4%]), there were 10 low, 15 moderate, and 9 high practitioners from 19 states. Participants' description of morality was consistent with Albert Bandura's Social-Cognitive Theory of Moral Thought and Action. The findings were used to create a modified framework. Within each group of physicians, 3 themes demonstrating their reconciliations between Catholic values and professional obligations emerged; each of these themes reflected one of the medical ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, or justice. All 10 low practitioners primarily promoted natural family planning approaches to avoid iatrogenic risks and none provided abortion, reflecting nonmaleficence. Alternatively, moderate practitioners focused on nonmaleficence by offering contraception to prevent abortions. High practitioners primarily promoted patient autonomy by separating religious doctrine from medical practice. All had concerns for beneficence. In each group, 1 of the 4 medical ethical principles was underrepresented. In this qualitative analysis, Catholic obstetrician-gynecologists establish their family planning care provision practices by emphasizing certain moral and/or ethical principles over others. These findings highlight how physician morality in the realm of family planning service provision often involves certain religious and/or professional reconciliations. Understanding the dilemmas Catholic obstetrician-gynecologists face can guide professional development efforts and inform ongoing discussions about conscientious objection and provision.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33044549/"}

The students completed self-assessment questionnaires at the beginning and end of the attachment.

There was a significant increase in the level of interest in the future practice of obstetrics only in the general practice group. However, this difference could be explained by the greater number of students in the general practice group who were by chance in the 'no or don't know' category at the start of their attachment.

Most residents reported inadequate exposure to Gyn ultrasound, and most residents and physicians agreed that it is important for obstetrician/gynecologists to be proficient in Gyn ultrasound and that the development of a standardized Gyn ultrasound curriculum for residency programs is important. Current ultrasound education in Ob/Gyn varies across Canadian residency programs. Training in Gyn ultrasound is lacking, and both trainees and physicians confirmed the need for a standardized Gyn ultrasound curriculum for residency programs in Canada.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26254157/"}

Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 29 obstetricians and gynaecologists from England, Belgium and Italy, exploring training and scope of practice, following a common topic guide. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded following a common coding framework in the language of the country concerned. Completed coding frames, written summaries and key quotes were then translated into English and were cross-analysed among the researchers to identify emerging themes and comparative findings. Although medical and specialty qualifications in each country are mutually recognised, there were great differences in training regimes, with different emphases on theory versus practice and recognition of different subspecialties. However all countries shared concerns about the impact of the European Working Time Directive on trainees' skills development. Reflecting differences in models of care, the scope of practice of OBGYN varied among countries, with pronounced differences between the public and private sector within countries. Technological advances and the growth of co-morbidities resulting from ageing populations have created new opportunities and greater links with other specialties. In turn new ethical concerns around abortion and fertility have also arisen, with stark cultural differences between the countries. Variations exist in the training and scope of practice of OBGYN specialists among these three countries, which could have significant implications for the expectations of patients seeking care and specialists practising in other EU countries. Changes within the specialty and advances in technology are creating new opportunities and challenges, although these may widen existing differences. Harmonisation of the training and scope of practice of OBGYN within Europe remains a distant goal.

It is a prospective study which took place in the gynecology-obstetric unit of the University of Nantes. Thanks to a questionnaire called \"Evaluation of the teaching during a gynecologic-obstetric training course\", we evaluated the feelings of 21 medical students about their two-month training course. This questionnaire of 27 items is divided in several parts. The first one is about the quality of the teaching, the second about planification, the third about the quality of the learning resources, and the fourth is about the educational quality of each teacher (interaction teacher-student). The fifth one evaluates the perception of this work experience by the student, notably his clinical activity and his personal implication in the unity. There are also some open questions which point out the positive aspects of the teaching but also its failings and the parts that must be improved. We give here the details of the different stages of this assessment from the questionnaire up to the results, mentioning their limits considering the conceptual orientations and the methodological orientations chosen.

Yet, recent research has neglected the intra-occupational processes influencing medical specialisation. This article aims to correct this oversight. It develops an historical account of intra-occupational factors influencing the decision to establish gynaecologic oncology as American ob/gyn's surgical subspecialty in 1972. Working within the framework initially developed by Everett C. Hughes and his students, the article examines this development as the outcome of a three-party relationship among gynaecologic oncologists, American ob/gyns, and gynaecologic pelvic surgeons. Aggressive movement by the gynaecologic pelvic surgeons challenging the established élite's identity definition for the ob/gyn specialty helped spur official recognition of gynaecologic oncology, a less threatening subspecialty. The article draws theoretical implications from the case regarding the role of a threatening other in influencing the specialisation process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21426362/"}

To assess the quality of debriefing, the notes were reviewed for evidence of documentation on discussion for reason, procedure and complications of mode of delivery, advised plan for next delivery and contraception advice. Feedback questionnaires were given to patients on discharge to complete, regarding their understanding on the events surrounding their delivery. To assess how well doctors reviewed their own deliveries, we searched the notes for documented evidence of primary operator review.

In this paper the results obtained after a four years practical application of these clinical techniques are presented. The factors considered were the type of assistance offered in correlation with different outcomes for both mother and child.

During the Nazi regime, the official \"health command\" policy monitored by the Nazi party promoted home delivery under midwife supervision, both by pertinacious propaganda and partly also by decrees and ordinances. The official line of argument against clinical obstetrics consisted of a queer and highly questionable mélange of ideology and distored facts brought forward by the so-called \"Reichsgesundheitsführer\" Dr. Leonardo Conti and his mother, Mrs Nanna Conti as head of the Party-sponsored Midwives Association. The \"Midwives Law\" was promulgated on 21 December 1938 prescribing compulsory consultation of a midwife for every delivery. By the end of 1939 gynaecologists eventually rallied in protest against legislative measures to restrict clinical obstetrics, by means of a memorandum penned by the German Association for Gynaecology. This memorandum was scheduled for circulation among all the members of the association. The pressure exercised by this memorandum resulted in tough negotiations amounting to a tug-of-war between representatives of the German Association for Gynaecology and Dr. Conti. This led eventually not only to an abandonment of the attacks against clinical obstetrics but also to an official and unreserved recognition of its achievements. In addition, the \"Reichsgesundheitsführer\" issued \"Directives for regulating obstetrics procedures\" in 1940/41 in which it was laid down that it would be left to the decision of the expectant mother to choose where she would prefer to deliver her child.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3910511/"}

The texts were read for a hidden curriculum of sexist ideology. This study is a partial replication of a study carried out by Scully and Bart in the United States eighteen years ago. The findings of Scully and Bart demonstrated that obstetric and gynaecological texts contained outdated and erroneous views about women's sexuality and portrayed women in stereotyped roles. It was anticipated that institutionalized changes may have occurred since the time that Scully and Bart carried out their research and the texts would reflect this accordingly; particularly with the effect of the women's health movement which has been expressing dissatisfaction with the health care system. The findings of this research show that sexist ideology still pervades the obstetric and gynaecological texts, though to a lesser extent than eighteen years ago. There are some differences from what Scully and Bart discovered, but major similarities were found. The main difference between the results of this study and the findings of Scully and Bart, is that the majority of texts analysed here did not contain outdated and incorrect information about women's sexual response. For example, none of the texts refer to vaginal orgasm as the 'mature' response for women. The main similarity is that women's sexuality is still depicted with a heterosexual perspective, with marriage and mothering the 'natural' aspirations of all women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2331867/"}

Identification of frailty can help predict patients at high risk of peri-operative complications and allow a collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach to their care. A survey was conducted to assess the confidence and knowledge of trainees in obstetrics and gynecology regarding identification and management of peri-operative issues encountered in frail gynecological oncology patients. A web-based survey was distributed via the Audit and Research in Gynaecological Oncology (ARGO) collaborative and UK Audit and Research Collaborative in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (UKARCOG) . The survey on the management of frail peri-operative patients was disseminated to doctors-in-training (trainees) working in obstetrics and gynecology in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland. Specialty (ST1-7), subspecialty, and general practice trainees, non-training grade doctors, and foundation year doctors currently working in obstetrics and gynecology were eligible. Consultants were excluded. Study data were collected using REDCAP software hosted at the University of Manchester. Responses were collected over a 6-week period between January and February 2020. Of the 666 trainees who participated, 67% (425/666) reported inadequate training in peri-operative management of frail patients. Validated frailty assessment tools were used by only 9% (59/638) of trainees and less than 1% (4/613) were able to correctly identify all the diagnostic features of frailty. Common misconceptions included the use of chronological age and gender in frailty assessments. The majority of trainees (76.5%, 448/586) correctly answered a series of questions relating to mental capacity; however, only 6% (36/606) were able to correctly identify all three diagnostic features of delirium. A total of 87% (495/571) of trainees supported closer collaboration with geriatricians and a multidisciplinary approach. Obstetrics and gynecology trainees reported inadequate training in the peri-operative care of frail gynecological oncology patients, and overwhelmingly favored input from geriatricians. Routine use of validated frailty assessment tools may aid diagnosis of frailty in the peri-operative setting.

This primary headache disorder, which often may be debilitating, has a higher prevalence in women than in men that is likely related to times of hormonal changes throughout the reproductive life cycle, such as menarche, pregnancy, postpartum period, lactation, perimenopause, and menopause, as well as to external hormonal changes associated with the use of oral contraceptives and hormone therapy. The obstetrician-gynecologist is well positioned to recognize and treat migraine and to recognize a potential relationship between estrogen fluctuation and migraine exacerbation. Migraine frequency is likely to decrease during pregnancy, but migraine often recurs during breastfeeding. Because headache does occur during these reproductive events, a careful evaluation and possible medication change may be necessary. Women also have unique risks for secondary headache during pregnancy, particularly pregnant women with a history of migraine. Therefore, a large portion of this monograph is devoted to evaluation, management, and drug safety in pregnant or breastfeeding women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241597/"}

As there is a dearth of cadaver training programs, it is important to evaluate them. The goal of this study was to estimate if our cadaver training program significantly and relatively rapidly taught residents laparoscopic surgical skills. Observational, timed comparative study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). University of Louisville School of Medicine, Fresh Tissue Laboratory, Louisville, KY. Twenty-nine obstetric/gynecology residents (15 postgraduate year PGY 2 and 14 PGY 3) participated in the study. During 5 half days, we compared the performance of each postgraduate year (PGY) 2 and PGY 3 obstetric/gynecology resident to his or her own results on five outcome skills before and after training in lightly embalmed cadavers. The testing was performed at the beginning and at the end of the week so that all improvement was secondary only to the training experience with the cadaver. Residents were assessed using laparoscopic techniques in a physical-reality simulator for three outcomes: bead transfer time, number of beads transferred, and suturing time on a stuffed vinyl glove and in two specific areas of the cadaver pelvis, with one slightly more difficult than the other. Assessment of suturing time was made on the two distinct tasks using the embalmed cadavers. Although the number of residents was relatively small, it covered two levels for one year. The residents were assessed on a simulator before and after laparoscopic surgical training on the cadaver. The median decrease in bead transfer time (task I, simulator) was 38.5 seconds (p=.02); 69% of the residents showed some reduction in time to complete this task. The median increase in the number of beads transferred (task II, simulator) was 2.5 beads (p=.0001); 72.4% of the residents transferred at least one more bead after training. The median decrease in suture time (task III, simulator) was 63.5 seconds (p=.001); 79.3% of the residents performed this task more quickly after training. The median decrease in suture time (task IV, cadaver) was 54.5 seconds (p=.001); 72.4% of the residents showed improved performance on this task after training. The median reduction in suture time (task V, cadaver) was 53.5 seconds (p<.001); 82.8% of the residents completed this task more quickly after training. This cadaver surgical training program appeared to significantly improve laparoscopic surgical techniques in PGY 2 and PGY 3 obstetric/gynecology residents in a relatively short time.

Redesign will continue to drive consolidation of providers into larger groups to cover the cost of the needed infrastructure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25173186/"}

This cross-sectional observational study identified all U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residencies with global health training programs, described residency and program characteristics, and evaluated the publications resulting from them. Eligible articles included those published in 2011-2016 about work done in a global health training location by global health training faculty. All eligible articles were evaluated for academic effect. The inclusion of host country authors on articles served as a proxy for reciprocity. Article content was assessed to evaluate whether programs addressed Millennium Development Goals. Among 245 obstetrics and gynecology residencies, 196 (80%) had global health training programs. Location and faculty members were identified for 67 (34%) programs, of which 26 (39%) had global health training faculty who had published articles meeting inclusion criteria. Of 698 articles reviewed, 78% addressed at least one Millennium Development Goal, including 39% that addressed improving maternal health (Millennium Development Goal 5). Approximately half (48%) of authors were from host countries. Most obstetrics and gynecology residencies are offering global health training. The majority of programmatic work addresses Millennium Development Goals and thus is aligned with global health priorities. The effect and reciprocity of global health training programs varies across institutions. Residencies could benefit from internal analysis of their global health training programs to evaluate whether knowledge gained is being disseminated and to ensure equitable partnerships and the creation of sustainable, influential initiatives.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30303903/"}

This study aimed to identify obstetrical randomized controlled trials published in top weekly general medical journals and monthly obstetrics and gynecology journals, to assess their quality in reporting and identify factors associated with publication in different journals. The 4 weekly medical journals with the highest 2019 impact factor (New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, and The BMJ), the top 4 monthly obstetrics and gynecology journals with obstetrics-related research (American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, and the BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology), and the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology Maternal-Fetal Medicine were searched for obstetrical randomized controlled trials in the years 2018 to 2020. The primary outcome was the number of obstetrical randomized controlled trials published in the obstetrics and gynecology journals vs the weekly medical journals and the percentage of trials published, overall and per journal. The secondary outcomes included the proportion of positive vs negative trials overall and per journal and the assessment of the study characteristics of published trials, including quality assessment criteria. Of the 4024 original research articles published in the 9 journals during the 3-year study period, 1221 (30.3%) were randomized controlled trials, with 137 (11.2%) randomized controlled trials being in obstetrics (46 in 2018, 47 in 2019, and 44 studies in 2020). Furthermore, 33 (24.1%) were published in weekly medical journals, and 104 (75.9%) were published in obstetrics and gynecology journals. The percentage of obstetrical randomized controlled trials published ranged from 1.5% to 9.6% per journal. Overall, 34.3% of obstetrical trials were statistically significant or \"positive\" for the primary outcome. Notably, 24.8% of the trials were retrospectively registered after the enrollment of the first study patient. Trials published in the 4 weekly medical journals enrolled significantly more patients (1801 vs 180; P<.001), received more often funding from the federal government (78.8% vs 35.6%; P<.001), and were more likely to be multicenter (90.9% vs 42.3%; P<.001), non-United States based (69.7% vs 49.0%; P=.03), and double blinded (45.5% vs 18.3%; P=.003) than trials published in the obstetrics and gynecology journals. There was no difference in study type (noninferiority vs superiority) and trial quality characteristics, including pretrial registration, ethics approval statement, informed consent statement, and adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines statement between studies published in weekly medical journals and studies published in obstetrics and gynecology journals. Approximately 45 trials in obstetrics are being published every year in the highest impact journals, with one-fourth being in the weekly medical journals and the remainder in the obstetrics and gynecology journals. Only about a third of published obstetrical trials are positive. Trials published in weekly medical journals are larger, more likely to be funded by the government, multicenter, international, and double blinded.

The curriculum forms the backbone of the 7-year speciality training programme in obstetrics and gynaecology. The programme is divided into three levels of training: basic, intermediate and advanced. The programme is competency-based rather than being focussed on time periods or the number of hours or number of procedures required to progress through the programme. Successful progress is achieved by meeting the requirements at designated waypoints defined within the programme. The curriculum outlines not only the knowledge and technical clinical skill requirements, but also the professional skills and attitudes that must consistently be adopted by health-care professionals in a modern health service.

Residency programs in obstetrics and gynecology provide exposure to research training that is variable but frequently limited. This creates challenges for junior faculty and in many cases limits their research productivity, typically measured by published original research articles and grant funding. This frequently disadvantages academic specialists in promotion compared with their subspecialty fellowship-trained colleagues. A few research fellowship programs were recently launched to address this issue. However, these programs are not uniform and encounter challenges such as sustainable funding. In this article, building on knowledge from current academic specialist fellowship programs, we discuss the needs, challenges, and proposed solutions. We also propose some details needing further discussion among the academic obstetrics and gynecology community. We discuss how such fellowships can integrate with current development and training opportunities such as the Women's Reproductive Health Research award, Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health award, other K and K-type career development programs, NIH T32 grants, and clinical research courses for obstetricians and gynecologists.

We selected randomized controlled trials comparing patient decision aids with usual clinical practice or a control intervention. Thirty-five randomized controlled trials, which reported data from 9,790 women, were included. Patient decision aids were evaluated within a wide range of clinical scenarios relevant to obstetrics and gynecology, including contraception, vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, and pelvic organ prolapse. Study characteristics and quality were recorded for each study. The meta-analysis was based on random-effects methods for pooled data. A standardized mean difference of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. When compared with usual clinical practice, the use of patient decision aids reduced decisional conflict (standardized mean difference -0.23; 95% CI -0.36, to -0.11; 19 trials; 4,624 women) and improved patient knowledge (standardized mean difference 0.58; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.71; 17 trials; 4,375 women).

Six hundred physicians completed the survey in six countries.

For treatment of atrophic vaginitis, 86% agreed that local estrogen was the most effective course of action. While 82% of participants were aware of the latest recommendations on low-dose HRT, and estrogen dose in particular, 67% cited lowering the progestogen dose as important. With regard to the recent negative media coverage on HRT, 78% of physicians felt this was unjustified. These results provide reassurance that health-care professionals in Europe and the US, experienced in treating women with climacteric symptoms, have not lost confidence in HRT.

The qualitative data indicated four themes: uncertainty about the future, concerns about patient care, concerns and discrepancies in OBGYN training, and suggestions and hopes for the future. Trainees, even if currently well trained in their view, are concerned about other trainees, patient safety in OBGYN clinical situations, and uncertainty about their own careers and the future of OBGYN. They are concerned that restrictions on family planning and pregnancy management in certain states will restrict care access, limit patient safety, and affect the OBGYN workforce in those locations. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This survey of OBGYN trainees indicates significant uncertainty about equity for training and patient care in clinical situations potentially affected by the Dobbs decision and a wider concern about how this will affect the field of OBGYN and the safety of women in the United States.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40499057/"}

A survey was administered to all residents taking the 2019 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology Exam and concurrently to program directors in all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited training programs. The survey was designed to assess resident confidence to perform robotic hysterectomies by the time of graduation. No patients were included in the study. The only intervention was administration of the survey. De-identified survey data were analyzed using chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. A total of 5473 resident respondents and 241 residency program directors were included in the study. Fifty-two percent of graduating residents reported that they felt they were given surgical autonomy to perform robotic hysterectomies, and 53.7% reported that they could perform one independently (if it was an \"emergency\" and they had to). By the time of graduation, only 59% of residents reported confidence performing a robotic hysterectomy, and only 56% reported they felt that it would be an important procedure for their future career. Program directors were significantly more likely to report that their residents were given autonomy to perform robotic hysterectomy by graduation (61.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 54.3-67.3]), could perform a robotic hysterectomy independently (60.9% [95% CI, 53.9-67.6]), or could perform a robotic hysterectomy by graduation (70.2% [95% CI, 63.5-76.3]) than residents themselves (38.6% [95% CI, 37.2-40.0], 22.8% [95% CI, 21.6-24.0], 62.6% [95% CI, 61.2-64.0], respectively).

The aim of the study was to assess the metrological qualities of the GOALS questionnaire after ratification in French language. To produce a French version of the GOALS surgical competence assessing tool according to an established method (translation - backward translation - retranslation) and to check the metrological qualities (user satisfaction, acceptability, reliability and validity) of this questionnaire through observing residents while in training program on 22 residents in Gynaecology Obstetrics during the laparoscopy training, with the performance of a nephrectomy on a porcine model. The discrepancies in the initial translations were mainly due literal translations. Only synonymous differences were observed in the two backward translations. Comparison with original version led to 8 minor changes. No changes occurred between the 2 French versions. Satisfaction surveys when using the GOALS questionnaire by both examiners and students are similar. Face and content validity seemed good and there is no significant discrepancy between the examiners and the students (11.5 [9-15]; 12.4 [9-15]; P=0.40). Assessment by examiners showed an median value of 17.8 [9-26] with good correlation (α=0.80). By contrast, self-assessment, although there is no significant discrepancy, showed heterogeneity.

{"id": "23342903", "title": "[Clinical practice guidelines of the Team of Experts of the Polish Gynecological Society: management of the intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy].", "text": "Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) constitutes the most common, reversible liver disease closely connected with pregnancy and spontaneously resolving in puerperium. ICP usually reoccurs in consecutive pregnancies (45-90%), often in a more intensified form. Many compounds (hormones, cytokines, medicines, endotoxins) can impair transport in the hepatocyte, disturb the intracellular transport and increase the permeability of the intercellular connections. As a result, the elements of bile may appear in the peripheral blood. Gestational cholestasis constitutes a classic example of intrahepatic cholestasis. The etiology of ICP is multifactorial with hormonal, genetic and environmental factors participating in the process. The diagnosis is based on the presence of pruritus, elevated values of bile acids in the blood serum and of aminotransferases (aspartic, aminopropionic and gamma-glutamylotranspeptydase (AspAt, AlAt, GGTP)), as well as spontaneous remission in the second or third week after childbirth, of lack of other illnesses causing pruritus and icterus. Clinical and biochemical symptoms of ICP include: pruritus without skin rash (usually after 30 weeks of gestation), mild icterus, steatorrhea etc. Abnormalities in the laboratory tests of the LFT (liver function tests) encompass: an increase in the serum concentration of fatty acids (BA) which can be the first and only laboratory abnormality. Concentrations surpassing 10 micromol/l are considered to be abnormal. Concentration of BA higher than 40 micromol/l allows to recognize a case of severe ICP, connected with the risk of premature delivery presence of the meconium liquor, surgical means of delivery and low APGAR score of the newborn (< 7 pt). In about 80% of pregnant women with ICP, the BA concentration ranges between 10-40 micromol/l, but perinatal results are comparable with uncomplicated pregnancies. Some authors are of the opinion that abnormal AlAt value is the most sensitive test, other authors consider the abnormal values of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin to be the most pathognomonic factors. Other abnormal tests include: higher activity of alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase correlated with an increase of the alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin; mild metabolic acidosis; dyslipidemia with elevated concentrations of the total lipids, total cholesterol and free LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein; abnormal glucose tolerance test. ICP constitutes a medical problem that carries a considerable risk for the fetus, resulting from an increased flow of bile acids to the fetal blood circulation (elevated level in the amniotic fluid, in the umbilical blood serum and meconium). The risk of adverse effects for the fetus correlates with the rise of BA concentration in maternal blood serum. Cholestasis increases the risk of premature labor, presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid, fetal bradycardia, intrauterine asphyxia and stillbirth, particularly when the concentration of serum bile acids on an empty stomach is above 40 micromol/l. However, maternal clinical signs and symptoms do not correlate with the fetal outcome. Aspiration of bile acids or their accumulation in the fetal blood circulation are responsible for the increased frequency of RDS appearing in ICP. The aim of the obstetric management of ICP is to reduce maternal symptoms and biochemical disorders and to minimize the risk of premature delivery fetal distress and sudden death. ICP management should include: bed regime, light, low-fat diet, no stress, upper abdomen ultrasound examination, LFT tests and thrombotic tests once a week, monitoring of the fetal well-being with the available biophysical methods, pharmacotherapy and therapeutic termination of pregnancy in case of serious illness and/or the fetal distress. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the basis of the pharmacological treatment of pregnant women and currently constitutes the most promising treatment option of ICP. UDCA is administered orally in the dosage of 10-16 mg/kg/24, what in practice means 250-300 mg/2-3 times a day.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23342903/"}

The projection results show that between the years 2000 and 2025, 59% of the obstetricians and gynaecologists would retire. The rising proportion of women in obstetrics and gynaecology and shorter working hours of both men and women will have a compounding effect on physician retirement. The paper concludes that the changes in practice, increasing feminisation and retirement from the workforce coupled with higher female population growth in the childbearing years and slightly higher fertility mean that ensuring an adequate obstetricians and gynaecologists in Australia will be a significant challenge over the next 20 years. There is the potential for shortages in obstetric care with particular risks for rural areas.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18447067/"}

However, the role of OBGYN clinics in cardiovascular disease prevention is largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to examine rates of hypertension recognition in women<50 years of age who presented with elevated blood pressures in family practice and internal medicine (medicine) OBGYN clinics and to compare these rates across clinic type. The study's population consisted of 34 627 nonpregnant women ages 18 to 49 years with new-onset hypertension (defined as 2 consecutive visits with elevated blood pressures of systolic blood pressure≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure≥90 mm Hg with no previous hypertension history) from 2002 to 2006. Multivariate logistic regressions predicting the clinical recognition of hypertension (a recorded diagnosis of hypertension and/or an antihypertensive prescription by any provider within 1 year of the second elevated blood pressure) assessed the association between hypertension recognition and the clinic where the second elevated blood pressure was recorded. Analysis showed that hypertension was recognized in <33% of women with new-onset hypertension. Women whose second consecutive elevated blood pressure was recorded in OBGYN clinics were less likely to be recognized as having hypertension within 12 months by any provider compared with women whose second consecutive elevated blood pressure was recorded in a medicine clinic (odds ratio: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.48 to 0.54]).

The R-track is designed to assess professional competence profiles and contains 66 items covering the following eight competence areas: \"Mental abilities\", \"Social sensibility\", \"Psychomotor and multitasking abilities\", \"Solutions orientation\", \"Social interactive competences\", \"Personality traits\", \"Verbal competences\" and \"Resistance capacity\". The mean scores of single items and competence areas were calculated. Results were compared between gender, training level, and place of practice. The participation rate was 65.5%, with 201 physicians returning the questionnaire. In this sample, 50.2% of them were in training and 49.8% were practicing O&G specialists. The proportion of physicians working in a hospital setting was 64.7% while 30.3% worked in private practice.

Whether there is equitable access to the prestige and resources of endowed professorships merits evaluation. We investigated this question in obstetrics and gynecology, a field that focuses on the health of women and in which women are much better represented than other specialties of medicine. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We compiled a list of the top 25 United States departments of obstetrics and gynecology and contacted department chairs (and used department websites) to obtain lists of faculty and their positions. Scopus, department websites, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER were used to collect h-Index, number of publications and citations, graduation year, degrees, gender, and NIH-funding.

While being the Director of the University Teaching Hospital of Gynaecology and Obstetrics he managed to raise money to start the building of a new hospital. He was engaged in experimental work and improved the diagnosis and therapy of genital tuberculosis, extrauterine pregnancy, adnexal inflammation, puerperal fever, etc. He was especially concerned with the determination of the child's sex before his/her birth. As a medical student he participated in the First World War working in the Company Hospital of the Morava Division.

Transformational forces and thriving in the new system.", "text": "Revamping the delivery of women's health care to meet future demands will require a number of changes. In the first 2 articles of this series, we introduced the reasons for change, suggested the use of the 'Triple Aim' concept to (1) improve the health of a population, (2) enhance the patient experience, and (3) control costs as a guide post for changes, and reviewed the transformational forces of payment and care system reform. In the final article, we discuss the valuable use of information technology and disruptive clinical technologies. The new health care system will require a digital transformation so that there can be increased communication, availability of information, and ongoing assessment of clinical care. This will allow for more cost-effective and individualized treatments as data are securely shared between patients and providers. Scientific advances that radically change clinical practice are coming at an accelerated pace as the underlying technologies of genetics, robotics, artificial intelligence, and molecular biology are translated into tools for diagnosis and treatment. Thriving in the new system not only will require time-honored traits such as leadership and compassion but also will require the obstetrician/gynecologist to become comfortable with technology, care redesign, and quality improvement.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25173190/"}

Quality metrics have been in development for years (by private and governmental sectors), and momentum is growing. The purpose of this commentary is to explore quality changes in the way practicing obstetricians and gynecologists will be held accountable for quality service. Two new options being explored for health care, both focusing on improving quality and physician metrics, include value-based purchasing and accountable-care organizations. Both will likely consist of universal clinical algorithms and cost monitoring as measures. For obstetrics this will probably include physician's rates of cesarean deliveries and elective inductions. For gynecology this may comprise of indications for hysterectomy with documented failed medical management, minor surgical management, or both medical and minor surgical management. It is anticipated patients will no longer be able to request obstetric testing, pregnancy induction, or hysterectomy. It is imperative we, as obstetrician-gynecologists, are involved in health care reform that inevitably involves the care of women. The expectation is that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) will further develop evidenced-based opinions and guidelines, as medical communities embrace ACOG documents and reference these in hospital policies and peer review.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21508757/"}

The second objective was to evaluate using simulation during residency. This national descriptive study, utilized a questionnaire to survey all interns in French gynecology and obstetrics. At the end of a study, 129 responses of residents were analyzed. The participation rate was 12%. The majority of residents were women (84%) and the highest response rate was from the Ile-de-France region (36%). The lowest rate was from the Southern region. The majority of residents were in the eighth semester (20%). Residents reported surgical and obstetric orientations in 53% (n = 68) and 44% (n = 57) of cases, respectively. Registration for cancer oncology was reported by 22% (n = 28) of respondents. Evaluation of oncologic surgery training was mostly considered \"good\" by the surgical group and \"passable\" by the obstetrics group. Access to simulators was usually restricted and most often utilized the pelvitrainer. Sessions were typically not mandatory and numbered between zero and five per semester. Three types of simulators were accessible in the Ile-de-France, North-West, West and Rhône-Alpes. The North-East did not have access to animal models, and the South-West did not have access to corpses. Surgical classes were more common in the Rhône-Alpes, North-East, Ile-de-France and North-West regions. To improve their training in oncological surgery, 64% (n = 18) of residents planned to do an inter-university exchange and 54% had completed additional specialized training. Measures that were most expected to improve training were increased training in surgery (96% of respondents, n = 27) and more intensive coaching (96%, n = 27). Companionship is a pillar of residents training, but its effectiveness is variable. One solution could be to implement better use of simulation methods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31531778/"}

Thirty-four OBGYN residents were randomized into 2 groups (group 1, control; group 2, intervention; 17 in each group). Before and after the interventions, written knowledge and confidence levels were assessed. Both groups received didactic lectures using a bony pelvis and an instructional video on TOT insertion; group 2 participated in a half day cadaver laboratory. Surgical skills were assessed by placing 1 arm of the TOT trocar on a custom-designed pelvic model simulator while being graded by an Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) board-certified proctor. Demographics were comparable. Baseline knowledge and confidence level before interventions were similar. After interventions, knowledge scores improved for both groups (8.8% for group 1; 14.1% for group 2); TOT insertion scores were significantly higher in group 2 (6.76/15 ± 2.54 group 1; 10.24/15 ± 2.73 group 2, P < 0.01); confidence scores improved in both groups. The pelvic model simulator was rated as the most useful method to learn TOT placement by group 1. Group 2 rated TOT simulation (47%) and cadaver laboratory (41%). All trainees reported that the pelvic model was highly realistic. Cadaver laboratory exposure, along with other educational interventions (lectures and video), improves OBGYN residents' confidence, knowledge, and surgical skills regarding TOT placement. The custom-designed pelvic model allows for a realistic simulation of TOT placement: it can be used to assess resident surgical skills and also aid the training of OBGYN residents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28922302/"}

In this study, we have attempted to assess the level of surgical confidence reported by senior and recently accredited trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in the UK via an anonymised postal questionnaire. A total of 103 replies were received from 202 questionnaires. Some 99% of the respondents said they felt competent to carry out a simple total abdominal hysterectomy; 61.2% could confidently dissect the ureter and 55.3% could repair major damage to the bladder. However, when managing major obstetric haemorrhage, only 44.6% of respondents felt confident to perform a caesarean hysterectomy; 27.1% could dissect the ureter and 41.7% could apply a B-Lynch suture to the uterus. The level of competence increased with seniority and also with additional time spent in research, subspecialty training or other specialties. There appears to be an appropriate level of confidence in carrying out gynaecological surgical procedures by senior trainees and new consultants. However, surprisingly few respondents were confident in performing any surgical procedure necessary in the management of major obstetric haemorrhage.

The great majority believed abortion was a serious public health issue; that physicians should provide abortions which are not illegal; that abortion should not be penalized to save the woman's life, or in cases of rape or fetal malformations; and that women having illegal abortions and abortion providers should not be imprisoned. Some 40% thought abortion should not be penalized if it is a woman's autonomous decision. Those who were better disposed towards the de-penalization of abortion cited a combination of public health reasons and the need for social equity.

The number of medical students has increased because of the greater number of doctors required, the gender balance and also because it provides revenue for the universities. This means that strategies must be developed to include more teaching units in both primary and secondary care as well as those at a distance from the main teaching provider. Australia and the UK both have this problem but, obviously, the distances involved in Australia are much greater. One of the drivers for the change in undergraduate medical education in the UK was factual overload and the need to teach basic competencies to the students. National curricula that take this into account are being developed and that in the UK has been taken up by a majority of the medical schools. The opportunities offered by O&G to provide basic skills and competencies difficult to find elsewhere in the curriculum are unparalleled.

The preference was given to the routine planned operations; however urgent surgical interventions were performed in cases of emergency. None of the operations were followed by complications due to the increased scope of procedures. High efficacy of these operations, prevention of possible complications in the post--operational period, due to combined pathologies, high economical effect, reduce of stress situations, provide us with the grounds to conduct operations of this nature in a multiprofile clinic by highly qualified personnel.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17057313/"}

The numbers of obstetrician-gynecologists entering subspecialty fellowships in maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) and reproductive endocrinology-infertility (REI) declined sharply between 1994 and 1999. There was a slow increase in gynecologic oncology (GO) fellows. Projections show that the numbers of practicing MFM and GO subspecialists will double by 2020, but they will be serving a 20% larger female population in the United States. Numbers of practicing REI subspecialists will increase slowly. The number of fellows in GO continues to enlarge progressively though slightly, whereas those in MFM and REI have fallen sharply in recent years.

This project incorporates all aspects of obstetrics and gynaecology into a single database. Database designed using Filemaker pro 7, Macromedia Fireworks 8, and Microsoft photodraw. Problems specific to obstetrics and gynaecology included recording multiple pregnancy data, and the lack of a unique patient number (the current system in Northern Ireland gives patients a unique hospital number, and a separate maternity number for each pregnancy). Linking all of these sources was a major component of this database. The database contains many intrinsic tabulations, relationships, programming scripts and calculations to combine files and calculate important statistical information for clinicians automatically. A successful audit of delivery statistics for December 05 was performed using the system. Several additional audits are currently under completion using the database. The major audit, completion date end April 06, is a 5 month summary of delivery data (Dec-April) based on mode of delivery, Robson groups, and Caesarian -Section rate among specified patient sub-groups. The system has been successful in its initial stages with obvious improvements to the medical audit process already apparent.

Catholic hospital policy prohibits all sterilizations, but this ban is not uniformly enforced. We conducted this study to assess obstetrician-gynecologists' beliefs and experiences with tubal ligation in Catholic hospitals. We interviewed 31 obstetrician-gynecologists geographically dispersed throughout the US who responded to a national survey and agreed to be contacted for a follow-up interview or who were referred by colleagues from the survey sample. Twenty-seven had experienced working in a Catholic hospital. Interviews were open ended and guided by a semistructured instrument. Transcripts were thematically analyzed. Obstetrician-gynecologists disagreed with strict prohibition of sterilizations, especially when denying a tubal ligation placed the patient at increased medical risk. Cesarean delivery in Catholic hospitals raised frustration for obstetrician-gynecologists when the hospital prohibited a simultaneous tubal ligation and, thus, sent the patient for an unnecessary subsequent surgery. Obstetrician-gynecologists described some hospitals allowing tubal ligations in limited circumstances, but these workarounds were vulnerable to changes in enforcement. Some obstetrician-gynecologists reported that Catholic policy posed greater barriers for low-income patients and those with insurance restrictions. Obstetrician-gynecologists working in Catholic hospitals in this study did not share the Church's beliefs on sterilization. Research to understand patients' experiences and knowledge of their sterilization options is warranted in order to promote women's autonomy and minimize risk of harm. Tubal sterilization, even when medically indicated or in conjunction with cesarean delivery, is severely restricted for women delivering in Catholic hospitals. For women whose only access to hospital care is at a Catholic institution, religious policies can prevent them from receiving a desired sterilization and place them at risk for future undesired pregnancy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24912729/"}

The world's literature on the impact of disasters on women is reviewed. Sixty-three members of the IMSuRT and Disaster Medical Assistance Team set up a mobile surgical field hospital after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. One member (AG) managed all the obstetrical care and taught the other team members essentials of labor management and assessment in pregnancy. Six hundred patients were treated in the first 14 days. Ten percent of these patients were pregnant.There were 12 deliveries. All pregnant patients were evaluated by a Sonosite ultrasound device. Pregnant patients with earthquake-related injuries were treated for their injuries.Women in labor were managed by active management in labor. No cesarean sections were needed. Well-being of mother and babies. Sixty pregnant women presented to the mobile hospital for evaluation from January 17, 2010, through January 28, 2012. Twelve women in labor delivered healthy infants by vaginal delivery. Gestational ages ranges from 34 to 40 weeks. Active management of labor included the use of intravenous Pitocin, which was titrated to contractions. Duration of labor ranged from 2 to 12 hours. Three team members participated in each delivery. Two women were discharged on the same day as their deliveries. Eight women were discharged on the first postpartum day and two on the second postpartum day. Pregnant women suffered severe injuries. Additionally, pregnant women with pre-existing medical conditions were treated after the earthquake. Active management of labor allowed all women to deliver vaginally. The labor management required tremendous team resources to facilitate vaginal deliveries and avoid cesarean sections. Cesarean sections in an austere environment have the potential for devastating consequences such as sepsis, wound dehiscence, and the long-term risks of uterine rupture with subsequent pregnancies.

We examined clinicians' recommendations of the copper IUD for emergency contraception in a setting with few cost obstacles. We conducted a survey among clinicians (n=1,246; response rate 65%) in a California State family planning program, where U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives are available at no cost to low-income women. We used multivariable logistic regression to measure the association of intrauterine contraceptive training and evidence-based knowledge with having recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception. The large majority of clinicians (85%) never recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception, and most (93%) required two or more visits for an IUD insertion. Multivariable analyses showed insertion skills were associated with having recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception, but the most significant factor was evidence-based knowledge of patient selection for IUD use. Clinicians who viewed a wide range of patients as IUD candidates were twice as likely to have recommended the copper IUD for emergency contraception. Although more than 93% of obstetrician-gynecologists were skilled in inserting the copper IUD, they were no more likely to have recommended it for emergency contraception than other physicians or advance practice clinicians. Recommendation of the copper IUD for emergency contraception is rare, despite its high efficacy and long-lasting contraceptive benefits. Recommendation would require clinic flow and scheduling adjustments to allow same-day IUD insertions. Patient-centered and high-quality care for emergency contraception should include a discussion of the most effective method. III.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22270272/"}

To explore changes in OBGYN practice locations from before to after the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization US Supreme Court decision in June 2022. National Plan & Provider Enumeration System data files were used in a descriptive cohort study assessing the association between state abortion policy environments and OBGYN practice locations in the US from January 1, 2018, to September 30, 2024, for all OBGYNs listed in the data files during the study period. The number of OBGYNs practicing in states with differing abortion laws and the movement of OBGYNs between these states before and after the Dobbs decision. The sample included 60 085 OBGYNs (59.7% women), of whom 3.8% were maternal-fetal medicine specialists and 12.9% were recent residency graduates. The mean increase in the per-quarter number of OBGYNs from before to after Dobbs was 8.3% (95% CI, 6.6%-10.1%) in states with total abortion bans, 10.5% (95% CI, 8.1%-13.0%) in states with gestational age limits or threatened bans, and 7.7% (95% CI, 5.9%-9.4%) in states with abortion protections. From the quarter immediately before Dobbs to the end of the study period, 95.8% of OBGYNs remained in protected states, 94.8% (95% CI, 94.3%-95.2%) remained in states threatening bans, and 94.2% (95% CI, 93.7%-94.7%) remained in states with abortion bans. In this descriptive cohort study, there were no significant differences in trends in OBGYNs' practice locations across states with different abortion-related policy environments after the Dobbs decision.

Rising health care expenditures highlight a critical need to improve education related to this competency. This study aimed to test if an educational module can teach residents to make cost-conscious decisions and reduce health care spending. All Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residents in 2017 were eligible to participate in this randomized controlled trial. The study was administered online via REDCap. Interested residents were enrolled, stratified by level of training, and block randomized. Residents completed a survey to determine their management of 4 obstetrical scenarios. The intervention group reviewed an educational module on cost-effective ordering prior to completing the survey; the control group was given the option to review the module afterward. The primary outcome was mean total expenditures, compared between the 2 groups using the t test. Eighty-five residents were enrolled between August and November 2017, and 63 residents from 13 Canadian residency programs completed the study requirements (33 control and 30 intervention). Mean total expenditure was CAD$291.03 (95% CI 259.38-322.68) versus CAD$192.98 (95% CI 170.67-215.29) for the control and intervention groups, respectively. These figures corresponded to a 33.69% or CAD$98.05 reduction in total expenditures (P = 0.0001).

The interrelated nature of these concepts suggests that they are complimentary paradigms in as much as they collectively form a framework of individual, professional and societal norms. Given the emergence of both legal pluralism and self-regulation over the last two decades, it is believed that neither self-regulation nor state intervention is in itself appropriate. Rather, it is contended that only a pluralistic system--incorporating ethics, deontology (self-regulatory models) and law (state regulatory model) can effectively and comprehensively regulate the medical community so that it may efficaciously and appropriately respond to the continually emerging issues raised by contemporary medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718707/"}

This pilot study was carried out to test whether this characterization still holds true: that women who are drawn from clinical settings report more symptoms compared with women who are recruited from community and work sites. Open-ended interviews were carried out with patients aged 40-60 years in a physician's office (n = 50), in a chiropractor's office (n = 24), at two Breast Health Project sites (n = 50), and in several non-health care sites in the community (n = 81). Interviews were supplemented by anthropometrics and standardized return-by-mail questionnaires. Women who experienced hot flashes and sweating were more likely to report having spoken with a physician about menopause. However, women who were drawn from the clinical setting were not significantly more likely to describe hot flashes, sweats, or mood changes and were significantly less likely to report headaches in relation to menopause compared with a community sample. Women who were drawn from the physician's office were more likely to use hormone replacement therapy and to have had a hysterectomy. This study suggests that because of the medicalization of menopause, we need to rethink our assumptions about the characteristics of populations drawn from health care settings.

Veterinarians are held responsible for the consequences of insufficient clinical examinations of female animals or, after a correct diagnosis, initiation of therapeutic measures that ar not indicated. An increasing number of damage claims is due to the fact that the veterinarian has not informed the owner of an animal in advance about the possible medical or economic risks of a particular treatment. From the expert opinions requested of our clinic by insurance companies and law courts, it can be concluded that in veterinary obstetrics, lesions and damages occurring during vaginal deliveries are still the most frequent cause of compensation claims. Veterinarians are blamed for the use of too much traction force (number of persons assisting in an extraction, use of mechanical calf-pullers) and for incorrect procedures during the manual or instrumental correction of postural or positional abnormalities or a uterine torsion. Also, in case of complications after obstetrical surgery owners suspect failure of the veterinarian. Many losses in the puerperal period are due to the fact that the clinical examination after an obstetrical intervention has not been performed with the necessary accuracy or has been completely omitted. Compensation claims after gynaecological procedures are mostly based on a falsely positive or negative pregnancy diagnosis and complications after surgery involving the ovaries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1559461/"}

The main obstacle is the unwillingness of gynecologists and obstetricians to provide abortion services by claiming conscientious objection, which is often used to hide their fear of the stigma associated with abortion. This happens because many colleagues are unaware that without access to legal services these women will resort to an unsafe abortion and its consequences. This violates the statement from FIGO's Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health, which asserts that: \"The primary conscientious duty of obstetrician-gynecologists is at all times to treat, or provide benefit and prevent harm, to the patients for whose care they are responsible.

Newer responsibilities-for example, in primary care, gerontology, and genetics-require Ob-Gyns to draw upon a base of medical knowledge that traditionally was not considered germane to their practices. Ob-Gyns are increasingly providing more primary care services to their patients; consequently, the field has expanded considerably. The Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network (CARN) was created in 1990 as a vehicle for investigating issues pertinent to women's health and to the practice of obstetrics and gynecology in the outpatient setting. This article summarizes the findings of CARN studies from 1995 to 2000, covering a range of topics related to women's health across the life cycle, including, but not limited to perinatal care. Topics include nutrition, infectious disease, hormone replacement therapy, psychosocial issues, and genetic testing in obstetric and gynecologic practice. Each study produced a picture of current practice patterns and knowledge of the physicians surveyed. Findings on knowledge, attitudes, and practices varied widely. Overall, Ob-Gyns were knowledgeable and consistent in more traditional areas of practice. Conversely, inconsistencies were observed in newer areas.

Residents training in part or whole at a Catholic institution may feel frustration at what they perceive to be a conflict with current secular ethics paradigms-such as access to abortion, contraception, sterilization, and assisted reproductive technologies. The recent adoption of Clinical Competencies by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), directs that residents shall be trained to function within the framework of their larger healthcare system (\"Systems-based Practice\"). This article will first, clarify areas of conflict and convergence between Catholic and secular reproductive ethics, which are unique to OB/GYN training. Next, using the ACGME's new Clinical Competency in Systems-Based practice as a model, a rationale for incorporating Catholic Healthcare ethics into an ethics curriculum for OB/GYN residents will be discussed. Finally, guidelines for faculty tackling the problem of how to teach Catholic Healthcare ethics will be described. Incorporating the rich tradition of Catholic healthcare ethics into the educational curriculum of OB/GYN residency fulfills training requirements while exposing young physicians to a rational decision-making framework in bioethics.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29108141/"}

A detailed policy analysis by the Guttmacher Institute projects that, if Roe v Wade is overturned, 21 states are certain to ban abortion and five states are likely to ban abortion. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires access to abortion training for all obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. We performed a comprehensive study of all accredited U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residency programs to assess how many of these programs and trainees are currently located in states projected to ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned. We found that, of 286 accredited obstetrics and gynecology residency programs with current residents, 128 (44.8%) are in states certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned. Therefore, of 6,007 current obstetrics and gynecology residents, 2,638 (43.9%) are certain or likely to lack access to in-state abortion training. Preparation for the reversal of Roe v Wade should include not only a recognition of the negative effects on patient access to abortion care in affected states, but also of the dramatic implications for obstetrics and gynecology residency training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35852261/"}

Historically there has been little communication and poor networking among this group, largely as a result of lack of infrastructure. Until the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology, there has been no common venue to unite academic specialists nor a means to identify colleagues and develop professional relationships. The Society is creating avenues for communication and collaboration among general ob-gyn faculty across institutions. The Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology is hosting national meetings, conducting workshops and webinars, and developing other media to promote research training, share administrative skills, and help members to become more effective educators. One major focus of the new organization is to provide resources to facilitate faculty development. Formation of the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology is particularly timely given that ob-gyns, without subspecialty fellowship training, have assumed major roles in academic departments. Their contribution to educational, scholarly, and clinical responsibilities is a significant benefit to the well-being of the departments of obstetrics and gynecology. In turn, the role of educator and scholar is of value to the general academic ob-gyn. The Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology will help academic faculty and their institutions by filling current gaps in professional and career development, which should improve scholarship, enhance retention, and improve the ability for academic departments to fulfill their educational and clinical missions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24901278/"}

The same population of Basse-Normandie will get old in the 15 years to come. The impact of these demographic changes over the activity in the gynecology-obstetrics field is not clearly identified. Although we cannot predict the technical and scientific developments in the next 15 years, we are presenting a model allowing to hypothesize about changes of gynecology and obstetrics according to population's aging. We have established a projection model for the realizable surgical acts in obstetrics and gynecology in accordance with the aging of the population in Basse-Normandie. The study was realized based on the acts concerning the cesarean sections (C-section), tubal sterilization, hysteroscopy and hysterectomy as well as ovarectomy and breast surgery. For each activity branch, the codes of the Classification commune des actes médicaux (CCAM) were selected and then removed from the Programme médicalisé des systèmes d'information (PMSI) database. We have used and adapted the Omphale model of the National Statistics and Economical Studies Institute and we have applied it for the period of 2009-2025. Our projection model has permeated to show a 5.5% regression of the C-section acts, a 2% incretion of the hysterectomies and hysteroscopies, 7.7% of ovarectomies as well as a 9.8% augmentation of the breast surgeries. However, we predict a 11.8% diminution of the sterilizations by tubal implants. Globally, the activity in obstetrics and gynecology will remain constant with an insignificant augmentation of 46 acts (0.01%). In Basse-Normandie, the surgical activity in gynecology-obstetrics will moderately increase in the next 15 years. This constant activity signifies that there is no need to form more residents than the number of practitioner to retire. The interest of this model is that it is applicable at a national level and it permits to confront the demographic data and the projections of different activities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660169/"}

The questions in the survey included the basic POI knowledge, previous exposure to POI, and comfort level in managing POI patients. Data from the survey was summarized descriptively and compared between two trainee groups (PGY-4 and PGY-5) using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. Responses were received from trainees in all Canadian residency programs with an overall response rate of 45% (95/210 residents). Most respondents (79%, 75/95 residents) identified correct age for POI diagnosis, and 65% (62/95 residents) recognized the most common aetiology. A majority (99%, 92/93 residents) would prescribe hormone therapy for POI patients. Most trainees (62%, 59/95 residents) lack access to a POI clinic at their centre and 63% (59/94 residents) have seen less than six POI patients during residency training. Most feel somewhat comfortable managing POI patients (67%, 64/95 residents), but 22% (21/95 residents) feel totally uncomfortable with a majority of respondents (83%, 78/94 residents), indicating they would benefit from additional training. Compared with PGY-4 residents, the proportion of trainees who could identify the correct age for diagnosis of POI was significantly higher in PGY-5 residents (89% vs. 70%, P = 0.024).

To determine which residency programs to apply to, and which programs to send signals to, applicants need accurate information to determine which programs align with their future training goals. Most applicants use a program's website to review program characteristics and criteria, so describing the current state of residency program websites can inform programs of best practices. This study aims to characterize information available on obstetrics and gynecology residency program websites and to determine whether there are differences in information available between different types of residency programs. This was a cross-sectional observational study of all US obstetrics and gynecology residency program website content. The authorship group identified factors that would be useful for residency applicants around program demographics and learner trajectories; application criteria including standardized testing metrics, residency statistics, and benefits; and diversity, equity, and inclusion mission statements and values. Two authors examined all available websites from November 2011 through March 2022. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA, with P<.05 considered significant. Among 290 programs, 283 (97.6%) had websites; 238 (82.1%) listed medical schools of current residents; 158 (54.5%) described residency alumni trajectories; 107 (36.9%) included guidance related to the preferred United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores; 53 (18.3%) included guidance related to the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination Level 1 scores; 185 (63.8%) included international applicant guidance; 132 (45.5%) included a program-specific mission statement; 84 (29%) included a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement; and 167 (57.6%) included program-specific media or links to program social media on their websites. University-based programs were more likely to include a variety of information compared to community-based university-affiliated and community-based programs, including medical schools of current residents (113/123, 91.9%, university-based; 85/111, 76.6%, community-based university-affiliated; 40/56, 71.4%, community-based; P<.001); alumni trajectories (90/123, 73.2%, university-based; 51/111, 45.9%, community-based university-affiliated; 17/56, 30.4%, community-based; P<.001); the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 score guidance (58/123, 47.2%, university-based; 36/111, 32.4%, community-based university-affiliated; 13/56, 23.2%, community-based; P=.004); and diversity, equity, and inclusion statements (57/123, 46.3%, university-based; 19/111, 17.1%, community-based university-affiliated; 8/56, 14.3%, community-based; P<.001).

The incourse MCQ was sensitive in selecting out those candidates at risk in their final examination but the advice they were given failed to deal with the deficiencies in half of the students involved. After graduating, these doctors will presumably need special help to maintain their knowledge as they are either incapable of self-motivation or are otherwise deficient. The incourse assessment feedback may have helped another small groups of students to work harder but this study cannot confirm that.

However, the programme should also be seen as just a part of the educational responses necessary as the medical profession moves into the 1990s, particularly for those of us in the discipline of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. This paper reviews the increasing pressures from within the profession and from the community towards the obligatory CME concepts pioneered by the RACOG, but suggests that the challenges that have been faced in this area in the past although significant, are much less than those which will be faced in the 1990's, as the discipline addresses the challenges of educating obstetricians in the third phase of Continuing Medical Education--education in managing the environment in which our discipline is practised.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1804089/"}

The paper was amended twice after intervals of approximately 12 months. The results showed differences in performance between the five schools on questions and alternatives within questions, which were common to all editions of the paper (the \"short\" paper). These differences were also shown in the first two editions of the full paper (the \"long\" paper), but were not apparent in the third. There was a significant improvement in performance from the first to the second paper edition of the long by approximately 11%, but this was reversed from the second to the third edition, where there was a significant decrease in performance by approximately 4%. We cannot here exclude the possibility that this decrease in the third edition has resulted from sample bias. The rank order of the schools may result from differences in methods of teaching. It seems that such relative performance between London medical schools in contributed to by the differences in course legnth and by the occurence of mid-course test. It appears also that student performance in any of the schools has not been uniform over the period of the study, there being a peak during the period when the second edition of the paper was used. Variations in student selection occuring between schools may effect some of these differences. There was also a marked difference in students' performance between Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The short papers appeared easier than the full papers. Whilst this may due to the greater clarity of phrasing for the questions of the short paper, we also believe the subject matter of the short paper may be more relevant.

This is a new educational strategy meant to consolidate knowledge in a fashion that is reproducible for a lifetime with successful application to both known and unknown clinical exercises. The development of lifelong learning is based on the principles of andragogy (autonomy and independence in one's learning activities), reflection and learning from experience. This paper deals with the development of these theories culminating in the advent of self-directed learning. Evidence to support experiential, reflective and self-directed learning is provided, including the use of rating scales. An example from obstetrics is used to highlight the application of these principles. There are barriers to adopting a new educational paradigm, however, lifelong learning remains an excellent tool for continuous professional development.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21823841/"}

Nurses were instrumental in assisting physicians in the care of patients in labor and during recovery. They were also necessary for male physicians because the vast majority of nurses were women and their presence during gynecological and obstetrical treatments made it more socially acceptable for men to examine female patients. In hospital schools in the northeast and through long-distance nursing programs, physicians taught students about obstetrical nursing and instructed them to protect the modesty of female patients. They also tried to instill strict professional hierarchies between nurses and physicians, emphasizing that nurses should never attempt to deliver a patient without a physician. But as nursing emerged into a unique professional practice separate from that of physicians, nurses were able to negotiate better education in the care of laboring patients. In order to take over women's sexual and reproductive health care from traditional providers, physicians conceded to nurses' demands for more authority in patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37315212/"}

Assuring retention of obstetric providers.", "text": "The Safe Motherhood Initiative has highlighted the need for improved health services with skilled attendants at delivery and the provision of emergency obstetric care. \"Brain drain\" has hampered this process and has been particularly prevalent in Ghana. Between 1993 and 2000, 68% of Ghanaian trained medical school graduates left the country. In 1989, postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynecology was established in Ghana, and as of November 2006, 37 of the 38 specialists who have completed the program have stayed in the country, most working in the public sector providing health care and serving as faculty. Interviews with graduates in 2002 found that the first and single-most important factor related to retention was the actual presence of a training program leading to specialty qualification in obstetrics and gynecology by the West African College of Surgeons. Economic and social factors also played major roles in a graduates' decision to stay in Ghana to practice. This model deserves replication in other countries that have a commitment to sustainable development, human resource and health services capacity building, and maternal mortality reduction. A network of University partnerships between departments of obstetrics and gynecology in developed and developing countries throughout the world sharing internet resources, clinical information, training curriculum and assessment techniques could be created. Grand rounds could be shared through teleconferencing, and faculty exchanges would build capacity for all faculty and enrich both institutions. Through new partnerships, creating opportunity for medical school graduates to become obstetrician-gynecologists may reduce brain drain and maternal mortality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17978113/"}

Victims of trafficking have been found in a wide range of legal and illegal business settings, and this frequently hidden population is most often exploited in the commercial sex industry, agriculture, factories, hotels, restaurants, as domestic workers, and by marriage brokers and some adoption firms. Human trafficking disproportionately affects underserved women and children, with more than 70% of trafficking cases involving women and girls and more than 90% of victims trafficked into the sex industry. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other women's health care providers are well-situated to identify and assist victims of human trafficking. Many trafficked individuals present to outpatient obstetrics and gynecology clinics, community health centers, family planning clinics, urgent care centers, and adolescent medicine clinics, and one half of all female victims of sex trafficking have visited the emergency department while involved in sex trafficking. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other women's health care providers should be aware of human trafficking, recognize signs of human trafficking, and be prepared to assist patients who are victims or who have been victims of human trafficking. This Committee Opinion has been updated to include screening questions and indicators to identify victims of human trafficking, additional information regarding reporting obligations for suspected human trafficking, and additional resources for survivors of human trafficking.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31441822/"}

{"id": "29408754", "title": "Elective abortion: Clinical practice guidelines from the French College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF).", "text": "The number of elective abortions has been stable for several decades. Many factors explain women's choice of abortion in cases of unplanned pregnancies. Early initiation of contraceptive use and a choice of contraceptive choices appropriate to the woman's life are associated with lower rates of unplanned pregnancies. Reversible long-acting contraceptives should be favored as first-line methods for adolescents because of their effectiveness (grade C). Ultrasound scan before an elective abortion must be encouraged but should not be obligatory (professional consensus). As soon as the embryo appears on the ultrasound scan, the date of pregnancy is estimated by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) or, from 11 weeks on, by measuring the biparietal diameter (BPD) (grade A). Because reliability of these parameters is ±5 days, the abortion may be done if measurements are respectively less than 90 mm for CRL and less than 30 mm for BPD (professional consensus). A medically induced abortion, performed with a dose of 200 mg mifepristone combined with misoprostol, is effective at any gestational age (Level of Evidence (LE) 1). Before 7 weeks, mifepristone should be followed 24-48 h later by misoprostol, administered orally, buccally, sublingually, or even vaginally followed if needed by a further dose of 400 μg after 3 h, to be renewed if needed after 3 h (LE 1, grade A). After 7 weeks, administration of misoprostol by the vaginal, sublingual, or buccal routes is more effective and better tolerated than by the oral route (LE 1). Cervical preparation is recommended for systematic use in surgical abortions (professional consensus). Misoprostol is a first-line agent for cervical preparation at a dose of 400 μg (grade A). Vacuum aspiration is preferable to curettage (grade B). A uterus perforated during surgical aspiration should not routinely be considered to be scarred (professional consensus). An elective abortion is not associated with a higher risk of subsequent infertility or ectopic pregnancy (LE 2). The medical consultation before an elective abortion generally does not affect the decision to end or continue the pregnancy, and most women are sufficiently certain about their choice at this time. Women appear to find the method used most acceptable and to be most satisfied when they were able to choose the method (grade B). Elective abortions are not associated with an increased rate of psychiatric disorders (LE 2). However, women with psychiatric histories are at a higher risk of psychological disorders after the occurrence of an unplanned pregnancy than women with such a history (LE 2). For surgical abortions, combined hormonal contraceptives - oral or transdermal - should be started on the day of the abortion, while the vaginal ring should be inserted 5 days afterwards (grade B). For medical abortions, the vaginal ring should be inserted in the week after mifepristone administration, while the combined contraceptives should begin the same day as the misoprostol or the day after (grade C). Contraceptive implants should be inserted on the same day as a surgical abortion, and may be inserted the day the mifepristone is administered for medical abortions (grade B and C respectively). In case of medical abortion, the implant can be inserted the same day the mifepristone is administered (grade C). Both the copper IUDs and levonorgestrel intrauterine system should be inserted on the day of the surgical abortion (grade A). After medical abortions, an IUD can be inserted in 10 days after mifepristone administration, after ultrasound scan verification of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy (grade C).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29408754/"}

The available literature was screened through December 2017 and served as the basis of 12 texts, reviewed by experts and physicians from public and private practices, with experience in this field. These texts enabled us to develop evidence based, graded recommendations. Male and female sterilization, as well as the use of hormonal treatments not authorized for contraception (\"off-label\") were excluded from the scope of our review. Specific practical recommendations are provided for the management of contraception prescription, patient information concerning effectiveness, risks, and benefits of the different methods, patient follow-up, intrauterine contraception, emergency contraception, local and natural methods, contraception in teenagers, in women after 40, for women at high thromboembolism or cardiovascular risk, and for those at of primary cancer or relapse. The short- and mid-term future of contraception depends mainly on improving the use of currently available methods.

ObGyns significantly impact societal health through their care for pregnant women, fetuses, and newborns, uniquely positioning them to advocate for health initiatives with lasting societal benefits. Despite its importance, the history of medicine is underrepresented in medical curricula, missing opportunities to foster critical thinking and ethical decision-making. In today's climate of threatened reproductive rights, vaccine misinformation, and harmful ideologies, it is imperative for ObGyns to champion comprehensive historical education. The history of medicine, particularly in relation to societal issues - such as racism, discrimination, genocides, pandemics, and wars - provides valuable context for addressing challenges like maternal mortality, reproductive rights, vaccine hesitancy, and ethical issues. Understanding historical milestones and notable ethical breaches, such as the Tuskegee Study and the thalidomide tragedy, informs better practices and safeguards patient rights. Technological advancements in hygiene, antibiotics, vaccines, and prenatal care have revolutionized the field, yet contemporary ObGyns must remain vigilant about lessons learned from past challenges and successes. Integrating historical knowledge into medical training enhances clinical proficiency and ethical responsibility, fostering innovation and improving health outcomes. By reflecting on historical achievements and their impacts, current and future ObGyns can advance the field, ensuring comprehensive and ethically sound approaches to patient care.

Attending physicians and residents feel graduating obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) trainees are unprepared to perform major surgery independently. Tracking has demonstrated tremendous success in general surgery, enriching trainee careers, allowing for increased operative and clinical experiences, enhancing autonomy, and improving mentorship, all while achieving equivalent or improved milestone achievement, case numbers, and board certification. A majority of medical students, residents, and OB/GYN residency program directors support tracking in OB/GYN. Currently, a single OB/GYN program provides tracking in the United States, with measurable success similar to that seen in general surgery. Enhanced surgical volume results in better outcomes in gynecologic surgery, but current training models are insufficient to meet these volume demands.

Sensitive issues such as sexual and reproductive health are addressed and certain procedures can be experienced as abusive. According to research a lifetime prevalence of abuse in healthcare (AHC) can be assumed for 13-28% of female patients in the Nordic countries. In the present study we analyse the content of ethical documents for healthcare professionals within obstetrics and gynaecology in Sweden, in order to find out to what extent ethical guidelines consider issues that have shown to be related to the occurrence of AHC. We searched the literature to find empirical data on AHC. Guidelines for nurses, midwives and physicians were selected. After developing an analytical framework based on the empirical data the content of the ethical guidelines was analysed. The various ethical guidelines for staff working within obstetrics and gynaecology differ distinctively from each other regarding their content of issues that are related to AHC. Issues that were mostly disregarded were: considering the patient's perspective and the patients' possible experience of violence, considering power imbalances within healthcare, sexual misconduct, how to deal with other professional's ethical misconduct and how professionals relate to each other. We found the ethical guidelines of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and of the International Confederation of Midwives to be those which contained most of the issues that have empirically shown to be important in regard to AHC. While staff members from different professions may share responsibility for the same patient, their ethical guidelines vary considerably. To become a possible resource for prevention of AHC, we suggest that ethical guidelines in healthcare should be revised following empirical research on ethical conduct. As ethical guidelines cannot be effective by their existence only, we would like to initiate a discussion on the function and use of ethical guidelines in general and regarding AHC in particular. Being aware that ethical guidelines are only a part of ethics in healthcare, however, we envision a broader approach to the aim of preventing AHC, where research is encouraged on how a virtue ethics approach could be applied.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22906683/"}

Simulation has been shown to be useful in assessing surgical skill and may be a useful tool in hospital credentialing and maintenance of privileges. To determine the correlation between a surgical case volume and fellowship training with performance on simulated procedural tasks. A total of 108 obstetricians and gynecologists with laparoscopic privileges at 2 academic institutions completed a pre-test survey and performed 3 tasks on the LapSim laparoscopic virtual reality simulator. The pre-test survey inquired about the monthly laparoscopic case volume and prior training. Simulations included a basic skills task (peg transfer) followed by a procedural task (salpingectomy) of 2 difficulty levels (low and moderate). Spearman correlation and Wilcoxon tests were used to determine correlations between the survey responses and performance metrics. Participants included 67 generalists (62%) and 41 fellowship-trained specialists (38%). There was an observed weak correlation among surgical volume (more than 6 cases per month), time to completion, and the amount of blood loss when performing the low-difficulty level salpingectomy (r=-0.32, P=.0007 and r=-0.29, P=.002, respectively). The economy of movement (instrument path length) was correlated to high surgical volume (r=-0.35, P=.0002). Compared with generalists, surgeons with fellowship training performed tasks faster (410.8 seconds [interquartile range, 309.7-595.2]) vs 530.2 seconds (interquartile range, 406.2-605.0; P=.0009), more efficiently at 6.1 m (interquartile range, 4.8-7.3) vs 8.1 m (interquartile range, 5.8-10.7; P=.0003), and with less blood loss at 21.7 mL (interquartile range, 11.8-37.7) vs 42.9 mL (interquartile range, 18.1-70.6; P=.002). Regarding the case volume and fellowship background, there was no difference in ovarian diathermy damage. In addition, there was no difference among most performance parameters for the peg transfer task and the moderate-difficulty salpingectomy procedure. Surgical experience obtained through higher case volume and fellowship training correlate with higher performance scores during simulated procedural tasks. In a previous study, we found a similar correlation with simulated basic skills tasks. The current study is a continuation of an ongoing quality initiative to establish a summative assessment of laparoscopic surgical skills using virtual reality simulator for the maintenance of credentials among obstetrical and gynecologic surgeons.

Traditionally, the uncertainty in decision making was handled using expertise collected by individual providers and, more recently, systematic appraisal of research in the form of evidence-based medicine. The traditional approach has been used successfully in medicine for a very long time. However, it has substantial limitations because of the complexity of the system of the human body and healthcare. The complex systems are a network of highly coupled components intensely interacting with each other. These interactions give those systems redundancy and thus robustness to failure and, at the same time, equifinality, that is, many different causative pathways leading to the same outcome. The equifinality of the complex systems of the human body and healthcare system demand the individualization of medical care, medicine, and medical decision making. Computational models excel in modeling complex systems and, consequently, enabling individualization of medical decision making and medicine. Computational models are theory- or knowledge-based models, data-driven models, or models that combine both approaches. Data are essential, although to a different degree, for computational models to successfully represent complex systems. The individualized decision making, made possible by the computational modeling of complex systems, has the potential to revolutionize the entire spectrum of medicine from individual patient care to policymaking. This approach allows applying tests and treatments to individuals who receive a net benefit from them, for whom benefits outweigh the risk, rather than treating all individuals in a population because, on average, the population benefits. Thus, the computational modeling-enabled individualization of medical decision making has the potential to both improve health outcomes and decrease the costs of healthcare.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32841628/"}

Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between perception of the legal climate on training and satisfaction with training and intent to provide abortions. To provide additional context to survey responses, we reviewed open-ended responses to the effect of the legal climate on training. <b>Results</b> Of 343 eligible residents, 88 (26%) responded from 13 of 15 programs (87% of programs). Most (73%) felt that the legal climate affected their training, and these respondents were more likely to be unsatisfied with their training (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 16.6; 95% CI 2.83-97.22). We found no association between perception of legal climate on training and intent to provide abortions. In open-ended responses, most residents described a desire for more abortion training and barriers to patient care. Some highlighted the positives of training in a restrictive environment, which allowed for an improved understanding of the skills required for patient advocacy. <b>Conclusions</b> Many residents felt that the legal climate in Ohio affected their abortion training, a perception that was associated with decreased satisfaction with training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37781426/"}

These systems are currently transforming to meet the Triple Aim: guaranteeing the equitable provision of high-quality, evidence-based care at a reasonable cost. Participatory leadership is an organizational change theory that engages key stakeholders as architects in the transformation process. This review highlights the utility of this leadership strategy in designing care for women's health. Our blueprint describing participatory leadership theory in women's health systems change is discussed in three case studies, highlighting what we call the six Ps of participatory leadership: participants, principles, purpose, process, and power. The 'sixth P', product, can then be substantially influential in changing the paradigm of care. Obstetrics and gynecology is increasingly practiced in large health systems responsible for the health of populations. Innovations in clinical practice impact care at the level of the individual. In order for advances in clinical practice to reach broad populations of women, they must be integrated into a delivery system.

Instead, students are taught formally through lectures and informally on the ward or in the operating room. This study aimed to incorporate simulation using a high fidelity postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) workshop into the teaching curriculum, with the goal of improving both medical knowledge of PPH and nontechnical skills (NTS). A novel teaching session was introduced for the third-year clerks on their OB/GYN rotation. Students (n = 88) were invited to participate in the research component to evaluate the effectiveness of this session. Students' (n = 83) baseline knowledge of PPH and teamwork attitudes were measured using a multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ) and the TeamSTEPPS Questionnaire. Students participated in small-group learning about PPH and NTS, followed by a high-fidelity PPH simulation using a Laerdal SimMom Mannequin in a mock operating room. Students were debriefed, followed by a different MCQ and the TeamSTEPPS Questionnaire. Statistically significant improvements in students' comprehension (MCQ scores 63.9% vs. 76.5%, P < 0.05) and NTS (4.35/5 vs. 4.51/5, P < 0.05) were noted after simulation. The majority (92%) of students agreed that this method of learning was more enjoyable than traditional methods. Simulation in undergraduate education offers an exciting alternative to deliver information that is traditionally taught with didactic sessions while incorporating essential NTS. The authors hope that this study will encourage discussion of current simulation practices across Canada and standardized simulation techniques in OB/GYN.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30316714/"}

The search strategy combined terms related to environmental impact, sustainability, climate change or carbon footprint, with the field of obstetrics and gynaecology. Articles reporting on the environmental impact of any service, procedure or product within the field of obstetrics and gynaecology were included. Included outcomes covered midpoint impact categories, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, waste generation and energy consumption. A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and Scopus, and a grey literature search was performed on Google Scholar and two websites of gynaecological associations. The scope of the investigated studies encompassed vaginal births, obstetric and gynaecological surgical procedures, menstrual products, vaginal specula and transportation to gynaecological oncologic consultations. Among the highest yielding mitigation strategies were displacing disposable with reusable materials and minimising content of surgical custom packs. The lowest yielding mitigation strategy was waste optimisation, including recycling.

Professional liability payment data from the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine was used. During the 10 years preceding August 2005, 38.6% of obstetrician-gynecologists and 32.2% of gynecologists made at least 1 professional liability payment. During the same time period, the percentage of subspecialists who made a payment was significantly less than obstetrician-gynecologists: gynecologic oncologists 10.0% (P = .012), maternal-fetal medicine 3.7% (P = .002), and reproductive endocrinologists 11.9% (P = .016). Using aggregate payment data for the period 1994-2003, the average payment per claim for specialists in maternal-fetal medicine ($1,950,000) and gynecologic oncology ($1,014,006) were above the average payment per claim for obstetrician-gynecologists ($447,983) or gynecologists ($400,338). Reproductive endocrinologists had an average payment per claim of $454,047. All specialists in the field of obstetrics and gynecology have major professional liability risks. Among subspecialists in obstetrics and gynecology, the favorable trend toward fewer physicians making payments is counterbalanced by greater payments per lost claim.

Students did not often answer 'don't know' to the questions, and the most striking finding was that the responses of male and female students differed, with statistical significance at the 1% level in twenty-six of the thirty-two questions. The male students were more likely to agree with statements which stereotyped women in a negative way and this suggests that, unless active steps are taken by medical teachers to help students to question their attitudes, women will continue to complain about the way they are treated by the medical profession, and women doctors will not fulfil their potential.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6865813/"}

Whether or not a complete separation into the three subdisciplines, (1) materno-fetal medicine--obstetrics, (2) surgical gynecology--gynecologic oncology, and (3) gynecologic endocrinology--reproductive medicine, is recommendable remains unclear. Some authors describe forms of supplementary postgraduate education only, a kind of prolongation of the basic gynecologic and obstetric training concentrating on one of the three main fields. The complete separation, i.e. into obstetric medicine, reproductive medicine, and gynecologic pelvic surgery, has the advantage of a more effective concentration on each of the respective subdisciplines in clinical work and in research. On the other hand, the separation will produce several disadvantages: (a) that which falls between the subdisciplines will be difficult to integrate; (b) the principle of the gynecologist functioning as a primary health care physician for women will be weakened, i.e. his competence in family-planning, pregnancy and delivery, cancer screening for genital and breast tumors, cycle disorders, pelvic inflammatory diseases and the care of postmenopausal women; (c) the lectures will become more split or overloaded with details than at present; (d) the need for a cost-effective and widely available general gynecologic care will not be met, and (e) the opportunities for younger colleagues to have an office of their own will be restricted. The disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The solution might be a combination of the two competitive models: the creation of subdisciplines, completely separated from one another but for a minority only (i.e. to candidates for leading posts in clinics of the tertiary care, university hospitals etc).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2098287/"}

A mixed-methods study including a web-based survey and focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted among medical students who had completed their obstetrics and gynaecology (ObGyn) clerkship. The FGDs were recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis with systematic text condensation. Survey factors were compared using the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test. 160 students (97 female, 61 male, two other) at six universities in Sweden responded to the survey. Two mixed FGDs were conducted. The majority (87%) of the students experienced confidence in performing pelvic examinations, stating that sufficient, repeated training opportunities and support from a clinical tutor were crucial components of the learning experience. Prior to the ObGyn clerkship, negative expectations were more common among male students. The male participants experienced having a disadvantage because of their gender, while female students considered their gender an advantage (p<0.001, N=121, Fisher's Exact Test). The clinical tutor and the use of professional patients (PPs) had a fundamental role in providing learning opportunities by including the student in patient care activities. The importance of the clinical tutor, as well as the use of PPs, are important factors when planning education in pelvic examinations, and this knowledge could be used when educating other intimate examinations during medical school.

The probability of cooperation was significantly inversely associated with age. It was found that the probability for advising CAM differed between various health problems. The following CAM methods were considered reasonable for the treatment of different conditions: phytotherapy for climacteric complaints and premenstrual syndrome; homoeopathy for puerperal problems; acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine for complaints during pregnancy; and dietary supplements for the side effects of cancer therapy.

In a considerable number of countries training units were audited more than once, allowing assessment of trends in both obstetric interventions. There is a notable rise in Caesarean section rate in a number of European countries, with the highest rates in Poland (55.1%), Turkey (54.8%) and Greece (48.6%). Conversely Caesarean sections were low in France (19.3%) associated with a higher rate of instrumental vaginal delivery rates. Some countries like Germany and Poland have high variability in their rates, indicating fluctuations or regional differences over the years. Vaginal instrumental delivery rates varied across countries having very low rates (Turkey with 1.0% and Poland with 1.2%) and others having relatively high rates (like Switzerland, France and Belgium). Germany and Belgium showed a balanced use of both Caesarean sections and vaginal instrumental deliveries but with considerable variability in both practices. Countries in Central Europe display marked differences in Caesarean section rate: Hungary 37.8%; Slovakia 34.5%, Czech Republic 27.5% and Slovenia 20.7%. Apart from Poland (1.2%), differences in vaginal instrumental delivery rate between these countries are relatively small with Hungary 2.7%, Slovakia 2.8%, Czech Republic 2.9% and Slovenia 2.9%.

We sought to build medical trainees' surgical familiarity with D&Es using a realistic simulation model. The simulation began with an instructional video reviewing accessible and affordable materials used to build the fetal model (vaginal swabs, styrofoam ball, and putty) and the uterine model (collapsible water bottle). Required personnel roles included surgeon, surgical assistant, and facilitator. A standardized rubric was used to evaluate learners' mastery of procedural learning objectives, and a pre- and postsimulation assessment measured learners' knowledge and confidence before and after the activity. Consistency between iterations was maintained with use of standardized prompts and lectures. Total time for the activity, including setup and debrief, was 1 hour. Eighteen residents, medical students, and attendings participated in the simulation, and 100% completed the assessment. There was a demonstrated improvement in clinical knowledge of D&E steps (56% presimulation vs. 94% postsimulation, <i>p</i> < .001) and increased surgical confidence in performing D&Es after participating in the simulation (28% presimulation vs. 89% postsimulation, <i>p</i> < .001).

To identify and characterize top-cited OBGYN articles in the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science's Science Citation Index Expanded and to compare top-cited OBGYN articles published in specialty OBGYN journals with those published in nonspecialty journals. Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of top-cited articles that were indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded from 1980 to 2018. The Science Citation Index Expanded was queried using search terms from the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology's 2018 certifying examination topics list. The top 100 articles from all journals and the top 100 articles from OBGYN journals were evaluated for specific characteristics. Data were analyzed in March 2019. The articles were characterized by citation number, publication year, topic, study design, and authorship. After excluding articles that featured on both lists, top-cited articles were compared. The query identified 3 767 874 articles, of which 278 846 (7.4%) were published in OBGYN journals. The top-cited article was published by Rossouw and colleagues in JAMA (2002). Top-cited articles published in nonspecialty journals were more frequently cited than those in OBGYN journals (median [interquartile range], 1738 [1490-2077] citations vs 666 [580-843] citations, respectively; P < .001) and were more likely to be randomized trials (25.0% vs 2.2%, respectively; difference, 22.8%; 95% CI, 13.5%-32.2%; P < .001). Whereas articles from nonspecialty journals focused on broad topics like osteoporosis, articles from OBGYN journal focused on topics like preeclampsia and endometriosis. This study found substantial differences between top-cited OBGYN articles published in nonspecialty vs OBGYN journals. These differences may reflect the different goals of the journals, which work together to ensure optimal dissemination of impactful articles.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860106/"}

This prospective process intervention study was conducted with two obstetrics and gynecology practice groups (five sites). The intervention included baseline process assessment, refinement of clinic-specific patient screening workflows and tools, and training in hereditary cancer risk screening and follow-up. Outcomes related to hereditary cancer assessment and testing were measured during an 8-week postintervention period. Patients and health care providers were surveyed about satisfaction with the process. Data also were collected during the 8 weeks before the intervention to assess the effects of screening process improvements. A total of 4,107 patients were seen during the postintervention period, and 92.8% (3,811) were assessed for hereditary cancer risk. Among those assessed, 906 of 3,811 (23.8%) women met National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for genetic testing, and 813 of 906 (89.7%) eligible patients were offered genetic testing. A total of 165 of 4,107 (4.0%) women completed genetic testing and received a final test result. This represents a fourfold increase over genetic testing immediately before the intervention (1.1%) and an eightfold increase over the previous year (0.5%). Testing identified pathogenic variants in 9 of 165 (5.5%) tested women. All health care providers (15/15) reported that they will continue to use the established hereditary cancer risk assessment process. In addition, 98.8% (167/169) of patients who submitted a sample for genetic testing and completed a patient satisfaction survey stated that they were able to understand the information provided, and 97.6% (165/169) expressed satisfaction with the overall process. It is feasible to incorporate hereditary cancer risk assessment, education, and testing into community obstetrics and gynecology practices.

The postgraduate curriculum of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) is such a surgical curriculum. It is a diverse branch of medicine and the role of anatomy in O&G is versatile. In the Netherlands nor in Europe the expectations of knowledge on anatomy are specified in the current training program, making trainees insecure about their performance in anatomy knowledge (\"Better Education for Obsetrics and Gynaecology,\"). Therefore, we recently performed a Delphi study to determine which anatomical structures should be taught to ensure safe and competent practice among general gynaecologists (Koppes et al., 2020). The aim of this study is the determination of the anatomical knowledge level in postgraduate training for O&G. Our hypothesis is that the trainees possess a good knowledge of anatomy and on average at least 80% of correct answers on core knowledge is shown. A longitudinal knowledge analysis was performed under Dutch Trainees Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The anatomy questions of the annual progress tests from 2010 to 2019 were analysed. Anatomy questions were selected and assessed on relevance based on the previous performed Delphi study which identified 86 structures which are essential to perform safe and competent practice as a general gynaecologist. Scores on relevant anatomy questions were calculated. In 10-year 3136 trainees performed the annual progress test. 54 Anatomy related questions were asked on a total of 1637 questions (3.3%). Of these 54 questions, 38 (70%) were concerned as relevant questions. Overall 10-year score was 64.5%. The anatomy knowledge of trainees' Obstetrics and Gynaecology is insufficient.

This study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of an educational program to improve PSC among health professionals working in the obstetric unit of a Tunisian university hospital. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in the obstetric unit of a university hospital in Sousse (Tunisia). All the obstetric unit's professionals were invited to take part in the study (n = 95). The intervention consisted of an educational intervention with workshops and self-learning documents on patient safety and quality of care. The study instrument was the French validated version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Normality of the data was checked using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The comparison of dimensions' scores before and after the intervention was carried out by the chi2 test. The significance level was set at 0.05. In total, 73 participants gave survey feedback in pre-test and 68 in post-test (response rates of 76.8% and 71.6, respectively). Eight dimensions improved significantly between pre- and post-tests.

The use of such forms of assessment is growing nationally and internationally in many specialties, but there is little research evidence on comparisons by procedure/competency and form-type across an entire specialty. Generalisability theory combined with a multilevel modelling approach is used to estimate variance components, G-coefficients and standard errors of measurement across 13 procedures and three form-types (mini-CEX, OSATS and CbD). The main finding is that there are wide variations in the estimates of reliability across the forms, and that therefore the guidance on assessment within the specialty does not always allow for enough forms per trainee to ensure that the levels of reliability of the process is adequate. There is, however, little evidence that reliability varies systematically by form-type. Methodologically, the problems of accurately estimating reliability in these contexts through the calculation of variance components and, crucially, their associated standard errors are considered. The importance of the use of appropriate methods in such calculations is emphasised, and the unavoidable limitations of research in naturalistic settings are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23782043/"}

As this paper will argue, there was considerable overlap between these specialisations, producing a fundamentally masculine, Eurocentric and racialised knowledge that had an enormous impact in establishing racially informed gynaecological and obstetric practices. This paper argues that comparative pelvic anatomy studies originated from the belief that African and Black women had specifically different pelves and genitalia and served to stratify women of different races and promoted racially oriented obstetric and gynaecological treatments. Despite their European origins, these French publications had profound repercussions across various regions of the Atlantic world and directly influenced the medical care provided to women of African descent in both slave and postemancipation societies, particularly in Brazil. In 1887, a doctoral candidate from the Rio de Janeiro Medical School (Brazil) wrote a dissertation in which he advocated and justified the racialised treatments offered to enslaved, free and soon-to-be-free women of African descendent who delivered their offspring at the medical school's maternity ward. In his advocacy for such practices, the author drew connections between the prevailing methods at Rio de Janeiro's Medical School to a long lineage of French medical thought on the racialised comparative anatomy of women's pelvises throughout the 19th century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39863416/"}

These guidelines were developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the French Health Authority (HAS). A prenatal clinical examination of the perineum is recommended for women with a history of Crohn's disease, OASIS, genital mutilation, or perianal lesions (professional consensus). Just after delivery, a perineal examination is recommended to check for OASIS (Grade B); if there is doubt about the diagnosis, a second opinion should be requested (Grade C). In case of OASIS, the injuries (including their severity) and the technique for their repair should be described in detail (Grade C). Perineal massage during pregnancy must be encouraged among women who want it (Grade B). No intervention conducted before the start of the active phase of the second stage of labour has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of perineal injury. The crowning of the baby's head should be manually controlled and the posterior perineum manually supported to reduce the risk of OASIS (Grade C). The performance of an episiotomy during normal deliveries is not recommended to reduce the risk of OASIS (Grade A). In instrumental deliveries, episiotomy may be indicated to avoid OASIS (Grade C). When an episiotomy is performed, a mediolateral incision is recommended (Grade B). The indication for episiotomy should be explained to the woman, and she should consent before its performance. Advising women to have a caesarean delivery for primary prevention of postnatal urinary or anal incontinence is not recommended (Grade B).

Accreditation deals with issues of patient safety and quality control, including equipment calibration, transducer cleaning and disinfection, universal precautions and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, ultrasound examination protocols, and qualifications of nonphysician personnel performing ultrasound examinations. A new field of radiology benefit managers has arisen in response to attempts by health insurers to manage care, and reduce their costs and utilization. They have adopted ultrasound accreditation, originally intended to enhance patient safety, to help restrict utilization. Currently two organizations are recognized as accrediting bodies: The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), which recognizes obstetric and gynecologic residency training as evidence of competency, and The American College of Radiologists, which does not.

It is demonstrated that investigations into non-compliance events arising in the work of medical facilities must include the analysis of the departmental normative legal acts that govern the organizational and diagnostic processes. These documents should be regarded as pertaining to an additional direct object and considered to be one of the constituent elements of.the offence to be identified during forensic medical expertise. Such documents are very specific in terms of their content and can not be properly interpreted by independent specialists possessing juristic knowledge alone.

{"id": "38413328", "title": "Revisiting the evolution of the Hippocratic Oath in obstetrics and gynecology.", "text": "Hippocrates, an influential figure in ancient Greek medicine, is best known for his lasting contribution, the Hippocratic Oath, which includes a significant message about obstetrics and gynecology. Given the Oath's status as a widely regarded ethical code for medical practice, it requires critical evaluation. The message of the Oath, as it related to obstetrics and gynecology, is expressed in ancient Greek by the phrase \"οὐδὲ γυναικὶ πεσσὸν φθόριον δώσω\" which translates directly to \"I will not give to any woman a harming pessary.\" The words fetus and abortion were not present in the original Greek text of the Oath. Yet, this message of the Hippocratic Oath has been interpreted often as a prohibition against abortion. In this article, we present a critical linguistic and historical analysis and argue against the notion that the Hippocratic Oath was prohibiting abortion. We provide evidence that the words \"foetum\" (fetus) and \"abortu\" (abortion) were inserted in the Latin translations of the Oath, which then carried on in subsequent English versions. The addition of the words \"fetus\" and \"abortion\" in the Latin translations significantly altered the Oath's original meaning. Unfortunately, these alterations in the translation of the Hippocratic Oath have been accepted over the years because of cultural, religious, and social reasons. We assert that because the original Hippocratic Oath did not contain language related to abortion, it should not be construed as prohibiting it. The interpretation of the Oath should be based on precise and rigorous translation and speculative interpretations should be avoided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38413328/"}

An online survey was sent to FMIGS graduates between March 15, 2019 and April 12, 2019. Information on physicians' demographics, compensation (on the basis of location, practice model, productivity benchmarks, academic rank, and years in practice), and attitudes toward fairness in compensation was collected. Online survey. FMIGS graduates practicing in the United States. E-mail survey. We surveyed 298 US FMIGS surgeons who had graduated during the last 10 years (2009-2018). The response rate was 48.7%. Most of the respondents were women (69%). Most of the graduates (84.8%) completed 2- or 3-year fellowship programs. After adjustment for inflation, the median starting salary for the first postfellowship job was $252 074 ($223 986-$279 983) (Table 1). The median time spent in the first job was 2.6 years, and the median total salary at the current year rose to $278 379.4 ($241 437-$350 976). The median salary for respondents entering a second postfellowship job started at $280 945 ($261 409-$329 603). Significantly lower compensation was reported for female FMIGS graduates in their initial postfellowship jobs and was consistently lower than for that of men over time. Most FMIGS graduates (59.7%) reported feeling inadequately compensated for their level of specialization. A trend toward higher self-reported salaries is noted for FMIGS graduates in recent years, with significant differences in compensation between men and women. Among obstetrics and gynecology subspecialists, FMIGS graduates earn significantly less than other fellowship-trained physicians, with median salaries that are lower than those of generalist obstetrics and gynecology physicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32439413/"}

The three major subspecialties were maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive medicine and gynaecological oncology. The two minor subspecialties were urogynaecology and community gynaecology. Some of the requirements for training centres are adequate clinical workload, a programme which embodies teaching, training, research and audit, adequate staffing to support training; collaboration with related disciplines and a programme director responsible for supervision and training. Each programme has a well-defined syllabus. The recruitment is based on expected needs. A minimum 7 years is needed to complete the general and subspecialty training. There is a strong academic input in this training and it includes structured research training. Many of the individuals who complete the subspecialty training will take on national responsibilities and hence their clinical and research training is of the highest quality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718725/"}

This was a questionnaire survey conducted at the National Obstetric and Gynaecology Specialist Registrar Meeting (SpROGs 2004, Birmingham, UK). A total of 190 trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology attended the meeting. Trainees at the meeting were given a questionnaire to fill in regarding their perception of work-life balance, stress at work and their attitude to training in obstetrics and gynaecology. The response rate was 128/190 (67%). Half of the trainees (64/128, 50%) felt that they had achieved satisfactory work-life balance. There was a trend towards more men achieving this balance compared with women (25/42 (60%) vs 38/83 (46%), p = 0.19). Unsatisfactory social life (82%) and scarce time with the family (74%) were cited as the most common reasons for not achieving a satisfactory work-life balance. More than two-thirds of the trainees (83/128, 65%) found their work moderately or very stressful. Senior trainees (years 4 or more of specialist training) found work more stressful than junior trainees (years 1 - 3 of specialist training) (29/35 (83%) vs 54/93 (58%), p = 0.01). However, 77/128 (60%) of trainees would still recommend a career in obstetrics and gynaecology to medical students. A majority (85/128, 66%) claimed that they would choose obstetrics and gynaecology again if given a second chance. A large number of trainees (110/128, 86%) were looking forward to their future in this field. In spite of the high levels of perceived work-life imbalance and stress at work, most trainees would choose the same specialty given another chance and would recommend the same to others, indicating a certain level of satisfaction with the specialty.

Most obstetrics and gynecology residencies struggle with barriers to efficient, effective research education and productivity for their residents. These barriers include constraints on faculty time, lack of intrinsic desire within individual residents, and lack of relevant outcome measures. We developed an efficient, novel research education curriculum that overcomes many of these barriers and provides obstetrics and gynecology residents with a structured format that maximizes the likelihood of a successful, positive research experience. Since the start of the Clinical Research Education Study Team program, the graduating resident cohorts reliably complete and present prospective research projects, including three registered randomized trials. Residency-wide support for other team research has grown dramatically. The residents' work was acknowledged with several research awards, which further reinforces the positive perception of the program. The certainty of completion of their research requirement relieved our residents of the anxiety commonly reported by residents nearing graduation.

Therefore, we sought to pilot an ethics and professionalism curriculum for faculty in obstetrics and gynaecology to remedy gaps in the formal, informal and hidden curriculum in medical education. An ethics curriculum was developed for faculty within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at a tertiary care, academic hospital. During the one-time, 4-hour, mandatory in-person session, the participants voluntarily completed the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, Handoff Clinical Evaluation Exercise, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine and overall course evaluation. Patient satisfaction survey scores in both the hospital and ambulatory settings were compared before and after the curriculum. Twenty-eight faculty members attended the curriculum. Overall, respondents reported less burnout and performed at the same level or better in terms of patient handoff than the original studies validating the instruments. Faculty rated the professionalism behaviours as well as teaching of professionalism much lower at our institution than the validation study. There was no change in patient satisfaction after the curriculum. However, overall, the course was well received as meeting its objectives, being beneficial and providing new tools to assess professionalism. This pilot study suggests that an ethics curriculum can be developed for practising physicians that is mindful of pragmatic concerns while still meeting its objectives.

Doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) often deal with emotionally demanding situations for themselves and for their patients, and therefore, EI skills may be vital and should be part of any training curriculum. Using novel methodology, 16 O&G consultants from across the North-West of England were asked to investigate (using a coding manual) randomly allocated modules of the RCOG O&G training curriculum, to look for constructs of EI and these were found both implicitly and explicitly, highlighting the importance of EI to O&G.

Recent scholarly work has highlighted the diminishing advanced surgical skills among obstetrician-gynecologists, particularly among new graduates. Therefore, it has become a practice in many institutions to refer complex cesarean deliveries and obstetrical hysterectomies to subspecialists, specifically gynecologic oncologists. Hence, in this commentary, we propose a process through which key personnel within departments of obstetrics and gynecology are identified and their appropriate level of involvement in cases of complex obstetrical surgery is delineated. In doing so, we describe the surgical skills expected from each provider level so that the cesarean delivery complexity level can be matched with specific surgical expertise. Through this process, an obstetrician-led complex obstetrical surgery team is formed. Ultimately, the goal of this process is 2-fold; first, to return cases with higher levels of surgical complexity back to obstetricians and, second, to reduce the surgical back-up burden from gynecology subspecialists such as gynecologic oncologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38969176/"}

Dr Weiss had died in 1900, 15 chief doctors (primarius) applied for the job. All of them belonged to the clinics in Vienna, a fact speaking in favour of the attractiveness of the Department. In addition to the professional qualities the chief should master one of the Slavic languages. It was necessary, because, simultaneously, the midwives' school was organized to give a proper education, primarily to decrease mothers' mortality in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Later, the Department was headed by Dr Mikucki, Dr Bokonjić and Dr Bazala. The Gynecology Obstetrics Clinic was established in April, 1947, headed by Prof. Szabo. In April, 1960, the Gynecology Department was joined to the Clinic, had 320 beds. Afterwards, the Clinic was headed by Prof. Berić, Prof. Knezević, Prof. Simić and Prof. Idrizbegović. The Clinic with the Obstetrics (Secondary) School became a centre of staff education (various types)--Internship, specialization, postgraduate level, doctorship of the gynecological perinatal service of the Republic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7752706/"}

It utilizes many of the elements of the SCORPIO and SPICES models of teaching. In particular, it involves problem-based learning and an integrated approach to teaching. One afternoon per week is set aside for each theme. So far we have introduced Theme Afternoons in Contraception and Sterilization, The Menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy, Screening for Disease in O&G and Examination Techniques. All Theme Afternoons follow a similar structure: a targeted tutorial, 10 MCQs, a 15-minute coffee break, OSCEs, and role-play with feedback. An evaluation form is completed by each student assessing the session and the tutor. The Theme Afternoon provides the student with stimulation to learn. It has a wide appeal and has been well received by learners. Students learn at a more controlled pace and in a more sheltered environment, which may be less stressful to them. It evaluates well and is flexible in its structure. The changes that occur are student-led and the desire for it to continue is student-driven. It is easily adaptable to other medical specialties or even nonmedical curriculums. We recommend it as a realistic opportunity to raise standards and enthusiasm in medical education.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10211295/"}

The 2019 Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology Survey assessed resident self-confidence and perceived readiness to independently perform common surgical procedures. Concurrently, obstetrics and gynecology residency program directors were surveyed about the readiness of their graduating residents to independently perform the same procedures. The overall response rate was 99.3% for residents (5,473/5,514 examinees attempted to complete the survey) and 83% for program directors (241/292 returned surveys). There were no significant differences in graduating residents and program directors' assessments of graduating residents' surgical confidence in performing cesarean delivery (99.6% [95% CI 98.9-99.9] vs 100% [95% CI 98.2-100.0]), vacuum delivery (96.5% [95% CI 95.2-97.4] vs 98.6% [95% CI 95.9-99.7]), abdominal hysterectomy (95.1% [95% CI 93.6-96.2] vs 96.7% [95% CI 93.3-98.7]) or operative hysteroscopy (99.5% [95% CI 98.9-99.9] vs 100% [95% CI 98.2-100.0]). Ninety percent, 86%, and 69% of graduating residents felt that they could independently perform an abdominal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, and vaginal hysterectomy, respectively, in the event of an emergency.

Clerkship directors have long sought strategies to help students become comfortable with the sensitive nature of these examinations. Incorporating standardized patients, simulation and gynecologic teaching associates (GTAs) are approaches gaining widespread use. However, there is a paucity of literature guiding optimal approach and timing. Our primary objective was to survey obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) clerkship directors regarding timing and methods for teaching and assessment of pelvic and breast examination skills in United States medical school curricula, and to assess clerkship director satisfaction with current educational strategies at their institutions. Ob/Gyn clerkship directors from all 135 Liaison Committee on Medical Education accredited allopathic United States medical schools were invited to complete an anonymous 15-item web-based questionnaire. The response rate was 70%. Pelvic and breast examinations are most commonly taught during the second and third years of medical school. Pelvic examinations are primarily taught during the Ob/Gyn and Family Medicine (FM) clerkships, while breast examinations are taught during the Ob/Gyn, Surgery and FM clerkships. GTAs teach pelvic and breast examinations at 72 and 65% of schools, respectively. Over 60% of schools use some type of simulation to teach examination skills. Direct observation by Ob/Gyn faculty is used to evaluate pelvic exam skills at 87% of schools and breast exam skills at 80% of schools. Only 40% of Ob/Gyn clerkship directors rated pelvic examination training as excellent, while 18% rated breast examination training as excellent. Pelvic and breast examinations are most commonly taught during the Ob/Gyn clerkship using GTAs, simulation trainers and clinical patients, and are assessed by direct faculty observation during the Ob/Gyn clerkship. While the majority of Ob/Gyn clerkship directors were not highly satisfied with either pelvic or breast examination training programs, they were less likely to describe their breast examination training programs as excellent as compared to pelvic examination training-overall suggesting an opportunity for improvement. The survey results will be useful in identifying future challenges in teaching such skills in a cost-effective manner.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27986086/"}

OB/GYN GENs were less likely than FPMRS-GYNs to report comfort with pelvic organ prolapse quantification assessment, urodynamic testing, cystoscopy, treatment of mesh complications, and management of overactive bladder. Urologists were less likely than FPMRS-GYNs to report comfort completing a pelvic organ prolapse quantification assessment, fitting pessaries, and treating mesh complications but more likely to report comfort managing overactive bladder. FPMRS-GYNs were more likely than other providers to report high volumes (>20 cases in the past year) of vaginal hysterectomy, as well as incontinence and prolapse procedures. OB/GYN GENs and urologists frequently cited lack of formal training in residency as a barrier to performing FPMRS procedures, whereas FPMRS-GYNs reported a lack of operating room facilities and support personnel. Overall, 76% of the respondents were of the opinion that FPMRS should be a credentialed Canadian subspecialty (92% FPMRS-GYN, 69% OB/GYN GEN, 59% urologists).

We compared prescriptions made for MHI to women seeking outpatient treatment for menopause-related symptoms before and after the publication of the 2002 WHI to study its effect of prescription behavior in Taiwan. There was one dichotomous outcome variable, which was whether MHT was prescribed or not in an outpatient visit to treat menopause-related symptoms. Our study included 504 women 45 years old or above whose outpatient visits for menopause-related symptoms were covered by National Health Insurance in 2002. In total, these 504 women made 2549 outpatient visits to be treated for these symptoms. The proportion of outpatient visits in which MHT was prescribed dropped from 83.0% (n = 1,155) before WHI to 73.0% (n = 844) after WHI. We found a decrease in likelihood that women would be prescribed MHT for menopause-related symptoms after the release of the WHI report (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.52, p < 0.05).

Most obstetrician-gynecologists viewed screening for vaccine-preventable diseases to be within their professional role, and a majority administers at least some vaccines. Over half agreed financial factors (eg, inadequate reimbursement, cost of storing vaccines) were barriers to vaccine administration. Other perceived barriers were a concern over safety of vaccinations during pregnancy and a view that administering vaccines was not part of their usual practice. They were also concerned about their level of training. A majority believed their immunization training was less than adequate, and believed their practice would benefit from continuing medical education courses. One study identified changes in Michigan obstetrician-gynecologists' attitudes, knowledge and practices since 2000. More Michigan ob-gyns are assessing vaccination needs, viewing this as part of their professional purview, and, in general, their knowledge of vaccine recommendations has improved.

We analysed the interventions and procedures performed by ten trainees who completed their specialisation between 2006 and 2009. The analysis was based on the EBCOG-Log Books. According to our survey the minimum requirements are better fulfilled in obstetrics compared to gynaecology. There is an imbalance between the EBCOG theoretical demand and practical performance of the trainees in gynaecology because of limited possibilities to perform traditional operations to the required extent. Consequently, gynaecological aspects in training need more resources and new alternative activities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23720951/"}

The Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology In-Service Examination in 1995, given to 4361 residents, who represented all programs in the country, included a questionnaire on whether obstetrics and gynecology was primary care and whether they planned to do primary care after residency. Primary care services were categorized by counseling and screening, as defined by the U.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force. Variables included gender, residency level (upper or lower), and type of residency (community or university based). Data were analyzed using the chi2 text and multiple analyses of variance. The response rate was 94% (4099 of 4361), representing a nationwide complement. Eighty-seven percent of the respondents believed that obstetrics and gynecology was primary care and 85% planned to practice accordingly after residency. Residents spend less than 25% of their time counseling on nongynecologic subjects and less than 25% of their time screening for nongynecologic entities, so their perception as primary care providers focused on traditional obstetric and gynecologic counseling and screening services. When assessments were made by gender, level of training, and type of residency, significant differences were found in many variables regarding counseling and screening practices. Our survey results suggest that most American obstetrics and gynecology residents consider obstetrics and gynecology primary care but that there were limitations in the educational venues for learning about nongynecologic primary care before the implementation of the Residency Review Committee Special Requirements. Improvement in nongynecologic primary care teaching is a reasonable expectation because residency programs have had 3 years to institute the mandated changes and provide it to residents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10511373/"}

The ability of natural language processing systems, such as ChatGPT, to successfully engage with healthcare systems requiring fluid reasoning, specialist data interpretation, and empathetic communication in an unfamiliar and evolving environment is poorly studied. This study investigated whether the ChatGPT interface could engage with and complete a mock objective structured clinical examination simulating assessment for membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. This study aimed to determine whether ChatGPT, without additional training, would achieve a score at least equivalent to that achieved by human candidates who sat for virtual objective structured clinical examinations in Singapore. This study was conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase, a total of 7 structured discussion questions were selected from 2 historical cohorts (cohorts A and B) of objective structured clinical examination questions. ChatGPT was examined using these questions and responses recorded in a script. Of note, 2 human candidates (acting as anonymizers) were examined on the same questions using videoconferencing, and their responses were transcribed verbatim into written scripts. The 3 sets of response scripts were mixed, and each set was allocated to 1 of 3 human actors. In the second phase, actors were used to presenting these scripts to examiners in response to the same examination questions. These responses were blind scored by 14 qualified examiners. ChatGPT scores were unblinded and compared with historical human candidate performance scores. The average score given to ChatGPT by 14 examiners was 77.2%. The average historical human score (n=26 candidates) was 73.7 %. ChatGPT demonstrated sizable performance improvements over the average human candidate in several subject domains. The median time taken for ChatGPT to complete each station was 2.54 minutes, well before the 10 minutes allowed. ChatGPT generated factually accurate and contextually relevant structured discussion answers to complex and evolving clinical questions based on unfamiliar settings within a very short period. ChatGPT outperformed human candidates in several knowledge areas. Not all examiners were able to discern between human and ChatGPT responses. Our data highlight the emergent ability of natural language processing models to demonstrate fluid reasoning in unfamiliar environments and successfully compete with human candidates that have undergone extensive specialist training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088277/"}

AI software has been able to beat world champions in chess, Go and recently even Poker. Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology. The list of medical image-analysis AI applications with USA Food and Drug Administration or European Union (soon to fall under European Union Medical Device Regulation) approval is growing rapidly and covers diverse clinical needs, such as detection of arrhythmia using a smartwatch or automatic triage of critical imaging studies to the top of the radiologist's worklist. Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good-quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary.

Shortage of health professionals and health facilities equipped to offer EOC and emergency obstetric care 24 hours a day are significantly related to quality of care and maternal mortality rates. Since the Primary Health Care (PHC) level is usually the first contact point for the majority of our women, it must be able to deliver the essential services in full and make appropriate referrals when necessary.

Produced by the educational arm of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) exam is a multiple-choice test given to all residents annually. Residency programs participating in this study provided residency program mean CREOG scores from the year prior (2015), and the first (2016) and second (2017) years of TrueLearn usage. Programs also contributed resident-specific CREOG scores for each resident for 2016 and 2017. This data was combined with each resident's TrueLearn usage data that was provided by TrueLearn with residency program consent. The CREOG scores consisted of the CREOG score standardized to all program years, the CREOG score standardized to the same program year (PGY) and the total percent (%) correct. TrueLearn usage data included number of practice questions completed, number of practice tests taken, average number of days between successive tests, and percent correct of answered practice questions. OBGYN Residency Training Programs. OBGYN residency programs that purchased and utilized TrueLearn for the 2016 CREOG examination were eligible for participation (n = 14). Ten residency programs participated, which consisted of 212 residents in 2016 and 218 residents in 2017. TrueLearn was used by 78.8% (167/212) of the residents in 2016 and 84.9% (185/218) of the residents in 2017. No significant difference was seen in the average CREOG scores available on a per- program level before versus after the first year of implementation either using the CREOG score standardized to all PGYs (mean difference 1.0; p = 0.58) or standardized to the same PGY (mean difference 3.1; p = 0.25). Using resident-level data, there was no significant difference in mean CREOG score standardized to all PGYs between users and non-users of TrueLearn in 2016 (mean, 199.4 vs 196.7; p = 0.41) or 2017 (mean, 198.2 vs 203.4; p = 0.19). The percent of practice questions answered correctly on TrueLearn was positively correlated with the CREOG score standardized to all PGYs (r = 0.47 for 2016 and r = 0.60 for 2017), as well as with the CREOG total percent correct (r = 0.47 for 2016 and r = 0.61 for 2017). Based on a simple linear regression, for every 500 practice questions completed, the CREOG score significantly increased for PGY-2 residents by an average (±SE) of 7.3 ± 2.8 points (p = 0.013); the average increase was 0.7 ± 2.5 (p = 0.79) for PGY-3 residents and 5.8 ± 3.3 points (p = 0.09) for PGY-4 residents.

They will become pregnant at some point in their training program or career. The present review focuses on all work-related exposure risks for pregnant obstetrics and gynaecology professionals. It discusses the risks of infectious diseases, radiation, stress, violence against doctors, and even peer support (or lack of it) that can have deleterious effects on the health of pregnant physicians and the health of their unborn foetuses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35853832/"}

Nevertheless, it is estimated that over 90% of pregnant women take over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication [2]. Considering the fact that the use of medication in the period before conception and during lactation can also influence the development of the child, information on the impact of their usage during reproductive life is important for everyone. The lack of clear information on this topic results in situations where life-saving medication is discontinued, withheld or used in a reduced dosage by pregnant women, while on the other hand medicines with (potential) toxic effects are taken. This is unacceptable and it is a major public concern that must be addressed. Currently, Europe lacks a robust and comprehensive information system about medication use in reproductive life (preconception, pregnancy and lactation). In order to improve maternal health, and subsequently the health of our next generation, reliable and up to date information should be made available. It should be readily accessible for both health care providers and women who are considering getting pregnant or who are already pregnant. In order to tackle this gap in public health, this paper describes current knowledge of the use of medicines before and during pregnancy. It calls upon all stakeholders involved in medical care, research and medicine regulation, such as policy makers, regulators and governmental agencies, to take action to protect patients and improve public health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27132708/"}

Mixed Vaginitis (MV) eg. the vaginal infection caused by at least two out of the triad of pathogens (fungi, bacteria and Trichomonas Vaginalis [TV]), constitutes the type of vaginitis which is underestimated as for its prevalence. Mixed pathogens are responsible for as much as one third of all vaginal infections. Macmiror Complex 500 contains two active ingredients: nifuratel and nystatin. Macmiror Complex 500 affects all common causes of vulvovaginitis, i.e. bacteria, yeasts and TV. At the same time, it is not effective against Lactobacillus spp., which is a clear advantage in the treatment of vaginal infections. The antibacterial spectrum of nifuratel includes aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Moreover nifuratel is effective against Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma spp., it has an anti-trichomonal effect comparable to metranidazole and shows certain activity against Candida spp. Nystatin is effective against Candida albicans and is even very effective against Candida glabrata which is usually more resistant to imidazole antifungal agents. Nystatin's importance is rising due to the current increase of candidoses caused by non-albicans types. This increase is especially perceptible in recurring candidoses. The review of the available literature on the effectiveness of Macmiror Complex 500 in the OB/GYN practice leads to the following conclusions: the exeptionally broad antibacterial and antifungal and trichomonicidal activity of this formulation makes it a drug of choice in cases where MV is suspected. The possibility to treat both partners, favorable safety profile in pregnant patients and the availability of both vaginal ovules and the cream with applicator makes this drug an effective and suitable treatment option in obstetrical and gynecologic practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23488303/"}

A logistic regression model, which accounted for nonindependent observations through generalized estimating equations, was used to identify factors associated with the provision of ECP advanced prescriptions. Approximately one-fifth of eligible visits (19.9%) and eligible patients (19.1%) had documentation of an ECP advanced prescription when indicated. Healthcare providers in this clinical setting were more likely to prescribe ECPs to adolescents and women whose primary contraceptive methods were associated with higher failure rates in typical use, such as condoms. Compared with women aged 20 to 25 years, the adjusted odds ratio of receiving an advanced prescription for ECPs was 5.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.85-12.41) for adolescents.

Australian obstetrician and gynaecologist, Professor Derek Llewellyn-Jones responded to frustrations with the limitations of this narrow approach from both within and beyond the medical profession. His pioneering research, education and writings re-conceptualised the discipline as encompassing the social and psychological contexts and profoundly influenced women's own understanding of their health and the practice of obstetrics and gynaecology. The biopsychosocial model has replaced biological determinism and is now pervasive in education and clinical practice in many parts of the world. Widespread acceptance of the model has until now been associated with under-recognition of the importance of biology. Recent findings from epigenetics and neuroscience are enabling integration of body, mind and society and enhanced understanding and practice of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26732974/"}

Additional clerkship sites (n=10) were identified using the Association of Professors in Gynecology and Obstetrics' (APGO) list of current members self-identified as clerkship directors. Written surveys were mailed to the individuals identified above. The survey included questions about demographic and academic profiles, 11 attitude statements, as well as potential interest in a national organization of clerkship directors under APGO and interest in the creation of web-based resources specifically for clerkship directors. One hundred twenty-three (81%) responses were received. Demographic and academic characteristics of clerkship directors were similar to those published 13 (1) and 6 (2) years ago, except that the proportion of female clerkship directors has steadily increased (20% in 1989 [1], 25% in 1994 [2], and 44% in 2000, P <.0001). Thirty-five percent of departments have a specialized division of medical education, and 21% of respondents stated that their affiliated medical school had a formal multidisciplinary women's health care curriculum.

Participants found the course useful and relevant to their practices and strongly recommended the incorporation of similar courses in early years of training. Impact Statement <b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Operating room is the mainstay of surgeons and the majority of the studies done in the operating room relate to structured courses to teach residents about non-technical skills, with training and evaluation done on the same day. These either explores the perception of trainees, expansion of the cognitive component and/or feasibility of training for non-technical skills. To date, there is a lack of evidence in the literature to address questions regarding the appropriate time to incorporate non-technical skills in the curriculum, due to study designs. This highlights the need for more randomised control trials with different curricular designs to evaluate effectiveness. <b>What do the results of this study add?</b> The results of our study enable a comparative analysis between learning curves of conventional training, with the experimental group demonstrating the effectiveness of a training course. This strongly supports implementation of non-technical training in postgraduate competency-based curricula. <b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> This study shall be used as an evidence-based source to design curricula for teaching non-technical skills to residents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328599/"}

These reports involved women who underwent hysteroscopic resection of myoma(s). A search of validated items was conducted for all of the reports, and the missing items were analysed. The different types of practitioners and between hospital and private medical offices were also compared with Chi-square tests. A total of 138 reports were analysed; 71 were performed in private offices and 67 were performed in the gynaecologic unit of the hospital. Many items were missing in the reports, with disparities between the type of institution (private offices or hospital) and the speciality of practitioners (radiologists or gynaecologists). Specific items regarding myomas, such as the International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) classification or measurement of the posterior wall, were more often missing in reports from radiologists (89.7% and 79.5%, respectively) than in reports from gynaecologists (21.2% and 34.3%, respectively) (P<0.05).

In contrast, 41.42% of publications concerned obstetrics, 33.9% on other benign gynecology, 41.9% on gynecologic oncology, and 24.7% on reproductive endocrinology and infertility. This study reveals consistent underrepresentation of urogynecology topics in leading OBGYN journals. Given that generalist gynecologists may not subscribe to subspecialty journals, this study underscores the need for the inclusion of urogynecologic research in OBGYN journals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39902850/"}

Each included study was evaluated by two reviewers using a quality checklist that was based on international guidelines for medical economic evaluation studies and a checklist used in a previous review. The mean number of quality criteria adhered to was 23 of 30 items, whereas five articles (3%) met all 30 criteria.

This curriculum was specifically aimed at residents in obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine. The curriculum was designed to convince these physicians that they needed to participate in promotion of preconception health for many reasons, such as the need to teach women to take folic acid daily because it significantly decreases the incidence of neural tube defects. Because over 50% of all pregnancies are unplanned, it is imperative that all physicians think of themselves as preconception health providers. Our group then taught the curriculum to medical students, residents, fellows, and attending physicians in all specialties at four hospitals affiliated with the medical college. Evaluation of the curriculum in 171 physicians who participated revealed that only a small percentage of physicians took folic acid daily themselves. Almost 36% of the obstetricians did not currently provide preconception care for their patients. Most physicians in all specialties believed that the curriculum provided them with useful information for their practice.

Among the most common procedures performed in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), abortion is a core competency for OB/GYN residency programs. For nearly 50 years, the procedure was federally protected by the U.S. Supreme Court's January 22, 1973, Roe v Wade decision. On June 24, 2022, amidst increasing state restrictions limiting abortion access, the Court's decision on Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization effectively reversed Roe . As a result, immediate bans on abortion went into effect across the country, removing access to abortion for millions of people and newly limiting training and education in this core competency for many medical residents. As of June 2022, nearly half of U.S. OB/GYN residency programs and more than 40% of residents are located in states that have banned or are likely to ban abortion. In states where abortion is restricted or illegal, states must adapt quickly to ensure their residents meet training requirements. This adaptation may include developing and leveraging relationships with programs in states where access is protected, depending on simulation, and placing greater emphasis on education and training in pregnancy loss management and postabortion care. None of these is a comprehensive solution and even all together, they are insufficient to train residents and medical students. Ultimately, many future physicians will not receive the training they need to provide full reproductive health care to their pregnant patients. Legal and other systems of support are needed to ensure that current and future physicians can provide compassionate, evidence-based reproductive health care, including essential abortion care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36656271/"}

Currently there is minimal consensus on how to interpret and validate professional experience, medical knowledge and surgical skills for doctors (accredited in Obstetrics and Gynaecology) who have an interest in and wish to achieve sub-specialisation in PAG. The challenge for the future of PAG is to create a framework of guidelines and references which in turn culminates in improvement and harmonisation in PAG healthcare delivery. The development of a post-specialty training curriculum in PAG for accredited practitioners was a logical next step after EBCOG introduced the PACT curriculum for OBGYN trainees. The guiding principle in the development of the PAG curriculum has been to strive for harmonisation in teaching and training in PAG within Europe. The new EURAPAG curriculum is divided in 17 chapters which in turn have been subdivided into medical and surgical sections plus a baseline skills section. The content has been determined through a consensus procedure amongst European gynaecologists and trainees. The medical chapters involve pathology that requires conservative treatment, prevention, education or lifestyle adjustment. The chapters that are both medical and surgical have a surgical (alternative) treatment ranging from vaginal procedures to advanced hysteroscopic and laparoscopic procedures and laparotomy. Currently, the framework for any medical education is workplace based competency training. Specific tools have been developed for workplace based assessments, such as direct observation (DO) of clinical task performance, Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), mini-clinical evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX) or case-based discussion (CBD). To measure progress in this PAG post-specialty training curriculum, the subspecialty trainee will be required to maintain and update a portfolio of experience and competency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33422776/"}

Patients may present with signs of physical abuse, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, and nonspecific somatic complaints. As with intimate partner violence, clinicians should be suspicious if the patient is accompanied by an individual who refuses to leave her side. Other potential red flags include patients with wounds in various stages of healing, patients appearing fearful or unable to answer specific questions, and patients who do not have any personal identification.

Using weighting to account for nonresponse, we generated estimates of the proportion of OB/GYNS providing abortion and used multivariate regression analysis to explore factors associated with abortion provision including practice type, physician sex, and sufficient abortion training. A total of 198 OB/GYNs responded to the survey (response rate = 29%). Of 158 OB/GYNs not in training, 55% provide some abortion care. More respondents reported sufficient training for surgical abortion (84%) than for medication abortion (43%). The most cited reasons for not providing abortion care were lack of integration into their clinical practice (29%), institutional opposition (27%), or personal opposition to abortion (23%). In multivariate analysis, female physicians were more likely to provide abortion care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.72, 95% CI [1.63-4.55], p < 0.01), and those with insufficient training less likely to provide abortion (aOR 0.18, 95% CI [0.10-0.33], p = 0.01).

Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms. Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics.

Osmotic dilators have been used to ripen the cervix in gynecologic and obstetric procedures for centuries. Their gradual effect in softening and dilating the cervix reduces the chance of stretch injury or perforation and could enhance completeness of evacuation of the uterine cavity. Natural and synthetic devices are available, each with unique properties. Notwithstanding major advances in prostaglandin analogs as cervical ripeners, these mechanical devices continue to play a vital role in cervical preparation. In the event of an unfavorable cervix, they are adjuncts for accelerating inductions of labor and for safe uterine entry during hysteroscopy and diagnostic dilation and curettage. For inducing pregnancy, they are routinely used as cervical ripeners from the late first trimester onward. The English-language literature was surveyed. The author used citations from a MEDLINE search, 2 unpublished case reports, and personal experience. Laminaria and Dilapan dilators can get trapped and fragment with the potential for serious adverse clinical and legal consequences. Lamicel devices do not share this feature. Serious infection is uncommon and anaphylaxis is rare. Timely, well-selected imaging techniques can aid diagnosis. Preventative measures could reduce the number and severity of osmotic dilator-associated complications. Measures suggested by some include predilating with metal dilators, incorporating laminaria or Lamicel devices with Dilapan, adding misoprostol, and using sonohysterography. However, these measures, singly and in combination, are unlikely to eliminate all complications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15199271/"}

This systematic review examines: (i) female patients' gender preferences and perceptions of men as Ob/Gyns and/or medical students; and (ii) the influence of gender on students' education and career decisions. We identified relevant research via PubMed using variations of three concepts in combination: Ob/Gyn care, gender bias/preference, and medical education or career. We conducted the initial review in 2018 and repeated the search in March 2021, adding additional references via citation review of included research. We restricted the review to original research from the United States between 2000-2021. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, categorised into three groups: (i) patient's gender preference for Ob/Gyns; (ii) patient's gender preference for medical students during the Ob/Gyn clerkship; and (iii) influence of gender bias on Ob/Gyn career decisions. Patients prioritised their physician's care attributes (eg technical skill, compassion, experience) over gender when choosing Ob/Gyns; however, provider gender was prioritised for medical students. Male medical students more commonly reported exclusion from clinical opportunities, although objective clinical exposure was like that of female counterparts. Despite perceived gender bias, male medical students reported increased Ob/Gyn interest post-clerkship; interest did not translate into residency applications. These findings are limited by study quality and heterogeneity. Real and perceived gender bias among female patients and male medical students in Ob/Gyn may underlie declining numbers of men entering the field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35293613/"}

We reviewed our housestaff records from July 1992 to June 1998 and the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) subspeciality match results for gynecologic oncology from its inception in 1994 to 1999. From July 1992 to June 1998, a total of 146 residents participated in our elective program. Of the 104 candidates who went through our program and subsequently participated in the NRMP, 55 (53%) obtained match positions. After completion of the elective, 42 of the 146 residents (29%) did not participate in the NRMP for gynecologic oncology and therefore were not eligible to obtain match appointments. During the study period, there were 255 other residents in the United States who applied for gynecologic oncology fellowship positions through the NRMP and did not participate in our program. Of these 255 candidates, 137 (54%) matched. The percentage of residents who went through our program, participated in the NRMP, and obtained fellowships did not differ significantly from the percentage of residents who matched without participating in the program. However, almost one-third of the residents who went through our program did not participate in the NRMP. The reasons for their lack of participation were not formally evaluated, but are likely related to a personal decision to pursue another carrer pathway, a decision facilitiated by their experience in our program. Therefore, it appears that the main benefits of the program are to help potential candidates decide whether or not to pursue a career in gyencologic oncology and to aid fellowship programs in identifying exceptional candidates for subspecialty training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11695806/"}

Respondents ranked honesty; accountability to patients, colleagues, and society; respect for patients; integrity; and excellence as the most important qualities of professionalism. Almost 79% believed those qualities were as important and as necessary as qualities of skill and knowledge in residency training. Almost 80% of respondents thought that the establishment of formal professionalism guidelines would be valuable in their training programs.

Applying patient profile and health care demand equations, we estimated the demand for providers in 2010 in each state for comparison with supply based on the 2010 American Medical Association Masterfile. U.S. Census Bureau population projections were used to project women's health care demands in 2020. The national demand for women's health care is forecast to grow by 6% by 2020. Most (81%) ob-gyn related services will be for women of reproductive age (18-44 years old). Growth in demand is forecast to be highest in states with the greatest population growth (Texas, Florida), where supply is currently less than adequate (western United States), and among Hispanic women. This increase in demand by 2020 will translate into a need for physicians or nonphysician clinicians, which is clinically equivalent to 2,090 full-time ob-gyns. Using today's national norms of ob-gyn related services, a modest growth in women's health care demands is estimated by 2020 that will require a larger provider workforce.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23829185/"}

His work and skill, most assuredly, contributed to the better comprehension, acknowledgement and reputation of the gynaecological-obstetrical practice, thus leaving repute and respect in medical history latitude. All these cases occurred in Dubrovnik during 1555-1557 and Amatus is assuredly an excellent observer and exactist, extracting the \"relevant from the non-relevant\" even in Dubrovnik's gynaecological-obstetrical daily happenings.

Given well documented staff shortages within obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland, it is increasingly important to understand the factors which influence medical students to choose or reject a career in the speciality. The aim of this study was to ascertain the perceptions of final year graduate entry medical students of obstetrics and gynaecology, including the factors which may influence a student's decision to pursue in a career in the speciality. Paper-based surveys of graduate entry medical students (n = 146) were conducted at the beginning and end of a six week rotation in obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland. Responses to the surveys pre- and post-rotation were matched and changes in career choices, merits and demerits over time were analysed. All analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows version 25. The responses of 72 students to both questionnaires could be matched (response rate of 49.3%). No male students expressed an interest in obstetrics, gynaecology or both as a first choice of career in the pre rotation survey. Obstetrics as a first choice of career increased from 6.9% pre rotation to 19.4% post rotation (p = 0.04) and this increase was seen in male and female students. Gynaecology as a first choice increased slightly from 1.4 to 4.2% (p = 0.50) and the dual speciality increased from 6.9 to 13.9% (p = 0.23). Students identified many merits of obstetrics pre-rotation with more than 60% identifying it as exciting, interesting fulfilling and challenging. However, incompatibility with family life was cited as a demerit by 72% of respondents and 68.1% identified fear of litigation as a demerit. Participants were less positive overall about the merits of a career in gynaecology with less than 40% viewing it as exciting, fulfilling, and varied. While respondents were positive about the merits of a career in obstetrics and gynecology, concerns remain about work-life balance, career opportunities, and the high-risk nature of the specialty. These concerns should be addressed by the profession and policy makers if they wish to attract sufficient numbers to address anticipated need in the coming years.

Obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) are uniquely positioned to assess women's suicide risk. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> A 53-question survey was distributed to the Pregnancy-Related Care Research Network, assessing practice, attitudes, and knowledge regarding suicide risk assessment and management, and personal experience with suicide. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with paired samples were used to compare the frequency of screening and interventions for different groups of women, and practices of those with and without suicide experience. Significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Response rate was 31.9%. Respondents were largely White females. OB/GYNs reported more frequently screening for suicide ideation/intent/behavior among pregnant and postpartum patients than nonpregnant/nonpostpartum patients of childbearing age. The most common assessment tool was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; half ask about past suicide ideation/behavior or current thoughts/plans. The most common intervention for at-risk patients was a mental health referral; all interventions were reported more frequently for pregnant patients. Common barriers to screening were inadequate mental health services, time constraints, and inadequate training. Most agreed suicide screening is within their purview, and were knowledgeable about the topic, although gaps were identified. Few reported adequate training in suicide risk assessment, and believed continuing education would be beneficial. A majority endorsed experience with suicide and some practice differences emerged. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> OB/GYNs view suicide risk assessment in their scope. Some knowledge gaps were identified, and respondents believe additional training would be beneficial.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35984865/"}

Simulation has been validated in the literature as contributing to positive outcomes in achieving learning objectives, maintaining individual and team competence, and enhancing patient safety. Simulation is a well-developed modality with established principles to maximize its utility and create a safe environment for simulation participants. Simulation is most effective when it involves interprofessional collaboration, institutional support, and regular repetition. This modality improves teamwork skills, patient outcomes, and health care spending. Upholding prescribed principles of psychological safety when implementing a simulation program minimizes harm to participants.

This descriptive study examined data from the National Residency Match Program for academic years 2000-2012. Annual comparisons were made between the numbers of residents who either pursued careers in their specialty or were accepted into fellowship training in an accredited subspecialty. We compared the numbers in each group who took the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG) written board examination and who became board-certified. Although the annual number of residency graduates in obstetrics and gynecology remained essentially the same (1,185 ± 56), the proportion of graduates accepted into fellowships increased steadily in all subspecialties (from 7.0% in 2000 to 19.5% in 2012). All other core specialties saw higher proportions of their graduates pursuing subspecialties except for family medicine. Coincident with rises in fellowship programs and positions was eventual increase in trainees who took the ABOG written examination for the first time in the three established subspecialties (maternal-fetal medicine, gynecologic oncology, reproductive endocrinology and infertility) and who became board-certified. Like with residents in other specialties, more graduates in obstetrics and gynecology are pursuing accredited subspecialty fellowship training, adding to the complexities of workforce planning.

This nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted annually in Japan from 2019 to 2024, targeting post-senior residency obstetricians and gynecologists. The survey collected data on demographics, timing, reasons for choosing obstetrics and gynecology, and changes in concerns from pre- to post-senior residency. The survey received 2049 responses out of 2458 distributed surveys, resulting in a response rate of 83.9% (60.6% female, 39.4% male). Moreover, 52.4% of respondents initially considered obstetrics and gynecology during medical school, with females more likely to consider it before medical school than males (24.8% vs. 17.3%). Clinical clerkship experience was the most common reason (57.7%), particularly among females compared to males (62.3% vs. 50.5%). However, males were more influenced by family members or relatives (6.9% vs. 13.1%) and lectures (8.6% vs. 12.6%) than females. Pre-residency concerns-physical burden, mental burden, night on-call demands, marriage and family planning, career path planning, litigation risks, and workforce shortages-were higher in females than in males, although these concerns decreased significantly post-residency, excluding those regarding workforce shortages and income. Male-specific concern about the \"need for male physicians\" decreased significantly from 32.3% to 11.9%.

Additionally, various factors, including specific job-related tasks, costs, and benefits, may impact ob-gyns' career satisfaction. Ethical concerns and career satisfaction can play a role in the quality of women's health care. This article summarizes the studies published between 2005 and 2009 by the Research Department of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which encompass ethical concerns regarding interactions with pharmaceutical representatives and patient safety/medical error reporting, as well as ob-gyn career satisfaction. Additionally, a brief discussion regarding ethical concerns in the ob-gyn field, in general, highlights key topics for the last 30 years. Ethical dilemmas continue to be of concern for ob-gyns. Familiarity with guidelines on appropriate interactions with industry is associated with lower percentages of potentially problematic relationships with pharmaceutical industries. Physicians report that the expense of patient safety initiatives is one of the top barriers for improving patient safety, followed by fear of liability. Overall, respondents reported being satisfied with their careers. However, half of the respondents reported that they were extremely concerned about the impact of professional liability costs on the duration of their careers. Increased familiarity with guidelines may lead to a decreased ob-gyn reliance on pharmaceutical representatives and free samples, whereas specific and practical tools may help them implement patient safety techniques. The easing of malpractice insurance and threat of litigation may enhance career satisfaction among ob-gyns. This article will discuss related findings in recent years.

We evaluated the career plans of Canadian residents in obstetrics and gynaecology to determine the proportion of residents currently considering a career in gynaecologic oncology (GO) and to explore factors that may affect their career decisions. Following institutional ethics approval, all residents at 13 participating Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residency training programs were contacted by email to complete a 20-item confidential questionnaire examining career plans. Quantitative data were analyzed using SAS v9.1. Qualitative data were coded by theme and grouped into various domains. Of 293 residents, 105 (36%) participated. More than half of these were considering at least one obstetrics and gynaecology subspecialty, but 53% indicated that their most appealing career path was general obstetrics and gynaecology. Although 50% of residents had ever considered a career in GO, only 17% were considering a GO career at the time of the survey. When rated as positive influences, medical school exposure, resident exposure, role models within GO, colleagues, other health care professionals, \"my individual life circumstances,\" \"my personal attributes,\" the clinical, research, and educational components of GO, the GO patient population, and relation with gynaecologic oncologists and other specialists were significant predictors of current GO interest. Themes that emerged from qualitative analysis revealed that the clinical, professional, and research domains were predominant influences among residents currently considering a career in GO. GO is an infrequent career choice for Canadian residents in obstetrics and gynaecology, and a number of factors significantly affect GO career decisions.

Data were analysed with descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and odds ratios as appropriate. Of 195 medical students approached, 134 completed the questionnaire, a response rate of 68.7%. The majority were female (55.2%, n = 74) and 76.1% of respondents (n = 102) were Direct Entry Medicine students, with the remainder Graduate Entry Medicine students. 30.8% (n = 41) of students who responded scored 6 or more on a 10-point Likert scale when asked about their likelihood of considering a career in O&G. Students' clerkship experience factored heavily into their perception of the specialty and was more likely to be positive if they experienced direct consultant engagement and the opportunity for hands-on experience. Lifestyle factors, litigation and media were found to be deterrents to considering the specialty after graduation. This study demonstrates the importance of good clerkship experience in fostering an interest amongst undergraduates in O&G. Educators and those working within the specialty should showcase the strengths of the specialty during undergraduate education, and work on ameliorating deterrents to ultimately provide a structured approach to improving recruitment into O&G.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38051720/"}

Simulation in the training of obstetricians and gynaecologists.", "text": "This paper discusses the use of simulation as a training tool in obstetrics and gynaecology. Modern medical training and patient pressure for treatment by more experienced clinicians have contributed to a reduction in the training opportunities available to junior doctors. Advances in information technology have led to the successful introduction of simulator-based training in many safety-critical industries such as aviation and nuclear power. In this editorial we describe simulation devices that are available to obstetrics and gynaecology and explain how simulation can benefit the patient, trainee and educator. We also explore how simulation could be integrated into obstetrics and gynaecology training programmes. At present simulation is very much underused as a training tool in medicine, and features little in the postgraduate training curriculum. In obstetrics and gynaecology simulation could be used as an educational tool to assist in (1) transfer of knowledge, (2) practising diagnostic and simple practical skills, (3) surgical skills training, (4) emergency drill training and (5) human factors and team training. Whereas simulation should not be perceived as a replacement for training with real patients, educators should embrace the opportunities that simulation provides and integrate it into current training programmes to maximize training opportunities and patient safety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16258334/"}

The ultimate goal for all residency programs is to ensure a skilled, competent physician, capable of independent practice by the end of his or her training. An online search was used for nationally recognized OBGYN training curricula. The curricula of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States were individually reviewed and evaluated for their use of competency-based medical education and methods of assessment, including simulation. These were also compared to the World Federation for Medical Education's Global Standards for postgraduate medical education. Comparing the OBGYN curricula of these five countries led to quite similar results. Even though curricula reviewed have or will be integrating competency-based medical education into their residency program, there is a need to develop adequate assessment tools, including simulation, to train competent physicians capable of independent practice. Standardization of curricula leads to a decrease in the variability and an increase in the quality of training and allows for measurements and comparisons across centres. Ultimately, modifications to the curricula or even consensus for an international standard, including a standardized national simulation curriculum, may potentially increase the quality and efficiency of training, which could have a direct impact on patient safety and quality of care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28532631/"}

Once a year we tested each resident on 12 structured surgical bench tasks. At the end of each year, we conducted formal objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) with all residents attempting multiple surgical procedures. We compared residents who had 4 years of laboratory training with those who started residency earlier and had only 1 or 2 years of the new curriculum. We also compared residents' own performance from year to year and cohort performance by resident year. PGY3 and PGY4s who had 4 years of surgical laboratory training did significantly better on bench laboratory skills than PGY3 and PGY4s with fewer years of training sessions (total scores of 48.8 vs 30.3, P < .001). However, no significant improvement in surgical procedures as measured by global OSATS was found. When comparing residents' own performance between the beginning and the end of 1 year, global OSATS scores improved significantly on laparoscopic salpingotomy (P < .001) and open oophorectomy (P < .001). For the cohort of PGY4s completing 4 years of laboratory training, average global OSATS scores showed statistically significant improvement (PGY1, PGY2 < PGY3 < PGY4, P < .001).

We conducted a departmental quality improvement initiative consisting of weekly 1-hour yoga classes conducted during protected education time and nutrition and physical challenges for 24 obstetrics and gynecology residents and five maternal-fetal medicine fellows. Participants received a free wrist-worn fitness tracker device to record their activity. Preprogram and postprogram data collection included results from validated scales on burnout, mindfulness, depression and anxiety, blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used for analysis. A P-value <.05 was considered significant. Over an 8-week period, 90% (n=26) of participants attended at least one yoga class and 68% attended at least 50% of the classes. No participant completed all sessions. Eighty percent (n=20) engaged in at least one nutrition challenge and 60% (n=15) in at least one physical challenge. After the program, a significant reduction in the depersonalization component of burnout (P=.04), anxiety (P=.02), and systolic (preprogram: 122, postprogram: 116 mm Hg; P=.01) and diastolic blood pressure (preprogram: 82, postprogram: 76 mm Hg; P=.01) occurred. Those participants who attended more than 50% of yoga classes demonstrated a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with less-frequent attendees (P=.02 and .04, respectively).

This study explores the impact of the current medico-legal and regulatory culture in Ireland on the decision of graduate entry medical students to enter one high risk specialty, obstetrics and gynecology. We conducted a survey of 146 final-year, graduate-entry medical students pre- and post- a 6-week rotation in obstetrics and gynecology in Ireland. Participants were asked to rate the influence (on a four-point scale) of factors such as fear of being sued, being reported to the regulatory body or criminal prosecution on their decision to pursue a career in obstetrics or gynaecology. Data were matched pre- and post-rotation and McNemar-Bowker's test was used to test for differences in related data. All analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows version 25. The responses of 72 students to both questionnaires could be matched (response rate 49.3%). The majority of participants pre-rotation reported that fear of being sued (74%), fear of being reported to the regulatory body (70%) and fear of criminal prosecution (55%) were factors influencing their decision (somewhat or to a great extent) to pursue a career in obstetrics. There were no significant changes post-rotation. Compared to obstetrics, lower proportions of participants pre-rotation considered fear of being sued (54%), fear of being reported to the regulatory body (50%) and fear of criminal prosecution (40%) as factors influencing their decision to pursue a career in gynecology. There were no significant changes post-rotation. Medico-legal and regulatory culture is shaping the perceptions of graduate entry medical students of obstetrics and gynecology and influencing their decision to pursue a career in the speciality. Understanding the impact of medico-legal culture on career choices including a high-risk specialty such as obstetrics and gynecology is important from both a policy and reform context, and if the healthcare service is to recruit and retain adequate numbers to ensure the safe provision of healthcare.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39413548/"}

Here, medical students shall be introduced to this multifaceted specialty and have their interest in it kindled. This article reports about the experiences of the first gynaecological summer school which was held at the University Hospital Heidelberg for 2 days in August 2018. The programme included keynote presentations, discussion roundtables and skills-lab training. To assess students' related satisfaction, and to improve future projects, an evaluation survey with seven items and two open-comment questions was given to each participant after the event. Mostly female students [n (♀) = 37, 93%; n (♂) = 3, 7%] from 15 different medical universities from all over Germany participated. Available places were booked within 1 week. Participants were in their clinical part of their studies between the 5th and 16th semester. The average rating of the event was excellent with 1.1 points (1 = best-5 = worst), while the selection of topics scored lowest marks with an average rating of 1.7 points. Due to the great success, the high demand and the student's positive evaluation, annual summer schools in obstetrics and gynaecology are planned. Because most of the participating students have shown a high interest and have appropriate education in the domain, the information content of keynote presentations could be increased above basic level in future projects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471634/"}

Smart glasses are being explored as a hands-free teaching tool for teleconferencing with hands-on demonstrations in addition to livestreaming capability. We wanted to understand the efficacy of such virtual teaching techniques in teaching procedural and surgical skills. Medical students in their Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship at our medical school were recruited to participate in a virtual demonstration of normal vaginal delivery. A birthing simulator and smart glasses were used to livestream the simulated delivery, and a previously published checklist was used to show the steps for conducting routine vaginal delivery. A follow-up electronic survey assessed the clarity of the video and audio feed, level of satisfaction, positive and constructive feedback, and an error-identification exercise with a smart glass-recorded video. A total of 62 students participated; 98% of them reported that the audio and video feeds were clear and 95% of the students reported being extremely satisfied or satisfied with the teaching tool. Students could identify on average three out of four errors. Students believed the streaming to be \"interactive\" and a \"most effective remote learning\" tool, but expressed that it did not \"take the place of clinical skills learning.\" The combination of smart glass technology and simulation can be a useful new tool for clinical faculty who simultaneously deliver care to patients and teach.

Randomized, controlled single-blinded trial. Canadian Task Force Classification I. A large community-based teaching hospital. All postgraduate year 1 through year 4 OB/GYN residents were enrolled (n = 22). All participants underwent a preintervention objective skills assessment test (OSAT), in which the participant performed live human laparoscopic salpingectomy. Residents were randomly assigned (using a computer-generated randomization table, in blocks of 2, stratified by ranked baseline OSAT scores) to the intervention or control group. The intervention group consisted of 1 educational session with presession assigned reading, a 40-min didactic lecture, viewing of a procedural video, and simulation and practice of laparoscopic salpingectomy on a porcine cadaver. The control group received traditional training per routine residency rotations. Laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed on live patients by study participants pre- and postintervention. These procedures were video recorded, and then scored by a single blinded evaluator of the OSATs. Nine pre- and postintervention OSAT indicators, reflecting provider knowledge and skill, were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes were the changes in 10 subjective measures of comfort, assessed by a pre- and postintervention survey. The outcomes were assessed using 5-point Likert scales (for OSATs 1 = lowest score; for the subjective survey 1 = highest score). The control group OSAT scores did not change (pre: 26.6 ± 10.8, post: 26.2 ± 10.1; p = .65). There were significant improvements in 2-handed surgery (pre: 2.8 ± 1.6, post: 3.5 ± 1.3; p = .004) and use of energy (pre: 2.9 ± 1.3, post: 3.6 ± 1.0; p = .01) in the intervention group, contributing to an overall score change (pre: 26.7 ± 10.6, post: 29.9 ± 9.8; p ≤ .001). The control group had no change in comfort levels. The intervention group experienced both increases (anatomy, steps of surgery, 2-handed surgery, and use of energy) and decreases (reading and learning in operating room) in reported comfort levels. This study demonstrates that simulation can improve surgical technique OSATs. However, of 45 possible points, both groups' average scores were <70% of the optimum. Thus, the improvement, although statistically significant, was relatively small and indicates that further supplementation in training is needed to substantially increase the residents' surgical skills.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26590067/"}

Rokitansky in the fields of pathology and anatomy].", "text": "With both its academic disciplines, gynaecology and obstetrics, the classical clinical subject of \"gynaecology\" in a wider sense was established mainly on the basis of a normal and, above all, abnormal, pathological morphology. It's a fact that the name of Carl Freiherr v. Rokitansky has always been remembered as an outstanding personality who established and dominated these fields of medical science. He described for the first time cases of endometriosis, strangulation of ovarian tumors, tuberculisation in the puerperal uterus, luteinic cysts in cases of hydatide moles, external wandering of the ovum, puerperal osteophytes and the spondylolisthetic pelvis. He created a linguistically and didactically suitable terminology: fibroids, later called fibromyomas, the kyphotic, the skoliotic and the coxalgic pelvis. Among the 14 medical terms used in pathological anatomy which are connected with the name of Rokitansky, two refer to the fields of gynaecology and obstetrics: the Mayer-v. Rokitansky-Kuster(-Hauser) syndrome in gynaecology and the Rokitansky spondylolisthetic pelvis in obstetrics. Rokitansky's authoritarian way of advocating the theory of Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis concerning the aetiology of puerperal fever plays an important part in both biographies. The 200th birthday of the founder of modern pathological anatomy is reason enough to look at Rokitansky's work from the point of view of the present-day gynaecologist.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15560472/"}

No significant gender differences existed regarding number of interactions with residents and faculty; number of deliveries, surgeries, or examinations performed; perceived quality of teaching; or feeling included as part of the clinical team. Male students were more likely to report performing specific surgical procedures, such as operating the bovie cautery during gynecological surgeries (p = 0.005). More men experienced patients refusing to allow them to participate in the clinical interview (p < 0.0001) and physical examination (p < 0.0001). Male students were also more likely to report feeling that their gender negatively impacted their clerkship experience (p < 0.0001). Although less likely to report preclerkship and postclerkship career interest in obstetrics and gynecology, male students were more likely to report that their interest increased at the end of the clerkship.

In addition, data sometimes have to be entered twice - since although open interfaces are often available, the elaborate programming required to transfer data from outside programs makes the financial costs too high. Since 1995 the University's of Frankfurt am Main Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics has therefore developed a consistent program of its own under Windows NT for in-patient facilities, as well as for some outpatient services. The program does not aim to achieve everything that is technically possible, but focuses primarily on user requirements. In addition to the general requirements for medical documentation in gynecology and obstetrics, the program can also handle perinatal inquiries and gynecological quality control (QSmed [Qualitätssicherung in der Medizin] of the BQS [Bundesgeschäftsstelle Qualitätssicherung]).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12439763/"}

A 30-question survey was sent to all obstetrics and gynecology and family practice residency program directors. The survey included questions about the didactic nature of the colposcopy curriculum, the type of supervision, how resident skills are evaluated, estimates of the numbers and types of patients evaluated, the numbers and types of procedures being done by each resident, and the program director's perception of residents' competence in colposcopy. The overall response rate was 485 of 752 program directors (64.5%). Significantly fewer family practice than obstetrics and gynecology program directors thought they had adequate numbers of colposcopy patients to train their residents. By their program directors' estimates, 86% of family practice residents evaluate 10 or fewer patients with high-grade lesions (versus 16.5% of obstetrics and gynecology residents); 51.4% evaluate 10 patients or fewer with low-grade lesions (versus 6.7% of obstetrics and gynecology residents), and 40.6% evaluate 10 patients or fewer with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (versus 3% of obstetrics and gynecology residents). Experience with vulvar disease is also limited. Program directors thought their residents' colposcopy skills were roughly comparable with their general obstetrics and gynecology skills. It is possible that many program directors underestimate the number of colposcopic examinations required to achieve and maintain colposcopic skills. Many training programs have insufficient clinical volume to properly train residents in colposcopy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11518918/"}

It was, he claimed, the result of the selective attention of doctors when securing medical histories. Though written 30 years ago, Donovan's paper is apparently still provocative enough to be regularly quoted. It has, however, never been closely examined. Looked at in a different light, Donovan's research appears even more interesting. The apparent paradoxes he reports disappear when it is remembered that symptoms are not data but means of communication. His perceptive picture of the influence of doctors on the formation of climacteric symptoms is especially convincing. Much of this is because the main conclusions of this research seem to have come almost as a surprise, forcing themselves on a worker engaged in a restricted field of his speciality.

Medical schools often rely on brief clinical exposure to abortion during the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship to provide this learning. Abortion is also a highly politicized and stigmatized procedure. Given this potential conflict, we examine medical student reactions to their observation of abortion care. Medical students in their second and third years at an academic medical center who observed in a first trimester abortion clinic completed open-ended, written questionnaires. Questionnaires explored student reactions to participating in the abortion clinic. We used applied thematic analysis to code and qualitatively analyze 78 questionnaires. We identified the following five themes: (1) students found participating in abortion care deeply worthwhile, (2) some were challenged by their reactions, particularly when reactions conflicted with prior beliefs, (3) some demonstrated empathy for the patient, but (4) some expressed judgment of both the patient and the abortion provider, and (5) students reported a desire for curricular change around abortion education, requesting more time for reflection, and some felt that their abortion observation might better prepare them to serve future patients. Observing in an abortion clinic is a valued experience that allows students to challenge their existing beliefs and may build empathy. Educators should provide students with adequate time for preparation and reflection around this topic and address areas of misunderstanding that may perpetuate abortion stigma. These findings may inform medical student curriculum changes around abortion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669243/"}

This is particularly true in the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology, with one of the highest rates of litigation of all medical specialities. We aimed to evaluate the influence of media and the legal environment on the career of trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology. Under the auspices of the Irish national training body, we distributed a 26-item questionnaire to doctors-in-training (DIT) working in obstetrics and gynaecology in the Republic of Ireland. Descriptive statistics and Chi-squared analyses were performed on the anonymised data. 151 DIT responded to the questionnaire, with a response rate of 86.2 % (sample size = 175). The majority were female (79.9 %, n = 121), Irish (85.5 %, n = 106) and had no children (67.0 %, n = 83). 86.7 % (n = 131) felt that the media did not have a positive impact on patients receiving care, and, further, unfairly represented the speciality (94.1 %; n = 142). Additionally, DIT felt that medico-legal issues had a negative impact on issues such as retention and recruitment. These two areas were implicated in over three quarters of DIT considering leaving the speciality. This study demonstrates that DIT perceive media scrutiny and litigation to have a negative effect on the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology. Further support integrated into specialist training, is needed to ensure that trainees are adequately equipped to deal with both mainstream and social media as well as interactions they may have with the legal profession as they progress through their career.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33359922/"}

Accuracy in clinical answers was equal between UpToDate (average 1.35 out of 2) and DynaMed (average 1.36 out of 2). However, time to answer was 2.5 minutes faster in UpToDate compared to DynaMed. Participants were also more confident and satisfied with their answers in UpToDate compared to DynaMed. Despite a preference for UpToDate and a higher confidence in responses, the accuracy of clinical answers in UpToDate was equal to those in DynaMed.

In this observational, cross-sectional study, an online questionnaire, containing multiple-choice questions and open questions, was distributed among Obstetrics and Gynaecology trainees in 33 ENTOG member countries. The questionnaire was designed as a follow-up of a similar survey conducted by ENTOG in 2009 and assessed the overall compliance with the EWTD, the adaptations needed to achieve this compliance, the impact of the EWTD on the quality of training and the well-being of trainees. The answers were analysed using descriptive statistics in Microsoft Excel. 59 responses from 28/33 (84.8%) ENTOG member countries were collected. Only 5 out of 28 (17.9%) countries were found to be nationally compliant with EWTD. There were no clear differences in the compliance between different types of the hospitals (university/teaching/district), but a trend was observed towards higher rate of implementation in smaller hospitals (<1500 deliveries per year). Regarding the changes needed to become EWTD-compliant and yet maintain high-quality training, the most common suggestions were: hiring extra junior doctors, restructuring training, having less doctors on duty simultaneously, consultants performing more hands on work, dedicated training sessions, reduction of administrative tasks and simulation training for surgical skills. The majority of trainees, 7 out of 12, (58.3%) in the EWTD-compliant hospitals experienced a positive effect on their training, whereas the majority of trainees in non-compliant hospitals, 31 out of 47, (66%) were uncertain about the impact of the EWTD on the quality of training. Among the positive changes, better work-life balance and more consultants available out of the daily working hours were listed. Despite the introduction and implementation of the EWTD over two decades ago, the compliance rates across Europe remain low and seem not to have altered in the last ten years. In order to ensure the quality of training and, most importantly patient safety, we suggest that European nations keep striving to implement the EWTD for doctors in training. We also suggest for nations that have yet to implement this directive to use the strategies as an exemplar in countries that follow EWTD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36108448/"}

The Delphi method was used, consisting of three rounds of survey questionnaires. Key leaders across Denmark were invited to participate. In Delphi round 1, the participants individually identified technical procedures that newly authorized specialists should be able to perform. These procedures were sent to round 2 to be explored for need for simulation-based training by estimating frequency of procedures, number of doctors, potential patient risk and/or discomfort, and feasibility of simulation. Round 3 consisted of elimination and prioritization of remaining procedures (Canadian Task Force Classification III). A total of 165 key leaders were invited. Response rates were 61%, 50%, and 53%, respectively. Identified procedures in Round 1 were as follows: gynaecology (n = 51), obstetrics (n = 40), and general procedures (n = 10). A needs assessment formula was used to calculate needs for training on the basis of the answers in round 2 and produce a preliminary prioritized list that was sent to round 3 for final exploration. Round 3 consisted of elimination and final prioritization, where gynaecology (n = 17) prioritized basic laparoscopy, vaginal ultrasound, and laparoscopy with salpingostomy and salpingectomy; obstetrics procedures (n = 16) prioritized basic resuscitation of newborn, vacuum extraction, and management of shoulder dystocia; and one general procedure (basic adult resuscitation) was included. A needs assessment using the Delphi method produced a prioritized list of technical procedures suitable for simulation. This can guide the development of simulation-based training programs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31859204/"}

The present study aimed to delineate Italian Obstetrics and Gynecology (ObGyn) residents' awareness of women's nutrition and supplementation in different stages of life. <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey about women's nutrition and supplementation use throughout their lifetime. A 31-item survey questionnaire was distributed to Italian ObGyn Residents. <b>Results</b>: 258 Italian ObGyn Residents completed the online survey. About 40% of the responders considered their knowledge of women's nutritional needs poor or very poor. A total of 226 residents (88%) declared that there is not enough time dedicated to women's nutrition during their specialty program, and almost all the trainees would consider training in this area helpful for achieving a better professional profile. A total of 128 participants (49.6%) demonstrated insufficient knowledge in this field. Most (97.1%) of the responding trainees recommend supplementation during different stages of women's lives. <b>Conclusions</b>: Italian ObGyn residents are not very skilled in women's nutrition.

Three hundred sixty-two residents provided data, representing 161 of the 240 residency programs contacted. Access to training in elective abortion was available to most respondents: 54% reported routine training--where abortion training was routinely scheduled; 30% reported opt-in training--where training was available but not routinely integrated; and 16% reported that elective abortion training was not available. Residents in programs with routine elective abortion training and those who intended to do abortions before residency did a greater number of first-trimester manual uterine aspiration and second-trimester dilation and evacuation procedures than those without routine training. Similarly, routine, integrated training, even for indications other than elective abortion, correlated with more clinical experience (all p<.01, odds ratio and confidence interval shown below).

Harmonisation of training will provide quality assurance of training and promote high quality care throughout Europe. Pan-European training standards should describe medical expertise outcomes that are required from the European gynaecologist. This paper reports on consensus development on the medical expertise outcomes of pan-European training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. A Delphi procedure was performed amongst European gynaecologists and trainees in Obstetrics & Gynaecology, to develop consensus on outcomes of training. The consensus procedure consisted of two questionnaire rounds, followed by a consensus meeting. To ensure reasonability and feasibility for implementation of the training standards in Europe, implications of the outcomes were considered in a working group thereafter. We invited 142 gynaecologists and trainees in Obstetrics & Gynaecology for participation representing a wide range of European countries. They were selected through the European Board & College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the European Network of Trainees in Obstetrics & Gynaecology. Sixty people participated in round 1 and 2 of the consensus procedure, 38 (63.3%) of whom were gynaecologists and 22 (36.7%) were trainees in Obstetrics & Gynaecology. Twenty-eight European countries were represented in this response. Round 3 of the consensus procedure was performed in a consensus meeting with six experts. Implications of the training outcomes were discussed in a working group meeting, to ensure reasonability and feasibility of the material for implementation in Europe. The entire consensus procedure resulted in a core content of training standards of 188 outcomes, categorised in ten topics.

We aimed to assess the impact of these challenges on training in gynaecology over time. We designed a study which aimed to assess both trainers and trainees perception of gynaecological surgical training in Ireland. The purpose of this was to identify confidence levels and challenges and to highlight potential areas for future improvement of surgical training in gynaecology. A a cross-sectional survey was distributed to all trainees and trainers registered with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland Obstetrics and Gynaecology higher specialist training programme in 2014, 2017 and again in 2021. During the study period trainees' confidence that the training programme prepared them to perform gynaecological surgery fell significantly. This fall in confidence was most evident for trainees' ability to perform abdominal hysterectomy (40.9% vs 15.2%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.61, p =.03) and vaginal hysterectomy (31.8% vs 12.1%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.58, p =.03) when comparing 2014 with 2021. All trainees reporteded that gynaecology was not given adequate time in the training programme to prepare them to practice independently as consultants. Themes identified by participants to improve training included dedicated access to theatre time with a named trainer, increased simulation training and subspecialisation at later stages of training. Our findings show an overall decrease in trainees' and trainers' confidence in the surgical training available in gynaecology over an eight-year period.. This is particularly true for major gynaecology procedures. Efforts must be made to ensure trainees have improved access to surgical training in gynaecology. Potential solutions include improving access to simulation and incorporation of subspecialist training into later stages of training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37517105/"}

Nevertheless, few clinics have standardized and structured training curricula for young obstetricians in the field of obstetric and gynecological ultrasound. Since ultrasound is best learned hands-on in small supervised groups, we developed and implemented a comprehensive ultrasound curriculum for all postgraduate residents of our department using a peer-teaching concept. We used Kern's six-step model of curricular development comprising (1) problem identification and general needs assessment, (2) needs assessment of the targeted learners, (3) goals and objectives, (4) educational strategies, (5) implementation, and (6) evaluation and feedback. Assistant physicians in the 1st and 2nd year of training received a theoretical and practical ultrasound basic course (six modules) in addition to their obligatory clinic rotations. The six main topics were prioritized according to service relevance and included the main features according to DEGUM, EBCOG and ISUOG. The units focused on a three-level training based on the AMEE levels: theoretical knowledge, well-founded theoretical knowledge and basic practical skills under guidance and self-employment of practical skills. Structured and standardized sonographic training allows young gynecology and obstetrics residents to conceptually grasp and practically implement topic-related themes. Furthermore, the course concept demonstrates the high inter-rater agreement among DEGUM-certified examiners. More research is needed to analyze the learning outcomes for residents and the improvement of the patient's outcome by establishing such an ultrasound curriculum.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35430714/"}

We screened curricula of five Mozambican medical schools based on a state-of-the-art intimate partner violence curriculum framework. The latter framework was based on a review of the literature. Few medical schools of Mozambique could be identified addressing intimate partner violence in their curriculum. When tackled, intimate partner violence content is mostly dealt within the context of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Community Health and Forensic Medicine rotations. Intimate partner violence contents are integrated as stand-alone modules in some specific subjects. In none of the schools, specific teachers teaching intimate partner violence could be identified. No time allocation was specified to address the topic; no teaching and learning strategies could be identified invoking awareness or supporting basic knowledge acquisition; additionally, hardly any information about related assessment methods was found. Only in one medical school was the subject part of the formal curriculum. Intimate partner violence content is hardly and inconsistently addressed. The limited intimate partner violence content tracked in the Mozambican medical schools' curricula, mainly addresses violence in general, for instance as identified in Orthopaedics or Surgery contexts and sexual violence in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The inclusion of elements of intimate partner violence in the curriculum remains restricted, questioning the impact of medical education of future practitioners' competencies. Critical changes are needed in medical curricula to match the current epidemiology of intimate partner violence in Mozambique.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928600/"}

This was a cross-sectional observational study. The gender of department-based leaders (chair, vice chair, division director) and residency program directors was determined from websites of 950 academic departments of anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Each specialty's representation ratio-proportion of leadership roles held by women in 2013 divided by proportion of residents in 1990 who were women-and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A ratio of 1 indicates proportionate representation. Women were significantly underrepresented among chairs for all specialties (ratios 0.60 or less, P≤.02) and division directors for all specialties except anesthesiology (ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.87-1.46) and diagnostic radiology (ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.16). The representation ratio for vice chair was below 1.0 for all specialties except anesthesiology; this finding reached statistical significance only for pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Women were significantly overrepresented as residency program directors in general surgery, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics (ratios greater than 1.19, P≤.046). Obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics had the highest proportions of residents in 1990 and department leaders in 2013 who were women. Despite having the largest proportion of leaders who were women, representation ratios demonstrate obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in progression of women to departmental leadership. Women's overrepresentation as residency program directors raises concern because education-based academic tracks may not lead to major leadership roles.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26855110/"}

We identified the diagnostic procedures and criteria for pre-eclampsia (PE) and assessed the level of obstetric training of the personnel responsible for the records submitted to the patient registry at the Danish National Board of Health. A structured questionnaire, including three case stories, was sent to the chief consultant of the department. Thirty-three out of the 34 Danish departments (97%) returned the questionnaire. Reporters of pregnancy diagnoses to the National Patient Registry differed widely in training. For complicated pregnancies, departments ranged from having only specialists reporting all cases to secretaries reporting up to 50%. Cut off limits of blood pressure (BP) and protein loss used to diagnose pre-eclampsia showed large differences across departments. The diagnoses given to three case stories showed little correlation to the criteria the departments reported using. Even in a small country like Denmark with 34 obstetrical departments, there was little consensus on the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia. The findings emphasize the need for standardizing diagnostic criteria and reporting practice and may have implications on how to interpret data regarding pre-eclampsia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16260339/"}

Performance on USMLE step 1 was correlated with ABOG examination performance and CREOG in-training examination scores. The correlations between USMLE step 1 and CREOG in-training examination scores and ABOG examination performance were analyzed by using the Spearman correlation coefficient. USMLE step 1 scores were significantly correlated with CREOG in-training examination scores (p < 0.000). None of the residents who scored >200 on USMLE step 1 and a mean of >200 on the CREOG in-training examinations failed the ABOG written examination. Program directors have used USMLE step 1 to identify trainees who are likely to perform well on the CREOG in-training examination.

A total of 35 GHT programs were identified, and general information was obtained online. Semi-structured telephone interviews of key members of 19 programs were then conducted and transcribed. The interview guide was constructed using WEIGHT recommendations. Transcript data were grouped according to domains: reciprocity, trainee selection and preparedness, needs assessments, and ethical questions. Many programs expressed difficulty in building reciprocal relationships due to imbalanced power structures. Eleven programs reported no formal application process for selecting trainees. Twelve (63%) programs reported only a single day of preparation. Nine (47%) programs did not conduct a formalized needs assessment of partner sites. Ethical considerations varied from concerns for safety to inadequate training for residents. This study reveals the limited preparedness curricula and lack of formalized needs assessments among several programs. Although many programs make an effort to build reciprocal exchanges with host partners, experiences for foreign trainees within the United States are limited, and U.S. residents are often tasked with duties above their training level abroad.

Although most faculty viewed CBME as a positive change, there were gaps in their knowledge about CBME and workplace-based assessment methods. Barriers to the implementation of CBME included lack of training in assessment of residents and feedback, financial implications, and time constraints. To facilitate the transition to CBME, institutions may need to consider establishing faculty training programs and implementing systemic change aimed at addressing faculty needs and barriers during this fundamental shift in the structure of residency training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31882283/"}

It has many advantages both from the aesthetic as well as the functional points of view. The low transverse scar is hidden in the region of the pubis. Post-operative breakdowns (such as hernia and eventertion) that occur with longitudinal incisions have almost disappeared. The site, the length and the height of the incision vary according to the surgeon's ideas and his experience. The result cosmetically therefore varies and the optimum benefit is not always achieved. We describe a graduated ruler specially designed for the transverse suprapubic incision. It was worked out in 1984. It makes it easier to standardise the technique of suprapubic incision, but one that can be changed according to variations in body contours. The ruler can be sterilised. It is available in two models: one, a flexible one which is ideal for caesarean sections and laparotomies in fat women or where the abdominal wall is distorted by tumours under it; the second model is rigid and should be able to be used on the normal flat abdomen. One and a half years experience shows that the ruler can be used to standardise the technique of transverse suprapubic incision. It also helps to teach this method of laparotomy; and the cosmetic results have become better.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2715603/"}

{"id": "26942370", "title": "Definitions of Obstetric and Gynecologic Hospitalists.", "text": "The obstetric hospitalist and the obstetric and gynecologic hospitalist evolved in response to diverse forces in medicine, including the need for leadership on labor and delivery units, an increasing emphasis on quality and safety in obstetrics and gynecology, the changing demographics of the obstetric and gynecologic workforce, and rising liability costs. Current (although limited) research suggests that obstetric and obstetric and gynecologic hospitalists may improve the quality and safety of obstetric care, including lower cesarean delivery rates and higher vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates as well as lower liability costs and fewer liability events. This research is currently hampered by the use of varied terminology. The leadership of the Society of Obstetric and Gynecologic Hospitalists proposes standardized definitions of an obstetric hospitalist, an obstetric and gynecologic hospitalist, and obstetric and gynecologic hospital medicine practices to standardize communication and facilitate program implementation and research. Clinical investigations regarding obstetric and gynecologic practices (including hospitalist practices) should define inpatient coverage arrangements using these standardized definitions to allow for fair conclusions and comparisons between practices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26942370/"}

Unfortunately, they often do not seek healthcare due to concerns about possible discrimination or prejudice. The aims of this study were to analyze and compare experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals and heterosexual women during OBGYN appointments in Lithuania as well as to analyze the health of individuals whose biological gender is female and their lifestyle's effect on their health. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: An anonymous online survey was conducted. Respondents answered questions regarding their gender and social identity; obstetrical, gynecological, and general clinical history; sexual life characteristics; and their experiences of visiting OBGYNs in Lithuania. <i>Results</i>: This study revealed that some lifestyle habits of LGBTQ+ respondents are more similar to those of heterosexuals than is often hypothesized. However, it also underscored such issues as the more common consumption of psychotropic substances, higher rates of depression, and more prevalent risky sexual practices among the LGBTQ+ community, as well as some neglected topics of OBGYN care in Lithuania. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study is the first in Lithuania to analyze the characteristics of LGBTQ+ individuals whose biological sex is female in relation to the field of obstetrics and gynecology.

Programs affiliated with public hospitals or with private non-Catholic institutions are the most likely to provide such training, while Catholic-affiliated training programs and those at military hospitals are the least likely to do so. Approximately 23 percent of institutions include abortion training as a routine part of residency, and 50 percent offer it as optional training. The 28 percent of residency programs that offer no abortion training represents an almost fourfold increase since 1976. Although more of the large programs affiliated with public hospitals now include such training as a routine part of their residency programs, fewer of the private non-Catholic programs--where the largest proportion of residents are trained--do so. Consequently, the number of residents exposed to abortion training may have declined slightly over the past decade. Little difference exists between the proportion of programs that offer training in first-trimester techniques and the proportion that train in second-trimester techniques. Nine percent of programs report that all residents participate in first-trimester abortion training, and another 56 percent report that at least half of their residents do so. The participation rate is linked to the expectations of the program: Approximately 88 percent of programs that routinely incorporate abortion techniques in their training report that from one-half to all their residents participate, compared with about 55 percent of programs that offer the training as an option. Approximately 82 percent of programs teach abortion techniques up to at least 20 weeks' gestation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3678482/"}

An observational study was performed on the basis of a questionnaire sent to 410 obstetrician-gynecologists and 27 medical directors of managed-care organizations. Of 67% of obstetrician-gynecologists and 96% of medical directors who responded, there was agreement as to the content of primary care, but a minority (38%) of obstetrician-gynecologists identified themselves as primary care providers. A minority of medical directors (35%) felt that obstetrician-gynecologists should serve in that role. Both obstetrician-gynecologists and medical directors felt that legislation had little impact. The reticence of obstetrician-gynecologists to assume a major role in primary care appears to be the result of an uneasiness with accepting a more comprehensive role in patient management and gatekeeping. They appear comfortable with the more traditional roles but feel that training and experience has not prepared them well for the management of more complex medical problems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9662305/"}

To improve our understanding of what qualifies as AHC and to support and optimise the health of women with these experiences, the objective of this study was to describe how women, who had previously endured AHC, gave meaning to and managed their experience during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the early postnatal period. Women, who had reported substantial suffering as a result of a previous experience of abuse within the healthcare system, were purposefully selected from a Danish sample of a multinational cohort study on negative life events among pregnant women (the BIDENS Study). Eleven women were interviewed individually by means of a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by means of qualitative systematic text condensation analysis. Four categories were identified to describe the women's experience of AHC and its consequences on pregnancy and childbirth: abusive acts of unintentional harm, dehumanization, bodily remembrance, and finding the strength to move on. Abuse in health care may have profound consequences on the reproductive lives of the women, among others affecting sexuality, the desire to have children and the expectations of mode of delivery. However, the women described constructive ways to manage the experience, to which healthcare professionals could also contribute significantly. Regardless of whether AHC is experienced in childhood or adulthood, it can influence the lives of women during pregnancy and childbirth. By recognising the potential existence of AHC, healthcare professionals have a unique opportunity to support women who have experienced AHC.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23521853/"}

{"id": "12020355", "title": "Managing Obstetric Emergencies and Trauma (MOET) structured skills training in Armenia, utilising models and reality based scenarios.", "text": "Mortality rates in Western Europe have fallen significantly over the last 50 years. Maternal mortality now averages 10 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births but in some of the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, the ratio is nearly 4 times higher. The availability of skilled attendants to prevent, detect and manage major obstetric complications may be the single most important factor in preventing maternal deaths. A modern, multidisciplinary, scenario and model based training programme has been established in the UK (Managing Obstetric Emergencies and Trauma (MOET)) and allows specialist obstetricians to learn or revise the undertaking of procedures using models, and to have their skills tested in scenarios. Given the success of the MOET course in the UK, the organisers were keen to evaluate it in another setting (Armenia). Pre-course knowledge and practice questionnaires were administered. In an exploratory analysis, post-course results were compared to pre-course answers obtained by the same interviewer. All candidates showed an improvement in post-course scores. The range was far narrower afterwards (167-188) than before (85-129.5). In the individual score analysis only two scenarios showed a non-significant change (cord prolapse and breech delivery). This paper demonstrates the reliability of the model based scenarios, with a highly significant improvement in obstetric emergency management. However, clinical audit will be required to measure the full impact of training by longer term follow up. Audit of delays, specific obstetric complications, referrals and near misses may all be amenable to review.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12020355/"}

We sought to characterize moral distress among Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) fellows using a standardized survey. We disseminated a national anonymized survey study of MFM fellows electronically regarding moral distress using a validated questionnaire with supplemental questions pertaining to specific challenges within MFM clinical care. Multivariable linear regression modeling was used to examine the association between abortion restrictions, maternal mortality, and moral distress, controlling for demographic variables. Thematic analysis was performed for the free text responses elaborating upon moral distress and grouped by thematic elements. We hypothesized that training in states with more abortion restrictions and higher maternal mortality would be associated with higher moral distress scores. Among 245 total responses (61% response rate), 177 complete responses (44% complete response rate) were included for analysis. Most of our respondents identified as female (78.5%), White (71.8%), and training in urban programs (83.1%). 37.9% of respondents reported training in the Northeast, with the remainder of respondents evenly distributed across the United States. The mean score for the validated questions was 85.9 ± 48.8, with female gender identity associated with higher measures of moral distress on the validated portion of the questionnaire as compared to male gender identity (90.1 ± 49.2 vs. 70.4 ± 44.7, p < 0.05), whereas more advanced training was associated with higher measures of moral distress on the supplemental questions as compared to those less advanced in training (20.9 ± 11.8 vs. 28.5 ± 15.9 vs. 25.9 ± 15.6 for PGY-5 vs. PGY-6 vs. PGY-7 and PGY-8 combined, respectively, p < 0.05). After adjustment, higher measure of moral distress on the validated questionnaire was associated with training in states designated \"Abortion restrictive\" as compared to \"Abortion most protective\" (beta estimate 27.80 and p < 0.01). Of 34 free responses, 65% referred to limitations on abortion access and reproductive justice as causes of significant moral distress. MFM fellows who identify as female reported higher measures of moral distress, as well as those training in states with more abortion restrictions. Among free text respondents, abortion restrictions underlie a significant proportion of moral distress.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40022052/"}

Residents indicated learning about genetics through discussions with attending physicians, lectures/courses, and publications. While residents felt their attendings valued (81%) and were knowledgeable about (85%) genetics, 28% felt their attendings did not reinforce concepts that were learned in coursework. Residents valued staying informed about the field of genetics and felt providing genetic services was within their scope of practice; however, there were deficiencies in self-reported comfort level, particularly regarding hereditary cancer counseling.

This is an IRB-approved cross-sectional study of leadership aspirations among Ob/Gyn residents in the U.S. as related to gender and mentorship using an electronic survey distributed nationwide in 2017. The primary outcome was resident interest in academic leadership. Mediator variables included demographics and training environment characteristics. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were performed using SPSS. We received 202 completed surveys, for a representative cross-section of 4% of all Ob/Gyn residents in the U.S. The majority (86%) of respondents were women (n = 174), reflecting the same gender distribution of all Ob/Gyn residents in training. Sixty-seven percent of all respondents reported an interest in pursuing academic leadership (n = 133). Women reported leadership aspirations less often than men (64% vs 86%, p < 0.05) and reported lower mean Likert scores (3.73 vs 4.14, p < 0.05) regarding interest in leadership. A marginal difference between mean Likert scores was observed between women and men when controlled for other demographics (coefficient - 0.344, SE 0.186; p = 0.066). No difference in leadership aspirations was noted between women and men when controlled for mentorship, presence of female program director, and presence of three or more female leaders in a program. Gender disparity in goal-setting toward leadership is identified as early as residency training in Ob/Gyn.

In this first German nationwide expert survey, we addressed the responsible university teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology departments and investigated their experiences during the pandemic as well as their opinions on future developments, especially with regard to the broader implementation of e-learning in the standard curriculum. The questionnaire included 42 items and was disseminated among teaching coordinators at all 41 departments of obstetrics and gynecology at German university hospitals via an email that included a weblink to the online survey provider. Responses were collected between 19 April and 7 June 2021. In total, 30 responses were collected from 41 departments across Germany and their respective teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology. The general opinion of the medical teaching provided during the pandemic was positive, whereas the teaching quality in practical skills was considered inferior and not equivalent to the standard face-to-face curriculum. Lectures and seminars had to be substituted by remote-learning alternatives, while clinical clerkships were reduced in length and provided less patient contact. Students in their final year experienced only a few differences in the clinical and teaching routine. Teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology stated that they intend to incorporate more e-learning into the curriculum in the future. The medical educators' views presented here may help to complement the already-thoroughly investigated experiences of students under the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical educators in obstetrics and gynecology at German university hospitals have successfully established online and hybrid teaching alternatives to their standard face-to-face courses.
