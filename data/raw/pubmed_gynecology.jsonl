The present review analyses the intricate interactions among physiological alterations, diseases, and medications that lead to bone mineral density reduction in women. It underscores the importance of gynaecologists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of osteoporosis via early risk assessment, suitable hormone treatment, and lifestyle modifications. Essential considerations encompass the categorisation of osteoporosis into primary (age-related) and secondary (attributable to diseases or pharmacological treatments) types, with particular emphasis on predisposing conditions such as premature menopause, hormone deficits, and cancer therapies. The significance of diagnostic instruments such as DXA and novel methodologies like trabecular bone score and quantitative ultrasonography is emphasised for precise evaluation and surveillance. The review also addresses nutritional methods, physical exercise, and pharmaceutical interventions, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT), selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and other anti-resorptive drugs, to preserve bone health.

In 2014, with Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology's guidance, these divisions were referred to as academic specialists divisions and the faculty within as academic specialists to emphasize that they provide specialized women's health care in academic settings. The divisions comprised approximately 30% of departments' full-time faculty (median 12). In 27% of the departments, these divisions contributed more than half of departmental revenue, and 49% contributed 26-50%. Nearly 90% of divisions provided a sizeable proportion of the department's total teaching efforts. Compensation relied more on clinical productivity than on seniority, quality, academic contributions, or academic rank. Subsequently, five performance domains were identified to help divisions define divisional excellence: clinical, education, research, service & advocacy, and academic environment. Furthermore, excellent divisions were characterized as those with outstanding clinicians and educators who emphasize scholarly productivity. Although academic specialists contribute significantly to their departments' financial, clinical, and educational productivity, many have limited opportunities for scholarly activity. Achieving divisional excellence likely will depend on the ability to recruit and retain faculty with career expectations that align with the division's prioritized performance domains.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030879/"}

The experience is directed to familiarise students with basic clinical management of gynaecological conditions, also develop communication and related core examination and procedural skills. Similarly, midwifery training encompasses independent care of low-risk pregnant women and assist in care of high-risk pregnancy in partnership with obstetricians. Although its necessary to acquaint most learners with core clinical skills in obstetrics and gynaecology, learning opportunities on patients can be limited, due to the intrusive nature of women's health examination. Simulation Based Education (SBE) can facilitate learning hands-on clinical examination and procedural skills, using realistic part-task and high-fidelity simulators prior to approaching patients. This can apply to both medical and midwifery undergraduate training, further creating opportunities for professional interaction and shared learning space to facilitate interprofessional education. IPE has been shown to improve professional relationships in practicing clinicians. This learning pedagogy can be applied in the undergraduate setting as well, to decrease risk of conflict and appreciate roles of other interprofessional staff in future clinical practice. In this chapter we highlight some challenges faced by medical and midwifery undergraduates in their learning from a global perspective.

The study was realized based on the acts concerning the cesarean sections (C-section), tubal sterilization, hysteroscopy and hysterectomy as well as ovarectomy and breast surgery. For each activity branch, the codes of the Classification commune des actes médicaux (CCAM) were selected and then removed from the Programme médicalisé des systèmes d'information (PMSI) database. We have used and adapted the Omphale model of the National Statistics and Economical Studies Institute and we have applied it for the period of 2009-2025. Our projection model has permeated to show a 5.5% regression of the C-section acts, a 2% incretion of the hysterectomies and hysteroscopies, 7.7% of ovarectomies as well as a 9.8% augmentation of the breast surgeries. However, we predict a 11.8% diminution of the sterilizations by tubal implants. Globally, the activity in obstetrics and gynecology will remain constant with an insignificant augmentation of 46 acts (0.01%). In Basse-Normandie, the surgical activity in gynecology-obstetrics will moderately increase in the next 15 years. This constant activity signifies that there is no need to form more residents than the number of practitioner to retire. The interest of this model is that it is applicable at a national level and it permits to confront the demographic data and the projections of different activities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660169/"}

Obstetrics and gynaecology remain highly litigious specialities, accounting for a large proportion of indemnity payments due to poor outcomes. Several challenges have to be faced in order to improve current clinical practice in both obstetrics and gynaecology. For instance, a complete understanding of fetal physiology and establishing accurately predictive antepartum and intrapartum monitoring are yet to be achieved. In gynaecology, the complexity of molecular biology results in a lack of understanding of gynaecological cancer, which also contributes to poor outcomes. In this review, we aim to describe some important applications of AI in obstetrics and gynaecology. We also discuss whether AI can lead to a deeper understanding of pathophysiological concepts in obstetrics and gynaecology, allowing delineation of some grey zones, leading to improved healthcare provision. We conclude that AI can be used as a promising tool in obstetrics and gynaecology, as an approach to resolve several longstanding challenges; AI may also be a means to augment knowledge and assist clinicians in decision-making in a variety of areas in obstetrics and gynaecology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471403/"}

The comparison between the two cities shown a greater gap between women and men in Lille: women in Lille were most reluctant to engage in academic careers and have not the prerequisites (diplomas, mobility or publications) that seem necessary for this type of career. Women were less expecting to have academic careers in Lille than in Paris. Many barriers have been identified as difficulties for them to follow this career path.

{"id": "31141843", "title": "Uterine fibroid management: Today and tomorrow.", "text": "Current treatments for fibroids are mainly surgical and expensive, so alternatives need to be found. It is, therefore, vital to develop and evaluate alternatives to surgical procedures, especially when fertility preservation is the goal. Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) are synthetic compounds that have either an agonistic or antagonistic impact on target tissues determined by their binding to progesterone receptors. Their mixed activity depends on recruitment of cofactors that regulate transcription along so-called genomic pathways, as well as nongenomic interactions with other signaling pathways. There is no doubt that surgery remains indicated in some instances, but we must now establish whether use of SPRMs (notably ulipristal acetate) allows less invasive surgery or even complete avoidance of surgery. Long-term intermittent administration of ulipristal acetate will undoubtedly change our approach to the management of uterine fibroids according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification, which provides a comprehensive basis for different treatment options. When considering less invasive techniques (uterus-sparing options like myomectomy), the choice is guided by the size, number and location of fibroids, as well as the personal experience of the gynecologist and available equipment. There is now a growing body of evidence pointing to the crucial role of progesterone pathways in the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids. SPRMs should, therefore, be considered an alternative to surgical therapy, or at least an adjunct to surgery, as illustrated in the algorithms. © 2019 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31141843/"}

We wanted to assess the teaching and the teachers in a gynaecological unit with a view to improve the education of the trainees within a dynamic educational system. It is a prospective study which took place in the gynecology-obstetric unit of the University of Nantes. Thanks to a questionnaire called \"Evaluation of the teaching during a gynecologic-obstetric training course\", we evaluated the feelings of 21 medical students about their two-month training course. This questionnaire of 27 items is divided in several parts. The first one is about the quality of the teaching, the second about planification, the third about the quality of the learning resources, and the fourth is about the educational quality of each teacher (interaction teacher-student). The fifth one evaluates the perception of this work experience by the student, notably his clinical activity and his personal implication in the unity. There are also some open questions which point out the positive aspects of the teaching but also its failings and the parts that must be improved. We give here the details of the different stages of this assessment from the questionnaire up to the results, mentioning their limits considering the conceptual orientations and the methodological orientations chosen. Analysis of the data was done determining the percentage of agreement and disagreement to a statement of the questionnaire. All the students find the teachings interesting and stimulating, objectives were gone through thoroughly. Courses were well organised. Their integration in the medical team was good. They feel responsible especially when they are on call (88.3%). On the other hand, for a quarter of them, educational supports are not adapted, teaching documents are not clear and adapted to the National Test. Half of them (45%) are not satisfied by the numerical campus which does not facilitate understanding. Staffs are not an opportunity to learn for 37% of them.

The care for children and young people differs from adults. In gynaecology, children should not be treated like little adults. Within Europe, there is great variability in the provision of care, availability of clinical networks and lack of national standards within paediatric and adolescent gynaecology. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the current evidence regarding best clinical practice within Europe. A search was performed in Embase and Medline from 1974 onwards. Inclusion criteria were paediatric and adolescent population, gynaecology or reproductive health, care provision and evidence based clinical guidelines. In most papers recommendations were made, so no outcome measures could be used. It was, therefore, not possible to perform a meta-analysis. The risk of bias of the studies was assessed according to the GRADE and AGREE-2 guidelines. 91 papers were identified and a total of 7 papers were included in the final analysis. The main recommendations are: - improvement for accessibility for healthcare facility, - training of healthcare staff in communication and examination according to developmental age, - develop evidence based clinical guidelines and standardize content of care delivered, - add training in general adolescent topics to training curriculum of paediatric and adolescent gynaecology. There is limited information about best clinical practice and low quality of evidence of healthcare service available in the field of Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology. As a result there is a need to refine standards of training and care. EURAPAG should encourage adaptation of the unified standards of care in each European country. Furthermore, at this moment, there is insufficient inclusion of curriculum related to PAG in the undergraduate and post graduate training for recognition of patterns and symptoms in young women. EURAPAG should not only take a lead to develop common curriculum for undergraduate and post graduate education and training to address this unmet need but should also lead on their implementation within Europe.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361165/"}

Other evidence for oocyte dysfunction exists, not all of which is consistent. Suppression of ovulation and menstruation to treat endometriosis-associated infertility is not effective. However, ovulation induction, perhaps with intrauterine insemination, does result in pregnancy rates higher than in control cycles, while stimulated IVF success rates are equivalent to those of other diagnostic groups.

Specialist knowledge is warranted for the care of these youngsters, and it is important that doctors attending to the gynaecological needs of children must understand that they are not just \"little women\". Their needs and accompanying clinical approaches required are very different from those of adults in this sensitive area, as is the spectrum of diseases and problems. A multidisciplinary collaboration is as important as the establishment and adoption of standards in education, training and management. The situation in Europe in PAG is varied, reflecting the relative youth of this area of special interest and thereby allowing for earlier consolidation of standards and services across Europe. This article summarises the background to PAG in Europe, inequitable current provision of care and issues relating to education and training all of which are relevant in providing a common approach to PAG problems and endeavouring to obtain the best outcomes. There remains huge diversity how the services for \"young women\" are currently delivered across different countries within Europe. A concerted European approach is urgently required to streamline standards of training and clinical care, to ensure high quality care by using agreed national and European pathways.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30826159/"}

{"id": "29408754", "title": "Elective abortion: Clinical practice guidelines from the French College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF).", "text": "The number of elective abortions has been stable for several decades. Many factors explain women's choice of abortion in cases of unplanned pregnancies. Early initiation of contraceptive use and a choice of contraceptive choices appropriate to the woman's life are associated with lower rates of unplanned pregnancies. Reversible long-acting contraceptives should be favored as first-line methods for adolescents because of their effectiveness (grade C). Ultrasound scan before an elective abortion must be encouraged but should not be obligatory (professional consensus). As soon as the embryo appears on the ultrasound scan, the date of pregnancy is estimated by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) or, from 11 weeks on, by measuring the biparietal diameter (BPD) (grade A). Because reliability of these parameters is ±5 days, the abortion may be done if measurements are respectively less than 90 mm for CRL and less than 30 mm for BPD (professional consensus). A medically induced abortion, performed with a dose of 200 mg mifepristone combined with misoprostol, is effective at any gestational age (Level of Evidence (LE) 1). Before 7 weeks, mifepristone should be followed 24-48 h later by misoprostol, administered orally, buccally, sublingually, or even vaginally followed if needed by a further dose of 400 μg after 3 h, to be renewed if needed after 3 h (LE 1, grade A). After 7 weeks, administration of misoprostol by the vaginal, sublingual, or buccal routes is more effective and better tolerated than by the oral route (LE 1). Cervical preparation is recommended for systematic use in surgical abortions (professional consensus). Misoprostol is a first-line agent for cervical preparation at a dose of 400 μg (grade A). Vacuum aspiration is preferable to curettage (grade B). A uterus perforated during surgical aspiration should not routinely be considered to be scarred (professional consensus). An elective abortion is not associated with a higher risk of subsequent infertility or ectopic pregnancy (LE 2). The medical consultation before an elective abortion generally does not affect the decision to end or continue the pregnancy, and most women are sufficiently certain about their choice at this time. Women appear to find the method used most acceptable and to be most satisfied when they were able to choose the method (grade B). Elective abortions are not associated with an increased rate of psychiatric disorders (LE 2). However, women with psychiatric histories are at a higher risk of psychological disorders after the occurrence of an unplanned pregnancy than women with such a history (LE 2). For surgical abortions, combined hormonal contraceptives - oral or transdermal - should be started on the day of the abortion, while the vaginal ring should be inserted 5 days afterwards (grade B). For medical abortions, the vaginal ring should be inserted in the week after mifepristone administration, while the combined contraceptives should begin the same day as the misoprostol or the day after (grade C). Contraceptive implants should be inserted on the same day as a surgical abortion, and may be inserted the day the mifepristone is administered for medical abortions (grade B and C respectively). In case of medical abortion, the implant can be inserted the same day the mifepristone is administered (grade C). Both the copper IUDs and levonorgestrel intrauterine system should be inserted on the day of the surgical abortion (grade A). After medical abortions, an IUD can be inserted in 10 days after mifepristone administration, after ultrasound scan verification of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy (grade C).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29408754/"}

This is a new educational strategy meant to consolidate knowledge in a fashion that is reproducible for a lifetime with successful application to both known and unknown clinical exercises. The development of lifelong learning is based on the principles of andragogy (autonomy and independence in one's learning activities), reflection and learning from experience. This paper deals with the development of these theories culminating in the advent of self-directed learning. Evidence to support experiential, reflective and self-directed learning is provided, including the use of rating scales.

A recent survey of clinicians involved in adolescent gynaecology revealed a lack of consistency in the management of acute adolescent heavy menses. Very few randomized trials have been undertaken for acute heavy menses in women of any age, although one recent trial compared the oral contraceptive pill with oral medroxy progesterone acetate in adult women and showed them to be equally effective. The applicability of this trial to adolescents is unclear. Furthermore, although guidelines have been produced for menorrhagia management in adults, there is again only limited clinical research specific to adolescents and thus room for concern that the approaches for adult women may not always be appropriate for teenagers. One small study on the successful use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system in teenagers does mean that this management option can now be considered. There is a need for careful assessment of the menstrual problem for, although anovulatory bleeds are the most common cause, bleeding disorders also need to be considered. Pelvic pathology is uncommon. Adolescents can also present with acute ongoing heavy bleeding. Whilst a range of approaches is reported, there are no studies to guide optimal management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17885455/"}

Medical students should receive teaching on general and gynaecological healthcare issues in this population. Our aim was to assess medical students' knowledge of healthcare needs of transgender people before and after a newly implemented teaching session on transgender healthcare. Method A mixed-method study was carried out over a three month period in a university obstetric and gynaecology hospital in Dublin. A one-hour teaching session was developed and delivered to final year medical students. Students completed a survey before and after receiving the lecture. Results Seventy-one students completed the pre-lecture survey and forty-three completed the post-lecture survey. Pre-lecture, 64 students (90%) reported some-to-no understanding of healthcare issues of transgender people, and only 13 (18%) reported understanding gynaecological issues faced by transgender people. Post-lecture, 41 (95%) had a better understanding of health issues faced by this population and 40 (93%) had a better understanding of gynaecological health issues faced. Most students (81%) wanted further teaching on the topic. Conclusion A one-hour teaching session was effective at improving student knowledge of care of transgender people.

To determine the depth of knowledge that obstetric and gynaecology trainees have with regards to the PAG services provided at their Hospital, reflecting how widely PAG services have had an impact on trainees. The national survey was distributed to all deaneries in the UK for circulation to all their trainees via e mail during Nov 2017-March 2018. 28% of the trainees said there was a PAG clinic at their hospital, 46.9% did not have a clinic and 24.7% were unsure. 41.6% of the respondents were aware of BritSPAG, however only 10.4% were aware of the BritSPAG clinical standards for service planning with regards to PAG clinics. Nearly half were aware of the PAG specialist centre for their region but only 6.5% were aware of the BritSPAG UK map of services. A large majority (93.24%) didn't believe that trainees in O&G received adequate exposure to PAG in their training. This study represents the largest and first national survey to seek obstetric and gynaecology trainees' thoughts on the provision of PAG training in the UK today. Given that only 28% of trainees answering said that they were aware of a PAG clinic at their hospital, this indicates not only that many hospitals did not have a dedicated PAG clinic but more worryingly five of the trainees were not aware of the existence of a confirmed PAG clinic at their hospital, and therefore are potentially losing out on training opportunities.

Assessment scores on the modified OSATS (out of 20) and global assessment (out of 5) differed significantly according to resident description, where the high-performing resident scored highest (median scores of 15 and 4, respectively), followed by the average-performing resident (13 and 3), and finally, the low-performing resident (11 and 3) (P=.008 and .043, respectively). Faculty assessment of residents in gynecologic surgery is influenced by the assessor's knowledge of the resident's past performance. This knowledge introduces bias that artificially increases scores given to those residents with favorable reputations and decreases scores given to those with reputed surgical skill deficits. These data quantify the effect of such bias in the assessment of residents in the workplace and serve as an impetus to explore systems-level interventions to mitigate bias.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34259459/"}

The postgraduate curriculum of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) is such a surgical curriculum. It is a diverse branch of medicine and the role of anatomy in O&G is versatile. In the Netherlands nor in Europe the expectations of knowledge on anatomy are specified in the current training program, making trainees insecure about their performance in anatomy knowledge (\"Better Education for Obsetrics and Gynaecology,\"). Therefore, we recently performed a Delphi study to determine which anatomical structures should be taught to ensure safe and competent practice among general gynaecologists (Koppes et al., 2020). The aim of this study is the determination of the anatomical knowledge level in postgraduate training for O&G. Our hypothesis is that the trainees possess a good knowledge of anatomy and on average at least 80% of correct answers on core knowledge is shown. A longitudinal knowledge analysis was performed under Dutch Trainees Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The anatomy questions of the annual progress tests from 2010 to 2019 were analysed. Anatomy questions were selected and assessed on relevance based on the previous performed Delphi study which identified 86 structures which are essential to perform safe and competent practice as a general gynaecologist. Scores on relevant anatomy questions were calculated. In 10-year 3136 trainees performed the annual progress test. 54 Anatomy related questions were asked on a total of 1637 questions (3.3%). Of these 54 questions, 38 (70%) were concerned as relevant questions. Overall 10-year score was 64.5%. The anatomy knowledge of trainees' Obstetrics and Gynaecology is insufficient.

The increasing number of female trainees has no negative impact on the rate of production of specialists as time from authorization to specialist is shorter for women than for men. Immigration is a factor of uncertain impact, 20% of the trainees are from abroad, a higher number than in any other speciality. The committee has not found any increased flow of specialists from hospitals to private practice during the last two years. The factors of greatest impact on the future need for specialists is above all increase in the number of positions, changes in working hours and age limit for retirement.

Two vaginal hysterectomies were performed on two ewes, following every step precisely as if the model were human. Each surgical step of vaginal hysterectomy performed on the ewe and on a woman were compared side by side. We identified that all surgical steps were particularly similar.

Currently there is minimal consensus on how to interpret and validate professional experience, medical knowledge and surgical skills for doctors (accredited in Obstetrics and Gynaecology) who have an interest in and wish to achieve sub-specialisation in PAG. The challenge for the future of PAG is to create a framework of guidelines and references which in turn culminates in improvement and harmonisation in PAG healthcare delivery. The development of a post-specialty training curriculum in PAG for accredited practitioners was a logical next step after EBCOG introduced the PACT curriculum for OBGYN trainees. The guiding principle in the development of the PAG curriculum has been to strive for harmonisation in teaching and training in PAG within Europe. The new EURAPAG curriculum is divided in 17 chapters which in turn have been subdivided into medical and surgical sections plus a baseline skills section. The content has been determined through a consensus procedure amongst European gynaecologists and trainees. The medical chapters involve pathology that requires conservative treatment, prevention, education or lifestyle adjustment. The chapters that are both medical and surgical have a surgical (alternative) treatment ranging from vaginal procedures to advanced hysteroscopic and laparoscopic procedures and laparotomy. Currently, the framework for any medical education is workplace based competency training. Specific tools have been developed for workplace based assessments, such as direct observation (DO) of clinical task performance, Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), mini-clinical evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX) or case-based discussion (CBD). To measure progress in this PAG post-specialty training curriculum, the subspecialty trainee will be required to maintain and update a portfolio of experience and competency.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33422776/"}

Training must be safe, because trainees or trainers must not put our patients at risk as part of the process of learning to heal others.

The FGDs were recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis with systematic text condensation. Survey factors were compared using the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test. 160 students (97 female, 61 male, two other) at six universities in Sweden responded to the survey. Two mixed FGDs were conducted. The majority (87%) of the students experienced confidence in performing pelvic examinations, stating that sufficient, repeated training opportunities and support from a clinical tutor were crucial components of the learning experience. Prior to the ObGyn clerkship, negative expectations were more common among male students. The male participants experienced having a disadvantage because of their gender, while female students considered their gender an advantage (p<0.001, N=121, Fisher's Exact Test). The clinical tutor and the use of professional patients (PPs) had a fundamental role in providing learning opportunities by including the student in patient care activities. The importance of the clinical tutor, as well as the use of PPs, are important factors when planning education in pelvic examinations, and this knowledge could be used when educating other intimate examinations during medical school.

A novel teaching session was introduced for the third-year clerks on their OB/GYN rotation. Students (n = 88) were invited to participate in the research component to evaluate the effectiveness of this session. Students' (n = 83) baseline knowledge of PPH and teamwork attitudes were measured using a multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ) and the TeamSTEPPS Questionnaire. Students participated in small-group learning about PPH and NTS, followed by a high-fidelity PPH simulation using a Laerdal SimMom Mannequin in a mock operating room. Students were debriefed, followed by a different MCQ and the TeamSTEPPS Questionnaire. Statistically significant improvements in students' comprehension (MCQ scores 63.9% vs. 76.5%, P < 0.05) and NTS (4.35/5 vs. 4.51/5, P < 0.05) were noted after simulation.

This study aims to quantify the working hours of The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) specialist trainees in order to better inform discussions of working hours and safety within our region. An anonymous, online survey of RANZCOG trainees was conducted. Demographic data were collected. The primary outcomes were: hours per week at work and hours per week on-call. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of long days (>12 h) and 24-h shifts, time spent studying, staff shortages and opinions regarding current rostering. Response rate was 49.5% (n = 259). Full-time trainees worked an average of 53.1 ± 10.0 h/week, with 11.6% working on-call. Long-day shifts were reported by 85.8% of respondents, with an average length of 14.2 h. Fifteen percent reported working 24-h shifts, with a median duration of uninterrupted sleep during this shift being 1-2 h. Trainees in New Zealand worked 7.0 h/week more than Australian trainees (P ≤0.001), but reported less on-call (P = 0.021). Trainees in Western Australia were more likely to work on-call (P ≤0.001) and 24-h shifts (P ≤0.001). While 53.1 h/week at work is similar to the average Australian hospital doctor, high rates of long days and 24-h shifts with minimal sleep were reported by RANZCOG trainees in this survey.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28299774/"}

We undertook a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the implementation of a laparoscopic VR simulation programme into a single unit. An observational study with qualitative analysis of semi-structured group interviews. Trainees in gynaecology (n=9) were scheduled to undertake a pre-validated structured training programme on a laparoscopic VR simulator (LapSim(®)) over six months. The main outcome measure was the trainees' progress through the training modules in six months. Trainees' perceptions of the feasibility and barriers to the implementation of laparoscopic VR training were assessed in focus groups after training. Sixty-six percent of participants completed six of ten modules. Overall, feedback from the focus groups was positive; trainees felt training improved their dexterity, hand-eye co-ordination and confidence in theatre. Negative aspects included lack of haptic feedback, and facility for laparoscopic port placement training. Time restriction emerged as the main barrier to training. Despite positive perceptions of training, no trainee completed more than two-thirds of the modules of a self-directed laparoscopic VR training programme. Suggested improvements to the integration of future laparoscopic VR training include an additional theoretical component with a fuller understanding of benefits of VR training, and scheduled supervision. Ultimately, the success of a laparoscopic VR simulation training programme might only be improved if it is a mandatory component of the curriculum, together with dedicated time for training.

The discrepancies in the initial translations were mainly due literal translations. Only synonymous differences were observed in the two backward translations. Comparison with original version led to 8 minor changes. No changes occurred between the 2 French versions. Satisfaction surveys when using the GOALS questionnaire by both examiners and students are similar.

We describe the development of the first OBGYN Master of Medicine (MMed) training programme in Botswana to address this human resource shortage. We developed a 4-year OBGYN MMed programme at the University of Botswana (UB) using the Kern's approach. In-line with UB MMed standards, the programme includes clinical apprenticeship training complemented by didactic and research requirements. We benchmarked curriculum content, learning outcomes, competencies, assessment strategies and research requirements with regional and international programmes. We engaged relevant local stakeholders and developed international collaborations to support in-country subspecialty training. The OBGYN MMed curriculum was completed and approved by all relevant UB bodies within ten months during which time additional staff were recruited and programme financing was assured. The programme was advertised immediately; 26 candidates applied for four positions, and all selected candidates accepted. The programme was launched in January 2020 with government salary support of all residents. The clinical rotations and curricular development have been rolled out successfully. The first round of continuous assessment of residents was performed and internal programme evaluation was conducted. The national accreditation process was initiated.

Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded following a common coding framework in the language of the country concerned. Completed coding frames, written summaries and key quotes were then translated into English and were cross-analysed among the researchers to identify emerging themes and comparative findings. Although medical and specialty qualifications in each country are mutually recognised, there were great differences in training regimes, with different emphases on theory versus practice and recognition of different subspecialties. However all countries shared concerns about the impact of the European Working Time Directive on trainees' skills development. Reflecting differences in models of care, the scope of practice of OBGYN varied among countries, with pronounced differences between the public and private sector within countries. Technological advances and the growth of co-morbidities resulting from ageing populations have created new opportunities and greater links with other specialties. In turn new ethical concerns around abortion and fertility have also arisen, with stark cultural differences between the countries. Variations exist in the training and scope of practice of OBGYN specialists among these three countries, which could have significant implications for the expectations of patients seeking care and specialists practising in other EU countries. Changes within the specialty and advances in technology are creating new opportunities and challenges, although these may widen existing differences.

The curriculum would underpin the new 7-year speciality training programme. In December 2006, the UK Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board approved the curriculum. In August 2007, the new Speciality Training and Education programme in Obstetrics and Gynaecology was launched. The curriculum forms the backbone of the 7-year speciality training programme in obstetrics and gynaecology. The programme is divided into three levels of training: basic, intermediate and advanced. The programme is competency-based rather than being focussed on time periods or the number of hours or number of procedures required to progress through the programme. Successful progress is achieved by meeting the requirements at designated waypoints defined within the programme. The curriculum outlines not only the knowledge and technical clinical skill requirements, but also the professional skills and attitudes that must consistently be adopted by health-care professionals in a modern health service. The curriculum was originally benchmarked against the General Medical Council's Good Medical Practice criteria: (1) Good clinical care; (2) Good medical practice; (3) Successful relationships with patients; (4) Working with colleagues; (5) Teaching and training; (6) Probity; (7) Health.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20724217/"}

Although these precepts, in theory, are accepted without challenge, in many settings where clinical care is delivered, there is a lack of formal oversight necessary to ensure their implementation in practice. Even though most medical specialties have national bodies that provide guidelines for good medical practice, and hospital accreditation makes reference to dissemination of such guidelines, there is usually not a mechanism to monitor medical uptake and adherence to good practice in the day-to-day delivery of care. Most hospitals require approval by an institutional review board before research protocols can be undertaken, but regional health authorities and hospitals do not usually have formal processes in place to regulate the adoption of new technologies into clinical practice. Recognizing the lack of a formal process at the hospital level to guide and regulate the introduction of new technologies or procedures, we set out to establish an oversight process to fill this gap. A committee was established to oversee innovation in the Gynaecology Division of our hospital. We describe here the establishment of this committee, the tools the committee used, and the processes used for the committee to do its work. We conclude that formal, local oversight of medical innovation is indispensible for ensuring the high standards of medical practice necessary to optimize patient safety.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27638986/"}

A postal survey of all practising gynaecologists in New Zealand was undertaken. Questions were asked regarding which women with menorrhagia should have an endometrial biopsy, what sampling method they used, and their first, second and third line medical treatments. There were 68 replies (48% response rate). There was no general agreement on the mean age at which women with menorrhagia should have an endometrial sample. Forty-six percent preferred hysteroscopy to sample the endometrium, and 41% preferred a pipelle suction curette. The most favoured first-line choice used to treat menorrhagia was luteal phase progestogens (54%). The most-favoured second choice was the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the most favoured third choice was danazol. The results from this study suggested that protocols need to be developed in order to prevent women with menorrhagia from being inappropriately investigated or suboptimally treated. It is possible that the high hysterectomy rate in New Zealand could be reduced if gynaecologists were to use more effective treatment earlier in the clinical presentation of menorrhagia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9006831/"}

We did a cross-sectional study to assess some aspects of the multiskills training programmes in gynaecology and anaesthesia, and the utilization of human resources trained under this scheme in Rajasthan. The analysis was primarily based on a review of records of postings of doctors obtained from the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Rajasthan. Information was also obtained through qualitative interviews with 122 doctors from 14 districts of the state, irrespective of their training status. In 2012, a total of 302 anaesthetists and 480 gynaecologists were posted in various public health facilities in Rajasthan. Of these, 128 (42%) anaesthetists and 69 (14.4%) gynaecologists had received multiskills training. However, only 57% of trained doctors were posted at health facilities for which they were trained. The acceptance of multiskills training among doctors was found to be low. Posting and deployment of personnel who had received multiskills training was often inappropriate, leading to suboptimal utilization of the skills acquired during such training and suboptimal delivery of public health services. Accreditation of the multiskills training programmes by regulatory bodies such as the Medical Council of India may improve the acceptance of such training among MBBS doctors and their colleagues.

In response to the high burden and improvements in the provision of gynaecological health care, the Essential Gynaecological Skills (EGS) implementation package was developed. It includes comprehensive in-service training for upskilling the non-specialised health care providers and introduces the first structured data recording system for gynaecology in the outdoor of public health facilities in Bangladesh. We outline how the stakeholder engagement process was integrated into the implementation research related to this pioneering initiative. Based on literature review, expert consultation and prior experience, we adopted the identification, sensitisation, involvement, and engagement (ISIE) framework of stakeholder engagement and process documentation. After identifying national and local level stakeholders via a power-interest mapping exercise, we sensitised them to the gaps in gynaecological health service delivery. High-power and high-interest stakeholders were involved and engaged in developing the EGS implementation package, which was then introduced in selected public health facilities and evaluated through implementation research. Acknowledging the urgent need for gynaecological health care services, the identified and sensitised stakeholders supported the development of the EGS implementation package. This resulted in the development and implementation of the EGS implementation package under the Government of Bangladesh's leadership, highlighting government ownership. These outcomes reflected the potential for scalability and sustainability of the package. However, stakeholder engagement remains a time and resource-intensive process that requires an innovative, research-backed approach with committed implementation. Our experience of using the ISIE framework showcased the potential of this framework in achieving sustainability and scalability at the national level.

His death marked the unexpected end of a splendid career as a physician, whose heritage in terms of humanity and scientific achievements is most impressive, even today. Pfannenstiel was born in Berlin on June 28, 1862. He studied medicine in Berlin (1880-1885) against his father's wishes and was therefore deprived of any financial support. Nevertheless, he completed his studies and his doctorate thesis (\"summa cum laude\") in 1885. Pfannenstiel was trained by v. Rabenau (Berlin; gynaecology), Pauly (Posen; surgery, internal medicine) and Fritsch (Breslau; gynaecology), and became a lecturer at the University of Breslau in 1890 (\"Habilitation\"). In 1889 he married Elisabeth Behlendorff, and in 1890 his only son Wilhelm was born. In January 1894 he established a private practice in Breslau until he was awarded a professorship in 1896. In the same year he became director of the Department of Gynaecology at a hospital in Breslau (Krankenhaus der Elisabethinerinnen), where he developed in 1900 his world-famous transverse laparotomy technique (suprasymphysärer Faszienquerschnitt) named after him (\"Pfannenstiel-Querschnitt\"). From 1891 he was secretary of the German Society for Gynaecology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gynäkologie) and since 1896 he was co-editor of the Archives of Gynaecology (Archiv für Gynäkologie). In 1902 Pfannenstiel was offered the chair of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Giessen to succeed Chr. A. H. Löhlein, who had died in 1901. He rejected three other chairs at Leyden (Holland), Erlangen and Freiburg which were offered to him in 1904.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2192940/"}

Despite changes in modern educational climate and patient expectations, its value is still irrefutable. There is evidence to suggest that such teaching is beneficial to students and patients alike. This paper describes the planning and delivery steps of a ward-based teaching session with 'pregnancy of unknown location' as an example. The organisation, following-up and feedback after the session are also mentioned. We have discussed the models applicable to clinical teaching and explored ways how the 'microskill' technique could be potentially used in such a situation. The paper also focuses on the use of clinical reasoning processes. Finally, the six domains of knowledge necessary to become a good preceptor have been applied to the session. A good teaching exercise is moored to sound pedagogical principles. Its success relies on mutual trust and understanding between the teacher and the taught.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20701497/"}

It is a prospective study demonstrating an operative procedure for correction of uterine prolapse in young women. This procedure was performed in three post-graduate teaching hospitals: Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Gandhi Hospital and Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad, India. Through an abdominal approach, the Merselene tape was fixed on the posterior surface of the uterus and anchored to the anterior longitudinal ligament, over the sacral promontory. This procedure was performed on 19 women in the age group 17-27 years, two of whom were unmarried virgins. The procedure rectified the descent of the uterus and kept it anteverted. In one of the cases, exploration at cesarean section showed that the sling was intact. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications. Recurrence of prolapse was not reported in any of these cases. This technique is a relatively simple method for correction of uterine prolapse in young women. The Merselene tape is inert, strong, flexible, effectively supports the uterus, and remains retroperitoneal.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9175671/"}

It develops an historical account of intra-occupational factors influencing the decision to establish gynaecologic oncology as American ob/gyn's surgical subspecialty in 1972. Working within the framework initially developed by Everett C. Hughes and his students, the article examines this development as the outcome of a three-party relationship among gynaecologic oncologists, American ob/gyns, and gynaecologic pelvic surgeons. Aggressive movement by the gynaecologic pelvic surgeons challenging the established élite's identity definition for the ob/gyn specialty helped spur official recognition of gynaecologic oncology, a less threatening subspecialty. The article draws theoretical implications from the case regarding the role of a threatening other in influencing the specialisation process.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21426362/"}

{"id": "20685170", "title": "New undergraduate curricula in the UK and Australia.", "text": "There are many challenges facing undergraduate education in the smaller specialities such as obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G). These are similar throughout the world, although the emphasis may vary according to geography and the approach of those involved in medical education in general. The number of medical students has increased because of the greater number of doctors required, the gender balance and also because it provides revenue for the universities. This means that strategies must be developed to include more teaching units in both primary and secondary care as well as those at a distance from the main teaching provider. Australia and the UK both have this problem but, obviously, the distances involved in Australia are much greater. One of the drivers for the change in undergraduate medical education in the UK was factual overload and the need to teach basic competencies to the students. National curricula that take this into account are being developed and that in the UK has been taken up by a majority of the medical schools. The opportunities offered by O&G to provide basic skills and competencies difficult to find elsewhere in the curriculum are unparalleled. These include issues such as communication in situations where great sensitivity is required and also the impact of cultural beliefs and ethnicity on clinical practice. However, factual knowledge of medical science is also essential and ways of achieving a balance are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20685170/"}

We performed a single-timepoint online survey of members of the International Urogynaecological Association (IUGA). Probability of difference from mean is presented as a raw value and significance of difference of means between surgical cohorts was calculated using the t test for independent variables. We received 205 responses from 118 general gynaecologists and 87 from subspecialty trained urogynaecologists (8 % response rate) to 27 questions concerning operative steps in four common urogynaecological operations. Surgeons had low levels of variation. The probability of any surgeon providing a different answer from the mode of their cohort was not significant within or between surgeons with and without subspeciality training (p = 0.47). Two areas with high levels of variation between surgeons were identified (probability of variation >0.5). These were: \"In order to reduce cystocele, do you plicate the fascia covering the bladder or use vaginal tissue?\" and \"Would you usually plicate the rectovaginal facial septum to the vault?\" Most urogynaecological surgeries were of similar technique; however there were two areas of significant variation between surgeons that may affect outcomes and warrant further study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26894606/"}

The CNGOF has decided to adopt the AGREE II and GRADE systems for grading scientific evidence. Each recommendation for practice was allocated a grade that reflects the quality of evidence (QE) (clinical practice guidelines). Endometriosis and pelvic pain Superficial endometriosis can be entirely asymptomatic. Surgical treatment of asymptomatic superficial peritoneal endometriosis is not recommended in women of childbearing age for the prevention of pelvic pain, especially in case of proximity to noble organs (e.g., the ureters, rectum and sigmoid, and ovaries in nulligravida) as there is no evidence that the disease will progress to become symptomatic (low level of evidence). In case of accidental discovery of superficial endometriosis in women of childbearing age with pelvic pain, it is recommended that the lesions are excised, if surgically accessible. Removal of superficial endometriosis lesions in patients with painful symptoms improves quality of life and pain (low level of evidence). Endometriosis and infertility It appears that women with isolated superficial endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy with histological confirmation have a significantly higher incidence of primary infertility than patients without endometriosis. However, there is no data regarding the impact of treatment of these lesions on the fertility in these women or on the natural course of their disease (low level of evidence). It is recommended that excision is performed rather than monopolar coagulation of superficial endometriosis lesions in infertile women, as this results in a higher spontaneous pregnancy rate (low level of evidence). Adhesions and pelvic pain There is limited data in the literature regarding the benefit of performing systematic adhesiolysis during laparoscopy to prevent pelvic pain when incidental pelvic adhesions are discovered. For patients with pelvic pain, it is probably better not to perform adhesiolysis to prevent pelvic pain, although this can be decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the extent of the adhesions, the topography, and the type of surgery considered (low level of evidence). For asymptomatic patients, it is recommended not to perform adhesiolysis to prevent pelvic pain due to the lack of clear efficacy both short- or long-term and due to the increased risk of surgical injuries (low level of evidence). Adhesions and infertility There is limited data in the literature regarding the potential benefit of performing systematic adhesiolysis when there is an incidental discovery of pelvic adhesions during laparoscopy to prevent infertility. For infertile women, in the event of fortuitous discovery of adhesions at laparoscopy, it is probably better not to perform complex adhesiolysis. Only adhesiolysis of tubo-ovarian adhesions that are minimal or slight in terms of their extension and/or their nature may be useful to improve the chances of spontaneous pregnancy. However, it remains to be decided on a case-by-case basis depending on other potential causes of infertility (low level of evidence). For women without known infertility issues, it is probably better not to perform systematic adhesiolysis in order to improve their pregnancy chances, considering the balance between the unknown benefit and the risks of complications inherent to surgery (low level of evidence). Further investigations are needed in order to increase the quality of management regarding associated interventions such as the treatment of superficial endometriosis or adhesions performed during a gynecologic surgical procedure and, thereby, bolster these recommendations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34391952/"}

All questions were related to the cytoreductive surgery of advanced ovarian cancer. Response rate reached 63%, and data from 17 European countries were analyzed. The median number of new patients with ovarian cancer treated annually in a single centre was 95. Whereas 19% of centers perform infracolic omentectomy only, 81% carry on total omentectomy. Approximately half of the centers conduct appendectomy in all patients with advanced ovarian cancer, 1/3 only if the appendix is macroscopically involved.

Initially, this system was applied to infertility/endocrine patients, but the programs were subsequently expanded to deal with a wide range of presenting symptoms. Questions are displayed on a visual display unit and the patient enters her answers on a simplified keypad. A formatted summary is provided by an interfaced printer. Cross-over comparison with manual histories showed that the computer produces an accurate and exhaustive record containing many additional items. This improvement was most marked for the infertility/endocrine system, where the computer provided 2.9-times as much information as a clinician. In the case of the general gynaecological history the computer obtained 1.6-times as much information. Both systems showed a high degree of consumer acceptance. This was more marked in the case of the specialist application: 77.5% of infertility/endocrine patients felt that the questionnaire had adequately covered their problem, compared to 44.5% of general gynaecological patients. Over-reporting of apparently trivial symptoms was more marked in the general system. Thus, we conclude that direct patient-interviewing systems can be recommended for relatively complex specialist applications, such as infertility/endocrinology. They may be less suitable for general applications such as gynaecology as a whole.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6548716/"}

Analysis of routinely collected statistics. England. POPULATION A total of 1.45 million gynaecology admissions in 1999/2001. The database used was a linked file of English NHS hospital admission statistics and death certificate data. Case fatality rates (CFRs)and emergency readmission (ERA) rates were calculated for different components of gynaecology workload. Funnel plots, using age-sex standardised measures, were displayed to compare the outcomes. CFRs and ERA rates. The CFR within 30 days after admission for patients with cancer was 5.1%. These patients accounted for only 3% of all the admissions but for 73% of all 30-day deaths. All other 30-day CFRs were extremely low-below 0.5%. The 30-day ERA rates ranged from 1.8% after day case care to 17.4% after emergency admissions for people who did not have an operation. Funnel plots showed considerable variation between hospitals for ERA after day case care but not after elective abdominal hysterectomy. There are no measures of mortality that could be used routinely and meaningfully to compare the performance of gynaecology units. We suggest that two suitable comparative measures of outcome, derivable from routine hospital statistics, are 30-day ERA rates after day case admissions and after elective abdominal hysterectomy, excluding those records with a cancer diagnosis. These measures are relatively homogeneous with respect to their likely rates of adverse events and have sufficient numbers to produce potentially useful comparative results.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16709213/"}

Inpatient episodes increased by 23.5% and day case episodes increased by 13.1%. More people treated contributed about 90% and increased readmissions contributed about 10% to the increase in workload. The workload was decreased by strike action in 1975 and 1981-2. Average length of stay decreased substantially and consistently over the 11 years. Emergency readmissions increased annually by an average of 2.7%. Admission rates in 11 groups of surgical procedures accounting for 85% of all gynaecological inpatients are reported, and increases occurred in 10 of the 11 groups. For example, average increases in annual admission rates were 1.0% for sterilization, 1.9% for legal abortion and 8.2% for biopsy of the cervix, the rate for dilatation and curettage decreased by 1.4%. The increase in admission rates in gynaecology was almost entirely due to increases in numbers of people treated. The rise would have been even greater if the increase in private patients had been considered. The increase may reflect increased expectations on the part of patients and their doctors, advances in technology and increased bed availability due to declining lengths of stay.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1911584/"}

Each programme has a well-defined syllabus. The recruitment is based on expected needs. A minimum 7 years is needed to complete the general and subspecialty training.

Later, these objectives were used at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington.

When a patient is discharged from the hospital. data on the diagnosis and treatment are registered by local medical officers and administrators. Registration of surgical procedures is based on the International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM, WHO 1978), the so-called WCC-standard. All hospitals but one (a cancer centre) in The Netherlands participate in this registration, resulting in 99.3% of all admissions. Data on gynaccological manpower were obtained from the Dutch College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In order to standardise the frequency numbers per 1,000 women, yearly data of the female population according to age were obtained from the Central Office for Population Statistics. The female population aged 20 years of age and older increased 3% between 1991 and 1998, from 5.8 million to 6.0 million.

He promoted gynaecology in the Netherlands as a separate speciality, partly because of the new surgical possibilities following the discoveries of anaesthesia and antisepsis, but also due to the prevailing belief that the physiology of reproduction qualified the physical and psychological disorders of women. In his private gynaecological clinic he devoted himself to the surgery of ovarian tumours, uterus myomatosus and genital prolapse, but also to the diagnosis and treatment of supposed inflammations of the cervix and endometrium as cause of psychological disorders. In this he followed the opinions of contemporary English gynaecologists. As he was not aware of physiological histology, he nearly always found signs of inflammation. He treated this with curettage and drastic caustics, sometimes after using a dilation knife (hysterotome) for the cervix. At the turn of the twentieth century Dutch gynaecologists such as Treub and Nijhoff began to cast doubt on such theories of \"reflex neurosis\", but Mendes de Leon persisted in his views. Nevertheless, he can still be considered one of the founding fathers of gynaecology in the Netherlands, partly because of his surgical skills, but also due to his study into the interaction between gynaecological and psychological problems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18561794/"}

It utilizes many of the elements of the SCORPIO and SPICES models of teaching. In particular, it involves problem-based learning and an integrated approach to teaching. One afternoon per week is set aside for each theme. So far we have introduced Theme Afternoons in Contraception and Sterilization, The Menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy, Screening for Disease in O&G and Examination Techniques. All Theme Afternoons follow a similar structure: a targeted tutorial, 10 MCQs, a 15-minute coffee break, OSCEs, and role-play with feedback. An evaluation form is completed by each student assessing the session and the tutor. The Theme Afternoon provides the student with stimulation to learn. It has a wide appeal and has been well received by learners. Students learn at a more controlled pace and in a more sheltered environment, which may be less stressful to them. It evaluates well and is flexible in its structure. The changes that occur are student-led and the desire for it to continue is student-driven. It is easily adaptable to other medical specialties or even nonmedical curriculums.

Nobody who performed well at the MCQ failed or was borderline at the final examination. Half of those who were advised to work harder occupied the lowest marks at the final examination. The incourse MCQ was sensitive in selecting out those candidates at risk in their final examination but the advice they were given failed to deal with the deficiencies in half of the students involved. After graduating, these doctors will presumably need special help to maintain their knowledge as they are either incapable of self-motivation or are otherwise deficient. The incourse assessment feedback may have helped another small groups of students to work harder but this study cannot confirm that. The exercise seems worthwhile in that the outlay in time is small, there may be a positive advantage for some students and the medical teacher can feel free of any guilt for failing to advise those students who were at risk of poor performance in the final examination.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1406137/"}

Pediatric gynaecology in Poland owes its growth to prof. Rudolf Peter from Prague (Tschechoslovakia), because it was under the guidance of prof. Peter and his followers at the clinic of Prague University that our gynaecologists extended their knowledge of the biological differences of the childhood. Since 1955 a regular gynaecological care for children and adolescence has been developed in Poland on the basis of general health care and MCH service. In Poland there are mainly out-patient departments of pediatric gynaecology, run by the gynaecological Clinics of Medical Academies and Hospitals. At the moment there are 52 pediatric gynaecological units in Poland. In the Medical Academies, Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, research work on the physiology and pathology of puberty in girls is beeing carried out. The Pediatric Gynaecological Section of the National Gynaecological Society has organized two national symposia in 1969 and in 1972, devoted to gynaecological problems and functional disorders occuring during childhood and puberty. The last Symposium was attended by Professor Robert Contamin, the President of International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology. In June 1972 Polish gynaecologists attended the First International Symposium on Pediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology held in France (Bordeaux). The Polish translation of R. Peter and K.

The teaching of medical ethics was built into the preclinical curriculum from the start. However, the clinical years remained largely unaffected, and only recently has an effort been made to extend the educational philosophy to this more or less traditional part of medical education. Within this context, an experiment of clinical ethics teaching was introduced in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) clerkships. The objectives, methods and results of this experimental programme are described in this paper. The success of the teaching is based on three features of the programme: 1) its student-centred approach; 2) the programme is designed in a way similar to regular patient conferences; 3) the programme is taught by a team consisting of both clinician and ethicist. Before starting a longitudinal programme of ethics teaching during the clinical years, it proved very helpful to experiment with a well designed and evaluated pilot programme.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2746612/"}

Its somewhat unique features have attracted widespread interest both nationally and internationally and may be seen as part of an international movement towards obligatory CME in Western Medicine. However, the programme should also be seen as just a part of the educational responses necessary as the medical profession moves into the 1990s, particularly for those of us in the discipline of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. This paper reviews the increasing pressures from within the profession and from the community towards the obligatory CME concepts pioneered by the RACOG, but suggests that the challenges that have been faced in this area in the past although significant, are much less than those which will be faced in the 1990's, as the discipline addresses the challenges of educating obstetricians in the third phase of Continuing Medical Education--education in managing the environment in which our discipline is practised.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1804089/"}

The paper was amended twice after intervals of approximately 12 months. The results showed differences in performance between the five schools on questions and alternatives within questions, which were common to all editions of the paper (the \"short\" paper). These differences were also shown in the first two editions of the full paper (the \"long\" paper), but were not apparent in the third. There was a significant improvement in performance from the first to the second paper edition of the long by approximately 11%, but this was reversed from the second to the third edition, where there was a significant decrease in performance by approximately 4%. We cannot here exclude the possibility that this decrease in the third edition has resulted from sample bias. The rank order of the schools may result from differences in methods of teaching. It seems that such relative performance between London medical schools in contributed to by the differences in course legnth and by the occurence of mid-course test. It appears also that student performance in any of the schools has not been uniform over the period of the study, there being a peak during the period when the second edition of the paper was used. Variations in student selection occuring between schools may effect some of these differences. There was also a marked difference in students' performance between Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The short papers appeared easier than the full papers. Whilst this may due to the greater clarity of phrasing for the questions of the short paper, we also believe the subject matter of the short paper may be more relevant. A distinct effect could also be shown, over the period, due to improvements in the wording of the questions. It is possible that students perform better at Obstetrics than at Gynaecology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/865339/"}

A significant percentage of women will not agree to such an intimate examination and thus there is an urgent need for a national guideline regarding consent in these circumstances and full compliance.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20108806/"}

A third option is the integration of clinical research, teaching and practice in a university hospital structure where the head of department is the head of service. This model has proven to be very successful but is an expensive option as it functions well only with high funding and staffing levels.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718726/"}

The gender and hours of work of younger and older cohorts were compared to determine the likely impacts of the transition from older to younger cohorts. The paper used the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's annual Medical Labour Force Surveys to examine trends in attrition of obstetricians and gynaecologists over the age of 45 years from the workforce and to predict their rate of retirement to 2025. The projection results show that between the years 2000 and 2025, 59% of the obstetricians and gynaecologists would retire. The rising proportion of women in obstetrics and gynaecology and shorter working hours of both men and women will have a compounding effect on physician retirement. The paper concludes that the changes in practice, increasing feminisation and retirement from the workforce coupled with higher female population growth in the childbearing years and slightly higher fertility mean that ensuring an adequate obstetricians and gynaecologists in Australia will be a significant challenge over the next 20 years.

Its evaluation using a trainees' feedback questionnaire (n = 21) showed that content of the pre-course work was scored favourably by 20 trainees, however one-third of trainees raised concerns about effectiveness and feasibility of the work. Lectures were preferred as the method of teaching by 17 compared with small group activity preferred by 14 trainees. The median scores for all items evaluated were above the threshold for concern.

Therefore, we sought to pilot an ethics and professionalism curriculum for faculty in obstetrics and gynaecology to remedy gaps in the formal, informal and hidden curriculum in medical education. An ethics curriculum was developed for faculty within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at a tertiary care, academic hospital. During the one-time, 4-hour, mandatory in-person session, the participants voluntarily completed the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, Handoff Clinical Evaluation Exercise, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine and overall course evaluation. Patient satisfaction survey scores in both the hospital and ambulatory settings were compared before and after the curriculum. Twenty-eight faculty members attended the curriculum. Overall, respondents reported less burnout and performed at the same level or better in terms of patient handoff than the original studies validating the instruments. Faculty rated the professionalism behaviours as well as teaching of professionalism much lower at our institution than the validation study. There was no change in patient satisfaction after the curriculum. However, overall, the course was well received as meeting its objectives, being beneficial and providing new tools to assess professionalism. This pilot study suggests that an ethics curriculum can be developed for practising physicians that is mindful of pragmatic concerns while still meeting its objectives. Further study is needed regarding long term and objective improvements in ethics knowledge, impact on the education of trainees and improvement in the care of patients as a result of a formal curriculum for faculty.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413157/"}

Celio-surgery is technology-dependent and operator-dependent. The cost of equipment remains prohibitive and its maintenance delicate and expensive, potentially hampering the implantation and spread of this new technique in Africa, which also lacks specifically trained staff as well as an appropriate technical infrastructure. Nevertheless, the experience of teams in Cameroon and Gabon are encouraging with 110 and 220 patients respectively treated by celio-surgery without complications.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the current use of simulation in obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada. A 19-question survey was developed and distributed to all 16 active and accredited obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada. The survey was sent to program directors initially, but on occasion was redirected to other faculty members involved in resident education or to senior residents. Survey responses were collected over an 18-month period. Twelve programs responded to the survey (11 complete responses). Eleven programs (92%) reported introducing an obstetrics and gynaecology simulation curriculum into their residency education. All respondents (100%) had access to a simulation centre. Simulation was used to teach various obstetrical and gynaecological skills using different simulation modalities. Barriers to simulation integration were primarily the costs of equipment and space and the need to ensure dedicated time for residents and educators. The majority of programs indicated that it was a priority for them to enhance their simulation curriculum and transition to competency-based resident assessment. Simulation training has increased in obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs. The development of formal simulation curricula for use in obstetrics and gynaecology resident education is in early development. A standardized national simulation curriculum would help facilitate the integration of simulation into obstetrics and gynaecology resident education and aid in the shift to competency-based resident assessment. Obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs need national collaboration (between centres and specialties) to develop a standardized simulation curriculum for use in obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26629724/"}

The use of such forms of assessment is growing nationally and internationally in many specialties, but there is little research evidence on comparisons by procedure/competency and form-type across an entire specialty. Generalisability theory combined with a multilevel modelling approach is used to estimate variance components, G-coefficients and standard errors of measurement across 13 procedures and three form-types (mini-CEX, OSATS and CbD). The main finding is that there are wide variations in the estimates of reliability across the forms, and that therefore the guidance on assessment within the specialty does not always allow for enough forms per trainee to ensure that the levels of reliability of the process is adequate. There is, however, little evidence that reliability varies systematically by form-type. Methodologically, the problems of accurately estimating reliability in these contexts through the calculation of variance components and, crucially, their associated standard errors are considered. The importance of the use of appropriate methods in such calculations is emphasised, and the unavoidable limitations of research in naturalistic settings are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23782043/"}

Despite its favourable outcomes, UAE is still only marginally applied in the Netherlands. The aim of this inventory is to identify factors which either restrict or facilitate the implementation of UAE. Gynaecologists and interventional-radiologists in three hospitals in Amsterdam were interviewed by means of questionnaires. One of these hospitals had ample experience in UAE for uterine fibroids, one hospital had just started providing this treatment, and one hospital did not perform UAE. Also patients with symptomatic fibroids who were scheduled for either UAE or hysterectomy were interviewed about the counselling for UAE. The following obstacles in the implementation of UAE were found: lack of knowledge about UAE , absence of a multidisciplinary protocol, and above all, the absence of UAE as one of the treatment options in the Dutch national guideline on the management of menorrhagia. 75% of all patients claimed to be well informed about UAE by their gynaecologist. Our recommendations for the implementation of UAE are: 1) adding UAE to the Dutch guideline for the management of menorrhagia with clearly defined indications and contraindications&semi; 2) educating gynaecologists about UAE&semi; 3) composing a patient information leaflet and a website, and 4) arranging a protocol in a multidisciplinary team.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21868811/"}

Only 30% of interns (G1) and 78% of surgeons (GA) were satisfied with their training. Most respondents agreed that two general surgery courses as currently offered in the curriculum do not provide enough good basic surgical knowledge. Courses that allow residents to train in other hospitals are generally preferred to those that focus on a particular hospital. Ninety-two percent of respondents consider camaraderie and bonding within a medical unit to be key to a successful course. Theoretical training, including lectures and access to listed references, is thought to be weak. Resources and tools for practical training outside the operating room, including pelvic trainer and anatomical dissection, are scarce. Course evaluation is expected by 83% of all respondents, although it is now virtually nonexistent. Surgical training of residents in obstetrics and gynecology can be improved in many ways, such as using synthetic materials and operating on animals or cadavers.

Complete responses were collected from 301 (41%) OB/GYNs and 39 (8%) urologists. Of the OB/GYN respondents, 57% were generalists (GEN), and 22% completed FPMRS fellowship training (FPMRS-GYN). OB/GYN GENs were less likely than FPMRS-GYNs to report comfort with pelvic organ prolapse quantification assessment, urodynamic testing, cystoscopy, treatment of mesh complications, and management of overactive bladder. Urologists were less likely than FPMRS-GYNs to report comfort completing a pelvic organ prolapse quantification assessment, fitting pessaries, and treating mesh complications but more likely to report comfort managing overactive bladder. FPMRS-GYNs were more likely than other providers to report high volumes (>20 cases in the past year) of vaginal hysterectomy, as well as incontinence and prolapse procedures. OB/GYN GENs and urologists frequently cited lack of formal training in residency as a barrier to performing FPMRS procedures, whereas FPMRS-GYNs reported a lack of operating room facilities and support personnel. Overall, 76% of the respondents were of the opinion that FPMRS should be a credentialed Canadian subspecialty (92% FPMRS-GYN, 69% OB/GYN GEN, 59% urologists).

Themes identified were: Competence, Vision and Innovation, Structures, ITP Coordinator Role and Teaching and Learning. Competence was defined as a combination of independent practice and understanding of ones' own limits, in addition to required clinical skills and knowledge. Enablers and barriers to achieving competency were identified and associated with structures, human and logistical factors.

During the Nazi regime, the official \"health command\" policy monitored by the Nazi party promoted home delivery under midwife supervision, both by pertinacious propaganda and partly also by decrees and ordinances. The official line of argument against clinical obstetrics consisted of a queer and highly questionable mélange of ideology and distored facts brought forward by the so-called \"Reichsgesundheitsführer\" Dr. Leonardo Conti and his mother, Mrs Nanna Conti as head of the Party-sponsored Midwives Association. The \"Midwives Law\" was promulgated on 21 December 1938 prescribing compulsory consultation of a midwife for every delivery. By the end of 1939 gynaecologists eventually rallied in protest against legislative measures to restrict clinical obstetrics, by means of a memorandum penned by the German Association for Gynaecology. This memorandum was scheduled for circulation among all the members of the association. The pressure exercised by this memorandum resulted in tough negotiations amounting to a tug-of-war between representatives of the German Association for Gynaecology and Dr. Conti. This led eventually not only to an abandonment of the attacks against clinical obstetrics but also to an official and unreserved recognition of its achievements. In addition, the \"Reichsgesundheitsführer\" issued \"Directives for regulating obstetrics procedures\" in 1940/41 in which it was laid down that it would be left to the decision of the expectant mother to choose where she would prefer to deliver her child.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3910511/"}

The second objective was to evaluate using simulation during residency. This national descriptive study, utilized a questionnaire to survey all interns in French gynecology and obstetrics. At the end of a study, 129 responses of residents were analyzed. The participation rate was 12%. The majority of residents were women (84%) and the highest response rate was from the Ile-de-France region (36%). The lowest rate was from the Southern region. The majority of residents were in the eighth semester (20%). Residents reported surgical and obstetric orientations in 53% (n = 68) and 44% (n = 57) of cases, respectively. Registration for cancer oncology was reported by 22% (n = 28) of respondents. Evaluation of oncologic surgery training was mostly considered \"good\" by the surgical group and \"passable\" by the obstetrics group. Access to simulators was usually restricted and most often utilized the pelvitrainer. Sessions were typically not mandatory and numbered between zero and five per semester. Three types of simulators were accessible in the Ile-de-France, North-West, West and Rhône-Alpes. The North-East did not have access to animal models, and the South-West did not have access to corpses. Surgical classes were more common in the Rhône-Alpes, North-East, Ile-de-France and North-West regions. To improve their training in oncological surgery, 64% (n = 18) of residents planned to do an inter-university exchange and 54% had completed additional specialized training. Measures that were most expected to improve training were increased training in surgery (96% of respondents, n = 27) and more intensive coaching (96%, n = 27). Companionship is a pillar of residents training, but its effectiveness is variable. One solution could be to implement better use of simulation methods.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31531778/"}

Surface rendering gives detailed plastic images if there are surrounding layers of different echogenicity allowing for the definition of a certain threshold. Transparent modes provide an imaging of structures with a higher echogenicity in the interior of the object. A combination of the two modes sequentially definable by the sonographer allows for the optimal viewing of structures. These imaging modes are innovative features which have to be evaluated for clinical applicability and usefulness. Digital documentation of whole volumes enables full evaluation without loss of information at a later point. 3D technology provides an enormous number of technical options which have to be evaluated for their diagnostic significance and limitations in obstetrics and gynaecology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7836537/"}

The aim was to review the available evidence base in gynaecologic surgery, to assess what progress has been made and to determine gaps in the evidence for clinical decision-making. Systematic reviews involving gynaecological surgery interventions were extracted from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 2, 2007) and data were extracted for key primary outcomes from each of the randomized trials in the reviews. The reviews were categorized as to whether they had provided evidence of effectiveness for pre-defined outcomes of most relevance to patients. Of 371 reviews or protocols published on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 2, 2007), only 30 were completed reviews assessing surgical interventions. Seven reviews concluded there was evidence of a significant effect (whether beneficial or harmful) of the interventions studied for pre-defined primary outcomes; 11 reviews concluded there was some evidence of significant effects for primary outcomes along with some gaps for primary outcomes; 12 reviews concluded insufficient evidence of effectiveness. Common themes of unique methodological challenges and pitfalls with trials of surgical interventions were apparent. Cochrane reviews have gone a long way to establishing a sound evidence base in gynaecologic surgery: some gaps in the evidence have been eliminated and others highlighted.

Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, categorised into three groups: (i) patient's gender preference for Ob/Gyns; (ii) patient's gender preference for medical students during the Ob/Gyn clerkship; and (iii) influence of gender bias on Ob/Gyn career decisions. Patients prioritised their physician's care attributes (eg technical skill, compassion, experience) over gender when choosing Ob/Gyns; however, provider gender was prioritised for medical students. Male medical students more commonly reported exclusion from clinical opportunities, although objective clinical exposure was like that of female counterparts. Despite perceived gender bias, male medical students reported increased Ob/Gyn interest post-clerkship; interest did not translate into residency applications.

Students identified many merits of obstetrics pre-rotation with more than 60% identifying it as exciting, interesting fulfilling and challenging. However, incompatibility with family life was cited as a demerit by 72% of respondents and 68.1% identified fear of litigation as a demerit. Participants were less positive overall about the merits of a career in gynaecology with less than 40% viewing it as exciting, fulfilling, and varied. While respondents were positive about the merits of a career in obstetrics and gynecology, concerns remain about work-life balance, career opportunities, and the high-risk nature of the specialty. These concerns should be addressed by the profession and policy makers if they wish to attract sufficient numbers to address anticipated need in the coming years. Gender differences in speciality choice were also evident. If males are to be recruited into obstetrics and gynaecology, consideration should be given to the positive impact of internship.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37337239/"}

The ability of natural language processing systems, such as ChatGPT, to successfully engage with healthcare systems requiring fluid reasoning, specialist data interpretation, and empathetic communication in an unfamiliar and evolving environment is poorly studied. This study investigated whether the ChatGPT interface could engage with and complete a mock objective structured clinical examination simulating assessment for membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. This study aimed to determine whether ChatGPT, without additional training, would achieve a score at least equivalent to that achieved by human candidates who sat for virtual objective structured clinical examinations in Singapore. This study was conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase, a total of 7 structured discussion questions were selected from 2 historical cohorts (cohorts A and B) of objective structured clinical examination questions. ChatGPT was examined using these questions and responses recorded in a script. Of note, 2 human candidates (acting as anonymizers) were examined on the same questions using videoconferencing, and their responses were transcribed verbatim into written scripts. The 3 sets of response scripts were mixed, and each set was allocated to 1 of 3 human actors. In the second phase, actors were used to presenting these scripts to examiners in response to the same examination questions. These responses were blind scored by 14 qualified examiners. ChatGPT scores were unblinded and compared with historical human candidate performance scores. The average score given to ChatGPT by 14 examiners was 77.2%. The average historical human score (n=26 candidates) was 73.7 %. ChatGPT demonstrated sizable performance improvements over the average human candidate in several subject domains. The median time taken for ChatGPT to complete each station was 2.54 minutes, well before the 10 minutes allowed. ChatGPT generated factually accurate and contextually relevant structured discussion answers to complex and evolving clinical questions based on unfamiliar settings within a very short period. ChatGPT outperformed human candidates in several knowledge areas. Not all examiners were able to discern between human and ChatGPT responses. Our data highlight the emergent ability of natural language processing models to demonstrate fluid reasoning in unfamiliar environments and successfully compete with human candidates that have undergone extensive specialist training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088277/"}

We aimed to assess the impact of these challenges on training in gynaecology over time. We designed a study which aimed to assess both trainers and trainees perception of gynaecological surgical training in Ireland. The purpose of this was to identify confidence levels and challenges and to highlight potential areas for future improvement of surgical training in gynaecology. A a cross-sectional survey was distributed to all trainees and trainers registered with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland Obstetrics and Gynaecology higher specialist training programme in 2014, 2017 and again in 2021. During the study period trainees' confidence that the training programme prepared them to perform gynaecological surgery fell significantly. This fall in confidence was most evident for trainees' ability to perform abdominal hysterectomy (40.9% vs 15.2%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.61, p =.03) and vaginal hysterectomy (31.8% vs 12.1%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.58, p =.03) when comparing 2014 with 2021. All trainees reporteded that gynaecology was not given adequate time in the training programme to prepare them to practice independently as consultants. Themes identified by participants to improve training included dedicated access to theatre time with a named trainer, increased simulation training and subspecialisation at later stages of training. Our findings show an overall decrease in trainees' and trainers' confidence in the surgical training available in gynaecology over an eight-year period.. This is particularly true for major gynaecology procedures. Efforts must be made to ensure trainees have improved access to surgical training in gynaecology.

These were also compared to the World Federation for Medical Education's Global Standards for postgraduate medical education. Comparing the OBGYN curricula of these five countries led to quite similar results. Even though curricula reviewed have or will be integrating competency-based medical education into their residency program, there is a need to develop adequate assessment tools, including simulation, to train competent physicians capable of independent practice.

Financial connections between drug and device manufacturers with doctors have been extensively debated over the past decade. On one hand, relationships between doctors and industry could be considered synergistic by allowing the development of improved treatments. On the other hand, payment (and other benefits) from industry to doctors may subtly shift the main objective of the collaboration from patients' health to mutual benefits for both doctors and industry. Fertility patients can be considered 'vulnerable' as they face the multiple challenges of seeking to be parents, understanding complex and expensive fertility treatments that are by no means universally successful, and at the same time are under pressure because of their ever-increasing age. They are entitled to receive the most cost-effective treatments. We suggest that specialists in the field of reproductive medicine should be transparent about the receipt of financial benefits, including funding from industry, as it may be influencing both research outcomes and treatments that patients are offered. We also recommend that payments arising from industry-sponsored research should be centralized in institutional funds and not paid directly to researchers. And there should be transparency about the source and the purpose of the payment. Industry sponsorship of medical societies and their educational events should be kept to a minimum and declared quantitatively in societies' websites and scientific programme brochures. Industry sponsorship of scientific meetings should not include the right to host educational symposia or speakers within the programme. All speakers should declare their conflicts of interest (COIs) at their meetings. Guideline groups should require all members to declare their financial COIs before meeting and exclude or limit those members with COI. Governmental authorities should not allow continuing medical education credits to those educational events not complying with the above policies.

Patient Safety Culture (PSC) is widely recognized as a key tenet that must be improved in order to enhance patient safety and prevent adverse events. However, in gynecology and obstetrics, despite the criticality of the environment, few studies have focused on improving PSC in these units. This study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of an educational program to improve PSC among health professionals working in the obstetric unit of a Tunisian university hospital. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in the obstetric unit of a university hospital in Sousse (Tunisia). All the obstetric unit's professionals were invited to take part in the study (n = 95). The intervention consisted of an educational intervention with workshops and self-learning documents on patient safety and quality of care. The study instrument was the French validated version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Normality of the data was checked using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The comparison of dimensions' scores before and after the intervention was carried out by the chi2 test. The significance level was set at 0.05. In total, 73 participants gave survey feedback in pre-test and 68 in post-test (response rates of 76.8% and 71.6, respectively). Eight dimensions improved significantly between pre- and post-tests.

If we are to determine the needs of our profession, we must be aware of the expected practice patterns of future women's health care providers. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the future career plans of Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residents. The SOGC Junior Member Committee administered two career surveys to Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residents. The first was directly distributed to all Canadian residents and collected by local representatives of the SOGC Junior Member Committee in November 2002. The second was electronically administered from November 2005 to January 2006. The data collected from the surveys were collated and analyzed using statistical analysis software. The first survey, in 2002, was completed by 236 obstetrics and gynaecology residents (68% response rate) and the second, in 2006, by 246 (65% response rate). In both surveys, respondents were evenly distributed over all five years of residency training and all residency training programs. In 2002, 63 residents (30%) were considering additional postgraduate fellowship training following completion of residency compared with 130 residents (53%) in 2006 (P < 0.001). In both surveys, senior residents (postgraduate years IV and V) were significantly less likely to consider further postgraduate training than residents in their first three years (2002: 17% vs. 38%; 2006: 42% vs. 58%). Of total respondents to the 2002 and 2006 surveys, 87% planned to practice obstetrics upon graduation.

Following institutional ethics approval, all residents at 13 participating Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residency training programs were contacted by email to complete a 20-item confidential questionnaire examining career plans. Quantitative data were analyzed using SAS v9.1. Qualitative data were coded by theme and grouped into various domains. Of 293 residents, 105 (36%) participated. More than half of these were considering at least one obstetrics and gynaecology subspecialty, but 53% indicated that their most appealing career path was general obstetrics and gynaecology. Although 50% of residents had ever considered a career in GO, only 17% were considering a GO career at the time of the survey. When rated as positive influences, medical school exposure, resident exposure, role models within GO, colleagues, other health care professionals, \"my individual life circumstances,\" \"my personal attributes,\" the clinical, research, and educational components of GO, the GO patient population, and relation with gynaecologic oncologists and other specialists were significant predictors of current GO interest. Themes that emerged from qualitative analysis revealed that the clinical, professional, and research domains were predominant influences among residents currently considering a career in GO. GO is an infrequent career choice for Canadian residents in obstetrics and gynaecology, and a number of factors significantly affect GO career decisions.

Invitees from 20 related societies briefly presented their organizations' perspectives and discussed focused questions about specific challenges, proposed solutions, and anticipated obstacles. Finally, participants summarized their top two recommendations to improve current residency training. Summit participants identified four primary areas of focus: 1) align curriculum with relevant topics to practice, 2) ensure faculty have the necessary resources and time to teach effectively, 3) consider using the final months of medical school to get a jump start on residency fund of knowledge and skills, and 4) use better assessments during the course of residency.

From May 2016 to June 2018, 18 residents from 9 US OBGYN residency programs participated in the elective. Under supervision, US residents performed 116 major and 77 minor gynecologic surgeries, and teach-assisted Batswana interns and medical officers in 76 cesarean deliveries. Residents led or contributed significantly to 25 didactic education sessions as part of the formal intern OBGYN curriculum. During this period, 24 Batswana interns rotated through the hospital's department of OBGYN, and all 24 trainees met required OBGYN competencies prior to completing their internship. Matching US resident demand for global health experiences to equitable global health programming while maintaining ACGME training guidelines poses a challenge to OBGYN residency training programs.

We screened curricula of five Mozambican medical schools based on a state-of-the-art intimate partner violence curriculum framework. The latter framework was based on a review of the literature. Few medical schools of Mozambique could be identified addressing intimate partner violence in their curriculum. When tackled, intimate partner violence content is mostly dealt within the context of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Community Health and Forensic Medicine rotations. Intimate partner violence contents are integrated as stand-alone modules in some specific subjects. In none of the schools, specific teachers teaching intimate partner violence could be identified. No time allocation was specified to address the topic; no teaching and learning strategies could be identified invoking awareness or supporting basic knowledge acquisition; additionally, hardly any information about related assessment methods was found. Only in one medical school was the subject part of the formal curriculum. Intimate partner violence content is hardly and inconsistently addressed. The limited intimate partner violence content tracked in the Mozambican medical schools' curricula, mainly addresses violence in general, for instance as identified in Orthopaedics or Surgery contexts and sexual violence in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The inclusion of elements of intimate partner violence in the curriculum remains restricted, questioning the impact of medical education of future practitioners' competencies.

In this study, we have attempted to assess the level of surgical confidence reported by senior and recently accredited trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in the UK via an anonymised postal questionnaire. A total of 103 replies were received from 202 questionnaires. Some 99% of the respondents said they felt competent to carry out a simple total abdominal hysterectomy; 61.2% could confidently dissect the ureter and 55.3% could repair major damage to the bladder. However, when managing major obstetric haemorrhage, only 44.6% of respondents felt confident to perform a caesarean hysterectomy; 27.1% could dissect the ureter and 41.7% could apply a B-Lynch suture to the uterus.

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data were examined to quantify the total number of major gynaecological procedures performed between 2013 and 2018. Medicare data were analysed to quantify the number of billed procedures. These data were compared with published Australian RANZCOG trainees and operative gynaecologists, to estimate the potential annual average exposure for each procedure. Major open, laparoscopic and vaginal surgeries constitute less than 27% of the 600 000 gynaecological procedures performed annually in Australia. Most major gynaecological surgeries are performed at rates lower than 12 cases per year for both trainees and specialists. Over the study period, laparotomies, vaginal hysterectomies and continence procedures decreased, and operative laparoscopies and laparoscopic hysterectomies increased.

It's a fact that the name of Carl Freiherr v. Rokitansky has always been remembered as an outstanding personality who established and dominated these fields of medical science. He described for the first time cases of endometriosis, strangulation of ovarian tumors, tuberculisation in the puerperal uterus, luteinic cysts in cases of hydatide moles, external wandering of the ovum, puerperal osteophytes and the spondylolisthetic pelvis. He created a linguistically and didactically suitable terminology: fibroids, later called fibromyomas, the kyphotic, the skoliotic and the coxalgic pelvis. Among the 14 medical terms used in pathological anatomy which are connected with the name of Rokitansky, two refer to the fields of gynaecology and obstetrics: the Mayer-v. Rokitansky-Kuster(-Hauser) syndrome in gynaecology and the Rokitansky spondylolisthetic pelvis in obstetrics. Rokitansky's authoritarian way of advocating the theory of Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis concerning the aetiology of puerperal fever plays an important part in both biographies.

This is a retrospective study conducted at the maternity of the CHU of Caen Level III between 2004 and 2009. The comprehensive collection of data totals 294 emergency cesarean sections. The main indications were found to be: bradycardia, cord prolapse, uterine rupture, eclampsia, failure of vacuum extraction on fetal heart rate abnormality during expulsion, the suspicion of placental abruption and hemorrhage in placenta previa. Recorded activities day and night were individualized and the maternal and fetal complications related to the emergency. The mean \"decision-to-delivery\" interval is of 21.3±10.3minutes with 80.2% of cesarean sections within 30minutes (CE30) and 25.8% in less than 15minutes. Concerning the activity period, the average time at night is 22.5±10.3minutes with 20.7% <15minutes and 77.2% <30minutes and in the daytime, the average time is 20.1±10.1minutes with 31.2% <15minutes and 83.3% <30minutes. The laying of spinal anesthesia in the operating room significantly delays the time of extraction (54.9% vs. 91, 8% CE30, P<0.001), but the epidural before the cesarean section and general anesthesia is faster with 91.9% vs. 78.9% (P=0.002) and 91.8% vs. 81.6% (P=0.022) respectively CE30. We deplored 9 deaths of newborns. These nine deaths represent 3.2% of emergency caesarean sections with an average time of 20.7±14.7minutes. The time is influenced by the transition to the operating room, the type of anesthesia and lack of information clearly stated to the team. The fetal prognosis is not limited to the \"decision-to-delivery\" interval but it remains essential in situations of emergency. The 15 or 30minutes interval is discussed in the literature. Obviously, the delay must be appreciated based on certain parameters (medical personnel, architecture) and each Alpha must adapt their practice to the physical working environment to meet the recommended objectives. However, the introduction of a protocol for extreme emergencies would allow for optimal responsiveness of all the teams involved and should result in a compliance period of 30minutes. Teamwork and adherence to procedures can improve these results.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23410555/"}

In non-teaching centres, the presence of a local protocol was significantly lower compared to academic and teaching hospitals (<i>p</i>=.012). If a local protocol was present, the first choice of treatment was medical in 54.5%. Four respondents (16%) always prescribed mifepristone in case of EPF. The most common reason not prescribing mifepristone was the lack of sufficient scientific evidence. An average increase in success rate of 21.7% was desired to prescribe mifepristone in the future for EPF. Completeness of evacuation of products of conception from the uterus was usually assessed after 1 week by ultrasonography combined with clinical signs. If a complete evacuation was not achieved by the initial medical treatment, expectant management was proposed just as often as surgical intervention. Impact Statement <b>What is already known on this subject?</b> In case of early pregnancy failure (EPF), women can choose from both expectant medical (misoprostol, whether or not combined with mifepristone) and surgical (D and C) treatment. In The Netherlands, a national guideline concerning the treatment of EPF is still lacking. A questionnaire performed by Verschoor et al. ( 2014 ) showed there was a large practice variety between Dutch clinics. <b>What</b> <b>the results of this study add?</b> In this study, a representative sample of all Dutch clinics received a questionnaire about the treatment of EPF. The results confirm a large practice variation regarding treatment of EPF. The first choice of treatment, the medical treatment regimen, and the assessment of whether or not the treatment have been variations of successful between clinics. With regards to the addition of mifepristone to the medical treatment regime with misoprostol, gynaecologists are willing to consider mifepristone if an improvement of efficacy of approximately 20% is scientifically proven. <b>What</b> <b>the implications</b> <b>are</b> <b>of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> In our opinion, these results emphasise the need for a national guideline concerning the treatment of EPF. Our results also demonstrate that, if the addition of mifepristone to medical treatment with misoprostol proves to be more efficient than misoprostol alone, gynaecologists are willing to prescribe mifepristone in the future. Whether the addition is indeed more effective than misoprostol alone, will be the subject of a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial, planned to begin in the first half of 2018.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31215270/"}

This is particularly true in the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology, with one of the highest rates of litigation of all medical specialities. We aimed to evaluate the influence of media and the legal environment on the career of trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology. Under the auspices of the Irish national training body, we distributed a 26-item questionnaire to doctors-in-training (DIT) working in obstetrics and gynaecology in the Republic of Ireland. Descriptive statistics and Chi-squared analyses were performed on the anonymised data. 151 DIT responded to the questionnaire, with a response rate of 86.2 % (sample size = 175). The majority were female (79.9 %, n = 121), Irish (85.5 %, n = 106) and had no children (67.0 %, n = 83). 86.7 % (n = 131) felt that the media did not have a positive impact on patients receiving care, and, further, unfairly represented the speciality (94.1 %; n = 142). Additionally, DIT felt that medico-legal issues had a negative impact on issues such as retention and recruitment. These two areas were implicated in over three quarters of DIT considering leaving the speciality. This study demonstrates that DIT perceive media scrutiny and litigation to have a negative effect on the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology. Further support integrated into specialist training, is needed to ensure that trainees are adequately equipped to deal with both mainstream and social media as well as interactions they may have with the legal profession as they progress through their career.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33359922/"}

Here, medical students shall be introduced to this multifaceted specialty and have their interest in it kindled. This article reports about the experiences of the first gynaecological summer school which was held at the University Hospital Heidelberg for 2 days in August 2018. The programme included keynote presentations, discussion roundtables and skills-lab training. To assess students' related satisfaction, and to improve future projects, an evaluation survey with seven items and two open-comment questions was given to each participant after the event. Mostly female students [n (♀) = 37, 93%; n (♂) = 3, 7%] from 15 different medical universities from all over Germany participated. Available places were booked within 1 week. Participants were in their clinical part of their studies between the 5th and 16th semester. The average rating of the event was excellent with 1.1 points (1 = best-5 = worst), while the selection of topics scored lowest marks with an average rating of 1.7 points. Due to the great success, the high demand and the student's positive evaluation, annual summer schools in obstetrics and gynaecology are planned. Because most of the participating students have shown a high interest and have appropriate education in the domain, the information content of keynote presentations could be increased above basic level in future projects.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471634/"}

Research on transfer of surgical training has focused on trainees' performance improvements and not on their actual opportunity to transfer their trained skills. This was a retrospective study conducted using data on surgical procedures performed by first-year trainees in abdominal surgery, gynaecology and urology in the Central Denmark Region. We included data on trainees who participated in two different SBST courses; open surgery and laparoscopic surgery from 2014 to 2018. Data on a total of 127 first-year trainees were included. Our results revealed considerable variation in the number of procedures performed by first-year trainees in the three specialities. Comparing surgical activity after and before the SBST courses, we found median differences between 0 and 3, indicating no consistent increases in trainees' surgical activity in the post-course periods (five out of six comparisons were insignificant (p > 0.05)). Trainees' surgical exposure varies within specialities and this may have consequences for achieving uniform levels of competence among trained specialists. Our results suggest that trainees do not have timely opportunities to intensify their clinical surgical activities after participating in SBST courses. A delay in opportunities to perform may inhibit the trainee's use of acquired skills and competencies and hamper transfer of training. none. not relevant.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33215601/"}

It was, he claimed, the result of the selective attention of doctors when securing medical histories. Though written 30 years ago, Donovan's paper is apparently still provocative enough to be regularly quoted. It has, however, never been closely examined. Looked at in a different light, Donovan's research appears even more interesting. The apparent paradoxes he reports disappear when it is remembered that symptoms are not data but means of communication. His perceptive picture of the influence of doctors on the formation of climacteric symptoms is especially convincing. Much of this is because the main conclusions of this research seem to have come almost as a surprise, forcing themselves on a worker engaged in a restricted field of his speciality.

The students completed self-assessment questionnaires at the beginning and end of the attachment. There was a significant improvement in the level of knowledge and skills required for antenatal care, care in labour and postnatal care by the end of the attachment, with no difference between hospital or general practice groups. There was a significant increase in the level of interest in the future practice of obstetrics only in the general practice group. However, this difference could be explained by the greater number of students in the general practice group who were by chance in the 'no or don't know' category at the start of their attachment.

The survey contained questions about demographics, knowledge and beliefs about RRS, and possible barriers to its implementation in women at average risk for ovarian cancer. One hundred ninety-two physicians responded to the survey, a response rate of 25%. Respondents varied in their duration in practice, came from all provinces, and spent a large proportion of their time practising gynaecology. Ninety percent of respondents had heard of RRS; however, 37% were unaware of the evidence supporting the hypothesis that HGSC originates in the fallopian tube, and 38% were unsure whether there would be any population benefit from performing RRS at the time of other gynaecologic surgery. Multiple barriers to implementation were identified. Most Canadian obstetrician-gynaecologists responding to our survey were aware of RRS as a possible method to prevent ovarian cancer in women at average risk; however, barriers still exist to widespread implementation.

In 2014, a web-based survey was sent to 633 trainees from the European Network of Young Gynaecological Oncologists (ENYGO) database. The 14-item questionnaire (partially using a 1- to 5-point Likert scale) assessed respondents' use of SM and preference for workshop content and organization. Descriptive analysis was used to describe the mean scores reported for different items, and the internal reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach α. In total, 170 ENYGO members (27%) responded to the survey. Of those, 91% said that they use SM platforms, mostly for private purposes. Twenty-three percent used SM professionally and 43% indicated that they would consider SM to be a clinical discussion forum. The respondents said that they would like updates on conferences and professional activities to be shared on SM platforms. Complication management, surgical anatomy, and state of the art in gynecologic oncology were identified as preferred workshops topics. The most frequently indicated hands-on workshops were laparoscopic techniques and surgical anatomy. Consultants attached a higher level of importance to palliative care education and communication training than trainees. The mean duration of the workshop preferred was 2 days. This report highlights the significance of ENYGO trainees' attachment to SM platforms. Most respondents expect ENYGO to use these online channels for promoting educational activities and other updates. Using SM for clinical discussion will require specific guidelines to secure professional and also consumer integrity. This survey confirms surgical management and the state of the art as important knowledge gaps, and ENYGO has tailored its activities according to these results.

Data analysis was entered into a software product, which generated a summary of findings table that included structured and qualified grading (very low to high) of the quality for the evidence of the individual outcomes and provided a measure of effect. Fourteen peer-reviewed studies with 741,760 patients were included in the systematic review. For gynecology the LVS group had an increased rate of total complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.5), intraoperative complications (OR, 1.6, 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), and postoperative complications (OR, 1.4 95% CI, 1.3-1.4). In gynecological oncology, the LVS group had higher mortality (OR, 1.9, 95% CI, 1.3-2.6). In the urogynecology group, a single study reported that the LVS group had a higher rate of any complication (risk ratio [RR], 1.4, 95% CI, -1.2-1.6). Another single study found that LVS had higher rates of reoperation for mesh complications after midurethral sling procedures (RR, 1.4, 95% CI, 1.2-1.5). The evidence is of moderate to very low quality. Gynecologists performing procedures approximately once a month or less were found to have higher rates of adverse outcomes in gynecology, gynecological oncology, and urogynecology, with higher mortality in gynecological oncology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26945605/"}
{"id": "2715603", "title": "[Graduated ruler for making a transverse suprapubic incision].", "text": "The transverse suprapubic incision is the most usual approach to laparotomy in obstetrics and gynaecology. It has many advantages both from the aesthetic as well as the functional points of view. The low transverse scar is hidden in the region of the pubis. Post-operative breakdowns (such as hernia and eventertion) that occur with longitudinal incisions have almost disappeared. The site, the length and the height of the incision vary according to the surgeon's ideas and his experience. The result cosmetically therefore varies and the optimum benefit is not always achieved. We describe a graduated ruler specially designed for the transverse suprapubic incision. It was worked out in 1984. It makes it easier to standardise the technique of suprapubic incision, but one that can be changed according to variations in body contours. The ruler can be sterilised. It is available in two models: one, a flexible one which is ideal for caesarean sections and laparotomies in fat women or where the abdominal wall is distorted by tumours under it; the second model is rigid and should be able to be used on the normal flat abdomen. One and a half years experience shows that the ruler can be used to standardise the technique of transverse suprapubic incision. It also helps to teach this method of laparotomy; and the cosmetic results have become better.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2715603/"}

Since 1995 the University's of Frankfurt am Main Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics has therefore developed a consistent program of its own under Windows NT for in-patient facilities, as well as for some outpatient services. The program does not aim to achieve everything that is technically possible, but focuses primarily on user requirements.

With training the quality of the knots increased, whereas the mean duration to tie a knot decreased from 277 +/- 114 to 67 +/- 27 s for the first 10 and the last 10 knots respectively. The initial and final duration of knot tying were lower in more experienced trainees, as estimated by the year of training or the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) level of experience. More specifically, duration of knot tying was shorter when more diagnostic laparoscopies, laparoscopic sterilizations or adnexectomies had been performed. This effect of previous experience was however limited compared with the overall effect of training. Previous passive experience, however, as determined by the number of assisted or observed surgical interventions, did not affect the learning curves. Speed of knot tying was slightly higher in trainees who spent more of their leisure time performing handicrafts than in trainees who were more interested in reading, but although significant, these differences were only marginal. In conclusion, the data show an important effect of training on the speed and quality of intracorporeal knot tying and confirm that learning curves improve with previous training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9455831/"}

Improvements have been made on a practice, institution, system and national scale, and efforts have focused on improving safety, efficiency, and cost of care. Gynecologic oncology practitioners ought to engage in this work to improve patient outcomes, comply with federal regulation, and continue to meet required educational requirements of training programs. In gynecologic oncology there are already many examples of successful quality improvement initiatives that have resulted in improved patient care, including the implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery programs, reduction in blood transfusion, and increases in guideline adherent cancer care. Quality improvement methodology is born out of industrial engineering and includes Six Sigma and Lean; both are frameworks for implementing quality improvement as a process and can be adopted in healthcare settings to achieve the desired outcomes. Six Sigma is a system that aims to have a 99.9997% defect free process, and uses the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) framework to guide stakeholders in their work. Lean is a concept aimed at reducing waste in process. Regardless of methodology used, the most important aspect of successful quality improvement is the use of change-management theory to achieve stakeholder buy-in and institutional participation. The physician champion is a key element to this. Finally, once a project has been completed, successfully or not, it is important to disseminate the experience. This will allow for adoption and replication in other institutions. It also can serve as a mechanism for academic recognition and advancement.

In 1999, a postal questionnaire was sent to all gynaecologists. The response rate was 51%. The questionnaire contained structured questions about current provision and a number of hypothetical scenarios to explore referral patterns to the cancer genetics service. The results of this study showed that referrals varied widely among specialists, as did the numbers who required onward referral to cancer genetics. The offer of screening to women at high risk of ovarian cancer was consistent, although there were variations in how often it was offered and the age at which it was offered. Most gynaecologists were easily able to establish when it was appropriate to refer onwards to cancer genetics, differentiating between women at high or low risk. There was some confusion about women at moderate risk of ovarian cancer. This study demonstrated the need for clear referral guidelines in Wales.

The questionnaire was designed as a follow-up of a similar survey conducted by ENTOG in 2009 and assessed the overall compliance with the EWTD, the adaptations needed to achieve this compliance, the impact of the EWTD on the quality of training and the well-being of trainees. The answers were analysed using descriptive statistics in Microsoft Excel. 59 responses from 28/33 (84.8%) ENTOG member countries were collected. Only 5 out of 28 (17.9%) countries were found to be nationally compliant with EWTD. There were no clear differences in the compliance between different types of the hospitals (university/teaching/district), but a trend was observed towards higher rate of implementation in smaller hospitals (<1500 deliveries per year). Regarding the changes needed to become EWTD-compliant and yet maintain high-quality training, the most common suggestions were: hiring extra junior doctors, restructuring training, having less doctors on duty simultaneously, consultants performing more hands on work, dedicated training sessions, reduction of administrative tasks and simulation training for surgical skills. The majority of trainees, 7 out of 12, (58.3%) in the EWTD-compliant hospitals experienced a positive effect on their training, whereas the majority of trainees in non-compliant hospitals, 31 out of 47, (66%) were uncertain about the impact of the EWTD on the quality of training. Among the positive changes, better work-life balance and more consultants available out of the daily working hours were listed. Despite the introduction and implementation of the EWTD over two decades ago, the compliance rates across Europe remain low and seem not to have altered in the last ten years. In order to ensure the quality of training and, most importantly patient safety, we suggest that European nations keep striving to implement the EWTD for doctors in training.

Such systems require image understanding, the ability for a computer to understand what the laparoscope sees. Image understanding has recently progressed owing to the emergence of artificial intelligence and especially deep learning techniques. However, the state of the art of deep learning in gynaecology only offers image-based detection, reporting the presence or absence of an anatomical structure, without finding its location. A solution to the localisation problem is given by the concept of semantic segmentation, giving the detection and pixel-level location of a structure in an image. The state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation are achieved by deep learning, whose usage requires a massive amount of annotated data. We propose the first dataset dedicated to this task and the first evaluation of deep learning-based semantic segmentation in gynaecology. We used the deep learning method called Mask R-CNN. Our dataset has 461 laparoscopic images manually annotated with three classes: uterus, ovaries and surgical tools. We split our dataset in 361 images to train Mask R-CNN and 100 images to evaluate its performance. The segmentation accuracy is reported in terms of percentage of overlap between the segmented regions from Mask R-CNN and the manually annotated ones. The accuracy is 84.5%, 29.6% and 54.5% for uterus, ovaries and surgical tools, respectively. An automatic detection of these structures was then inferred from the semantic segmentation results which led to state-of-the-art detection performance, except for the ovaries. Specifically, the detection accuracy is 97%, 24% and 86% for uterus, ovaries and surgical tools, respectively. Our preliminary results are very promising, given the relatively small size of our initial dataset.

Twenty-four residents from all 4 years of residency program were included in the study after their informed consent. The competencies identified were surgical skills, professionalism, communication skills and critical appraisal skills. The reflective exercises evaluation was done on questionnaire designed for this purpose. The results showed that the residents initially had underdeveloped ability to engage into purposeful reflective exercises, which improved with practice and showed encouraging results. Reflective exercises particularly helped in improvement of surgical skills as opposed to other identified competencies. Regular engagement of postgraduate trainees in reflective exercises in a purposeful manner has encouraging results in terms of improvement in surgical, communication, critical appraisal skills and has a role in boosting professionalism among residents.

The aim of this study was to analyse all female patients aged ≤18 years who were referred to a tertiary paediatric hospital for HMB over a 12-month period. Medical records were reviewed to determine if pelvic ultrasonography was ordered during the diagnostic process and whether the imaging altered management. No pelvic ultrasounds ordered for adolescents with HMB altered clinical management. General practitioners (GP) were the most likely to refer patients to the tertiary paediatric hospital and to order pelvic ultrasonography, likely reflecting that most female adolescents are seen by a GP within the community.

Considerable potential opportunities exist in European training and education programmes to bring about improvements. Nonetheless, the most significant disparity stems from the absence of formal education and training opportunities for healthcare professionals, that appears to have an impact and may be a significant factor contributing to the disparities observed in STD care delivery. The health impact of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is frequently underestimated, but if left untreated, these common infections can lead to complications that have a disproportionate long-term impact on the health of women and children. The variation in the availability of educational initiatives and training opportunities on STDs across Europe underscores the necessity for a standardised, evidence-based care model to address disparities and enhance sexual healthcare outcomes.

Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests, and qualitative thematic analysis. A total of 151 trainees and trainers participated in the study. While 61.2% of respondents reported familiarity with the concept of OBE, only 22.4% accurately identified its primary focus on learner goals. Participants highlighted several key benefits of OBE, including the establishment of clearly defined goals and the development of competency in essential skills. However, significant challenges were also identified, such as the perception of unattainable goals for trainees and insufficient training facilities. Additionally, trainer engagement and the lack of allocated time for both trainers and trainees to attend training courses were recognized as major barriers to the successful implementation of OBE. OBE presents a promising educational framework for O&G training, with the potential to modernize and enhance learning outcomes.

All Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology residents in 2017 were eligible to participate in this randomized controlled trial. The study was administered online via REDCap. Interested residents were enrolled, stratified by level of training, and block randomized. Residents completed a survey to determine their management of 4 obstetrical scenarios. The intervention group reviewed an educational module on cost-effective ordering prior to completing the survey; the control group was given the option to review the module afterward. The primary outcome was mean total expenditures, compared between the 2 groups using the t test. Eighty-five residents were enrolled between August and November 2017, and 63 residents from 13 Canadian residency programs completed the study requirements (33 control and 30 intervention).

Many factors (i.e., clinical location, patient volume and medical school didactics) can affect how well the student learns the material needed to succeed on the NBME (National Board of Medical Examiners) exam. The goal of this study was to design and implement a multimodel, resident-run medical student curriculum and evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving Obstetrics and Gynaecology NBME exam scores. This 2-year medical education quality improvement project went from October 2022 to 2024. The length of the curriculum was 6 weeks, and students met with a resident for two 30-min sessions per week. Each session was designed as a case study for students to answer questions and discuss specific patient scenarios. There was also a weekly plan with supplemental resources for students to review beforehand. A total of 55 students had a reported NBME score and were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant increase in mean NBME scores when compared to the mean score from previous years before the implementation of the curriculum. This was consistent across two medical student groups from two different medical schools. This study showed high student satisfaction with the newly implemented curriculum. This may have been due to the multimodel approach and the supplemental material provided for different learning styles. Future studies that are adequately powered and have appropriate controls are needed to better evaluate whether a multimodel approach truly does improve exam performance and to better tease out which specific aspect of the multimodel approach is most helpful.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40963365/"}

This study was a cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire, on the basis of the PAG training in obstetrics and gynecology section of the European Board & College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Project of Achieving Consensus in Training curriculum. We aimed to survey the national programs in 35 European Network of Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ENTOG) member countries. Taking part in the survey was voluntary. The questionnaire was shared on the ENTOG online platforms. Ninety obstetrics and gynecology trainees in 33 of 35 countries responded to our questionnaire. Of the 35 ENTOG member countries, 33 participated in the survey, and a total of 90 responses were collected, giving a response rate of 9% of all European trainees and representing 94% of the member countries. Only 27% of trainees reported having a PAG rotation during their training program, and a PAG elective was only available to 34% of the trainees. Forty-one percent reported that PAG training was not included in their curriculum (no official rotations or lectures planned). Despite the lack of formal training, 72% of trainees felt able to diagnose and manage prepubertal vaginal bleeding and adnexal masses in children and adolescents by the end of their training. Most (58%) also confirmed that they could determine indications for treatment of vulval, vaginal, perineal, and rectal conditions. However, despite scoring positively for the management and counseling of subjects that often overlap with adult patients, such as \"contraception in adolescents with health problems,\" \"acute abdominal pain,\" \"menstrual abnormalities,\" and \"vaginal discharge,\" the study revealed poorer scores when the trainees were asked about more specific PAG topics such as \"premature puberty\" and \"developmental disorders of the genital tract.\" Most core training programs across Europe do not include formal PAG training, and trainees reported a need to improve the provision of core PAG training in Europe.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35691506/"}

A Nigerian Gynaecologist encountered an average of one patient with menopausal symptoms every three months (range: 0-3 patients per month). The commoner symptoms they encountered were hot flushes (88%), insomnia (75.4%), depression (58.0%), irritability (56.3%), night sweats (55.6%) and muscle pains (54.8%) while urinary symptoms (16.7%) and fracture (1.6%) were less common.

A consistently high rate of loss from the specialty of obstetrics and gynaecology has been demonstrated in surveys covering the period 1978 to 1988. Approximately one-quarter of this loss reflects trainees who had never intended to pursue consultant appointment in the specialty in the British Isles, half reflects factors which may improve with the implementation of the recommendations contained in the New Deal and the 'Calman' report, and one-quarter reflects loss for inevitable reasons.

Procedural training however needs to evolve in line with legislated working time restrictions and patient safety concerns. This makes gynecologic procedures ideal for simulation training. To date, no studies have looked at the use of low-fidelity simulation models to teach cervical punch biopsy. A cervical punch biopsy model was created using home and departmental waste products. The simulation model was tested by expert colposcopists and used during a gynecology trainee cervical study day. Twenty-one trainees attended a lecture that showed photographs of normal and abnormal cervices and a workshop where colposcopists demonstrated the technique before direct hands-on training with the simulator. Participants were asked to complete a survey, using a 5-point Likert scale, outlining the educational value of the workshop. Five low-fidelity cervical biopsy simulation models were created, these cost nothing, took an hour to make, and were easily transported. Of the different \"cervix\" materials tested, sponge provided the most realistic traction and the least fragmented biopsies (3-5 mm). Eighteen trainees completed the survey of whom all strongly agreed that learning was enhanced compared with didactics alone. The mean score for the value of the simulation in preparing trainees to perform future cervical biopsies was 4.7 (SD = 0.42) (95% confidence interval, 4.49-4.90). Our low-fidelity cervical biopsy models are easy to make, portable, and low cost.

A blinded multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine the distance (known as the Mahalanobis distance) in the seven indicator multidimensional space that each consultant was from the average consultant in each year. The change in Mahalanobis distance over time was also investigated by using a mixed effects model. NHS hospital trusts in two English regions, in the five years from 1991-2 to 1995-6.

Although our method found other outlier consultants, we strongly caution that these outliers should not be overinterpreted as indicative of \"poor\" performance. Instead, a scientific search for a credible explanation should be undertaken, but this was outside the remit of our study. The set of indicators used means that cancer specialists, for example, are likely to have high values for several indicators, and the approach needs to be refined to deal with case mix variation. Even after allowing for that, the interpretation of outlier status is still as yet unclear.

Of the respondents, 61.8% reported that either they or their partner had had one or more induced abortions; 37.6% stated that they usually used either coitus interruptus or no contraceptive method at all; 51.0% were unwilling to prescribe combined oral contraceptives (COCs) to girls younger than 18 years, and 76.5% advised women against the use of COCs for more than two years. Irrational concerns about the health risks of contraception were identified. The contraceptive needs of women aged 20 + were particularly hampered by the fact that 75.5% of respondents thought that intrauterine device use was unsafe for women with benign, non infectious cervicitis. The results indicate that a significant number of Serbian gynaecologists neither use modern methods of contraception themselves nor have adequate knowledge to advise their patients. Thus, education and training of gynaecologists in all methods of available contraception is a priority in Serbia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18465478/"}

With increasing medical negligence cases being brought against doctors, it is time to carefully consider the implications of such actions to ensure appropriate safeguards (Ferner and McDowell 2006). At a time when the culture of 'no win, no fee' is rampant, the jobbing frontline doctor is on the back-foot trying to untangle the legalities of a malpractice claim (Ferner and McDowell 2006). Reassuringly, the numbers of doctors referred to the GMC or having to face legal procedures or claims for compensation are still very small (National Audit Office 2001). An essential issue for all doctors is having appropriate indemnity cover in the event that their practice is challenged. The opt-out for the European Working Time Regulations (EWTR) has caused further confusion as to what is covered for junior doctors by individual indemnity policies and the employer's liability scheme. Recently, the RCOG Trainees committee and the BMA Junior Doctors Association issued a joint advice regarding this issue (RCOG 2010). In this paper, we consider the differences in cover provided by the employer's liability scheme, individual professional indemnity schemes and the role of professional bodies.

We conducted a mixed-methods multicenter study at gynecologic emergency departments in France and Belgium. A modified Delphi procedure was first conducted in 2014 among health care professionals to define relevant combinations of potentially life-threatening conditions and near misses in the field of gynecologic emergency care. A prospective case-cohort study in the spring of 2015 then assessed the prevalence of these potentially life-threatening emergencies and near misses among women of reproductive age presenting for acute pelvic pain. Women in the case group were identified at 21 participating centers. The control group consisted of a sample of women hospitalized for acute pelvic pain not caused by a potentially life-threatening condition and a 10% random sample of outpatients. Eight gynecologic emergencies and 17 criteria for near misses were identified using the Delphi procedure. Among the 3,825 women who presented for acute pelvic pain, 130 (3%) were considered to have a potentially life-threatening condition. The most common diagnoses were ectopic pregnancies with severe bleeding (n=54; 42%), complex pelvic inflammatory disease (n=30; 23%), adnexal torsion (n=20; 15%), hemorrhagic miscarriage (n=15; 12%), and severe appendicitis (n=6; 5%). The control group comprised 225 hospitalized women and 381 outpatients.

The Calman reforms implemented in 1996 introduced a focussed system with defined competencies and a shorter training period. The previous system was based on experience gained in an apprentice-type setting with no defined duration of training. The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) regulates the number of working hours for junior doctors and aims for a 48-h working week by 2009. In the surgical disciplines a reduction in working hours and shorter duration of training could adversely affect the acquisition of operative skills. The concern among trainees and their trainers was that surgical exposure has been reduced and therefore trainees have limited surgical experience by the time they complete training. We conducted this study in a teaching district hospital to determine the effect of recent changes on gynaecological surgical training. We found that there was a 27% reduction in surgical activity between 1995 and 2005 from 3,789 to 2,781, whereas the number of trainees had increased by 67% from 6 to 10. The proportion of operative procedures performed by trainees decreased from 55% (2,078/3,789) in 1995 to 34% (951/2,781) in 2005 (p < 0.001). The average number of procedures performed by each trainee in 2005 was 95 compared with 346 in 1995, a 73% reduction (p < 0.001).

The generic competency framework was developed through action research. Data were collected by four European stakeholder groups (patients, nurses, midwives and hospital boards), using a variety of methods. Subsequently, the data were analysed further in consensus discussions with European specialists and trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. These discussions ensured that the framework provides guidance, is specialty-specific, and that implementation in all European countries could be feasible. The presented generic competency framework identifies four domains: 'Patient-centred care', 'Teamwork', 'System-based practice' and 'Personal and professional development'.

This data was used to estimate the mean number of urinary diversions performed each year. Gender, primary diagnosis, type of diversion, gynecologic oncologist involvement, and medical center were explored. Of the nearly 21,000 urinary diversions performed in UHC participating hospitals during the study period, 6180 (29.5%) were performed in women. On average, 1648 urinary diversions are performed in women each year, with gynecologic malignancies accounting for 6.8% of cases. We estimate that a gynecologic oncologist was involved with 87 cases per year at nonprofit academic medical centers in the US. With approximately 112 clinically active fellows per year during the study period, this equates to less than one diversion per clinical fellow per year if cases are equally distributed among centers. However, the majority of urinary diversions with gynecologic oncologist involvement were performed at just a fraction of centers. Thus, only a small contingent of fellows may be getting the greatest exposure to urinary diversions. The majority of urinary diversions in women in the US are performed for bladder carcinoma by urologists. The estimated number of cases per clinical gynecologic oncology fellow per year is less than one. Strategies to improve fellow exposure to urinary diversion and consideration of alternative surgical training modalities should be explored.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26556767/"}

The Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Gynecologic Steering Committee evaluated during a 5-month period the storage, use, and maintenance of gynecologic laparoscopic instrument sets used in the surgical suite. Acting on this data, the committee oversaw the following changes. Infrequently used instruments were removed from permanent trays and separately packaged. Two types of gynecologic laparoscopy trays were prepared: one for laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligations and one for both diagnostic and operative laparoscopy. A double-decker compartmentalized tray in which instruments were sterilized and stored replaced the extant single-layer ones in which instruments were stacked on each other. To facilitate instrument identification and function, a surgical manual was compiled with photographs of each instrument and a description of its use. After implementation of these changes, maintenance and sterilization costs for a 10-month period were compared with those for the previous 10 months. There was a savings of $13,889. The ratio of total costs divided by number of cases performed during the two study periods was also compared. There was a savings of $31 per case. Savings were achieved by reorganizing this operating room's handling of reusable gynecologic laparoscopy equipment. By eliminating infrequently used instruments from the permanent trays and by using a double decker compartmentalized tray that was used during surgery, sterilization, and storage, both sterilization costs and maintenance costs were reduced.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9649110/"}

This was a questionnaire survey conducted at the National Obstetric and Gynaecology Specialist Registrar Meeting (SpROGs 2004, Birmingham, UK). A total of 190 trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology attended the meeting. Trainees at the meeting were given a questionnaire to fill in regarding their perception of work-life balance, stress at work and their attitude to training in obstetrics and gynaecology. The response rate was 128/190 (67%). Half of the trainees (64/128, 50%) felt that they had achieved satisfactory work-life balance. There was a trend towards more men achieving this balance compared with women (25/42 (60%) vs 38/83 (46%), p = 0.19). Unsatisfactory social life (82%) and scarce time with the family (74%) were cited as the most common reasons for not achieving a satisfactory work-life balance. More than two-thirds of the trainees (83/128, 65%) found their work moderately or very stressful. Senior trainees (years 4 or more of specialist training) found work more stressful than junior trainees (years 1 - 3 of specialist training) (29/35 (83%) vs 54/93 (58%), p = 0.01). However, 77/128 (60%) of trainees would still recommend a career in obstetrics and gynaecology to medical students. A majority (85/128, 66%) claimed that they would choose obstetrics and gynaecology again if given a second chance. A large number of trainees (110/128, 86%) were looking forward to their future in this field. In spite of the high levels of perceived work-life imbalance and stress at work, most trainees would choose the same specialty given another chance and would recommend the same to others, indicating a certain level of satisfaction with the specialty.

Redeployment of staff and restrictions in elective services raised training concerns. We sought to assess the impact on subspecialty training, to identify issues to help mitigate the impact. We conducted cross-sectional anonymous electronic surveys of UK subspecialty trainees at three time points: June 2020, February 2021, September 2021. Surveys were analysed by descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text responses. Response rates ranged from 30% to 40%, with higher response rates from urogynaecology trainees. Up to 72% reported an impact on training, most notable in gynaecological subspecialties, and particularly urogynaecology, which persisted over time. More than a third anticipated needing extra time to complete training. This raises serious future workforce and patient care concerns. Clinical recovery should consider training needs as essential when re-establishing services. Subspecialty trainees may need additional time to achieve competencies required of future consultants.IMPACT STATEMENT<b>What is already known on the subject?</b> Covid-19 led to dramatic changes in clinical practice in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Previous studies on training in O and G during the pandemic in the UK and internationally highlighted issues from redeployment, trainee absence, and changes in service provision, that had potential to severely impact training.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> Subspecialty training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology has been affected by the pandemic. Urogynaecology was worst affected and continues to be affected over the course of the pandemic.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Covid-19 recovery plans need to incorporate training requirements.

ObGyns significantly impact societal health through their care for pregnant women, fetuses, and newborns, uniquely positioning them to advocate for health initiatives with lasting societal benefits. Despite its importance, the history of medicine is underrepresented in medical curricula, missing opportunities to foster critical thinking and ethical decision-making. In today's climate of threatened reproductive rights, vaccine misinformation, and harmful ideologies, it is imperative for ObGyns to champion comprehensive historical education. The history of medicine, particularly in relation to societal issues - such as racism, discrimination, genocides, pandemics, and wars - provides valuable context for addressing challenges like maternal mortality, reproductive rights, vaccine hesitancy, and ethical issues. Understanding historical milestones and notable ethical breaches, such as the Tuskegee Study and the thalidomide tragedy, informs better practices and safeguards patient rights. Technological advancements in hygiene, antibiotics, vaccines, and prenatal care have revolutionized the field, yet contemporary ObGyns must remain vigilant about lessons learned from past challenges and successes. Integrating historical knowledge into medical training enhances clinical proficiency and ethical responsibility, fostering innovation and improving health outcomes. By reflecting on historical achievements and their impacts, current and future ObGyns can advance the field, ensuring comprehensive and ethically sound approaches to patient care.

This study was conducted to assess the current state of laparoscopy, to identify factors influencing the implementation and to find solutions toward a better implementation. In 2003 a questionnaire was sent to all 151 gynecologists who finished residency within the previous 5 years. The questionnaire addressed practice demographics, performance of laparoscopy, factors influencing use of laparoscopy in practice and means of obtaining laparoscopic skills after residency. Of 151 gynecologists, 124 (82%) responded, 46 (37%) male and 78 (63%) female. Mean age was 39 years (range 32-47 years). Respondents (73%) believed they were adequately trained during residency for basic laparoscopic procedures, but not for the more advanced procedures (82%). Lack of caseload, lack of being a primary surgeon, and lack of simulator training caused the deficiency of laparoscopic skills at the end of the residency. Causes of the slow implementation were long operating time, lack of attention for laparoscopy during residency, and budgetary problems, but not the financial compensation for gynecologists. In current practice, only 9% believed they reached their preferred level of competence. Hiring an advanced laparoscopic gynecologist was believed to be the best opportunity to reach the preferred level of competence. A minority of respondents supported a referral system or fellowship program. Basic laparoscopy is sufficiently mastered during residency training; however, advanced laparoscopy is not. More emphasis should be placed on laparoscopic training of advanced procedures during residency and for gynecologists in practice. Hiring a gynecologist with advanced laparoscopic skills is expected to be the solution for this problem. However, a referral system or fellowship program is not.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16431316/"}

Therefore, we sought to explore the potential association between the degree of IP characteristics, EI and teaching ability in obstetrics and gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) faculty physicians. A cross-sectional, survey-based pilot study was completed at a single academic institution. Ob/Gyn attending (faculty) physicians were queried using surveys related to IP, EI and teaching ability. Resident (trainee) physicians also completed anonymous evaluations of faculty teaching ability. The degree of IP characteristics correlated negatively with self-perceived teaching ability, with no significant differences in resident assessment of faculty teaching. IP also correlated negatively with EI. Although there were no statistically significant differences in resident assessment of teaching ability based on EI, both EI and IP demonstrated inverse relationships to faculty assessment of teaching ability compared with resident assessment. IP appears to relate to lower perceived teaching ability in Ob/Gyn faculty that does not correspond to resident evaluation of teaching performance. The demonstrated negative correlation between the degree of impostor characteristics and EI suggests that EI could potentially play a protective role in the development of IP and burnout, as well as influence teaching. This relationship may have implications for faculty willingness to continue in academic medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37665024/"}

Assessment may test student learning but its role in learning itself is rarely recognised. We undertook this study to assess medical and midwifery student learning through a simulation program using a pre-test and post-test design and also to evaluate use of assessment as a method of learning. The interprofessional simulation education program consisted of a brief pre-reading document, a lecture, a video demonstration and a hands-on workshop. Over a 24-month period, 405 medical and 104 midwifery students participated in the study and were assessed before and after the program. Numerical data were analysed using paired t-test and one-way analysis of variance. Students' perceptions of the role of assessment in learning were qualitatively analysed. The post-test scores were significantly higher than the pre-test (P < 0.001) with improvements in scores in both medical and midwifery groups. Students described the benefit of assessment on learning in preparation of the assessment, reinforcement of learning occurring during assessment and reflection on performance cementing previous learning as a post-assessment effect. Both medical and midwifery students demonstrated a significant improvement in their test scores and for most students the examination process itself was a positive learning experience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656616/"}

Male students who had not experienced sexual intercourse felt less able to perform a speculum examination, to do a Papanicolaou smear or be able to detect an abnormality. There were no gender differences between the preferred methods of learning to conduct a gynecological examination but non-sexually experienced students ranked higher the examination of a woman under anesthesia. The suggestion of student volunteers was more acceptable to sexually experienced women and non-sexually experienced male students. Students varied in their response to being volunteers for students learning to conduct vaginal or rectal (if male) examinations.

Problem-based learning (PBL) was chosen as the central educational method throughout the 5 years. A thematic interdisciplinary style provided a framework around which to select and integrate content. The theme for family, reproductive and child health for the 14-week Families and Children Module (FCM) in year 4 integrated content from obstetrics-gynaecology, paediatrics (including child psychiatry), genetics and public health. This paper focuses on the FCM which has put to test some of the principles of integration. The educational process and outcome of the FCM was evaluated with information from (1) Open Forum feedback sessions (2) student questionnaires and (3) students' performance in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Significant problems were encountered during the first year of the FCM (1997--98). An Open Forum for all students and staff was convened after each module in order to address the level of concern. Students' responses to questionnaires reflected the overall impression obtained from the Open Forum. Difficulties appeared to be more than the anxieties and challenges inherent in organisational change and were not simple practical timetabling problems. Tutors perceived a loss of coherence and student contact; students reported difficulties maintaining sufficient continuity of focus in clinical and academic learning experiences. The intended level of integration of paediatrics and obstetrics-gynaecology was unmanageable. Consequently, the FCM (1998-99) was divided into separate attachments for clinical learning and experience in paediatrics and obstetrics-gynaecology, each of 7 weeks' duration. Further open feedback sessions revealed that the modifications implemented in 1998-99 were associated with positive experiences for students and tutors. Comparison of responses to the evaluation questionnaires showed that students' overall rating of the module was higher (P=0.002) for 1998-99 (mean 3.4, SD 0.9) than for 1997-98 (mean 3.0, SD 1.1).

Thus, the purpose of this review is to introduce the surgeon to a variety of commercially available mesh materials and the characteristics that make mesh suitable for use as sling grafts. Type I macroporous mesh materials appear most suitable for transvaginal implantation. Utilization of these materials in a minimally invasive retropubic or transobturator approach, promising early and intermediate follow-up data has been achieved. The outcome of these procedures in women with urethral hypermobility and genuine stress incontinence seems clear. No controlled data, however, exist to define the role of these procedures in difficult cases of stress incontinence.

Knot strength (N); proportion of knots that were 'secure' (defined as those that eventually failed on the testing device by breakage rather than slippage); proportion of knots that were 'dangerous' (defined as those with a tensile strength of < 5 N). After tuition, the median knot strength of the whole group was 5.7 N stronger than before instruction (95% CI 4.6-12.3 N). Prior to tuition 13.5% (20/148) knots tied had a tensile strength of < 5 N. This was compared with 3.4% (5/148) after tuition (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Before instruction 55.4% (82/148) of the knots were secure compared with 66.9% (99/148) after tuition (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.7). Knot tying workshops can improve the ability of trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology to tie reef knots.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11702829/"}

A recent study found that many obstetrics and gynecology (ObGyn) practicing physicians are unaware of the Rotterdam criteria recommended for diagnosis. Our objective was to identify gaps in trainee knowledge of PCOS diagnostic criteria and management. An online survey was sent out to US ObGyn physicians-in-training in 2018. The primary outcomes were identification of at least one component of each Rotterdam criteria (Rot-3): (1) oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, (2) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and (3) ovarian volume or antral follicle count, and identification of all five components (Rot-5). Secondary outcomes were identification of comorbidities and management of PCOS. Multivariable logistic regression was used controlling for gender, seniority (PGY) status, program type, completion of an REI rotation, and number of PCOS patients seen. 85.4% of 347 trainees completing the survey reported using Rotterdam criteria to diagnose PCOS. However, only 55% identified Rot-3 and less than 10% identified Rot-5. Seniority (PGY4 OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-4.1; <i>p</i> = .01) and completion of REI rotation (OR 1.8 95% CI: 1.2, 1.8; <i>p</i> = .006) were associated with identifying Rot-3. Similar findings were noted with identifying Rot-5. Our study identified significant gaps in knowledge regarding PCOS, suggesting an urgent need for improving strategies for trainee education to increase patient satisfaction and provide comprehensive care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32252571/"}

The pan-European curriculum for training in obstetrics and gynecology PACT (Project for Achieving Consensus in Training) incorporates medical simulation and recommends its urgent implementation in the national residency programs of individual countries. The current Covid-19 pandemic presents challenges to the medical community. During the first wave of the pandemic, Italy was the most severely affected EU country, whereas during the second wave Slovenia was among those most affected. The severe limitations of the lockdown and post-lockdown led to significant changes in all healthcare organizations and, consequently, also training activities in obstetrics and gynecology. Limitations on training during the Covid-19 pandemic may have severely impacted the opportunity to learn basic clinical and surgical skills. A potential strategy for overcoming these limitations was offered by simulation activities, which allowed trainees to receive basic training in our discipline and prevented an additional \"lockdown\" of their learning and development of skills. This type of simulation training will be of paramount importance, considering the paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in lifestyle and healthcare activities.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ACOG: American college of obstetricians and gynecologists; EBCOG: European board and college of obstetrics and gynaecology; ICU: intensive care unit; OR: operating room; PACT: project for achieving consensus in training; PUI: patient under investigation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34651559/"}

Progestogens may be effective in treating vasomotor symptoms. A variety of agents are available for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and all except parathyroid hormone and strontium ranelate act mainly by inhibiting bone resorption. There is little scientific evidence that complementary and alternative therapies can help menopausal symptoms or conserve bone mass and there are no safety data in women with gynaecological cancer.

It carries with it both short- and long-term sequelae for women that can affect both their physical and psychological wellbeing. Every day obstetric providers treat patients who have been assaulted. Timely identification can interrupt the cycle of violence, prevent further injury and initiate the help-seeking process. The objectives of this study were to survey how often Nigerian obstetrician-gynaecologists see these patients in their practice and to describe the demographics and management of their most recent case so as to give an idea of the extent of the problem. This is especially important as abuse is grossly under-reported because the victims are afraid to report it because of male dominance in society and the fear of losing their homes. We used a self-administered questionnaire survey of 138 practising obstetricians and gynaecologists in Nigeria. Questions were asked about the yearly estimation of cases seen and how recently a case was seen. The type of abuse, risk factors and management of their most recent case was also documented. Most (98.6%) obstetricians surveyed had previously managed a case of violence. The mean estimate of abused women seen was 7.0 per year. Details of the last case managed were recollected by 91.3% of respondents. The majority (51.6%) of patients were pregnant. The assailant was the husband in 69.8% of cases and the most common factor for abuse was as a result of women requesting money for the family needs from their husbands. The most common type of abuse was physical (79.4%), with 34.9% of patients sustaining cuts. Treatment and counselling were the forms of management in most cases. The police were informed in 9.5% of cases and one obstetrician had to give evidence in court. Of the pregnant abused women, 73.8% had live births. Better job opportunities and female empowerment can reduce the risk of violence. Obstetricians should screen routinely for battery, provide education about violence, assess the danger, review safety plans and refer women appropriately. We cannot solve the problem alone, but sensitivity and commitment can begin to make a difference.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14675983/"}

Economic evaluation is a commonly used tool to compare health-care services and treatments on the basis of costs and benefits. However, the principles on which economic evaluations are based are not well understood, and guidelines for conducting such evaluations in practice are often not followed. This paper describes the overarching principle of opportunity cost, and highlights the implication that decision-making in health care should necessarily be based on both costs and benefits. Two notions of efficiency, technical and allocative, are also presented, and the important point is made that the specific type of economic evaluation chosen must be based not on the unit of benefit in the given study, as is commonly done, but rather on the type of efficiency being addressed. The 3 primary types of economic evaluation are outlined, and a common pitfall in economic evaluation, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, is critiqued. Finally, a number of methodological considerations when conducting economic evaluations in practice are presented.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12610674/"}

Programmes aimed at enhancing physician resilience are heterogeneous and use varied targets to measure efficacy, because there is a lack of clarity regarding this concept. A more robust understanding of how resilience is manifested could enhance efforts to create and measure it in physicians in training. A qualitative study used grounded theory methodology to analyse semi-structured interviews with a purposive, intensity sample of obstetrics and gynaecology residents in an urban academic health centre. Longitudinal engagement through two sets of interviews 3-6 months apart allowed for variations in season and context. Thematic saturation was achieved after enrollment of 18 residents representing all 4 years of postgraduate training. A three-phase coding process used constant comparison, reflective memos and member checking to support the credibility of the analysis. A conceptual model for resilience as a socio-ecological phenomenon emerged. Resilience was linked to professional identity and purpose served to root the individual and provide a base of support through adversity. Connections to others inside and outside medicine were essential to support developing resilience, as was finding meaning in experiences. The surrounding personal and professional environments had strong influences on the ability of individuals to develop personal resilience. Physician resilience in this context emerged as a developmental phenomenon, influenced by individual response to adversity as well as surrounding culture. This suggests that both programmes teaching individual skills as well as systematic and cultural interventions could improve a physician's capacity to thrive.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30328135/"}

While much has been written about the reliability of the OSCE, empirical work on the determination of the passing score which represents competence on the OSCE is rarely encountered. If the OSCE is to play its role in the 'high stakes' testing of clinical competence, it is important that this passing score be set reliably and defensibly. This article illustrates how a two-session modified Angoff standard-setting procedure is used to set the passing score on a 14 station Obstetrics and Gynaecology OSCE used to assess final year students at The Queen's University of Belfast. The Angoff methodology harnesses the professional judgement of expert judges to establish defensible standards. Four university teachers, five non-academic consultants and six junior clinical staff took part in a two-session Angoff standard-setting procedure. In the first session, the judges (individually and in silence) used their professional judgement to estimate the score which a minimally competent final year obstetrics and gynaecology student should achieve on each tested element of the OSCE. In the second session they revised their session 1 judgements in the light of the OSCE scores of real students and the opportunity for structured discussion. The passing score for the OSCE is reported together with the statistical measures which assure its reliability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8949473/"}

Descriptive thematic analysis using the constant comparative method of grounded theory was performed on each transcript by two independent investigators. Codes were applied to each sentence of the transcript to identify the main idea in the text segment. Once coding was complete the investigators looked for relationships among codes to define themes. Data collection continued until a saturation of themes was reached. Fifteen participants from across Canada completed the study. The most significant challenges surrounding parental leave during residency included breastfeeding, difficulty on return to work (skill loss, time management, examination preparation), and work-life balance. The major supports noted included family, colleagues and mentors, adequate childcare, and program flexibility surrounding the leave. Participants' suggestions for alleviating the stressors included a gradual return to work and careful planning surrounding returning rotation. Trainees identified formal program supports, non-surgical or core initial rotation back, and a gradual return to work as important areas to address in policies surrounding resident parental leave during Canadian obstetrics and gynaecology training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30473122/"}

These challenges include the maintenance of excellence in research, commercial potential and clinical innovation, as well as the maintenance of adequate human resources, new standards for patient orientation and individualised medicine. Based on a SWOT analysis of the status quo, of local and national quality data, a search regarding national conceptions and of international best practice for women's health centres, the model of a Department of Women's Health was developed. The Department, consisting of a University Hospital and a Research Institute, should interlink clinical care and science. With the establishment of the department, a pool of expertise is achieved which encompasses gynaecology and obstetrics from basic care to the high-technology segments, as well as all the scientific areas relevant to the medical discipline and women's health, including health services research. Preservation and attraction of personnel resources are based on the department's excellence, on reliable perspectives and the flexibility of job profiles, which also result from the close connection between care and research and the expansion of perspectives on women's health. Methodological diversity and inter-professionalism build the appropriate base for the further development of research fields. At the same time, the Department creates space for the consolidation of the core areas and the integration of sub-disciplines (clinical and scientific) to maintain the unity of this discipline. Via the scientific monitoring of the implementation, suitable elements can be highlighted for transfer to other facilities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25135379/"}

Currently, there is no standardized laparoscopic training program available for gynecology residents. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a comprehensive ex vivo training curriculum for gynecologic laparoscopy. In a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force Classification I) postgraduate year 1 and 2 gynecology residents were allocated randomly to receive either conventional residency training or an evidence-based laparoscopy curriculum. The 7-week curriculum consisted of cognitive didactic and interactive sessions, low-fidelity box trainer and high-fidelity virtual reality simulator technical skills, and high-fidelity team simulation. The primary outcome measure was the technical procedure score at laparoscopic salpingectomy with the use of the objective structured assessment of laparoscopic salpingectomy tool. Secondary outcome measures related to performance in multiple-choice questions and technical performance at box trainer and virtual reality simulator tasks. A sample size of 10 residents per group was planned (n = 20). Results are reported as medians (interquartile ranges), and data were compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests (P ≤ .05). In July 2013, 27 residents were assigned randomly (14 curriculum, 13 conventional). Both groups were similar at baseline. Twenty-one residents (10 curriculum, 11 conventional) completed the surgical procedure-based assessment in the operating room (September to December 2013). Our primary outcome indicated that curriculum-trained residents displayed superior performance at laparoscopic salpingectomy (P = .043). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that curriculum-trained residents had higher performance scores on the cognitive multiple-choice questions (P < .001), the nontechnical skills multiple-choice questions (P = .016), box trainer task time (P < .001), and all virtual reality simulator parameters.

Documents were assessed for the inclusion of predefined key words or topics, including sex-specific pronoun usage, insurance, fertility regulation, government regulation/laws, documentation burden, malpractice, race, medicine as \"art\" or medicine as \"science,\" and others. Data were extracted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Changing pronoun usage was evident across both texts. From 1941 through 1950, physicians were referred to as male 19 times and as female once. The ratio of male-to-female pronoun usage equalized in the 1990s. Medicine increasingly was referred to as a science rather than as an art within the last 2 decades. From the 1970s onward, emerging physician concerns, including malpractice, documentation burden, regulation, and insurance, were mentioned increasingly. The first mention of governmental regulation and evidence-based medicine occurred in the 21st century. Since 1903, race was never mentioned and \"change\" and \"improvement\" were cited almost universally. The increase in female pronoun usage reflects the expanding role of women in medicine.

Data collection, controlling and analysis were performed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH). A total of 422 participants took part in the survey, of which 375 (88.9%) were female, 46 (10.9%) were male, and one (0.2%) was divers. The diverse participant was excluded from further analyses. The gender distribution was comparable in all three countries. Multiple regression analyses showed that gender is an independent variable significantly impacting on the confidence levels in performing standard gynaecological (p = 0.03) and obstetric (p < 0.001) procedures. Similarly, the feeling of confidence in being prepared for working as a specialist in a clinic showed to be gender-dependent (p < 0.001), however, not the feeling of being prepared for working as specialist in an outpatient setting (p = 0.37). The \"female factor\" significantly decreases the confidence rating for surgical and practical skills and for working in a hospital. Covariates including year of training, country, workload, receiving regular feedback, and implemented simulation training were included in all analyses.

Additionally, the postgraduate training curricula in obstetrics and gynecology show some similarities. We aimed to compare self-perceived level of ability, availability of simulation training and teaching and feedback culture among residents in obstetrics and gynecology in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. The focus was on Switzerland to gain a better understanding of strengths and room for improvement. With a cross-sectional design, a web-based survey with 30 questions was distributed to obstetrics and gynecology residents in the three countries in August and September 2020. The primary outcome was the self-perception of skills in between-country comparisons of mid-training trainees, i.e., omitting trainees in their first year as well as very advanced trainees and specialists. The secondary outcomes were reported teaching, simulation training and feedback culture. German and Austrian responses were calculated together and compared with the Swiss replies. A total of 422 participants took part in the survey, 27.5% (n = 116) of whom were from Switzerland, corresponding to a questionnaire response rate of approximately 19%. 48% of Swiss trainees were in training years 2-5. 57% of Swiss participants felt confident in obstetric procedures and 69% in gynecological procedures, compared to 52% and 68% of non-Swiss participants (p = 0.005 and p = 0.176, respectively). Swiss participants felt significantly more confident in performing gynecological than obstetric procedures (p = 0.015). A total of 63% of the Swiss participants had obstetric simulation training, and 28% had gynecological simulation training compared to 37% and 17% in Germany and Austria, respectively (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007). 56% of Swiss participants reported \"sufficient structured teaching\", 43% reported a \"good teaching culture\", 47% of Swiss participants stated that they received regular feedback. The majority of trainees in Switzerland feel confident in a range of procedures and interventions. Simulation training is relatively widespread, although in particular surgical simulation training should be expanded. Clinical teaching and feedback culture should be strengthened. \"Teach the teacher\" courses should be encouraged to promote a sustainable feedback culture.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39797943/"}

However, a medical test can influence the health of patients through other mechanisms as well, like giving reassurance. To make a clinical recommendation about a medical test, we should be aware of the full range of effects of that test on patients. This requires an understanding of the range of effects that medical testing can have on patients. This study evaluates the mechanisms through which medical testing can influence patients' health, other than the effect on clinical management, from a gynecologist's perspective. A qualitative study in which explorative focus groups were conducted with gynecologists, gynecological residents and gynecological M.D. researchers (n = 43). Discussions were transcribed verbatim. Transcriptions were coded inductively and analyzed by three researchers. All participants contributed various clinical examples in which medical testing had influenced patients' health. Clinical examples illustrated that testing, in itself or in interaction with contextual factors, may provoke a wide range of effects on patients. Our data showed that testing can influence the doctor's perceptions of the patients' appraisal of their illness, their perceived control, or the doctor-patient relationship. This may lead to changes in psychological, behavioral, and/or medical outcomes, both favorably or unfavorably. The data were used to construct a conceptual framework of effects of medical testing on patients. Besides supporting clinical decision making, medical testing may have favorable or unfavorable effects on patients' health though several mechanisms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24106969/"}

With the new-generation 3D high-definition laparoscopic vision systems (LVSs), operation time and learning period are reduced and procedural error margin is decreased. New-generation 3D high-definition LVSs enable to reduce operation time both for novice and experienced surgeons. Headache, eye fatigue or nausea reported with first-generation systems are not different than two-dimensional (2D) LVSs. The system's being more expensive, having the obligation to wear glasses, big and heavy camera probe in some of the devices are accounted for negative aspects of the system that need to be improved. Depth loss in tissues in 2D LVSs and associated adverse events can be eliminated with 3D high-definition LVSs. By virtue of faster learning curve, shorter operation time, reduced error margin and lack of side-effects reported by surgeons with first-generation systems, 3D LVSs seem to be a strong competition to classical laparoscopic imaging systems.

This paper argues that comparative pelvic anatomy studies originated from the belief that African and Black women had specifically different pelves and genitalia and served to stratify women of different races and promoted racially oriented obstetric and gynaecological treatments. Despite their European origins, these French publications had profound repercussions across various regions of the Atlantic world and directly influenced the medical care provided to women of African descent in both slave and postemancipation societies, particularly in Brazil. In 1887, a doctoral candidate from the Rio de Janeiro Medical School (Brazil) wrote a dissertation in which he advocated and justified the racialised treatments offered to enslaved, free and soon-to-be-free women of African descendent who delivered their offspring at the medical school's maternity ward. In his advocacy for such practices, the author drew connections between the prevailing methods at Rio de Janeiro's Medical School to a long lineage of French medical thought on the racialised comparative anatomy of women's pelvises throughout the 19th century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39863416/"}

In addition, generational changes have contributed to increasing subspecialization, more desiring part-time employment, and earlier retirement. This article reviews data regarding changes in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Residency education is focusing more on a core curriculum in general obstetrics and gynecology, while subspecialty fellowship training has grown in popularity. There are no recent data to describe whether OB-GYNs are working fewer hours, yet more are employed in larger practices at mostly metropolitan locations. A team-based care model that incorporates nonphysician clinicians and digital conversion of clinical data has been encouraged to increase accessibility, improve comprehensiveness, commit to more continuity of care, and reduce redundancy. Compared with other medical specialists, OB-GYNs retire slightly earlier, especially females who will represent the field more. The specialty is moving toward a more comprehensive women's health care practice model that is more patient-centered, efficient, cost controlling, team-based, and adaptable to the needs of a diverse population. Implications from these changes for our practices and improving patient care are currently unclear and await more reported experience.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26819135/"}

Randomized controlled trial. Urban tertiary care academic obstetrics and gynecology department. First- and second-year gynecology residents. Access to an education video on LSO for 1 week before performing this surgery in the operating room. Twenty-four junior residents were recruited and randomized to either the educational video group or traditional residency training group. All participants completed a demographic survey and knowledge questionnaire before performing an LSO, which was video-recorded. Video recordings of surgical performance were analyzed using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS; 20 points) and an LSO-specific tool (30 points). Participants completed a self-assessment questionnaire before completing the procedure. The primary outcome measure was the difference in OSATS scores. The secondary outcomes were the knowledge questionnaire scores and self-assessed confidence scores. There were no significant differences between demographic variables of the 2 groups. The primary outcome revealed no significant differences in mean (standard deviation) OSATS scores (10.64 [2.05] vs 11.55 [1.85], p = .3) or LSO-specific tool scores (16.45 [2.68] vs 17.85 [2.63], p = .24). However, there was a significant difference in mean knowledge scores between the video and the traditional training (8.42 [0.79] vs 7.11 [1.36], p = .01) groups. In addition, residents in the video group had more confidence in their knowledge of pelvic anatomy (3.83 [0.39] vs 3.00 [1.00] out of 5.00, p = .04).

Veterinarians are held responsible for the consequences of insufficient clinical examinations of female animals or, after a correct diagnosis, initiation of therapeutic measures that ar not indicated. An increasing number of damage claims is due to the fact that the veterinarian has not informed the owner of an animal in advance about the possible medical or economic risks of a particular treatment. From the expert opinions requested of our clinic by insurance companies and law courts, it can be concluded that in veterinary obstetrics, lesions and damages occurring during vaginal deliveries are still the most frequent cause of compensation claims. Veterinarians are blamed for the use of too much traction force (number of persons assisting in an extraction, use of mechanical calf-pullers) and for incorrect procedures during the manual or instrumental correction of postural or positional abnormalities or a uterine torsion. Also, in case of complications after obstetrical surgery owners suspect failure of the veterinarian. Many losses in the puerperal period are due to the fact that the clinical examination after an obstetrical intervention has not been performed with the necessary accuracy or has been completely omitted. Compensation claims after gynaecological procedures are mostly based on a falsely positive or negative pregnancy diagnosis and complications after surgery involving the ovaries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1559461/"}

Conservative measures were tried by 43 patients (45.3%) and documentation of risk factors varied between 70% for failure and intermittent catheterisation and 1% for laparotomy and dyspareunia. Compliance was significantly better and more consent was obtained by senior medical staff when insertions were carried out by gynaecologists than when they were carried out by urologists. All insertions were carried out by consultants or under their direct supervision. The audit highlighted the need to ensure that conservative measures are tried before resorting to this minimally invasive technique and that proper patient counselling is documented on the consent form.

Interviews explored contextual factors of the first pelvic examination, including visit acuity and clinical setting and individuals' experiences with the pelvic examination itself and elicited recommendations on how to improve the examination experience. Interviews were transcribed and computer-assisted content analysis was performed; salient themes are presented. Thirty participants completed interviews. Nineteen participants described their first pelvic examination experience as positive; 11 described this examination as a negative or neutral experience. Factors influencing the experience include the examination indication and acuity, examination location and physical space, provider features, relational and interpersonal features, and procedural aspects. Recommendations included: (1) establish rapport and educate before the examination; (2) establish practices to orient patients; (3) make no assumptions about identity; and (4) elicit continuous feedback. Individuals' first pelvic examination experiences are influenced by a variety of factors. Although some factors are directly modifiable by providers, other factors that might not be modifiable are important to elicit to optimize the examination experience.

We sought to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of telemedicine in Obstetrics and Gynaecology during this period. We conducted a retrospective and prospective analysis of the messages from the WhatsApp consults for demographic characteristics, type and classification of condition, level of urgency, ability to make a diagnosis and the type of recommendation offered. A follow-up message was used to assess effectiveness of the medical advice given and patient satisfaction. Of 109 women who used telemedicine 67consented. The average age was 31 years and most of the women were married, had university or tertiary college education and were urban dwellers. Forty-nine (73.1%) cases were Gynaecological consults and 51 (76.1%) were elective cases. Twenty (29.9%) and fourteen (20.8%) cases needed elective and urgent hospital referral respectively. A diagnosis was made in 33(49.3%) of the cases from the available information during the consult. Thirty-five (52.2%) cases had recovered whilst 27(40.3%) cases were still waiting further assessments at the end of the follow up. The patients were satisfied with the service in 94% of the cases.

As a group, these 'end-users' report utilizing databases to keep abreast of medical progress, to conduct research and to address specific patient care issues. Throughout the literature, medical professionals ('content experts') have proved to be less effective searchers than librarians ('search experts'). The potential implications of this discrepancy are worrysome. For any given clinical scenario, for example, published reports may reach contradictory conclusions. A poorly skilled searcher may not retrieve enough articles to appreciate this fact. Optimizing searching skills is therefore a worthwhile goal. As a first step, many medical schools introduce students to on-line databases, most notably MEDLINE. Residency is an ideal time to continue this training. A recognized obstacle to provide residents with formal MEDLINE instruction is time constraint. We therefore conducted this study to ascertain the impact an individual 1-hour tutorial session would have on MEDLINE utilization among obstetrics and gynecology residents training at an academic medical centre. Outcome measures included MEDLINE search frequency, duration, recall, precision and searcher satisfaction. Search recall measures the searcher's ability to retrieve articles deemed relevant to the question at hand. Search precision gauges the searchers' ability to eliminate irrelevant articles. Although the sessions were well received, we were unable to demonstrate an improvement in the outcome measures analysed. Further research is therefore indicated so that cost-effective educational strategies can be recommended for wide-scale use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9743780/"}

Four a priori identified major foci were explored in a half-day virtual consensus conference. Participants included representatives from various countries and disciplines with diverse backgrounds-clinicians, physician-scientists, and basic scientists in the fields of urogynecology, biomechanical engineering, and molecular biology. Following a keynote address, each focus area was first tackled by a dedicated breakout group, led by the Chair(s) of the most relevant IUGA committees. The break-out sessions were followed by an iterative discussion among all attendees to identify mitigating strategies to address the shortage of mechanistic researchers in the field of female pelvic medicine. The major focus areas included: research priorities for IUGA basic science scholar program; viable strategies for sustainable basic science mentorship; core competencies in basic science training; and the challenges of conducting complex mechanistic experiments in low-resource countries. Key gaps in knowledge and core competencies that should be incorporated into fellowship/graduate training were identified, and existing training modalities were discussed. Recommendations were made for pragmatic approaches to increasing the exposure of trainees to learning tools to enable sustainable training of the next generation of basic science researchers in female pelvic medicine worldwide. The attendees presented multiple perspectives to gain consensus regarding critical areas of need for training future generations of mechanistic researchers. Recommendations for a sustainable Basic Science Scholar Program were developed using IUGA as a platform. The overarching goal of such a program is to ensure a successful bench-to-bedside-and-back circuit in Urogynecology and Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery, ultimately improving lives of millions of women worldwide through scientifically rational effective preventative and therapeutic interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38523162/"}

In the 1860s, ovariectomy became the 'key operation' in supervening traditional boundaries. The increasing safety of surgical intervention soon led to unspecifically indicated operations on normal organs within the female abdomen, aiming at curing 'typically female mental abnormalities', i.e. a kind of psychosurgery. This is still occasionally found today. The operative management of normal situations has even increased in gynaecology (hysterectomy) and obstetrics (caesarean section) in the 1970s and 1980s. Traditional medical ethos has therefore not been able to prevent it. Another new field, plastic and aesthetic surgery, had its specific ethical problems, which were well recognised as early as 1900. Because of the relative frequency of goitres and their operative treatment, after 1883 women came to the fore of the concepts of internal secretion, organ transplantation, and physiological surgery. In view of cultural and gender history, socio-cultural factors have been at least as decisive as medico-scientific 'facts' for the frequency of some of the operations performed on women. These operations have, in turn, accelerated the progress in surgery and medicine in general.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10629383/"}

The message of the Oath, as it related to obstetrics and gynecology, is expressed in ancient Greek by the phrase \"οὐδὲ γυναικὶ πεσσὸν φθόριον δώσω\" which translates directly to \"I will not give to any woman a harming pessary.\" The words fetus and abortion were not present in the original Greek text of the Oath. Yet, this message of the Hippocratic Oath has been interpreted often as a prohibition against abortion. In this article, we present a critical linguistic and historical analysis and argue against the notion that the Hippocratic Oath was prohibiting abortion. We provide evidence that the words \"foetum\" (fetus) and \"abortu\" (abortion) were inserted in the Latin translations of the Oath, which then carried on in subsequent English versions. The addition of the words \"fetus\" and \"abortion\" in the Latin translations significantly altered the Oath's original meaning. Unfortunately, these alterations in the translation of the Hippocratic Oath have been accepted over the years because of cultural, religious, and social reasons. We assert that because the original Hippocratic Oath did not contain language related to abortion, it should not be construed as prohibiting it. The interpretation of the Oath should be based on precise and rigorous translation and speculative interpretations should be avoided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38413328/"}

A survey questionnaire was initially sent out to representatives of the 28 member national societies of AOFOG in 2015, and final verification and compilation of data were completed in November 2017. A response was received from 24 countries. Artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization treatments were available in 23 and 22 of them respectively. Of the 23 responding countries where ART activities were carried out, these were governed by legislation or national regulations in 12 of them, and 15 had a national registry, to which reporting was compulsory in 11 of them. Only Australia, Nepal, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia allowed ART treatment for both single men and women, while only Australia and New Zealand allowed ART treatment for homosexual couples. In Vietnam, ART treatment was allowed only for single women (but not men) from the same country. In Israel, only single or homosexual women but not men were allowed to receive ART treatment. Government subsidy was available for artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization treatments in 10 and 9 responding countries respectively. Compensation to gamete donors and surrogate mothers were allowed in some countries, mostly on the basis of covering the medical treatment cost and compensation for leave from work. There is great diversity in the availability of various forms of ART treatments, their regulations and data-monitoring mechanisms, as well as funding issues, among Asian-Oceanic countries. Availability of ART activities involving donor gametes or surrogacy, or those for nonheterosexual unions, is still limited in this region.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30058253/"}

We assessed inter- and intra-rater reliability and agreement using a two-way mixed-effects intra-class correlation (ICC). We also performed a generalised linear mixed model to evaluate factors associated triage correctness. Triage acuity. We obtained a total of 1191 evaluations. Inter-rater reliability was good (ICC 0.748; 95% CI 0.633-0.858) and intra-rater reliability was almost perfect (ICC 0.812; 95% CI 0.726-0.889). We observed a wide variability: the mean number of questions varied from 6.9 to 18.9 across individuals and from 8.4 to 16.9 across vignettes. Triage acuity was underestimated in 12.4% of cases and overestimated in 9.3%. Undertriage occurred less frequently for gynaecology compared with obstetric vignettes [odds ratio (OR) 0.45; 95% CI 0.23-0.91; P = 0.035] and decreased with the number of questions asked (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-0.99; P = 0.047).

A sample of 164 gynaecological doctors was encompassed by the study. A questionnaire survey was applied as an independent empirical procedure on the basis of the theory of attitudes and the following questionnaires: WCQ (The Ways of Coping Questionnaire)--Folkman, Lazarus, Dukiel-Scheier & Weintraub, as the authors own adaptation of that instrument for the requirements of the study. In response to the question on the purpose of performing prenatal diagnostics in detecting genetic irregularities in the first and second trimester--35% of physicians were against such diagnostics if it served abortion, 60% supported the test even if in consequence an abortion was carried out, whereas 5% had no stance on the matter. The problem of physicians' approach to abortion for so-called \"social reasons\" was also studied. Over half, as many as 51% of physicians were against abortion in any form whatsoever, including pharmacological abortions; 45% agreed to abortion and 4% had no opinion. The veracity of ethical motivations was also measured: approx. 4%, refrained from expressing their support of either position; 29% stated that a physician, although they do not perform abortions themselves, should indicate other possibilities of performing the abortion and as many as 67% thought that the indication of a place or a person who performs abortions is obvious. The results of the survey indicate the differences in the attitudes of physicians towards the diagnosis of prenatal tests, especially the ones revealing genetic defects and lethal disease. There are two ambivalent patterns of behaviour: one group of physicians opt for delivering every child without any exceptions, but the other one is for destroying deformed foetuses.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18217415/"}

The course consisted of a theoretical portion describing the suturing technique basics and a practical portion consisting of box trainer suturing. Before and after the course, each trainee was given 10 min to introduce the suture material into the abdomen, properly position the needle using a needle holder, pass the suture through premarked points on the silicone pads and tie an intracorporeal knot. The procedures were video recorded and evaluated after the course. The results showed that there were statistically significant reductions in the needle holding, suture passing and knot tying times after completing the course. Overall, the one-day course was an effective training programme for improving a surgeon's laparoscopic suturing skills. IMPACT STATEMENT <b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Currently, many countries have centres that provide laparoscopic training as part of the medical residency education. However, a standardised training programme has not been implemented worldwide. <b>What do the results of this study add?</b> In this study, we pointed out the effectiveness of a one-day laparoscopic suturing course. A one-day suturing course is easy to implement, cheap and effective. <b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> A one-day suturing course should be implemented worldwide, especially in those countries lacking sufficient financial resources to provide laparoscopic training as part of the medical residency programme.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31303078/"}

The study involved the Gynaecology and Obstetrics wards of the three Aberdeen teaching hospitals, all of which are supplied with blood and services by the transfusion laboratory of Aberdeen and North East of Scotland Blood Transfusion Service. The transfusion laboratory and hospital records were examined and analysed for all transfusion events in Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the three periods of 6 months immediately before, immediately after and 2 1/2-3 years following the introduction of a GS and MSBOS policy in November 1986. The number of units of blood crossmatched and units transfused decreased consistently and progressively to half the pre-GS and MSBOS level in both Gynaecology wards and Obstetrics wards during the study periods. This reduction was not associated with a decrease in the clinical workload. However, the crossmatched/transfused ratio (CTR) showed an immediate but transient improvement (3.6 to 2.2 to 3.4) and only partial and delayed improvement (10.1 to 9.6 to 7.7) with regard to blood use in the Gynaecology wards and the Obstetrics wards (respectively) during the three periods of 6 months indicated above. We conclude that the introduction of a GS and MSBOS policy can have a significant and sustained impact in reducing unnecessary blood ordering. The CTR may not be as sensitive an indicator of the effect of the introduction of GS and MSBOS as the total blood usage and a more detailed examination of blood use is necessary to assess performance and long-term impact.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8536422/"}

Study of concrete results].", "text": "In our opinion German gynaecology has failed to adequately face what came to pass during the Nazi period. This can be proved objectively, for there is no evidence that, after 1945, gynaecology had in any way cared to take notice--either thermatically or medically--of the thousands of victims of inhuman practices such as forced termination of pregnancy, compulsory sterilisation and the like. During the past 50 years recollections of enforced sterilisations, compulsory abortions, deliberate and hence criminal negligence and problematic approaches in research and teaching were almost completely banished from the area of conscious awareness and largely suppressed or silently ignored. Most of the medical directors of Departments of Gynaecology of German universities shared this view whenever they were questioned on the connections between gynaecology and Nazism. Now that two generations have passed it seems possible to examine and explore with less guilt feelings and shame the immensely fateful rôle of gynaecology in that context. Accent should be on the fate of the victims of that period. To bring back these events to memory, however, does not permit to conceal the part played by the physicians committing of these inhuman Nazi crimes. Data collected from a psychosomatically oriented examination of victims exemplify that to concretely recall gynaecology during Nazism a1-so offers a chance in several respects. One of the possibilities in this context is to signal \"late apology\" and regret to patients who had been victims, in one's own area of work, after one has psychically worked over their fate. Besides, a gynaecological-psychosomatic expertise will help e.g. that compulsorily sterilised women are granted financial aid that has at long last become a legal possibility and can be applied for since 1980. However, the relevant patient records do show very clearly that the inhuman practice of gynaecology during the so-called \"Third Reich\" was not only a collective problem but equally due to a failure of the individual conscience of numerous gynaecologists. Working over this complex may enhance our own sensitivity for psychosomatic and ethic problems and counteract any likelihood of a recurrence of an inhuman gynaecology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7982555/"}

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and the ISRCTN Register of Clinical Trials were searched using selected terminology. No language restrictions were applied. The selection criteria were randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled studies that investigated the use of GTAs to teach students or health-related professionals the pelvic examination. Data evaluating study outcomes, along with methodological details, were extracted in duplicate. The outcomes measured were: self-reported confidence, assessed competence and assessed communication skills. The standard mean difference (SMD) was derived for each study where possible and heterogeneity across studies was quantified using the I(2) statistic. In the presence of substantial variation, the data were pooled using a random effects model. Eleven studies with 856 participants were included: five RCTs and six observational studies. GTA training improved competence compared with other teaching methods and the finding of enhanced competence was consistent when the pooled analysis was restricted to RCTs. Communication skills were also improved with GTA teaching, but to a lesser degree, whereas no effect on student confidence was observed. Statistical heterogeneity was present for all outcomes when data were pooled. Our findings suggest that GTA-based teaching of pelvic examination is associated with improvement in the competence and communication skills of trainees. However, further larger-scale studies with standardised relevant educational outcomes are needed to confirm these findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26611185/"}

Robotic surgery has potential advantages compared to laparoscopic surgery but also requires new skills. Using virtual reality (VR) simulation to facilitate the acquisition of these new skills could potentially benefit training of robotic surgical skills and also be a crucial step in developing a robotic surgical training curriculum. The study's objective was to establish validity evidence for a simulation-based test for procedural competency for the vaginal cuff closure procedure that can be used in a future simulation-based, mastery learning training curriculum. Eleven novice gynaecological surgeons without prior robotic experience and 11 experienced gynaecological robotic surgeons (> 30 robotic procedures) were recruited. After familiarization with the VR simulator, participants completed the module 'Guided Vaginal Cuff Closure' six times. Validity evidence was investigated for 18 preselected simulator metrics. The internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and a composite score was calculated based on metrics with significant discriminative ability between the two groups. Finally, a pass/fail standard was established using the contrasting groups' method. The experienced surgeons significantly outperformed the novice surgeons on 6 of the 18 metrics. The internal consistency was 0.58 (Cronbach's alpha). The experienced surgeons' mean composite score for all six repetitions were significantly better than the novice surgeons' (76.1 vs. 63.0, respectively, p < 0.001). A pass/fail standard of 75/100 was established. Four novice surgeons passed this standard (false positives) and three experienced surgeons failed (false negatives). Our study has gathered validity evidence for a simulation-based test for procedural robotic surgical competency in the vaginal cuff closure procedure and established a credible pass/fail standard for future proficiency-based training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29603003/"}

Surgical residencies are now required to have skills laboratories so that varying degrees of surgical training and skills acquisition can occur outside of the operating room. There is mounting evidence that surgeons can learn many fundamental skills and specific procedures with simulators. Evidence also supports the theory that surgeons trained initially with simulators perform better in the operating room than those who are not. Currently, there are many different simulators available for obstetrics/gynaecology procedures, both high and low fidelity. Less-expensive models are often as effective for training as low-fidelity models. Developing an effective surgical simulation programme requires a commitment to the concept and finding the time and space. Most importantly, it requires desire on the part of the trainees to devote the hours of practise needed to make themselves accomplished surgeons.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20605529/"}

All medical students entering their obstetrics-gynecology clerkship at a medical school in the Netherlands between May and October 2011 were invited to participate in this study's questionnaire, which asked them to report the number of gynecological examinations they were allowed and not allowed to perform during their clerkship. Eighteen questionnaire respondents participated in three focus groups. Of the 139 medical students invited, 76 (55%) completed the questionnaire. Students reported a total of 2,196 instances in which they were not allowed to participate in the examination; 89% (n = 1,956) were related to the supervisory physician. Qualitative data from the focus group interviews showed that female supervisory physicians prioritized patients' autonomy above students' learning needs. Furthermore, female students were less assertive than male students in asking the supervisory physician for permission to participate. The physician's role in not allowing student involvement is substantial and results in fewer opportunities for students to perform gynecological examinations. For students to develop the necessary gynecological exam skills during their clerkship, medical educators need to improve the learning environment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24280852/"}

The aim of this study was to generate hypotheses as to which factors favour the use of EGONE and which didactic implications for the learning success the application of EGONE has. During August 2009, 28 medical students in their 8th and 9th semester were interviewed after having completed their block of training in gynaecology. The instruments used included a questionnaire and a partially standardised interview. We found that the e-learning offering EGONE was basically met with a positive response from the medical students at the University of Ulm. Regarding the integration of EGONE, three problem areas were identified: shortage of equipment, lack of dependable access and functional, but not curricular integration. Students' suggestions for better integration of EGONE were related to two subject areas: establishing an assisted learning centre (e.g., PC pool with library) and developing curricular independence and relevance (e.g., specific application to patient cases, conducting seminars with EGONE). The integration of the e-learning programme EGONE presupposes a logical, didactic concept for the whole clinical block of training in gynaecology as well as dependable, sufficient infrastructure and technical equipment and providing didactic support to users.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23200210/"}

All the rest got a mark lower than 60. The results are lower than the ones obtained in written exams, because these cannot assess clinical skills. It could be observed that a student's performance in a clinical problem does not certainly predict his performance in other, so it seems to be determined more by the specific knowledge and the student's experience related to the case, than by a general problem-solving skill. The results show the advantages of this instrument to assess clinical skills, that justify its application in the formative process.

We hypothesized that the previously proposed threshold value of 12 as an excessive number of follicles per ovary (FN) is no longer appropriate because of current technological developments. In this study, we have revisited the thresholds for FN and for the serum Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level (a possible surrogate for FN) for the definition of PCOM. Clinical, hormonal and ultrasound data were consecutively recorded in 240 patients referred to our department between 2008 and 2010 for exploration of hyperandrogenism (HA), menstrual disorders and/or infertility. According to only their symptoms, patients were grouped as: non-PCOS without HA and with ovulatory cycles (group 1, n = 105), presumption of PCOS with only HA or only oligo-anovulation (group 2, n = 73) and PCOS with HA and oligo-anovulation (group 3, n = 62). By cluster analysis using androgens, LH, FSH, AMH, FN and ovarian volume, group 1 appeared to be constituted of two homogeneous clusters, most likely a non-PCOM non-PCOS subgroup (n = 66) and a PCOM, non-PCOS (i.e. asymptomatic) subgroup (n = 39). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to distinguish the non-PCOM non-PCO members of group 1 and to group 3. For FN and serum AMH respectively, the areas under the curve were 0.949 and 0.973 and the best compromise between sensitivity (81 and 92%) and specificity (92 and 97%) was obtained with a threshold values of 19 follicles and 35 pmol/l (5 ng/ml). For the definition of PCOM, the former threshold of >12 for FN is no longer valid. A serum AMH >35 pmol/l (or >5 ng/ml) appears to be more sensitive and specific than a FN >19 and should be therefore included in the current diagnostic classifications for PCOS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21926054/"}

This study assessed the impact of a new multi-element teaching mode that utilizes Bite-Sized Teaching, flipped classroom, and MOOC on learner perception in an Obstetrics and gynaecology clerkship. A Two-stage crossover design study was conducted of a multi-element teaching mode compared to traditional teaching mode in an academic year. Participants included Ninety-six medical students practicing obstetrics and gynecology in our hospital, randomly divided into two groups respectively underwent multi-element teaching mode and traditional teaching mode. After each semester, a final test (including theoretical and clinical practical test) was conducted.When an academic year was completed, post intervention survey assessed learner perceptions of the intervention. In order to comprehensively test students' performance after study, we take theoretical and practical examinations. The theoretical examination mainly tests students' grasp of basic knowledge points, while the practical examination focuses on the examination of students' diagnosis and treatment of diseases. There were statistically significant differences both in the theoretical and clinical practical scores between the new multi-element integrated teaching mode and the traditional teaching mode, specifically as follows: In the end of first semester, the theoretical scores of the two groups were respective 43.75 ± 3.42 vs. 42.07 ± 2.90, and clinic practical test scores were respective 44.93 ± 2.42 vs. 43.37 ± 2.52; In the end of second semester, the theoretical scores of the two groups were respective 44.30 ± 2.69 vs. 42.25 ± 3.39, and clinic practical test scores were respective 43.79 ± 2.25 vs. 41.93 ± 2.80.(p < 0.05). The results of questionnaires demonstrated that 80.21% of the students showed preference for the new multi-element integrated teaching mode comparing to traditional teaching methods. The new multi-element integrated teaching mode is well accepted by the students and can improve the students' mastery of knowledge, and can improve the students' clinical comprehensive ability. The new multi-element integrated teaching mode is shown more preference than traditional teaching mode in the teaching of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Further long term study is needed carried out to consolidate our conclusion.

The objective of this study was to determine motivating factors for choosing a speciality career in general and, more specifically, for the choice of obstetrics and gynaecology (OBGYN) over surgery or general practice. This study was based on prospectively collected data from a large research multi-site cross-sectional study. We sent a survey to medical students in the sixth year, which contained questions about demographics, choice of speciality and motives for choosing. We grouped the specialities into families of specialities and motives into motivating factors clustered by principal component analysis. We used a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test to identify differences between motivating factors in speciality categories and gender. We performed logistic regression analyse to compare the choice of OBGYN to choices of surgery and general practice as well as undecided. A total of 1749 students responded with an average return rate of 56%. Our study revealed four motivating factors: \"experiential\", \"relational\", \"occupational\" and \"scientific\". Logistic regression analysis showed that the choice of OBGYN was particularly influenced by \"experiential factor\" (OR 1.5; 95%CI [1.2; 1.9]) and by gender (OR 4.5; 95%CI [2.2; 9.2]). When we compared the motivational profile of OBGYN to other speciality categories, OBGYN appeared to stand between surgery and general practice for the \"experiential\" and \"relational\" factors, more like surgery for the \"occupational factor\" and more like general practice for the \"scientific factor\". This study highlighted the importance of \"experiential factor\" and gender for choosing OBGYN as a career. OBGYN seemed to stand between surgery and general practice from a Swiss students' point of view. These findings provide useful information for targeted interventions to promote OBGYN at the undergraduate level. Such interventions could include providing more hands-on experiences, improving integration of male students and encouraging student involvement in patient care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051419/"}

Communication from medical student applicants to programs varies, and the effect this has on their rank status is unclear. We assessed how obstetrics and gynecology program directors interpret and act on postinterview communication initiated by applicants by conducting an anonymous cross-sectional web-based survey of allopathic obstetrics and gynecology program directors. One hundred thirty-seven program directors (55%) responded to the survey. Twenty-nine percent would consider ranking an applicant more favorably if the applicant expressed interest (beyond a routine thank you) or if a faculty mentor personally known to the program director stated that the applicant was ranking the program first. Fifty-two percent indicated that they would rank an applicant more favorably if a mentor known to them endorsed the applicant as outstanding. Approximately 30% responded that applicants who did not communicate with their program were disadvantaged compared with those who did. Approximately 17% stated it was desirable to create additional specialty-specific guidelines regarding postinterview contact between programs and applications. Based on the wide variation in how program directors interpret and act on postinterview communication from applicants, residency programs should formulate and communicate a clear policy about whether they request and how they respond to postinterview communication from applicants and their mentors. This will establish a more level playing field and eliminate potential inequities resulting from inconsistent communication practices.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25068562/"}

{"id": "25701235", "title": "Overview and expert assessment of off-label use of misoprostol in obstetrics and gynaecology: review and report by the Collège national des gynécologues obstétriciens français.", "text": "The literature suggests that misoprostol can be offered to patients for off-label use as it has reasonable efficacy, risk/benefit ratio, tolerance and patient satisfaction, according to the criteria for evidence-based medicine. Both the vaginal and sublingual routes are more effective than the oral route for first-trimester cervical dilatation. Vaginal misoprostol 800μg, repeated if necessary after 24 or 48h, is a possible alternative for management after early pregnancy failure. However, misoprostol has not been demonstrated to be useful for the evacuation of an incomplete miscarriage, except for cervical dilatation before vacuum aspiration. Oral mifepristone 200mg, followed 24-48h later by vaginal, sublingual or buccal misoprostol 800μg (followed 3-4h later, if necessary, by misoprostol 400μg) is a less efficacious but less aggressive alternative to vacuum aspiration for elective or medically-indicated first-trimester terminations; this alternative becomes increasingly less effective as gestational age increases. In the second trimester, vaginal misoprostol 800-2400μg in 24h, 24-48h after at least 200mg of mifepristone, is an alternative to surgery, sulprostone and gemeprost. Data for the third trimester are sparse. For women with an unripe cervix and an unscarred uterus, vaginal misoprostol 25μg every 3-6h is an alternative to prostaglandin E2 for cervical ripening at term for a live fetus. When oxytocin is unavailable, misoprostol can be used after delivery for prevention (sublingual misoprostol 600μg) and treatment (sublingual misoprostol 800μg) of postpartum haemorrhage. The use of misoprostol to promote cervical dilatation before diagnostic hysteroscopy or surgical procedures is beneficial for premenopausal women but not for postmenopausal women. Nonetheless, in view of the side effects of misoprostol, its use as a first-line treatment is not indicated, and it should be reserved for difficult cases. Misoprostol is not useful for placing or removing the types of intra-uterine devices used in Europe, regardless of parity.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25701235/"}

We aimed to assess the adequacy of training in cervical smear taking among hospital medical trainees. An anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among hospital medical trainees within the North West region of England. The questionnaire assessed the trainees' level of confidence in their knowledge and skills in the theoretical and practical aspects of cervical smear taking, and the training they had received. The standards used were as stated in the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme Resource Pack for Training Smear Takers (July 1998). These included practical smear taking, pre- and post-test counselling, the background to cervical screening, the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme, the role of the Health Authority and the laboratory, provision for women with special needs, acceptability, accountability and quality assurance. Seventy-eight per cent of trainees returned the questionnaires. Although all the trainees were confident about taking smears, a significant percentage was concerned about the theoretical and specific issues associated with smear taking such as the care of women with special needs. Only 60.7% had received formal training in practical smear taking. Furthermore, only 48.3% had been formally trained in the clinical management of smears. There appears to be an urgent need for formal training in the theory and practice of smear taking and for the standardization of the course content. The introduction of training in liquid-based cytology provides us with a golden opportunity to address this deficit.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17168919/"}

For their professional development, previously incorporated understandings need to be relearned: how to transgress boundaries that regulate intimacy and physical closeness, learning to examine and touch other peoples' bodies, and talking about things that are otherwise taboo. This paper compares how students learn to perform two intimate examinations: (i) the digital rectal examination (DRE) of the prostate, and (ii) the bimanual pelvic examination (PE) and analyses how norms and expectations affect how students learn to approach them. This study is based on ethnographic work: in-depth qualitative interviews with two urologists and nine medical students in semesters four, eight and 11 of a medical education programme in Sweden, observations of three learning sessions where 16 students performed the PE on professional patients, and 2 days of observations at a urology outpatient clinic. The educational approach to the PE and DRE differ. The PE is taught as sensitive and to be handled with care, using a well-documented learning concept including interpersonal and technical skills. The patient's exposed position in the gynaecological chair, possible previous negative experiences of PE or sexual exploitation are taken into account. In contrast, there is no educational concept for teaching the DRE. The students perform their first DRE on a clinical patient. The DRE is also handled with care, but with less sensitivity. The patients' possible previous negative experiences are not discussed and are thus made invisible. Well-established routines in performing the PE help doctors and students to be attentive to patients' emotions and previous experiences, and remind them to perceive the examination as sensitive. Aligning the teaching of the DRE with that of the PE will improve how the male prostate patient is approached.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32043635/"}

The undergraduate medical curriculum at the University of Auckland provides improvement science theory and skills in Year 5 teaching, and the opportunity to put this into practice during an Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) clinical attachment in Year 6. In 2015, a revised medical school curriculum at the university resulted in a planned reduction of the O&G attachment from five weeks to four, necessitating revision of the Year 6 Quality Improvement (QI) project. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the revised programme provided an important experiential learning opportunity for medical students without imposing an unsustainable burden on clinical services. Based on a CIPP (Context/Input/Process/Product) evaluation model, the study was conducted in several stages to get a sense of the context as the new programme was being planned (Context evaluation), the feasibility of an alternative approach to meet the educational need (Input evaluation), the implementation of the revised programme (Process evaluation) and finally, the programme outcomes (Product evaluation). We used multiple data sources (supervisors, students, academic administrators, and hospital staff) and data collection methods (questionnaires, focus groups, individual interviews, consultative workshops, student reports and oral presentations). The context evaluation revealed the Year 6 QI programme to be valuable and contributed to O&G service improvements, however, the following concerns were identified: time to complete the project, timely topic selection and access to data, recognition of student achievement, and staff workload. The evaluation of the revised QI project indicated improvement in student perceptions of their QI knowledge and skills, and most areas previously identified as challenging, despite the concurrent reduction in the duration of the O&G attachment. Applying the CIPP model for evaluation to our revised QI programme enabled streamlining of procedures to achieve greater efficiency without compromising the quality of the learning experience, or increasing pressure on staff. A four week clinical rotation is adequate for medical educators to consider opportunities for including QI projects as part of student experiential learning.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28549464/"}

The authors searched PubMed for all articles describing a program in which psychiatry was formally integrated with obstetric or gynecological services, other than standard consultation-liaison programs, in the care of patients with major mental disorders. The search terms used included interdisciplinary, interprofessional, integrated, collaborative care, psychiatry, and obstetrics-gynecology or psychosomatic obstetrics-gynecology. The authors found six distinct integrated programs. These included family planning clinics that were integrated into inpatient psychiatry services; inpatient and outpatient psychiatry services for pregnant mentally ill women in close collaboration with obstetric services; a day hospital for pregnant women with psychiatric disorders in an obstetric setting; an interdisciplinary training site providing care for predominantly depressed, low-income, and minority women; a primary care HIV service for women integrated with departments of obstetrics-gynecology and psychiatry; and an obstetrics-gynecology clinic-based collaborative depression care intervention for socially disadvantaged women.

All the procedures were performed in a fully equipped surgical environment and complied with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The trainees assessed the anatomical and manipulative characteristics of the soft-embalmed cadavers as similar to real conditions. Color and consistency hardly differed from those of the live patients. The trainees stated that soft-embalmed cadavers were beneficial for learning and increased their self-confidence. In terms of realism, all surgical steps were rated a median of 4 out of 5 or higher on a Likert scale by both trainees and experts. The use of soft-embalmed cadavers for training was perceived positively by trainees and experts. The evaluation results showed a high degree of realism compared with training on living patients. Hands-on training on soft-embalmed cadavers offers great potential as a new training method for surgical skills in gynecological oncology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40301137/"}

Rates of injury increase with limited surgical experience and reduced surgical volume. Currently, there are no low-fidelity or high-fidelity simulation models for teaching and practicing ureteric dissection. Our goal was to design a laparoscopic simulation model for retroperitoneal anatomy with high face validity that is low-cost and easily reproducible. A low-fidelity 3-dimensional simulation model was developed that represents key anatomic structures encountered during retroperitoneal dissection and ureteric identification. Materials, construction steps, and costs were determined. The models were trialed by expert laparoscopic surgeons. Demographic information that included age, gender, surgical experience, and complex laparoscopic case volumes was collected. Face validity was assessed with a 5-item Likert-scale. The total cost of 1 model ranged from $65 to $75. The majority of the materials that were used were reusable, except for 2 components that cost <$1 per use. Seven expert surgeons participated in the study, all of whom were fellowship-trained minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons or currently enrolled in this type of fellowship program. Participants agreed or strongly agreed that the model resembled the texture of the ureter, vessels, and peritoneal layer (n=6; 86%), approximated the correct anatomic course of the ureter (n=7; 100%), and closely approximated live surgery (n=5; 71%). They also agreed or strongly agreed that the model would be useful for teaching laparoscopic retroperitoneal dissection (n=7; 100%), for assessing a learner's ability before performing in the operating room (n=6; 86%), was low-cost (n=7; 100%), and was easily reproducible (n=6; 86%). This unique model fills a gap in laparoscopic simulation training. No other low- or high-fidelity models for laparoscopic retroperitoneal ureteric dissection have been identified in the literature. This simulation model is low-cost, easily reproducible, closely resembles retroperitoneal dissection during laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, and can be used for education and assessment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28694150/"}

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and nature of adverse gynaecological events. The clinical records of all women admitted with gynaecological conditions over 9 months were assessed for adverse events, defined as an injury caused by medical management rather than the underlying disease. Adverse events occurred in 11.7% of admissions and 52% were avoidable. The majority of adverse events were minor (disability lasting less than 6 months). Mortality accounted for 17.7% of adverse events and 2.1% of all admissions. The death rate was higher in the elective admissions. The frequency of adverse events increased with age, the presence of co-existing illnesses, and severity of the illness on admission. Therapeutic mishaps (n = 67; 8%) were the most common type of adverse event. Lessons learnt from audit should reduce adverse events considerably.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16263542/"}

This is a part of the medical curriculum where communication skills are particularly important, but difficult to learn in practice. Twenty-one medical students took part in three role-play case studies. An innovation we implemented was the use of 'time outs' which could be called at any time through a session. After the exercise students were required to complete a questionnaire designed to probe their attitudes towards the experience. The results indicate that this technique can be successfully used in teaching a conventional speciality. Unlike some previous studies we also found this to be a satisfactory tool in teaching the factual part of the course. We found the 'time out' innovation to be an important aid.

Four short online videos on the topics of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, evaluation of an adnexal mass, and ovarian cancer were created, and students were instructed to view them prior to a class-time active learning session. The Learning Activity Management System (lams) open-source online platform was used to create an active learning class-time activity that consisted of a coached discussion of cases. Student satisfaction with the two aspects of the flipped curriculum was obtained. In addition, lecture assessment for the gynaecologic oncology topics and aggregate student performance on the gynaecological oncology questions of the US National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Subject Examination were compared before and after implementation of the curriculum. Eighty-nine students rotated on the clerkship during the pilot period of analysis. Seventy-one students (80%) viewed the videos prior to the class session, and 84 (94%) attended the session.

There is little understanding about vulvodynia among junior gynaecologists. Most of them did not have any form of basic training about the condition even after reaching the final stages of the speciality training.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training course in improving residents' non-technical skills performance in the operating room. Twenty-eight eligible Obstetrics and Gynaecology residents were divided into conventional and experimental groups by using blocked randomisation. The experimental group received a training course comprising of 20 h over 5 weeks as an educational intervention. A blinded assessor assessed non-technical skill performance by using non-technical skill for surgeons rating system while performing two procedures evacuation and curettage and elective caesarean section in pretest and post-test phase. The post-test results of experimental training group improved significantly in all four categories: situational awareness, decision-making, communication and leadership than the conventional training group demonstrating the effectiveness of a training course. Participants found the course useful and relevant to their practices and strongly recommended the incorporation of similar courses in early years of training. Impact Statement <b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Operating room is the mainstay of surgeons and the majority of the studies done in the operating room relate to structured courses to teach residents about non-technical skills, with training and evaluation done on the same day. These either explores the perception of trainees, expansion of the cognitive component and/or feasibility of training for non-technical skills. To date, there is a lack of evidence in the literature to address questions regarding the appropriate time to incorporate non-technical skills in the curriculum, due to study designs. This highlights the need for more randomised control trials with different curricular designs to evaluate effectiveness. <b>What do the results of this study add?</b> The results of our study enable a comparative analysis between learning curves of conventional training, with the experimental group demonstrating the effectiveness of a training course. This strongly supports implementation of non-technical training in postgraduate competency-based curricula. <b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> This study shall be used as an evidence-based source to design curricula for teaching non-technical skills to residents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328599/"}

Different minimum thresholds for each category of care provider were proposed according to the number of births/year in the facility. These minimum thresholds can be modulated upwards as a function of the level of care (Level 1, 2 or 3 for perinatal centers), existence of an emergency department, and responsibilities as a referral center for maternal-fetal and/or surgical care. For example, an obstetrics-gynecology department handling 3000-4500 births per year without serving as a referral center must have an obstetrician-gynecologist, an anesthesiologist-resuscitation specialist, a nurse-anesthetist, and a pediatrician onsite specifically to provide care for unscheduled obstetrics-gynecology needs and a second obstetrician-gynecologist available within a time compatible with security requirements 24/7; the number of midwives always present (24/7) onsite and dedicated to unscheduled care is 5.1 for 3000 births and 7.2 for 4500 births.

A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database to identify trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations in obstetrics and gynaecology published between January 1, 2000 and May 16, 2017. Studies performed in middle- and low-income countries and studies related to prevention, midwifery, and reproduction were excluded. Reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard (CHEERS) statement (a modified version with 21 items, as we focused on trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations) and the statistical quality was assessed using a literature-based list of criteria (8 items). Exploratory regression analyses were performed to assess the association between reporting and statistical quality scores and publication year. The electronic search resulted in 5482 potentially eligible studies. Forty-five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 22 in obstetrics and 23 in gynaecology. Twenty-seven (60%) studies did not adhere to 50% (n = 10) or more of the reporting quality items and 32 studies (71%) did not meet 50% (n = 4) or more of the statistical quality items. As for the statistical quality, no study used the appropriate method to assess cost differences, no advanced methods were used to deal with missing data, and clustering of data was ignored in all studies. No significant improvements over time were found in reporting or statistical quality in gynaecology, whereas in obstetrics a significant improvement in reporting and statistical quality was found over time. The focus of this review was on trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations in obstetrics and gynaecology, so further research is needed to explore whether results from this review are generalizable to other medical disciplines. The reporting and analysis of trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations in gynaecology and obstetrics is generally poor. Since this can result in biased results, incorrect conclusions, and inappropriate healthcare decisions, there is an urgent need for improvement in the methods of cost-effectiveness evaluations in this field.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28674846/"}

We performed an uncontrolled prospective single center, before-after study, at the gynecological emergency department of Angers University Hospital in France, between May 2014 and April 2015. We included all patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of first trimester PL. A self-administering questionnaire (SAQ) that included the short version of the perinatal grief scale (PGS) and questions about the couples' personal experience was sent by mail 8 weeks after the diagnosis. Patients were included before and after simulation training of the residents on the communication of the diagnosis of PL, and scores were compared between the two groups (before and after training). Overall 72 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and responded to the SAQ, 45 before and 27 after simulation training. Overall, simulation training significantly lowered the overall PGS (39.4±4.9 vs 57.3±5.6, p=0.03), significantly improved the attitude of the resident when announcing the diagnosis (more considerate (74.1 % vs 48.9 %, p=0.04) and available (59.3 % vs 28.9 %, p=0.01)), and significantly improved the quality of the information given (less incomprehensible (22.2 % vs 46.7 %, p=0.04). Finally, significantly fewer patients reported needing an additional consultation for further information following training (33.3 % vs 73.3 %, p=0.01).

Research, however, on how to acquire surgical skills in the operating room safely, effectively and efficiently is scarce. We performed this study to explore trainers' and trainees' mutual expectations concerning operative training, to identify key aspects for improving learning and teaching in the operating theatre. We conducted a focus group study in different teaching hospitals in The Netherlands. Three focus groups were composed of gynaecology consultants representing over half of the training hospitals in The Netherlands. Four groups were composed of gynaecology trainees at different stages of training, from university and non-university hospitals and of both sexes. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into qualitative data analysis software and two researchers performed a thematic analysis. Teaching and learning in the operating theatre are complicated by the dynamics of trainer-trainee interaction, which are fraught with potentially conflicting interests. Trainer and trainee have to consider each other's interests, while their primary concern must be patient safety. Trainers want to feel in control and trainees want to be given a free hand within a safe atmosphere. Structuring of the teaching and learning process appears to hold the key to creating positive dynamics between trainer, trainee and their responsibility towards the patient. Structuring can be achieved before, during and after an operation. Before the operation both trainer and trainee can take the initiative to talk about learning objectives, plan of action, and task allocation. During the operation, the trainee can verbalise actions before actually performing them. This makes trainee actions predictable, enhances trainer confidence and thus may increase the trainee's chance of actually performing (a portion of) a procedure. After the operation, both trainer and trainee can initiate an evaluation the trainee's performance. Interaction between trainer and trainee is complicated by their shared responsibility towards the patient. Structured interactions before, during and after operations appear to offer opportunities for improving learning and teaching in the operating theatre.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20950925/"}

Physicians' communication skills were assessed by independent raters using a standardised evaluation instrument (adapted version of the MAAS-R) to analyse video recorded interviews before and after the training. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a patient satisfaction questionnaire. Using general linear model (GLM) for repeated measures no group x time interaction nor time effects were found for physicians' communication skills. No group x time interaction was found for patients' satisfaction scores; however the significant time effect was mostly attributable to positive changes in patients' rating of the training group. Physicians with poorer performance at the beginning showed greater improvements over the course of the study, especially in the training group. In this randomized controlled trial marginal intervention effects for the improvement of communication skills and only partial changes in patient satisfaction scores from pre to post training were shown. However, physicians with poorer performance at the beginning showed greater improvements, suggesting that competence levels were already relatively high at the beginning of the study. Also, formation of communication training groups should be based on specific skill deficits rather than being implemented unspecifically for an entire team of physicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17576587/"}

This pilot program was centred on cervical cancer prevention, which lends itself to applying the principles of advocacy. An educational module was developed and disseminated to all obstetrics and gynaecology residency programs in Canada. The module describes options for HA involving cervical dysplasia screening, such as an outreach clinic or a forum for public/student education, which were to be implemented during Cervical Cancer Awareness Week. The measures of success were the number of programs implementing the curriculum, number of residents who participated, diversity of projects implemented, individuals (patients or learners) reached by the program, and the overall experience of the trainees. Three programs implemented the curriculum in 2011, one in 2012, and seven in 2013. After three years, the module has involved seven of 16 medical schools, over 100 residents, and thousands of women either directly or indirectly. Additionally, attributes of HA experienced by the residents were identified: teamwork, leadership, increased systems knowledge, increased social capital within the community, creativity, innovation, and adaptability.

Improving the quality of gynaecological care will enhance patient recovery and improve outcomes of gynaecological diseases. However, comprehensive evaluation tools and nationwide data on the quality of gynaecological care are lacking. This study aims to develop a framework for evaluating gynaecological care quality in China, analysing disparities and proposing improvement strategies. This nationwide study employs a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design across three phases: (1) questionnaire development through a literature review, indepth interviews, expert consultation and pilot testing; (2) collection of cross-sectional survey data from gynaecology departments, healthcare providers and patients in public healthcare facilities across 31 provinces in mainland China; and (3) integration and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative results. The study collects data on organisational structure, care processes and outcomes. Analysis of quantitative data will include risk adjustment of key quality indicators, comprehensive evaluation of care quality and exploration of influencing factors using linear regression. Qualitative data will undergo thematic and content analyses. Joint displays will be used to integrate the mixed-method results. The study was approved by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Ethics Committee (I-24ZM0003). All participants provided informed consent. Data were anonymised and participants retained the right to withdraw without penalty. A risk-benefit assessment was conducted, and no vulnerable groups were included without justification. These findings will be disseminated to healthcare policymakers through academic publications, scientific conference presentations and reports. The results are expected to provide methodological guidance for the quality evaluation of gynaecological care and inform policy development in China.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40345684/"}

The majority of women are now in paid employment and women's position in society is dramatically improved. The decrease in mortality has affected women and men differently. Women live longer than men, but they tend to be afflicted by chronic non-lethal diseases. Issues which earlier were kept out of the public debate on women's health are now part of that debate.

Given that coordination with other medical departments is vital for treatment, a high level of interpersonal and technical skills needs to be demonstrated to form the axis for medical treatment. One objective of the specialist certification system is the grooming of leaders as gynecologic oncologists while instructing trainees. The most distinguishing feature of Japanese gynecologic oncologists is that they need experience in more than 150 invasive cancer treatments, including more than 100 operations within the last 3-5 years. As for performance of surgery, at least 30 operations, including 15 radical hysterectomies, are required. Since surgical methods, including laparoscopic surgery, are undergoing a radical change, and increasing numbers of patients are undergoing radiotherapy for invasive cervical cancer, a review of the necessary requirements is critical. It is important to foster new leaders who are research-oriented. Now is the time for marked reform with the new specialist certification system being introduced by the Japanese Medical Specialty Board. Japan has the advantage of offering medical services at a much lower cost because of its national health insurance system. However, specialists are currently not receiving clear benefits befitting their efforts, and the question of how to maintain their motivation is an issue for the future. For these purposes, I believe securing incentives is a critical issue for specialists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26988808/"}

The technological complexities and amended theatre dynamics that RAS demands mean that effective non-technical skills (NTS) are vitally important to overcome these unique challenges. However, NTS have been neglected in RAS-training programmes with focus placed instead on the exclusive acquisition of technical skills (TS). NTS include teamwork, communication, leadership, situational awareness, decision-making and stress management. Communication is the most frequently cited NTS impacted during RAS, as the physical limitations imposed by the robotic hardware make communication exchange difficult. The full immersion that RAS enables can contribute to situational awareness deficits. However, RAS can complement communication and teamwork when multidisciplinary (MDT) surgeries (such as complex endometriosis excisions) are undertaken; dual-console capabilities facilitate the involvement of specialties such as general surgery and urology. The development of NTS in RAS cannot be achieved with in-situ experience alone, and current training is poorly standardised. RAS-training programmes and curricula for gynaecology do exist, however the integration of NTS remain limited. Simulation is a viable tool to facilitate enhanced-NTS integration, yet cost implications form a barrier to its wider implementation. However, given that RAS will continue to occupy a greater proportion of the gynaecological caseload, integration of NTS within gynaecological RAS training curricula is necessary.

We collected prospectively: the answerer's characteristics, the rate of episiotomy and its systematics indications for spontaneous and operative delivery, the habits of the practitioners for the section and the reparation, the modalities of women's information and the data entered into the medical record. Three hundred and eighty nine CNGOF members answered to the survey. They were 69% to declare performing less than 10% of episiotomy in case of spontaneous vertex delivery. The most frequent systematic indication of episiotomy was the personal history of obstetric anal sphincter injury (more than 30% of answerers). Systematic episiotomy was less frequent in case of vacuum assisted operative delivery compared to forceps (OR=0.18 [0.08-0.37]) or spatulas (OR=0.28 [0.12-0.59]). Most of practitioners (94%) declared performing mediolateral episiotomies, 64% declared cutting with an equal or more than 45° angle and 50% declared using a resorbable continuous suture technique for the reparation.

Physical models have shown great potential for teaching anatomy and enhancing surgical skills. In this article, we introduce an innovative physical anatomy model called \"Pelvic+\" to teach anatomical relationships in the female pelvis. The Pelvic+ model's value was compared to a traditional lecture in 61 first-year midwifery students randomly allocated to either the Pelvic+ (n = 30) or a control group (n = 32). The primary outcome measure was a quiz comprised of 15 multiple choice questions on pelvic anatomy. Participants were assessed at baseline (Pre-Test), upon completion of the intervention (Post-Test1) and 4 months afterward (Post-Test2). Satisfaction with the approach was assessed at Post-Test1. Increase in knowledge was greater and the approach more accepted among resident midwives when Pelvic+ was used instead of standard lectures. Four months after the intervention, the improvement in knowledge was preserved in the Pelvic+ group. This randomized study demonstrates that the Pelvic+ simulator is more effective than classical learning for pelvic anatomy education, and offers a higher level of satisfaction among students during the educational process. Medical students training in obstetrics and gynecology, or any professional who specializes in the female pelvic floor might also benefit from incorporation of the Pelvic+ model into their training program.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37312278/"}

Among 592 eligible resident participants, 387 (65%) responded to the post-intervention survey. Workshop facilitators submitted 65 surveys (47% response) on curriculum elements, rating the activities as 'good' or 'excellent' in 90.8% of cases. Qualitative analysis of workshop facilitators' and resident comments pointed to three themes, namely disagreement about the purpose of the curriculum, the social value of the curriculum in the residency programme and the need to open a broader discussion and take action to address structural barriers to wellness. Residents and faculty members involved in a wellness curriculum pilot had polarised reactions. While participants found value in learning skills and connecting to colleagues, efforts to promote wellness skills should be accompanied by communication and action to address drivers of burnout.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33969629/"}

Almost all published work concentrates on content validity and generalizability. However, an assessment system needs construct validity, and has to have practicability and acceptability, without sacrificing fitness for purpose, content validity or inter-rater reliability. This was a six-year study of the first UK-wide hospital-based multi-source feedback system, in the specialty of obstetrics and gynaecology. This paper describes the development of the assessment tool, its use and the analyses of the results in several areas. These are picking up poor performance, congratulating good behaviour, construct validity, the number of domains to be measured, and the minimum number of raters. The study demonstrated that the Team Observation system in reality only measured a very limited number of attributes, and that the main construct under scrutiny is interpersonal behaviour. The system can identify those who may have a problem, using less than 10 raters, and yet the process can be a positive experience for the large majority of people who have been assessed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17594543/"}

This was a \"Before and After\" study conducted in two French academic hospitals in 2015-2017. Gynaecology and urology residents were given open access to a FLS BT during a six-month surgical rotation. Residents in the first group (Before group) trained on the BT while receiving classic companionship. Residents in the second group (After group) had to complete the FLS curriculum before they were allowed to participate in laparoscopic procedures as a primary operator. Outcomes measures were the time to curriculum completion and the intracorporeal suturing performances based on two validated assessment tools (FLS and GOALS scores). Twenty-one surgical residents were included. All but two residents in the Before group completed the curriculum. The time to curriculum completion was longer in the Before group than the After group (69.5 days versus 28 days, P=0.001). Post-curriculum performances were lower in the Before group than in the After group for the FLS scores (452.5 versus 496, P=0.01) and the GOALS scores (14.5 versus 18, P=0.01). The mandatory completion of a BT curriculum prior to receiving active companionship in the OR is beneficial to residents in reducing time to curriculum completion and in enhancing laparoscopic skills on the BT.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29408606/"}

An accurate report is essential for the optimal care of women, especially those presenting myomas. The goal of this study was to evaluate the quality of gynaecological ultrasound reports for women with type 0 to 2 uterine myomas, referring to the items contained in the French guidelines. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted from reports of ultrasounds performed in private offices and in the gynaecologic department of a hospital, between June 2014 and June 2016 (before the report of CNGOF). These reports involved women who underwent hysteroscopic resection of myoma(s). A search of validated items was conducted for all of the reports, and the missing items were analysed. The different types of practitioners and between hospital and private medical offices were also compared with Chi-square tests. A total of 138 reports were analysed; 71 were performed in private offices and 67 were performed in the gynaecologic unit of the hospital. Many items were missing in the reports, with disparities between the type of institution (private offices or hospital) and the speciality of practitioners (radiologists or gynaecologists). Specific items regarding myomas, such as the International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) classification or measurement of the posterior wall, were more often missing in reports from radiologists (89.7% and 79.5%, respectively) than in reports from gynaecologists (21.2% and 34.3%, respectively) (P<0.05). A significant difference was also observed for these data between private offices' reports and hospitals' reports. Items relative to ultrasound structures, such as the appearance of myomas or associated abdominal effusion, were more frequently missing in gynaecologists' reports (88.9% and 49.5%, respectively) compared to radiologists' reports (56.4% and 12.8%, respectively) (P<0.05). Certain items are present in all the reports, while others are insufficiently mentioned. These inequalities can be explained in part by the type of practice; however, methods to overcome these difficulties must be developed. Information campaigns to educate professionals on the minimum reporting and training conducted jointly by radiologists and gynaecologist surgeons might improve reports and improve the care of women.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28643658/"}

The survey collected data on demographics, timing, reasons for choosing obstetrics and gynecology, and changes in concerns from pre- to post-senior residency. The survey received 2049 responses out of 2458 distributed surveys, resulting in a response rate of 83.9% (60.6% female, 39.4% male). Moreover, 52.4% of respondents initially considered obstetrics and gynecology during medical school, with females more likely to consider it before medical school than males (24.8% vs. 17.3%). Clinical clerkship experience was the most common reason (57.7%), particularly among females compared to males (62.3% vs. 50.5%). However, males were more influenced by family members or relatives (6.9% vs. 13.1%) and lectures (8.6% vs. 12.6%) than females. Pre-residency concerns-physical burden, mental burden, night on-call demands, marriage and family planning, career path planning, litigation risks, and workforce shortages-were higher in females than in males, although these concerns decreased significantly post-residency, excluding those regarding workforce shortages and income.

Reliable assessment and monitoring of these intimate conditions is challenging. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) can be invaluable in providing objective assessment, but no comprehensive PROM assessing all of these conditions and their impact on quality of life is currently available. The purpose of this study was to develop and undertake initial psychometric testing of a comprehensive interactive electronic patient reported outcome measure for these conditions. A prototype electronic PROM (ePAQ-MPH) was developed following systematic literature review, semi structured interviews with 25 patients and expert panel review. Exploratory factor analysis was undertaken in 291 women attending a menstrual-disorders clinic; establishing a domain structure and enabling item reduction. Two validated PROMS (Women's Health Questionnaire and Menstrual Distress Questionnaire) were completed to assess criterion validity in 213 patients. Test-retest reliability was carried out in 30 women completing ePAQ-MPH at least one week apart. Patients' views on 'Value' and 'Burden' were assessed in 278 women using a validated 10-item survey measuring questionnaire utility (QQ-10). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the revised version of ePAQ-MPH following item reduction was undertaken in a different sample of 254 women. Exploratory factor analysis identified 18 domains (Cronbach's α > 0.7) and 30 redundant items. Test-retest analysis found acceptable intra-class correlations of 0.6-0.9 (p < 0.05). Eight domains were compared with Menstrual Distress Questionnaire showing moderate or strong correlation in seven domains. Ten domains were compared with Women's Health Questionnaire, six of which showed moderate correlation. Mean QQ-10 Value and Burden scores were 76 and 25, respectively (SD=15.8 and 15.5). The mean completion time for ePAQ-MPH was 31 min. CFA of the revised version 2 instrument with 15 domains showed good model fit. Whilst wider psychometric testing of the revised version of ePAQ-MPH is required, including in different settings and in assessments of data quality and responsiveness, initial analysis provides some evidence for reliability, validity and acceptability of this multi-dimensional electronic PROM. ePAQ-MPH shows potential for both patient assessment and roles in service evaluation and research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31132692/"}

The percentage of residents who went through our program, participated in the NRMP, and obtained fellowships did not differ significantly from the percentage of residents who matched without participating in the program. However, almost one-third of the residents who went through our program did not participate in the NRMP. The reasons for their lack of participation were not formally evaluated, but are likely related to a personal decision to pursue another carrer pathway, a decision facilitiated by their experience in our program. Therefore, it appears that the main benefits of the program are to help potential candidates decide whether or not to pursue a career in gyencologic oncology and to aid fellowship programs in identifying exceptional candidates for subspecialty training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11695806/"}

Yet, we know very little about how best to prepare graduates for the full scope of independent practice, beyond ensuring clinical competence. Thus, we explored the transition to independent practice (TTP) experiences of recent Obstetrics and Gynaecology graduates to understand potential gaps in their perceived readiness for practice. Using constructivist grounded theory, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 Obstetricians/Gynaecologists who graduated from nine Canadian residency programs within the last five years. Iterative data collection and analysis led to the development of key themes. Five key themes encompassed different practice gaps experienced by participants throughout their transition. These practice gaps fit into five competency domains: providing clinical care, such as managing unfamiliar low-risk ambulatory presentations; navigating logistics, such as triaging referrals; managing administration, such as hiring or firing support staff; reclaiming personhood, such as boundary-setting between work and home; and bearing ultimate responsibility, such as navigating patient complaints. Mitigating factors were found to widen or narrow the extent to which new graduates experienced a practice gap. There was a shared sense among participants that some practice gaps were impossible to resolve during training. Existing practice gaps are multi-dimensional and perhaps not realistically addressed during residency. Instead, TTP mentorship and training opportunities must extend beyond residency to ensure that new graduates are equipped for the full breadth of independent practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39114783/"}

The students (226) from two universities completed anonymous questionnaires providing measures of state and trait anxiety and anxiety and confidence feelings, before and after conducting their first bimanual and speculum examination. This took place during a structured, self-directed learning session and involved examination of a professional patient. Students state anxiety was significantly elevated immediately before and fell to below baseline levels after the examination (p < 0.001). Students' reported feelings of increased confidence during the examination (p < 0.001). Students who had personally had a Pap smear test were most anxious before (p < 0.003) but during the examination, students who had experienced a gynecological exam felt less anxious (p < 0.002). The students experiencing the greatest decreases (before to after) in state anxiety were those who had never experienced sexual intercourse (p < 0.005). Most students (96%), particularly those who were more anxious during the examination (p < 0.001) and who experienced a greater decrease in anxiety from before to after the examination (p < 0.008) would recommend this method of learning to other students.

Various aspects of the gynecologic care of transgender patients, including health maintenance and cancer screening examinations, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, and referral and collaboration with the patient's care team, are outlined. Transgender patients are more likely to be engaged and seek care if their identity and their needs are understood. While many aspects of transgender health care follow standard practices, there are significant and important differences, including gender-affirming therapies.

The gynecologist Isaac Baker Brown (1811-1873) and the distinguished endocrinologist Charles Brown-Séquard (1817-1894) advocated clitoridectomy to prevent the progression to masturbatory melancholia, paralysis, blindness and even death. Even after the public disgrace of Baker Brown in 1866-7, the operation remained respectable and widely used in other parts of Europe. This medical contempt for normal female sexual development was reflected in public and literary attitudes. Or perhaps it led and encouraged public opinion. There is virtually no novel or opera in the last half of the 19th century where the heroine with 'a past' survives to the end. H. G. Wells's Ann Veronica and Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier, both of which appeared in 1909, broke the mould and are important milestones. In the last 50 years new research into the sociology, psychology and physiology of sexuality has provided an understanding of decreased libido and inadequate sexual response in the form of hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

A total of 155 questionnaires were returned, 143 completed and 12 indicating not having foundation doctors. Whilst about 50 % of respondents ranked the competencies of foundation year doctors as similar to that of the former senior house officer grade, the ratings were down in areas specific to obstetrics and gynaecology, such as seeing new patients in antenatal clinic, and up in general terms such as communication. General comments highlighted differences in ability and role and suggested longer attachments and less frequent changes in training structure. The study highlighted the need to focus on teaching generic skills in shorter durations and reflection on whole-patient management, which are relevant to all specialities. It underlined the impact of more frequent change of doctors on service delivery and recommended having a further look at foundation training programme before making any future changes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25001572/"}

The study looked at residents' attitudes towards four guidelines that support vaginal and assisted delivery (vaginal birth after caesarean section, induction of labour, operative vaginal birth, and fetal health surveillance in labour) and towards Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines in general. The study also sought to investigate whether these attitudes vary by residency training location. An online survey of obstetrics and gynaecology residents across Canada was conducted. Residents responded to statements derived from guidelines using a five-point attitudinal scale and to an optional long-answer question about how residency has prepared them to make decisions around interventions. Descriptive summary statistics are used to present the findings (Canadian Task Force Classification III). A total of 27% of residents completed the survey. The majority demonstrated attitudes congruent with guidelines and favourable towards SOGC guidelines in general. Residents attitudes were least favourable towards electronic fetal monitoring, with 67.4% of responses congruent with the guideline. Attitudes were most aligned with the operative vaginal birth guideline, with 87.9% of responses congruent with the guideline. This sample was underpowered to detect statistically significant differences among residency programs, although there was some variation in attitudes across programs, with the most congruent scoring program at 81.8% congruent responses and the lowest at 66.7%.

Whole population data were updated on a rolling basis from the earliest year of reliable data (1973) to the most recent year (2012). The total number of full-time ob-gyn faculty increased from 922 in 1973 to 4,208 in 2012. The increase in proportion of faculty who were women (from 9.9% to 52.7%) contributed to the growth of underrepresented faculty (from 7.7% to 13.3%) during this period. Percentages of ob-gyn faculty who were women and underrepresented in 2012 were higher than in other core clinical departments and similar to those of current medical student matriculants.

Sixty percent of respondents were male, most ranged between 30 and 60 years of age and more than half performed 5-10 major surgeries per week. More than half of respondents (53.9%) deferred the End of Life discussion until the patient had sustained a major change in functional and/or medical status. Thirty percent initiated it at the first recurrence or progression of disease. Forty three percent of respondents characterized the discussion as an on-going process. Patients' age, social support, health insurance, and co-morbidities had no influence on the discussion, and neither did the tumor's site of origin or grade. More respondents initiated the discussion in advanced stage cancer (57%) and after salvage chemotherapy institution (54%). Forty four percent of respondents reported that \"understanding and acceptance\" was the initial response by patient when counseled about withdrawal of care. This increased to 86% when the issue was revisited. Confusion or reluctance to discuss the subject were initially reported to be 12% and 19%, respectively, but decreased to 2% and 3%, respectively, when withdrawal of care was subsequently addressed with the patient.

His family was well known for having many well educated members including lawyers, doctors, and priests. The last member of their family was Giacomo who committed suicide few years after the Second World War. According to now known facts, we can say that Dr Valen Lucas was the first doctor in Rijeka who specialised in gynaecology, obstetrics and venereology, with the reputation and knowledge from working in Trieste and Vienna. In Rijeka he established his private practice that was visited by patients of different social backgrounds, which we can find in Dr Valentin Lucas' medical records. Just before Ester in 1909, he accepted a job offer as a one year substitute for Dr Manzini, who was a police-doctor for Harbour Master's Office in Pula. Pula by that time had already established an image of a strategic military Austrian-Hungarian port. In hope for a better life thousands of residents moved to already overpopulatedPula. As their new environment could not render their hopes, many were drawn to refuge in immorality and women in prostitution. Dr Lucas had been fighting against prostitution in Pula, especially against secret prostitution, because that was one of his main goals as a doctor. Though his task was not easy, because there were no organised sanitary and administrative services for that popular social deviation.

All obstetric and gynaecology registrars working in New Zealand were invited by their clinical directors to participate in an online survey in March-June 2011. Statistical analysis, using Fisher's Exact and chi-squared tests, was used to investigate how demographic, experience and encourager variables were associated with academic interest. Of the 58 participants, 46 were women, 32 were New Zealand medical graduates and 43 were on the training program. Over half (54%) indicated they would consider a 1-year rotating research/teaching position and 45% an academic career. The most important encouraging factors for academic work were interest, opportunity to balance clinical and academic roles, job flexibility (lifestyle and family) and a supportive academic environment. Women were nearly nine times more likely to consider academic training (OR 8.75, P = 0.007), and trainees were one-third as likely to consider it compared to non-trainees (OR 0.31, P = 0.073).

Most trainees (93.9% of respondents) were aware of the CanMEDS HA role and that it is a training objective (92.9%). Only 52.4% had clear objectives while 58.4% understood the role requirements. Most trainees (95.1% of respondents) felt HA was important to address during training. Only 30.4% had HA training, and just 36.3% felt their training needs were addressed. Training included teaching sessions (11.9%), clinical teaching (4.7%), and role modelling (4.7%). Although 82.9% of respondents had HA opportunities with patients, there were fewer opportunities at community (45.1%) and societal (30.0%) levels. Awareness of community groups and activities was low (28.6%), and few (20.0%) had participated in community advocacy programs during their residency. Incorporating advocacy activities into training was valued (80.0%). Many residents supported mandatory HA training (60.0%), more training time on HA experiences (66.3%), and HA experiences during protected time (71.3%). Awareness of and interest in the HA role is high, but clear objectives and training are lacking or inadequate. A standardized curriculum would ensure health advocacy exposure and emphasize active participation in community and societal activities. Trainees support this training during protected time.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23870779/"}

A 30-question survey was sent to all obstetrics and gynecology and family practice residency program directors. The survey included questions about the didactic nature of the colposcopy curriculum, the type of supervision, how resident skills are evaluated, estimates of the numbers and types of patients evaluated, the numbers and types of procedures being done by each resident, and the program director's perception of residents' competence in colposcopy. The overall response rate was 485 of 752 program directors (64.5%). Significantly fewer family practice than obstetrics and gynecology program directors thought they had adequate numbers of colposcopy patients to train their residents. By their program directors' estimates, 86% of family practice residents evaluate 10 or fewer patients with high-grade lesions (versus 16.5% of obstetrics and gynecology residents); 51.4% evaluate 10 patients or fewer with low-grade lesions (versus 6.7% of obstetrics and gynecology residents), and 40.6% evaluate 10 patients or fewer with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (versus 3% of obstetrics and gynecology residents). Experience with vulvar disease is also limited. Program directors thought their residents' colposcopy skills were roughly comparable with their general obstetrics and gynecology skills. It is possible that many program directors underestimate the number of colposcopic examinations required to achieve and maintain colposcopic skills. Many training programs have insufficient clinical volume to properly train residents in colposcopy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11518918/"}

We conducted multivariable, ordinal logistic regression with general estimating equations to determine individual-level and resident-reported, program-level correlates of quantity of uterine evacuation procedures done during residency. Three hundred sixty-two residents provided data, representing 161 of the 240 residency programs contacted. Access to training in elective abortion was available to most respondents: 54% reported routine training--where abortion training was routinely scheduled; 30% reported opt-in training--where training was available but not routinely integrated; and 16% reported that elective abortion training was not available. Residents in programs with routine elective abortion training and those who intended to do abortions before residency did a greater number of first-trimester manual uterine aspiration and second-trimester dilation and evacuation procedures than those without routine training. Similarly, routine, integrated training, even for indications other than elective abortion, correlated with more clinical experience (all p<.01, odds ratio and confidence interval shown below). There is a strong independent relationship between routine training and greater clinical experience with uterine aspiration procedures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24461206/"}

This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based online survey aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the residency training program in Obstetrics and Gynecology. The questionnaire consisted of five sections: demographic details, information regarding COVID-19 status, clinical work load, teaching and research, and psychological impact. The questionnaire was completed by 280 OBG trainees from different medical colleges from India. Training activity in general was reduced considerably during the pandemic, according to 79.6% (n = 223) respondents. According to 13.21% (n = 37) and 5% (n = 14) respondents, reduction in training activity were due to cancelation of elective operations and reduced patient foot fall respectively. In 74.3% (n = 208) of cases, trainees reported worry about meeting the goals of their specialty training. Logistic regression showed that the extent of training reduction was not significantly associated with residents' age (p = 0.806), gender (p = 0.982), marital status (p = 0.363), and status of their duty in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals (p = 0.110). However, year of residency was a significant predictor of the perception about degree of training reduction. The pandemic imposed a significant impact on OBG residency training in India. During the pandemic, exposure to learning opportunities, surgeries, and teaching were reduced, which may result in a decline in the quality of care offered to women in the future if training deficit is not overcome. At the same time, pandemic also gave birth to newer insights of learning and interaction by online mode.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35580870/"}

It is difficult to diagnose PID because of the variability in the presentation of the disease. The revised guideline is a solid guide in the diagnostic process. History taking and physical examination are the most important diagnostic techniques, but require experience. Any diagnostic uncertainty justifies the consultation ofa specialist. The value ofsupplementary diagnostics in a specialist setting is limited. In case of suspected PID, cervical material should always be cultured for Chlamydia trackomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, even if treatment has already been started. Laparoscopy is considered to be the gold standard in the diagnosis of PID. but is only performed if other methods do not suffice. Fast and adequate treatment considerably decreases the risk of serious complications, such as fertility disorders. Therefore, adequate antibiotic therapy covering at least the above-mentioned pathogens should be started if other causes of abdominal pain, such as ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis and torsion of the adnexal mass, have been excluded.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17471772/"}
