The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders. Methods: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach. Findings: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247–308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8–9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34–44] and DALYs by 15% [9–21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26–30] and DALYs by 27% [24–31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6–46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7–20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0–12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6–10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05–1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8–35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8–17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable). Interpretation: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The reeler heterozygous mouse (+/rl) appears superficially normal but has been of interest as an animal model for psychosis since the discovery that reelin is 50% down-regulated in postmortem psychotic brain. Brain abnormalities in +/rl are similar to psychotic brain and include a reduction in glutamic acid de carboxylase 67 (GAD67), dendritic arbors and spine density in cortex and hippocampus, and abnormalities in synaptic function including long-term potentiation (LTP). In spite of these abnormalities, behavioral abnormalities in +/rl are subtle and controversial. Recent findings indicate that the reelin (RELN) and GAD67 promoters are hypermethylated in GABAergic neurons of psychotic postmortem brain and that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is up-regulated. Hypermethlyation of RELN and GAD67 promoters can be induced by treating mice with methionine, and these mice display brain and behavioral abnormalities similar to +/rl. Thus, an animal model that combines genetic heterozygocity with epigenesis holds promise for understanding the role of Reelin down-regulation in psychosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000444713", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2320983896", "source": "openalex"}

It is increasingly apparent that there are significant limitations to these criteria, which only address the contrast-enhancing component of the tumor. For example, chemoradiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastomas results in transient increase in tumor enhancement (pseudoprogression) in 20% to 30% of patients, which is difficult to differentiate from true tumor progression. Antiangiogenic agents produce high radiographic response rates, as defined by a rapid decrease in contrast enhancement on CT/MRI that occurs within days of initiation of treatment and that is partly a result of reduced vascular permeability to contrast agents rather than a true antitumor effect. In addition, a subset of patients treated with antiangiogenic agents develop tumor recurrence characterized by an increase in the nonenhancing component depicted on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. The recognition that contrast enhancement is nonspecific and may not always be a true surrogate of tumor response and the need to account for the nonenhancing component of the tumor mandate that new criteria be developed and validated to permit accurate assessment of the efficacy of novel therapies. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group is an international effort to develop new standardized response criteria for clinical trials in brain tumors. In this proposal, we present the recommendations for updated response criteria for high-grade gliomas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.26.3541", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162643152", "source": "openalex"}

We developed a neurologic examination and have correlated changes in neurologic status with the size and location of areas of infarction. The MCA was surgically occluded at different sites in six groups of normal rats. After 24 hr, rats were evaluated for the extent of neurologic deficits and graded as having severe, moderate, or no deficit using a new examination developed for this model. After rats were sacrificed the incidence of infarction was determined at histologic examination. In a subset of rats, the size of the area of infarction was measured as a percent of the area of a standard coronal section. Focal (1-2 mm) occlusion of the MCA at its origin, at the olfactory tract, or lateral to the inferior cerebral vein produced infarction in 13%, 67%, and 0% of rats, respectively (N = 38) and produced variable neurologic deficits. However, more extensive (3 or 6 mm) occlusion of the MCA beginning proximal to the olfactory tract--thus isolating lenticulostriate end-arteries from the proximal and distal supply--produced infarctions of uniform size, location, and with severe neurologic deficit (Grade 2) in 100% of rats (N = 17). Neurologic deficit correlated significantly with the size of the infarcted area (Grade 2, N = 17, 28 +/- 5% infarction; Grade 1, N = 5, 19 +/- 5%; Grade 0, N = 3, 10 +/- 2%; p less than 0.05). We have characterized precise anatomical sites of the MCA that when surgically occluded reliably produce uniform cerebral infarction in rats, and have developed a neurologic grading system that can be used to evaluate the effects of cerebral ischemia rapidly and accurately. The model will be useful for experimental assessment of new therapies for irreversible cerebral ischemia.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.str.17.3.472", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2125683177", "source": "openalex"}

The ADC of in vivo water differed from the diffusion coefficient of pure water.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W4210575617", "title": "Neurological associations of COVID-19", "text": "SummaryBackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.Recent developmentsA growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin.Where next?Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s1474-4422(20)30221-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4210575617", "source": "openalex"}

For further explanation of the clarifications and changes in this revision, see the accompanying article (Kirshblum S., et al. J Spinal Cord Med. 2011:doi 10.1179/107902611X13186000420242 The spinal cord is the major conduit through which motor and sensory information travels between the brain and body. The spinal cord contains longitudinally oriented spinal tracts (white matter) surrounding central areas (gray matter) where most spinal neuronal cell bodies are located. The gray matter is organized into segments comprising sensory and motor neurons. Axons from spinal sensory neurons enter and axons from motor neurons leave the spinal cord via segmental nerves or roots. In the cervical spine, there are 8 nerve roots. Cervical roots of C1-C7 are named according to the vertebra above which they exit (i.e. C1 exits above the C1 vertebra, just below the skull and C6 nerve roots pass between the C5 and C6 vertebrae) whereas C8 exists between the C7 and T1 vertebra; as there is no C8 vertebra. The C1 nerve root does not have a sensory component that is tested on the International Standards Examination. The thoracic spine has 12 distinct nerve roots and the lumbar spine consists of 5 distinct nerve roots that are each named accordingly as they exit below the level of the respective vertebrae. The sacrum consists of 5 embryonic sections that have fused into one bony structure with 5 distinct nerve roots that exit via the sacral foramina. The spinal cord itself ends at approximately the L1-2 vertebral level. The distal most part of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The cauda equina is a cluster of paired (right and left) lumbosacral nerve roots that originate in the region of the conus medullaris and travel down through the thecal sac and exit via the intervertebral foramen below their respective vertebral levels. There may be 0, 1, or 2 coccygeal nerves but they do not have a role with the International Standards examination in accordance with the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI). Each root receives sensory information from skin areas called dermatomes. Similarly each root innervates a group of muscles called a myotome. While a dermatome usually represents a discrete and contiguous skin area, most roots innervate more than one muscle, and most muscles are innervated by more than one root. Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects conduction of sensory and motor signals across the site(s) of lesion(s), as well as the autonomic nervous system. By systematically examining the dermatomes and myotomes, as described within this booklet, one can determine the cord segments affected by the SCI. From the International Standards examination several measures of neurological damage are generated, e.g., Sensory and Motor Levels (on right and left sides), NLI, Sensory Scores (Pin Prick and Light Touch), Motor Scores (upper and lower limb), and ZPP. This booklet also describes the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale (AIS) to classify the severity (i.e. completeness) of injury. This booklet begins with basic definitions of common terms used herein. The section that follows describes the recommended International Standards examination, including both sensory and motor components. Subsequent sections cover sensory and motor scores, the AIS classification, and clinical syndromes associated with SCI. For ease of reference, a worksheet (Appendix 1) of the recommended examination is included, with a summary of steps used to classify the injury (Appendix 2).

It includes authoritative coverage of all the major areas related to behavioral neurology, neuropsychology, and neuropsychiatry. Each chapter, written by a world-renowned expert in the relevant area, provides an introductory background as well as an up-to-date review of the most recent developments. Clinical relevance is emphasized but is placed in the context of cognitive neuroscience, basic neuroscience, and functional imaging. Major cognitive domains such as frontal lobe function, attention and neglect, memory, language, prosody, complex visual processing, and object identification are reviewed in detail. A comprehensive chapter on behavioural neuroanatomy provides a background for brain-behaviour interactions in the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebullum. Chapters on temperolimbic epilepsy, major psychiatric syndromes, and dementia provide in-depth analyses of these neurobehavioral entities and their neurobiological coordinates. Changes for this second edition include the reflection throughout the book of the new and flourishing alliance of behavioral neurology, neuropsychology, and neuropsychiatry with cognitive science;major revision of all chapters; new authorship of those on language and memory; and the inclusion of entirely new chapters on psychiatric syndromes and the dementias. Both as a textbook and a reference work, the second edition of Principles of Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology represents an invaluable resource for behavioural neurologists, neuropsychologists, neuropsychiatrists, cognitive and basic neuroscientists, geriatricians, physiatrists, and their students and trainees.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195134759.001.0001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W611533172", "source": "openalex"}

Each child had been evaluated at 30 months of age. The children underwent standardized cognitive and neurologic assessments at six years of age. Disability was defined as severe (indicating dependence on caregivers), moderate, or mild according to predetermined criteria.Of 308 surviving children, 241 (78 percent) were assessed at a median age of six years and four months; 160 classmates delivered at full term served as a comparison group. Although the use of test reference norms showed that cognitive impairment (defined as results more than 2 SD below the mean) was present in 21 percent of the children born extremely preterm (as compared with 1 percent in the standardized data), this value rose to 41 percent when the results were compared with those for their classmates. The rates of severe, moderate, and mild disability were 22 percent, 24 percent, and 34 percent, respectively; disabling cerebral palsy was present in 30 children (12 percent). Among children with severe disability at 30 months of age, 86 percent still had moderate-to-severe disability at 6 years of age. In contrast, other disabilities at the age of 30 months were poorly predictive of developmental problems at 6 years of age.Among extremely preterm children, cognitive and neurologic impairment is common at school age. A comparison with their classroom peers indicates a level of impairment that is greater than is recognized with the use of standardized norms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa041367", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016693709", "source": "openalex"}

To explore this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated in which the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), under the regulatory control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene promoter, was overexpressed in the CNS. A number of transgenic founder mice and their offspring exhibited a neurologic syndrome the severity of which correlated with the levels of cerebral IL-6 expression. Transgenic mice with high levels of IL-6 expression developed severe neurologic disease characterized by runting, tremor, ataxia, and seizure. Neuropathologic manifestations included neuro-degeneration, astrocytosis, angiogenesis, and induction of acute-phase-protein production. These findings indicate that cytokines such as IL-6 can have a direct pathogenic role in inflammatory, infectious, and neurodegenerative CNS diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.21.10061", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080742766", "source": "openalex"}

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study provides such information but does not routinely aggregate results that are of interest to clinicians specialising in neurological conditions. In this systematic analysis, we quantified the global disease burden due to neurological disorders in 2015 and its relationship with country development level.We estimated global and country-specific prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) for various neurological disorders that in the GBD classification have been previously spread across multiple disease groupings. The more inclusive grouping of neurological disorders included stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, tetanus, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, brain and nervous system cancers, and a residual category of other neurological disorders. We also analysed results based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility, to identify patterns associated with development and how countries fare against expected outcomes relative to their level of development.Neurological disorders ranked as the leading cause group of DALYs in 2015 (250·7 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 229·1 to 274·7] million, comprising 10·2% of global DALYs) and the second-leading cause group of deaths (9·4 [9·1 to 9·7] million], comprising 16·8% of global deaths). The most prevalent neurological disorders were tension-type headache (1505·9 [UI 1337·3 to 1681·6 million cases]), migraine (958·8 [872·1 to 1055·6] million), medication overuse headache (58·5 [50·8 to 67·4 million]), and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (46·0 [40·2 to 52·7 million]). Between 1990 and 2015, the number of deaths from neurological disorders increased by 36·7%, and the number of DALYs by 7·4%. These increases occurred despite decreases in age-standardised rates of death and DALYs of 26·1% and 29·7%, respectively; stroke and communicable neurological disorders were responsible for most of these decreases. Communicable neurological disorders were the largest cause of DALYs in countries with low SDI. Stroke rates were highest at middle levels of SDI and lowest at the highest SDI. Most of the changes in DALY rates of neurological disorders with development were driven by changes in YLLs.Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, the burden of neurological disorders has increased substantially over the past 25 years because of expanding population numbers and ageing, despite substantial decreases in mortality rates from stroke and communicable neurological disorders. The number of patients who will need care by clinicians with expertise in neurological conditions will continue to grow in coming decades.

The diagnosis is difficult because clinical markers are often lacking, and symptoms usually precede the diagnosis of cancer or mimic other complications. The frequency of antineuronal antibodies in patients with PLE has not been investigated. We examined the neurological symptoms and the causal tumours in 50 patients with PLE to determine the utility of paraneoplastic antibodies and other tests. The diagnosis of PLE required neuropathological examination or the presence of the four following criteria: (i) a compatible clinical picture; (ii) an interval of <4 years between the development of neurological symptoms and tumour diagnosis; (iii) exclusion of other neuro-oncological complications; and (iv) at least one of the following: CSF with inflammatory changes but negative cytology; MRI demonstrating temporal lobe abnormalities; EEG showing epileptic activity in the temporal lobes. Of 1047 patients with neurological symptoms, whose sera or CSF were examined for paraneoplastic antibodies, 79 had the presumptive diagnosis of limbic encephalitis, dementia, cognitive dysfunction, or confusion. Fifty of these patients fulfilled our criteria for PLE. Pathological confirmation was obtained in 12 patients. The commonly associated neoplasms were of the lung (50%), testis (20%) and breast (8%). Neurological symptoms preceded the cancer diagnosis in 60% of patients (by a median of 3.5 months). Twenty-five of 44 (57%) patients with MRI studies had signal abnormalities in the limbic system. Thirty (60%) patients had antineuronal antibodies (18 anti-Hu, 10 anti-Ta, 2 anti-Ma), and 20 were antibody-negative or had uncharacterized antibodies (n = 4). The combination of symptoms, MRI findings and paraneoplastic antibodies established the diagnosis of PLE in 78% of the patients. Patients with anti-Hu antibodies usually had small-cell lung cancer (94%), multifocal neurological symptoms (78%) and a poor neurological outcome. Patients with anti-Ta (also called anti-Ma2) antibodies were young men with testicular tumours (100%), frequent hypothalamic involvement (70%) and a poor neurological outcome. In the group of patients without anti-Hu or anti-Ta antibodies, the tumour distribution was diverse, with cancer of the lung the most common (36%); 57% had positive MRI. Fifteen of 34 (44%) patients with a median follow-up of 8 months showed neurological improvement. Treatment of the tumour appeared to have more effect on the neurological outcome than the use of immune modulation. Improvement was observed in 38% of anti-Hu patients, 30% of anti-Ta patients and 64% of patients without these antibodies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/123.7.1481", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2143285990", "source": "openalex"}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified.In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil.In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94% or more (95% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93% sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85% sensitivity (95% CI, 76 to 94) and 73% specificity (95% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95% sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain.

Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment ofpatients up to age 25years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.12.758", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2905654445", "source": "openalex"}

Then, we discuss the desired device characteristics of the synaptic devices (e.g., multilevel states, weight update nonlinearity/asymmetry, variation/noise), and survey a few representative material systems and device prototypes reported in the literature that show the analog conductance tuning. These candidates include phase change memory, resistive memory, ferroelectric memory, floating-gate transistors, etc. Next, we introduce the crossbar array architecture to accelerate the weighted sum and weight update operations that are commonly used in the neuro-inspired machine learning algorithms, and review the recent progresses of array-level experimental demonstrations for pattern recognition tasks. In addition, we discuss the peripheral neuron circuit design issues and present a device-circuit-algorithm codesign methodology to evaluate the impact of nonideal device effects on the system-level performance (e.g., learning accuracy).

Results Mean neurological score and mean number of necrotic neurons in the cortex were more favorable after transient (30- to 60-minute) compared with permanent arterial occlusion ( P &lt;.005). Moreover, the correlation between mean neurological score and mean number of necrotic neurons was highly significant: r =.951; P &lt;.001. Conclusions The histological effects of an intracranial arterial occlusion in the adult rat can be predicted on day 1 by the neurological score described in this report. Significant improvement can be obtained in these animals by reestablishing arterial flow 60 minutes or sooner after the ictus. The pattern of cortical pannecrosis observed after permanent occlusion (≥72 hours) was transformed into incomplete ischemic injury in most instances of transient occlusion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.str.26.4.627", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013900800", "source": "openalex"}

We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis.MethodsFor this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism.FindingsAmong 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33·62% (95% CI 33·17–34·07), with 12·84% (12·36–13·33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46·42% (44·78–48·09) and for a first diagnosis was 25·79% (23·50–28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0·56% (0·50–0·63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97–2·23) for ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08–0·14) for parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59–0·75) for dementia, 17·39% (17·04–17·74) for anxiety disorder, and 1·40% (1·30–1·51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2·66% (2·24–3·16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17–7·76) for ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15–0·45) for parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31–2·30) for dementia, 19·15% (17·90–20·48) for anxiety disorder, and 2·77% (2·31–3·33) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40–1·47, for any diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68–1·89, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14–1·17, for any diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27–1·36, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 1·58, 1·50–1·67, for any diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45–3·35, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events.InterpretationOur study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.FundingNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(21)00084-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3148333766", "source": "openalex"}

Rule generation from artificial neural networks is gaining in popularity in recent times due to its capability of providing some insight to the user about the symbolic knowledge embedded within the network. Fuzzy sets are an aid in providing this information in a more human comprehensible or natural form, and can handle uncertainties at various levels. The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules. Finally, real-life application to medical diagnosis is provided.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/72.846746", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159111290", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2651525809", "title": "Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Clinical Trials", "text": "Development of novel therapies for CNS tumors requires reliable assessment of response and progression. This requirement has been particularly challenging in neuro-oncology for which contrast enhancement serves as an imperfect surrogate for tumor volume and is influenced by agents that affect vascular permeability, such as antiangiogenic therapies. In addition, most tumors have a nonenhancing component that can be difficult to accurately quantify. To improve the response assessment in neuro-oncology and to standardize the criteria that are used for different CNS tumors, the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group was established. This multidisciplinary international working group consists of neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, neuropsychologists, and experts in clinical outcomes assessments, working in collaboration with government and industry to enhance the interpretation of clinical trials. The RANO working group was originally created to update response criteria for high- and low-grade gliomas and to address such issues as pseudoresponse and nonenhancing tumor progression from antiangiogenic therapies, and pseudoprogression from radiochemotherapy. RANO has expanded to include working groups that are focused on other tumors, including brain metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, spine tumors, pediatric brain tumors, and meningiomas, as well as other clinical trial end points, such as clinical outcomes assessments, seizures, corticosteroid use, and positron emission tomography imaging. In an effort to standardize the measurement of neurologic function for clinical assessment, the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology scale was drafted. Born out of a workshop conducted by the Jumpstarting Brain Tumor Drug Development Coalition and the US Food and Drug Administration, a standardized brain tumor imaging protocol now exists to reduce variability and improve reliability. Efforts by RANO have been widely accepted and are increasingly being used in neuro-oncology trials, although additional refinements will be needed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2017.72.7511", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2651525809", "source": "openalex"}

Responding to this, a weekly virtual coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) neurology multi-disciplinary meeting was established at the National Hospital, Queen Square, in early March 2020 in order to discuss and begin to understand neurological presentations in patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disorders. Detailed clinical and paraclinical data were collected from cases where the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed through RNA PCR, or where the diagnosis was probable/possible according to World Health Organization criteria. Of 43 patients, 29 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and definite, eight probable and six possible. Five major categories emerged: (i) encephalopathies (n = 10) with delirium/psychosis and no distinct MRI or CSF abnormalities, and with 9/10 making a full or partial recovery with supportive care only; (ii) inflammatory CNS syndromes (n = 12) including encephalitis (n = 2, para- or post-infectious), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 9), with haemorrhage in five, necrosis in one, and myelitis in two, and isolated myelitis (n = 1). Of these, 10 were treated with corticosteroids, and three of these patients also received intravenous immunoglobulin; one made a full recovery, 10 of 12 made a partial recovery, and one patient died; (iii) ischaemic strokes (n = 8) associated with a pro-thrombotic state (four with pulmonary thromboembolism), one of whom died; (iv) peripheral neurological disorders (n = 8), seven with Guillain-Barré syndrome, one with brachial plexopathy, six of eight making a partial and ongoing recovery; and (v) five patients with miscellaneous central disorders who did not fit these categories. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological syndromes affecting the whole neuraxis, including the cerebral vasculature and, in some cases, responding to immunotherapies. The high incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, particularly with haemorrhagic change, is striking. This complication was not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease. Early recognition, investigation and management of COVID-19-related neurological disease is challenging. Further clinical, neuroradiological, biomarker and neuropathological studies are essential to determine the underlying pathobiological mechanisms that will guide treatment. Longitudinal follow-up studies will be necessary to ascertain the long-term neurological and neuropsychological consequences of this pandemic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa240", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3040794648", "source": "openalex"}

Three samples were utilized during short form development: general population (Internet-based, n = 2,113); clinical panel (Internet-based, n = 553); and clinical outpatient (clinic-based, n = 581). All short forms are expressed as T scores with a mean of 50 and SD of 10.Internal consistency (Cronbach α) of the 13 short forms ranged from 0.85 to 0.97. Correlations between short form and full-length item bank scores ranged from 0.88 to 0.99 (0.82-0.96 after removing common items from banks). Online respondents were asked whether they had any of 19 different chronic health conditions, and whether or not those reported conditions interfered with ability to function normally. All short forms, across physical, mental, and social health, were able to separate people who reported no health condition from those who reported 1-2 or 3 or more. In addition, scores on all 13 domains were worse for people who acknowledged being limited by the health conditions they reported, compared to those who reported conditions but were not limited by them.These 13 brief measures of self-reported QOL are reliable and show preliminary evidence of concurrent validity inasmuch as they differentiate people based upon number of reported health conditions and whether those reported conditions impede normal function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0b013e318258f744", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1985265957", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2411848313", "title": "Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimizing Motor Performance", "text": "This second edition of Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimizing Motor Performance provides a practical, task-oriented approach to rehabilitation for clients with neurological conditions, emphasizing active participation by clients and providing details of exercises and training to challenge them and help them regain the strength and endurance needed for independent living. In the new edition, authors Janet Carr and Roberta Shepherd have included updated scientific evidence as well as input from colleagues whose research and clinical expertise are also in this area of practice. Neurological Rehabilitation is also innovative in discussing the need to expand rehabilitation to increase opportunities for practice by including semi-supervised groups and circuit training in addition to traditional one-to-one interventions. The book is divided into three parts. Chapters 1–3 provide a foundation for understanding the role of neuro-rehabilitation in recovery. Chapter 1 reviews plasticity in the brain and the role of practice and challenge in brain reorganization; chapter 2 builds on this by discussing task-specific practice, the principles of motor learning, and clinical applications of these principles in neuro-rehabilitation. Chapter 3 provides an overview of measurement tools commonly used in neuro-rehabilitation. Part 2 devotes one chapter to each of the following specific actions required for independent living: standing up and sitting down, walking, reaching and manipulation, and balancing. Each chapter describes the action and the biomechanical factors, the motor dysfunction that occurs following neurological injury, and practical methods for training, focusing on repetitive task-oriented training, functional strength training of task-related muscles, and maximizing skills with practice and variety. The information on training is applicable to patient care, but because it focuses on clients who are able to perform the action, there is less guidance for working with those who are unable to do so, or who need to work on other tasks such as getting out of bed. Part 3 covers lesions to the motor and sensory–perceptual systems and includes detailed chapters on stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Each chapter discusses the pathology of the lesion or condition, resulting clinical features, training, and specific assessments. The recommended management consistently includes specific exercises and task-specific and aerobic training. Throughout, Carr and Shepherd also provide information on supplementary methods for rehabilitation, including mental practice, orthosis, electrostimulation, and computerized aids, and discuss the evidence-based benefits of including these methods in management strategies. Photos of exercises, clients, and clinicians working with clients complement the text and are helpful for applying the information clinically. Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimizing Motor Performance is an excellent book for a practical, task-oriented approach to neuro-rehabilitation, and I would recommend it as one of the key resources for working with clients with neurological conditions. However, additional resources may also be useful, since this book focuses on the task-oriented approach and offers little information or evidence on other approaches. Because of its rehabilitation focus, Neurological Rehabilitation will be most beneficial to physical therapy students, new graduates and experienced clinicians who work in neuro-rehabilitation, but other health care professionals and physical therapists in other settings may also find it helpful for the detailed information it provides on neurological injury and recovery. Overall, Neurological Rehabilitation balances evidence with clinical application, provides a foundation of knowledge for neuro-rehabilitation as well as methods for promoting motor learning and plasticity, and encourages readers to think about changing the delivery of therapy to enhance learning and recovery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3138/ptc.67.2.rev2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2411848313", "source": "openalex"}

Fatigue contributes substantially to decrements in quality of life and disability in these illnesses. Despite the clear impact of fatigue as a disabling symptom, our understanding of fatigue pathophysiology is limited and current treatment options rarely lead to meaningful improvements in fatigue. Progress continues to be hampered by issues related to terminology and assessment. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy and a novel assessment approach to addressing distinct aspects of fatigue and fatigability in clinical and research settings. This taxonomy is based on our current knowledge of the pathophysiology and phenomenology of fatigue and fatigability. Application of our approach indicates that the assessment and reporting of fatigue can be clarified and improved by utilizing this taxonomy and creating measures to address distinct aspects of fatigue and fatigability. We review the strengths and weaknesses of several common measures of fatigue and suggest, based on our model, that many research questions may be better addressed by using multiple measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,899 consecutive cerebral digital subtraction angiograms obtained with nonionic contrast material were prospectively evaluated. Neurologic complications were categorized as transient (<24 hours), reversible (24 hours to 7 days), and permanent (>7 days). The neurologic complication rate was correlated with patient age, type of indication for catheter angiography, medical history, fluoroscopic time, number and size of catheters, type and number of vessels injected, operator experience, and the quartile in which the study was performed. The correlations were statistically analyzed with Fisher exact tests and a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: There were 39 (1.3%) neurologic complications in 2,899 procedures; 20 were transient (0.7%), five (0.2%) were reversible, and 14 (0.5%) were permanent. Neurologic complications were significantly more common in patients 55 years of age or older (25 of 1,361; 1.8%) (P = .035), in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (20 of 862; 2.3%) (P = .004), and when fluoroscopic times were 10 minutes or longer (24 of 1,238; 1.9%) (P = .022). The neurologic complication rate was higher in procedures performed by fellows alone (24 of 1,878; 1.3%) compared with that when staff alone performed the procedures (three of 598; 0.5%), but the difference was not significant (P = .172). Neurologic complications were lower in the fourth quartile of the study (six of 171; 0.9%) compared with the first quartile (16 of 776; 2.1%), which was likely due to fewer patients being examined for carotid stenosis or ischemic stroke and fewer patients with CVD (P = .085). CONCLUSION: Age-related vascular disease accounted for the failure to lower the neurologic complication rate of cerebral angiography despite technical advances. © RSNA, 2003", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2272012071", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2169436924", "source": "openalex"}

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. <h3>Observations</h3> This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.2065", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3029172496", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we used GBD 2010 data to investigate time, year, region and age specific trends in burden due to mental, neurological and substance use disorders. Method For each disorder, prevalence data were assembled from systematic literature reviews. DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was used to model prevalence by country, region, age, sex and year. Prevalence data were combined with disability weights derived from survey data to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years lost to premature mortality (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying deaths occurring as a result of a given disorder by the reference standard life expectancy at the age death occurred. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Results In 2010, mental, neurological and substance use disorders accounted for 10.4% of global DALYs, 2.3% of global YLLs and, 28.5% of global YLDs, making them the leading cause of YLDs. Mental disorders accounted for the largest proportion of DALYs (56.7%), followed by neurological disorders (28.6%) and substance use disorders (14.7%). DALYs peaked in early adulthood for mental and substance use disorders but were more consistent across age for neurological disorders. Females accounted for more DALYs in all mental and neurological disorders, except for mental disorders occurring in childhood, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy where males accounted for more DALYs. Overall DALYs were highest in Eastern Europe/Central Asia and lowest in East Asia/the Pacific. Conclusion Mental, neurological and substance use disorders contribute to a significant proportion of disease burden. Health systems can respond by implementing established, cost effective interventions, or by supporting the research necessary to develop better prevention and treatment options.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116820", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2006103193", "source": "openalex"}

Both nuclei receive projections from the striatum with axons containing substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R), and immunoreactivities for these substances show complementary patterns in the striatum and SNr. In this study we revealed a similar complementarity in the mouse EPN, combined it with region-specific neuronal distributions, and defined subregions of the EPN. First, the EPN was divided into two areas, one showing low SP and high CB1R (lSP/hCB1R) immunoreactivities and the other showing opposite immunoreactivities (hSP/lCB1R). The former received inputs from the dorsolateral striatum that is innervated by sensorimotor cortices, whereas the latter received inputs from the medial striatum innervated by limbic/association cortices. Then, the lSP/hCB1R area was further divided into the dorsolateral subregion in the rostral EPN and the core subregion in the caudal EPN, the latter characterized by the concentration of parvalbumin-positive neurons targeting the VA-VL thalamic nucleus. The hSP/lCB1R area was divided into the ventromedial subregion in the rostral EPN and the shell subregion in the caudal EPN, the former characterized by the concentration of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons targeting the lateral habenula (LHb). Somatostatin-positive neurons targeting the LHb were located diffusely in three subregions other than the core. These findings illuminate structural organization inside the basal ganglia, suggesting mechanisms for sorting diverse information through parallel loops with differing synaptic modulation by CB1R. <b>Significance statement</b> The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in rodents corresponds to the internal segment of the globus pallidus in primates and is one of the major output nuclei of the basal ganglia. Because studies on the EPN are limited, we investigated the morphological features of the mouse EPN, focusing on the complementary immunoreactivities for substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R). The EPN was first divided into two parts, one showing low SP and high CB1R immunoreactivities and the other showing opposite immunoreactivities. Each part was further divided into two subregions based on the distributions of different neuronal types.

Significant differences were established between tension headache and migraine in respect of incidence and severity of symptoms and their time of onset in relation to the headache. In migraine, vestibulocochlear disturbances can occur as an aura, accompanying the headache or during headache-free periods, the highest incidence occurring during the headache. In Series I, 59 per cent reported vestibular and/or cochlear symptoms and these were of disabling severity in 5 per cent. Significantly, 50 per cent had a history of motion sickness and 81 per cent experienced phonophobia during the headache, the probable mechanism of which is discussed.

The experimental record indicates that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located in Broca's area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca's aphasia, does have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinatorial capacities necessary for language processing – for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion – are not supported by the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics. The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross-linguistic considerations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimaging and from structured observations on speech production of Broca's aphasics. Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human combinatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transformational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca's area.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x00002399", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2153590473", "source": "openalex"}

Further, available measures are generally expensive, normed on homogenous nondiverse populations, not easily administered, do not cover the lifespan (or have easily linked pediatric and adult counterparts for the purposes of longitudinal comparison), and not based on the current thinking in the neuroscience community. There is also a paucity of measurement tools to gauge normal children in the motor and sensation domain areas, and many of these measures rely heavily on proxy reporting. Investigators have expressed the need for brief assessment tools that could address these issues and be used as a form of \"common currency\" across diverse study designs and populations. This ability to assess functionality along a common metric and \"crosswalk\" across measures is essential to the process of being able to pool data, which is often necessary when a large and diverse sample is needed.

The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training.

Neoplasms included primary CNS lymphoma (15), systemic lymphoma with CNS involvement (12), and metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma (three). Cerebrovascular complications were seen in four patients with hemorrhage and five with infarction. Five patients in the UCSF series had multiple intracranial pathologies, including two cases of simultaneous Toxoplasma gondii infections and primary CNS lymphoma, two cases of coexistent Toxoplasma gondii and viral infections, and one case of combined Toxoplasma gondii and atypical mycobacterial infection.

We retrospectively studied 82 patients (65 women and 17 men) with neurologic manifestations associated with primary SS, as defined by the 2002 American-European criteria. The mean age at neurologic onset was 53 years. Neurologic involvement frequently preceded the diagnosis of SS (81% of patients). Fifty-six patients had CNS disorders, which were mostly focal or multifocal. Twenty-nine patients had spinal cord involvement (acute myelopathy [n = 12], chronic myelopathy [n = 16], or motor neuron disease [n = 1]). Thirty-three patients had brain involvement and 13 patients had optic neuropathy. The disease mimicked relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 10 patients and primary progressive MS in 13 patients. We also recorded diffuse CNS symptoms: some of the patients presented seizures (n = 7), cognitive dysfunction (n = 9), and encephalopathy (n = 2). Fifty-one patients had peripheral nervous system involvement (PNS). Symmetric axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with a predominance of sensory symptoms or pure sensory neuropathy occurred most frequently (n = 28), followed by cranial nerve involvement affecting trigeminal, facial, or cochlear nerves (n = 16). Multiple mononeuropathy (n = 7), myositis (n = 2), and polyradiculoneuropathy (n = 1) were also observed. Thirty percent of patients (all with CNS involvement) had oligoclonal bands. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in 61% of the patients tested. Fifty-eight patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Of these, 70% presented white matter lesions and 40% met the radiologic criteria for MS. Thirty-nine patients had a spinal cord MRI. Abnormalities were observed only in patients with spinal cord involvement. Among the 29 patients with myelopathy, 75% had T2-weighted hyperintensities. Patients with PNS manifestations had frequent extraglandular complications of SS. Anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies were detected in 21% of patients at the diagnosis of SS and in 43% of patients during the follow-up (mean follow-up, 10 yr). Biologic abnormalities were more frequently observed in patients with PNS involvement than in those with CNS involvement (p < 0.01). Fifty-two percent of patients had severe disability, and were more likely to have CNS involvement than PNS involvement (p < 0.001). Treatment by cyclophosphamide allowed a partial recovery or stabilization in patients with myelopathy (92%) or multiple mononeuropathy (100%). The current study underlines the diversity of neurologic complications of SS. The frequency of neurologic manifestations revealing SS and of negative biologic features, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why SS is frequently misdiagnosed. Screening for SS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, or cranial nerve involvement. The outcome is frequently severe, especially in patients with CNS involvement. Our study also underlines the efficacy of cyclophosphamide in myelopathy and multiple neuropathy occurring during SS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.md.0000141099.53742.16", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2083149517", "source": "openalex"}

A closely related experience is autoscopy (AS), which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body-part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information-as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space-is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awh040", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099202374", "source": "openalex"}

Severe complications are believed to be extremely rare, but the incidence is probably underestimated.A retrospective study of severe neurologic complications after central neuraxial blockades in Sweden 1990-1999 was performed. Information was obtained from a postal survey and administrative files in the health care system. During the study period approximately 1,260,000 spinal blockades and 450,000 epidural blockades were administered, including 200,000 epidural blockades for pain relief in labor.: The 127 complications found included spinal hematoma (33), cauda equina syndrome (32), meningitis (29), epidural abscess (13), and miscellaneous (20). Permanent neurologic damage was observed in 85 patients. Incidence of complications after spinal blockade was within 1:20-30,000 in all patient groups. Incidence after obstetric epidural blockade was 1:25,000; in the remaining patients it was 1:3600 (P < 0.0001). Spinal hematoma after obstetric epidural blockade carried the incidence 1:200,000, significantly lower than the incidence 1:3,600 females subject to knee arthroplasty (P < 0.0001).: More complications than expected were found, probably as a result of the comprehensive study design. Half of the complications were retrieved exclusively from administrative files. Complications occur significantly more often after epidural blockade than after spinal blockade, and the complications are different. Obstetric patients carry significantly lower incidence of complications. Osteoporosis is proposed as a previously neglected risk factor. Close surveillance after central neuraxial blockade is mandatory for safe practice.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200410000-00021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144449821", "source": "openalex"}

Reliable estimates of the prevalence of permanent sequelae and mortality associated with congenital CMV are needed to guide development of education and prevention programmes and to gauge the financial costs associated with this disease. To calculate such estimates, this review used data solely from studies in which children with congenital CMV were identified through universal screening. Based on 15 studies with a total of 117 986 infants screened, the overall CMV birth prevalence estimate was 0.7%. The percentage of infected children with CMV‐specific symptoms at birth was 12.7%. The percentage of symptomatic children with permanent sequelae was 40–58%. The percentage of children without symptoms at birth who developed permanent sequelae was estimated to be 13.5%. The true burden of congenital CMV infection is unclear because data on important outcomes, such as visual impairment, are lacking and follow‐up of infected children has been too short to fully identify late‐onset sequelae. Therefore, the estimates of permanent sequelae associated with congenital CMV presented here are likely underestimates. Future studies should extend follow‐up of CMV‐infected children identified through universal screening and include the evaluation of visual impairment.

At the onset of this research we had to confront squarely (and solve!) a critical question: If anatomy is destiny, can we influence it? Our efforts over the last five years have been focused on answering this question and we will present a few of our clinical results from over 2,000 hours of robot-aided therapy with 76 stroke patients. To determine if exercise therapy influences plasticity and recovery of the brain following a stroke, we needed the appropriate \"microscope\" that would allow us to concomitantly control the amount of therapy delivered to a patient, while objectively measuring patient's performance. Back-driveable robots are the key enabling technology. Our results to date using common clinical scales suggest that robot-aided sensorimotor training does have a genuinely positive effect on reduction of impairment and the reorganization of the adult brain. Yet while clinical scales can help us to examine the impact in the neuro-recovery process, their coarse nature requires extensive and time-consuming trials, and on top of that they fail to show us details important for optimizing therapy. Alternative, robot-based scales offer the potential benefit of new finer measurements-and deeper insight into the process of recovery from neurological injury. We also plan to use present technology to establish the practicality and economic feasibility of clinician-supervised, robot-administered therapy, including classroom therapy. We feel quite optimistic that the march of progress will accelerate substantially in the near future and allow us to transfer this technology from the research realm to the everyday treatment of stroke survivors.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1496737310", "source": "openalex"}

Usually, CNS pathologies are caused by known neurotropic viruses such as measles virus, herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus, among others. However, nowadays respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for CNS pathologies. Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the influenza virus (IV), the coronavirus (CoV), and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under five years old and also the elderly. Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms. The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or febrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies, and encephalitis. All these viruses have been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests that all these pathogens, once in the lungs, can spread throughout the body and eventually reach the CNS. The current knowledge about the mechanisms and routes used by these neuroinvasive viruses remains scarce.

The authors present their clinical experience with 17 dural AVM's in adults, including 10 cases with an aggressive neurological course (strictly defined as hemorrhage or progressive focal neurological deficit other than ophthalmoplegia). Two of these 10 patients died prior to surgical intervention and a third was severely disabled by intracerebral hemorrhage. Six patients underwent surgical resection of their dural AVM, with preparatory embolization in two cases. One patient received embolization and radiation therapy without surgery. Six of the seven cases without an aggressive neurological course were treated conservatively, and the seventh patient underwent embolization of a cavernous sinus dural AVM because of worsening ophthalmoplegia. In order to clarify features associated with aggressive behavior, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed on 360 additional dural AVM's reported in the literature with sufficiently detailed clinical and angiographic information. The location and angiographic features of 100 aggressive cases were compared to those of 277 benign cases. No location of dural AVM's was immune from aggressive neurological behavior; however, an aggressive neurological course was least often associated with cases involving the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and cavernous sinus and most often associated with cases at the tentorial incisura. Contralateral contribution to arterial supply and rate of shunting (high vs. low flow) did not correlate with aggressive neurological behavior as defined. Leptomeningeal venous drainage, variceal or aneurysmal venous dilations, and galenic drainage correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with aggressive neurological presentation. The latter three angiographic features often coexisted in the same dural AVM. It is concluded that these features significantly increase the natural risk of dural AVM's, and warrant a more vigilant therapeutic strategy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3171/jns.1990.72.6.0839", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110124299", "source": "openalex"}

The mesolimbic cortex is cytoarchitectonically, angioarchitectonically, and neurochemically distinct and, along with the striatum, forms the entire target area of dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons. This raises the possibility that autism is related to neuromediator imbalance in those structures.

Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.1264", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2805331168", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS One thousand consecutive cerebral angiographic procedures were evaluated prospectively. Examinations were performed using transfemoral catheterization and film-screen methods. For purposes of this trial, a neurologic complication was defined as any new focal neurologic deficit or change in mental status occurring during the angiogram or within the following 24 hours. Patients were evaluated during and at the completion of angiography. Follow-up evaluations were performed on the day of and the day after angiography. RESULTS There were a total of 10 neurologic complications within 24 hours of angiography, 5 of which were persistent. Onset of 5 of the deficits occurred during angiography, the other 5 (3 persistent) were delayed. All complications occurred in patients being evaluated for stroke/transient ischemic attack or (in one case) asymptomatic bruit. A higher average age, longer average procedure time, and greater volume of radiographic contrast was noted in these patients than in the study population. CONCLUSION Cerebral angiography was associated with a 1% overall incidence of neurologic deficit and a 0.5% incidence of persistent deficit. All complications occurred in patients presenting with a history of stroke/transient ischemic accident or carotid bruit, which may reflect the difficulty of performing angiography in this population at risk for atherosclerotic changes.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2319220716", "source": "openalex"}

IL-6 in plasma (&gt;21.5 pg/mL; OR 37.7, CI 11.9 to 118.8) or in CSF (&gt;6.3 pg/mL; OR 13.1, CI 2.2 to 77.3) were independent factors for early clinical worsening, with multiple logistic regression. The association was statistically significant in all ischemic stroke subtypes as well as in subjects with cortical or subcortical infarctions. IL-6 in plasma was highly correlated with body temperature, glucose, fibrinogen, and infarct volume. CSF and plasma concentrations of TNF-α were also higher in patients who deteriorated, but the differences observed did not remain significant on multivariate analysis. Conclusions —In addition to participating in the acute-phase response that follows focal cerebral ischemia, IL-6 levels on admission are associated with early clinical deterioration. The association between IL-6 and early neurological worsening prevails without regard to the initial size, topography, or mechanism of the ischemic infarction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/01.str.31.10.2325", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2132401640", "source": "openalex"}

Cox regression models were developed to analyze variables predictive of neurological complications and associated mortality. Three hundred forty patients (25%) experienced such complications: 192 patients (14%) had ischemic events, 86 (6%) had encephalopathy/meningitis, 60 (4%) had hemorrhages, and 2 (1%) had brain abscesses. Independent risk factors associated with all neurological complications were vegetation size ≥3 cm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.91), Staphylococcus aureus as a cause (HR 2.47), mitral valve involvement (HR 1.29), and anticoagulant therapy (HR 1.31). This last variable was particularly related to a greater incidence of hemorrhagic events (HR 2.71). Overall mortality was 30%, and neurological complications had a negative impact on outcome (45% of deaths versus 24% in patients without these complications; P<0.01), although only moderate to severe ischemic stroke (HR 1.63) and brain hemorrhage (HR 1.73) were significantly associated with a poorer prognosis. Antimicrobial treatment reduced (by 33% to 75%) the risk of neurological complications. In patients with hemorrhage, mortality was higher when surgery was performed within 4 weeks of the hemorrhagic event (75% versus 40% in later surgery).Moderate to severe ischemic stroke and brain hemorrhage were found to have a significant negative impact on the outcome of infective endocarditis. Early appropriate antimicrobial treatment is critical, and transitory discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy should be considered.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.112.000813", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964229213", "source": "openalex"}

This systematic review was performed with the objective of determining whether glucocorticoid therapy, to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia, impairs neuro-developmental outcomes in preterm infants. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Medline was searched and articles retrieved using predefined criteria. Data from randomized controlled trials with adequate neuro-developmental follow up (to at least one year) were entered into a meta-analysis to determine the effects of postnatal treatment of preterm infants with glucocorticoids. Cerebral palsy rates, and neuro-developmental impairment (developmental score more than 2SD below the mean, or cerebral palsy or blindness) were analyzed. The studies were divided into 2 groups according to the extent of contamination of the results by treatment of controls with steroids after the initial study period, those with less than 30% contamination, and those with more than 30% contamination or size of contamination not reported. Postnatal steroid therapy is associated with an increase in cerebral palsy and neuro-developmental impairment. The studies with less contamination show a greater effect of the steroids, consistent with a real direct toxic effect of steroids on the developing central nervous system. The typical relative risk for the development of cerebral palsy derived from studies with less than 30% contamination is 2.86 (95% CI 1.95, 4.19). The typical relative risk for the development of neuro-developmental disability among followed up infants from studies with less than 30% contamination is 1.66 (95% CI 1.26, 2.19). From this subgroup of studies, the number of premature infants who need to be treated to have one more infant with cerebral palsy (number needed to harm, NNH) is 7; to have one more infant with neuro-developmental impairment the NNH is 11. Postnatal pharmacologic steroid treatment for prevention or treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with dramatic increases in neuro-developmental impairment.

The influence of age and sex is largely unknown, and levels across neurological disorders have not been compared systematically to date. Objectives: To assess the associations of age, sex, and diagnosis with NfL in CSF (cNfL) and to evaluate its potential in discriminating clinically similar conditions. Data Sources: PubMed was searched for studies published between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2016, reporting cNfL levels (using the search terms neurofilament light and cerebrospinal fluid) in neurological or psychiatric conditions and/or in HC. Study Selection: Studies reporting NfL levels measured in lumbar CSF using a commercially available immunoassay, as well as age and sex. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Individual-level data were requested from study authors. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the fixed effects of age, sex, and diagnosis on log-transformed NfL levels, with cohort of origin modeled as a random intercept. Main Outcome and Measure: The cNfL levels adjusted for age and sex across diagnoses. Results: Data were collected for 10 059 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [18.8] years; 54.1% female). Thirty-five diagnoses were identified, including inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (n = 2795), dementias and predementia stages (n = 4284), parkinsonian disorders (n = 984), and HC (n = 1332). The cNfL was elevated compared with HC in a majority of neurological conditions studied. Highest levels were observed in cognitively impaired HIV-positive individuals (iHIV), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Huntington disease. In 33.3% of diagnoses, including HC, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease (AD), and Parkinson disease (PD), cNfL was higher in men than women. The cNfL increased with age in HC and a majority of neurological conditions, although the association was strongest in HC. The cNfL overlapped in most clinically similar diagnoses except for FTD and iHIV, which segregated from other dementias, and PD, which segregated from atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Conclusions and Relevance: These data support the use of cNfL as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage and indicate that age-specific and sex-specific (and in some cases disease-specific) reference values may be needed. The cNfL has potential to assist the differentiation of FTD from AD and PD from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.1534", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2950228559", "source": "openalex"}

These data indicate the presence of a thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which we propose is responsible for all the above mentioned conditions. This coherent θ activity, the result of a resonant interaction between thalamus and cortex, is due to the generation of low-threshold calcium spike bursts by thalamic cells. The presence of these bursts is directly related to thalamic cell hyperpolarization, brought about by either excess inhibition or disfacilitation. The emergence of positive clinical symptoms is viewed as resulting from ectopic γ-band activation, which we refer to as the “edge effect.” This effect is observable as increased coherence between low- and high-frequency oscillations, probably resulting from inhibitory asymmetry between high- and low-frequency thalamocortical modules at the cortical level.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.26.15222", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124698022", "source": "openalex"}

Nevertheless, survival for patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive glioma, although individually variable, has improved from an average of 10 months to 14 months after diagnosis in the last 5 years due to improvements in the standard of care. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment of these lesions for decades, and the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved greatly. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent with simple oral administration and a favorable toxicity profile, is used in conjunction with and after radiotherapy. Newer surgical techniques, such as fluorescence-guided resection and neuroendoscopic approaches, have become important in the management of malignant gliomas. Furthermore, new discoveries are being made in basic and translational research, which are likely to improve this situation further in the next 10 years. These include agents that block 1 or more of the disordered tumor proliferation signaling pathways, and that overcome resistance to already existing treatments. Targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic therapy with antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (bevacizumab) are finding their way into clinical practice. Large-scale research efforts are ongoing to provide a comprehensive understanding of all the genetic alterations and gene expression changes underlying glioma formation. These have already refined the classification of glioblastoma into 4 distinct molecular entities that may lead to different treatment regimens. The role of cancer stem-like cells is another area of active investigation. There is definite hope that by 2020, new cocktails of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in gliomas and reduce their mortality and morbidity, a positive development for patients, their families, and medical professionals alike.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.20069", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115862526", "source": "openalex"}

Finally, reference to the neuro–psychiatric disorders of autism, psychopathy and acquired sociopathy will be made. In these conditions, the appropriate processing of emotional expressions is impaired. In autism, it is argued that the basic response to emotional expressions remains intact but that there is impaired ability to represent the referent of the individual displaying the emotion. In psychopathy, the response to fearful and sad expressions is attenuated and this interferes with socialization resulting in an individual who fails to learn to avoid actions that result in harm to others. In acquired sociopathy, the response to angry expressions in particular is attenuated resulting in reduced regulation of social behaviour.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2002.1220", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109240438", "source": "openalex"}

We review evidence that the perception of social isolation (i.e., loneliness) impacts brain and behavior and is a risk factor for broad-based morbidity and mortality. However, the causal role of loneliness on neural mechanisms and mortality is difficult to test conclusively in humans. Mechanistic animal studies provide a lens through which to evaluate the neurological effects of a member of a social species living chronically on the social perimeter. Experimental studies show that social isolation produces significant changes in brain structures and processes in adult social animals. These effects are not uniform across the brain or across species but instead are most evident in brain regions that reflect differences in the functional demands of solitary versus social living for a particular species. The human and animal literatures have developed independently, however, and significant gaps also exist.

The secondary outcome was full recovery in 45% of patients, based on parental response. The primary and secondary outcome measures were moderately correlated ( P &lt; .001; K = 0.5). In bivariate analysis, arterial stroke type, male gender, age of at least 28 days, presence of associated neurologic disorders, and need for rehabilitation therapy after stroke were predictors of poor outcome ( P &lt; .05). Multivariate analysis showed that only arterial ischemic stroke, associated neurologic disorders, and presence of rehabilitation therapy were independent predictors of poor outcome ( P &lt; .02). Poor outcome in children after ischemic stroke is therefore frequent and more likely in the presence of arterial stroke, rehabilitation therapy, and associated neurologic disorders, which justifies clinical trials of treatment strategies in childhood ischemic stroke.

Most studies of moderate pesticide exposure have found increased prevalence of neurologic symptoms and changes in neurobehavioral performance, reflecting cognitive and psychomotor dysfunction. There is less evidence that moderate exposure is related to deficits in sensory or motor function or peripheral nerve conduction, but fewer studies have considered these outcomes. It is possible that the most sensitive manifestation of pesticide neurotoxicity is a general malaise lacking in specificity and related to mild cognitive dysfunction, similar to that described for Gulf War syndrome. Most studies have focused on organophosphate insecticides, but some found neurotoxic effects from other pesticides, including fungicides, fumigants, and organochlorine and carbamate insecticides. Pesticide exposure may also be associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease; several classes of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, have been implicated. Studies of other neurodegenerative diseases are limited and inconclusive. Future studies will need to improve assessment of pesticide exposure in individuals and consider the role of genetic susceptibility. More studies of pesticides other than organophosphates are needed. Major unresolved issues include the relative importance of acute and chronic exposure, the effect of moderate exposure in the absence of poisoning, and the relationship of pesticide-related neurotoxicity to neurodegenerative disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.7135", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1990502840", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, clinical trials of several neurodegenerative diseases have increasingly targeted the evaluation of the effectiveness of various antioxidants. The results so far are encouraging but variable and thus confusing. Rationale for the possible clinical effectiveness of antioxidants in several degenerative conditions has arisen out of the many years of basic science generally showing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage are important factors in the processes involved. Aging is one of the most significant risk factors for degenerative neurological disorders. Basic science efforts in our laboratory have centered on exploring the role of ROS and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative processes. The present review brings together some of the basic concepts we have learned by following this approach for the last 20 years and specifically the results we have obtained by following up on our serendipitous findings that a nitrone‐based free radical trap, α‐phenyl‐ tert ‐butylnitrone (PBN), has neuroprotective activity in several experimental neurodegenerative models. The mechanistic basis of the neuroprotective activity of PBN does not appear to rely on its general free radical trapping or antioxidant activity per se , but its activity in mediating the suppression of genes induced by pro‐inflammatory cytokines and other mediators associated with enhanced neuroinflammatory processes. Neuroinflammatory processes, induced in part by pro‐inflammatory cytokines, yield enhanced ROS and reactive nitric oxide species (RNS) as well as other unknown components that have neurotoxic properties. Neurotoxic amounts of RNS are formed by the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The demonstration of enhanced 3‐nitro‐tyrosine formation in affected regions of the Alzheimer's brain, in comparison to age‐matched controls, reinforces the importance of neuroinflammatory processes. iNOS induction involves activation by phosphorylation of the MAP kinase p38 and can be induced in cultured astrocytes by IL‐1β or H2O2. The action of PBN and N‐acetyl cysteine to suppress the activation of p38 was demonstrated in cultured astrocytes. The demonstration of activated p38 in neurons surrounding amyloid plaques in affected regions of the Alzheimer's brain attest to enhanced signal transduction processes in this neurodegenerative condition. The major themes of ROS and RNS formation associated with neuroinflammation processes and the suppression of these processes by antioxidants and PBN continue to yield promising leads for new therapies. Outcomes of clinical trials on antioxidants will become less confusing as more knowledge is amassed on the basic processes involved.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-1373.1999.d01-140.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070046033", "source": "openalex"}

DESIGN Retrospective case series SETTING Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).

Twelve of these cases resulted from spinal surgery, seven from epidural catheters, four from vascular lesions, three from anticoagulation medications, two from trauma, and two from spontaneous causes. Pain was the predominant initial symptom, and all patients developed neurological deficits. Eight patients had complete motor and sensory loss (Frankel Grade A); six had complete motor loss but some sensation preserved (Frankel Grade B); and 16 had incomplete loss of motor function (10 patients Frankel Grade C and six patients Frankel Grade D). The average interval from onset of initial symptom to maximum neurological deficit was 13 hours, and the average interval from onset of symptom to surgery was 23 hours. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in all patients; 26 of these improved; four remained unchanged, and no patients worsened (mean follow up 11 months). Complete recovery (Frankel Grade E) was observed in 43% of the patients and functional recovery (Frankel Grades D or E) was observed in 87%. One postoperative death occurred from a pulmonary embolus (surgical mortality 3%). Preoperative neurological status correlated with outcome; 83% of Frankel Grade D patients recovered completely compared to 25% of Frankel Grade A patients. The rapidity of surgical intervention also correlated with outcome; greater neurological recovery occurred as the interval from symptom onset to surgery decreased. Patients taken to surgery within 12 hours had better neurological outcomes than patients with identical preoperative Frankel grades whose surgery was delayed beyond 12 hours. This large series of SEH demonstrates that rapid diagnosis and emergency surgical treatment maximize neurological recovery. However, patients with complete neurological lesions or long-standing compression can improve substantially with surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3171/jns.1995.83.1.0001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2056954413", "source": "openalex"}

The median patient age was 12 years with nearly equal numbers of male and female patients. Cutaneous symptoms (sun sensitivity or freckling) had a median age of onset of between 1 and 2 years. Forty-five percent of the patients described had basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The median age of first nonmelanoma skin cancer among patients with xeroderma pigmentosum was 8 years, more than 50 years less than that among patients with skin cancer in the United States. Melanomas were reported in 5% of patients. Ninety-seven percent of the reported basal and squamous cell carcinomas and 65% of the melanomas in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum occurred on the face, head, or neck. Seventy percent probability of survival was attained at age 40 years, a 28-year reduction in comparison with the US general population. Ocular abnormalities were reported in 40% of the patients described and were restricted to tissues exposed to ultraviolet radiation (lid, conjunctiva, and cornea) and included ectropion, corneal opacity leading to blindness, and neoplasms. Neurologic abnormalities were found in 18% of the cases reported, consisting of progressive mental deterioration, hyporeflexia or areflexia, and progressive deafness in some patients in association with dwarfism and immature sexual development.

We evaluated patients with IE-associated neurologic complications and compared them with patients with IE who did not have neurologic symptoms. Particular attention was focused on assessing the impact of cardiac surgery and the presence of potential risk factors for complications on the outcome of the patients. <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 218 episodes designated as definite or possible IE according to Duke criteria and treated during the years 1980 through 1996 in a Finnish teaching hospital were retrospectively evaluated for neurologic manifestations. <h3>Results</h3> Neurologic complications were identified in 55 episodes (25%), with an embolic event as the most frequent manifestation (23/55; 42%). In the majority (76%) of episodes, the neurologic manifestation was evident before antimicrobial treatment was started, being the first sign of IE in 47% of episodes. Only 1 recurrent cerebral embolization was observed. Neurologic complications were significantly associated with<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>infection (29% vs 10%;<i>P</i>= .001) and with IE affecting both the aortic and the mitral valves (56% vs 23%;<i>P</i>&lt;.01), but not with echocardiographic detection of vegetations or anticoagulant therapy. Death during the acute phase of IE occurred in 13 episodes (24%) with neurologic complications and in 17 episodes (10%) without neurologic complications (<i>P</i>&lt;.03). In episodes with neurologic complications, the IE-associated mortality rate was 25% (10/40) in the medical treatment group and 20% (3/15) in the surgical group. No neurologic deterioration was observed in these surgically treated patients postoperatively. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results reinforce the belief that rapid diagnosis and initiation of antimicrobial therapy may still be the most effective means to prevent neurologic complications. These data underscore the importance of diagnostic alertness to the prognosis of patients with IE.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.160.18.2781", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983659762", "source": "openalex"}

A posttranslational process, as yet unidentified, converts the cellular prion protein into an abnormal isoform. Scrapie incubation times, neuropathology, and prion synthesis in transgenic mice are controlled by the prion protein gene.

Ligands for these receptors are also found. They include immunoglobulins, complement proteins of the classical pathway, T lymphocytes of the cytotoxic/suppressor and helper/inducer classes, and vitronectin. T lymphocytes marginate along capillary venules, with some penetrating into the tissue matrix. Immunoglobulins and complement proteins are synthesized locally in brain, although they may also come from the bloodstream if the blood‐brain barrier is compromised. The membrane attack complex, which is formed from C5b‐9, the terminal components of complement, has been identified in AD and multiple sclerosis brain tissue. In addition, proteins designed to defend against bystander lysis caused by the membrane attack complex, including protectin, C8 binding protein, clusterin, and vitronectin, are associated with damaged neuronal processes in AD.

However, the full spectrum of neurological syndromes associated with GAD-ab is not well established. In addition, these patients usually present type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) that could justify the presence of high GAD-ab levels. To clarify these issues, we reviewed the clinical and immunological features of patients in whom high GAD-ab levels were detected in a reference centre for DM1 and for the detection of antineuronal antibodies in suspected paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). High GAD-ab levels were defined as values > or =2000 U/ml by radioimmunoassay. Intrathecal synthesis (IS) of GAD-ab was calculated in paired serum/CSF samples. Values higher than the IgG index were considered indicators for positive GAD-ab-specific IS. High GAD-ab levels were identified in 61 patients, 22 (36%) had SPS, 17 (28%) cerebellar ataxia, 11 (18%) other neurological disorders (epilepsy -- four, PNS -- four; idiopathic limbic encephalitis -- two; myasthenia gravis -- one), and 11 (18%) isolated DM1. Patients with SPS and cerebellar ataxia had the same frequency of female gender (86% vs 94%), DM1 (59% vs 53%), CSF oligoclonal bands (35% vs 69%). Three of the four PNS patients, with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, a predominant gait cerebellar ataxia, and limbic encephalitis, had neuroendocrine carcinomas. GAD expression was confirmed in the two tumours in which the study was done. The fourth patient presented with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration antedating a lung adenocarcinoma. The frequency of increased IS of GAD-ab was 85% in SPS, 100% in cerebellar ataxia, and 86% in other neurological disorders. In conclusion, our study emphasizes that high GAD-ab levels associate with other neurological disorders besides SPS. Cerebellar ataxia, the second most common syndrome associated with high GAD-ab levels, shares with SPS the same demographic, clinical and immunological features. The demonstration of an increased IS of GAD-ab is important to confirm that the GAD autoimmunity is related to the neurological syndrome particularly when there is a concomitant DM1 that could justify the presence of high GAD-ab levels. Lastly, in patients who develop neurological syndromes that suggest a PNS, the finding of GAD-ab does not rule out this possibility and appropriate studies should be done to confirm an underlying cancer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awn183", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078990452", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment can be lengthy, expensive, and often difficult for families and caregivers. Physical examination is potentially useful in this clinical scenario, and the information obtained may help physicians and families make accurate decisions about treatment and/or withdrawal of care.To determine the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting poor outcome in post-cardiac arrest coma.We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles (1966-2003) using the terms coma, cardiac arrest, prognosis, physical examination, sensitivity and specificity, and observer variation. Other sources came from bibliographies of retrieved articles and physical examination textbooks. Studies were included if they assessed the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in prognosis of post-cardiac arrest coma in adults. Eleven studies, involving 1914 patients, met our inclusion criteria.Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Summary likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated from random effects models. Five clinical signs were found to strongly predict death or poor neurological outcome: absent corneal reflexes at 24 hours (LR, 12.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-68.7), absent pupillary response at 24 hours (LR, 10.2; 95% CI, 1.8-48.6), absent withdrawal response to pain at 24 hours (LR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.2-9.8), no motor response at 24 hours (LR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.6-13.0), and no motor response at 72 hours (LR, 9.2; 95% CI, 2.1-49.4). The proportion of individuals' dying or having a poor neurological outcome was calculated by pooling the outcome data from the 11 studies (n = 1914) and used as an estimate of the pretest probability of poor outcome. The random effects estimate of poor outcome was 77% (95% CI, 72%-80%). The highest LR increases the pretest probability of 77% to a posttest probability of 97% (95% CI, 87%-100%). No clinical findings were found to have LRs that strongly predicted good neurological outcome.Simple physical examination maneuvers strongly predict death or poor outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The most useful signs occur at 24 hours after cardiac arrest, and earlier prognosis should not be made by clinical examination alone. These data provide prognostic information, rather than treatment recommendations, which must be made on an individual basis incorporating many other variables.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.291.7.870", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2092760657", "source": "openalex"}

Only carefully designed prospective studies can provide information regarding prevalence, incidence, and natural history of the full spectrum of neurologic complications of HIV infection. A degree of tropism for monocyte/macrophages and possibly for cells within the CNS seems certain. One of the most frequent complications is AIDS-related dementia, which reflects central nervous system invasion by HIV. Despite the evidence linking unchecked viral replication within the brain and progressive dementia, the basic pathogenetic mechanisms remain obscure. Further characterization of the cellular targets of HIV within the brain, and the mechanisms which ultimately lead to the dementia, is critical. The demonstration that HIV enters the central nervous system during the earliest stages of infection has major implications for antiviral agents which must penetrate brain parenchyma to clear the virus effectively. Other neurologic complications occur frequently, including myelopathies, peripheral neuropathies, opportunistic CNS infections, and CNS neoplasms. Many of these disorders are novel and incompletely characterized and their etiology is uncertain. While treatment is available for several of these conditions, it is generally not curative, and is often poorly tolerated because of adverse effects. Research directions will focus on better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, on earlier and more precise detection of these diverse conditions, and on improved therapeutic agents. For the future, efforts toward the development of a safe, effective vaccine are of critical importance. There are, however, already up to 2 million individuals in the United States who are already infected with HIV and who are thus at risk for developing 1 or several of these neurologic complications. Vaccination, even if it were available now, is not likely to benefit these individuals. While it is hoped that only a fraction of this infected population will develop neurologic symptoms, the prospects of an epidemic of AIDS-related dementia are ominous, particularly as antiviral therapy alone is unlikely to either eradicate the virus or restore brain function. In Africa and worldwide the numbers at risk for HIV-related diseases are enormous, and the risk factors for transmission of HIV less well defined. There, economic and medical resources are less than adequate to deal with a problem of this magnitude.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00005792-198711000-00001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975473749", "source": "openalex"}

PNS are rare, affecting less than 1/10,000 patients with cancer. Only the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is relatively frequent, occurring in about 1% of patients with small cell lung cancer. PNS can affect any part of the central and peripheral nervous system, the neuromuscular junction, and muscle. They can be isolated or occur in association. In most patients, the neurological disorder develops before the cancer becomes clinically overt and the patient is referred to the neurologist who has the charge of identifying a neurological disorder as paraneoplastic. PNS are usually severely disabling. The most common PNS are Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), subacute cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis (LE), opsoclonus-myoclonus (OM), retinopathies (cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) and melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR), Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS), chronic gastrointestinal pseudoobstruction (CGP), sensory neuronopathy (SSN), encephalomyelitis (EM) and dermatomyositis. PNS are caused by autoimmune processes triggered by the cancer and directed against antigens common to both the cancer and the nervous system, designated as onconeural antigens. Due to their high specificity (> 90%), the best way to diagnose a neurological disorder as paraneoplastic is to identify one of the well-characterized anti-onconeural protein antibodies in the patient's serum. In addition, as these antibodies are associated with a restricted range of cancers, they can guide the search for the underlying tumor at a stage when it is frequently not clinically overt. This is a critical point as, to date, the best way to stabilize PNS is to treat the cancer as soon as possible. Unfortunately, about one-third of patients do not have detectable antibodies and 5% to 10% have an atypical antibody that is not well-characterized. As PNS are believed to be immune-mediated, suppression of the immune response represents another treatment approach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-1172-2-22", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3022314034", "source": "openalex"}

Literature searches of the Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE databases included January 1, 1992, through April 2020 identified pertinent articles for review. Because of the lack of high-quality data from randomized clinical trials or large observational studies, recommendations were formulated based on consensus of contributors and medical societies that represented relevant disciplines, including critical care, neurology, and neurosurgery. <h3>Evidence Synthesis</h3> Based on review of the literature and consensus from a large multidisciplinary, international panel, minimum clinical criteria needed to determine BD/DNC in various circumstances were developed. <h3>Recommendations</h3> Prior to evaluating a patient for BD/DNC, the patient should have an established neurologic diagnosis that can lead to the complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, and conditions that may confound the clinical examination and diseases that may mimic BD/DNC should be excluded. Determination of BD/DNC can be done with a clinical examination that demonstrates coma, brainstem areflexia, and apnea. This is seen when (1) there is no evidence of arousal or awareness to maximal external stimulation, including noxious visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation; (2) pupils are fixed in a midsize or dilated position and are nonreactive to light; (3) corneal, oculocephalic, and oculovestibular reflexes are absent; (4) there is no facial movement to noxious stimulation; (5) the gag reflex is absent to bilateral posterior pharyngeal stimulation; (6) the cough reflex is absent to deep tracheal suctioning; (7) there is no brain-mediated motor response to noxious stimulation of the limbs; and (8) spontaneous respirations are not observed when apnea test targets reach pH &lt;7.30 and Paco<sub>2</sub>≥60 mm Hg. If the clinical examination cannot be completed, ancillary testing may be considered with blood flow studies or electrophysiologic testing. Special consideration is needed for children, for persons receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and for those receiving therapeutic hypothermia, as well as for factors such as religious, societal, and cultural perspectives; legal requirements; and resource availability. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This report provides recommendations for the minimum clinical standards for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria in adults and children with clear guidance for various clinical circumstances.

It appears that no such estimates have been reported at the state level for the US. <h3>Objective</h3> To present burden estimates of major neurological disorders in the US states by age and sex from 1990 to 2017. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This is a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of major neurological disorders were derived from the GBD 2017 study of the 48 contiguous US states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Fourteen major neurological disorders were analyzed: stroke, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injuries, brain and other nervous system cancers, meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus. <h3>Exposures</h3> Any of the 14 listed neurological diseases. <h3>Main Outcome and Measure</h3> Absolute numbers in detail by age and sex and age-standardized rates (with 95% uncertainty intervals) were calculated. <h3>Results</h3> The 3 most burdensome neurological disorders in the US in terms of absolute number of DALYs were stroke (3.58 [95% uncertainty interval [UI], 3.25-3.92] million DALYs), Alzheimer disease and other dementias (2.55 [95% UI, 2.43-2.68] million DALYs), and migraine (2.40 [95% UI, 1.53-3.44] million DALYs). The burden of almost all neurological disorders (in terms of absolute number of incident, prevalent, and fatal cases, as well as DALYs) increased from 1990 to 2017, largely because of the aging of the population. Exceptions for this trend included traumatic brain injury incidence (−29.1% [95% UI, −32.4% to −25.8%]); spinal cord injury prevalence (−38.5% [95% UI, −43.1% to −34.0%]); meningitis prevalence (−44.8% [95% UI, −47.3% to −42.3%]), deaths (−64.4% [95% UI, −67.7% to −50.3%]), and DALYs (−66.9% [95% UI, −70.1% to −55.9%]); and encephalitis DALYs (−25.8% [95% UI, −30.7% to −5.8%]). The different metrics of age-standardized rates varied between the US states from a 1.2-fold difference for tension-type headache to 7.5-fold for tetanus; southeastern states and Arkansas had a relatively higher burden for stroke, while northern states had a relatively higher burden of multiple sclerosis and eastern states had higher rates of Parkinson disease, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine and tension-type headache, and meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> There is a large and increasing burden of noncommunicable neurological disorders in the US, with up to a 5-fold variation in the burden of and trends in particular neurological disorders across the US states.

New insight is provided on the pathobiology of traumatically induced cell body injury and diffuse axonal damage. The consequences of axonal damage in terms of subsequent deafferentation and any potential retrograde cell death and atrophy are addressed. The regional and global metabolic sequelae are also considered. This detailed presentation of the neuropathological consequences of traumatic brain injury is used to set the stage for better appreciating the neurological recovery occurring after traumatic injury. Although the pathological and clinical effects of focal and diffuse damage are usually intermingled, the different clinical manifestations of recovery patterns associated with focal versus diffuse injuries are presented. The recognizable patterns of recovery, involving unconsciousness, posttraumatic confusion/amnesia, and postconfusional restoration, that typically occur across the full spectrum of diffuse injury are described, recognizing that the patient's long-term recovery may involve more idiosyncratic combinations of dysfunction. The review highlights the relationship of focal lesions to localizing syndromes that may be embedded in the evolving natural history of diffuse pathology. It is noted that injuries with primarily focal pathology do not necessarily follow a comparable pattern of recovery with distinct phases. Potential linkages of these recovery patterns to the known neuropathological sequelae of injury and various reparative mechanisms are considered and it is proposed that potential biological markers and newer imaging technologies will better define these linkages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00001199-200501000-00008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009105636", "source": "openalex"}

Limited data exist regarding the frequency of such complications occurring in the first days after the ictus and the relationship of these complications to outcome. Our objective was to identify the types, severity, and frequency of medical and neurological complications following acute ischemic stroke and to determine their role in mortality and functional outcome. Methods —Rates of serious (life-threatening) and nonserious medical and neurological complications and mortality were derived from the placebo limb of the Randomized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Acute Stroke (RANTTAS) database (n=279). Complications were correlated with clinical outcome using logistic regression techniques. Results —Of all patients, 95% had at least one complication. The most common serious medical complication was pneumonia (5%), and the most common serious neurological complication was new cerebral infarction or extension of the admission infarction (5%). The 3-month mortality was 14%; 51% of these deaths were attributed primarily to medical complications. Outcome was significantly worse in patients with serious medical complications, after adjustment for baseline imbalances, as measured by the Barthel Index (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 15.1) and by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 30.9).

Unpacking how this burden varies regionally and nationally is important to inform public health policy and prevention strategies. The population in the EU is older than that of the WHO European region (western, central, and eastern Europe) and even older than the global population, suggesting that it might be particularly vulnerable to an increasing burden of age-related neurological disorders. We aimed to compare the burden of neurological disorders in the EU between 1990 and 2017 with those of the WHO European region and worldwide.The burden of neurological disorders was calculated for the year 2017 as incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost, and years lived with disability for the countries in the EU and the WHO European region, totally and, separately. Diseases analysed were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, epilepsy, headache (migraine and tension-type headache), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain cancer, motor neuron diseases, neuroinfectious diseases, and stroke. Data are presented as totals and by sex, age, year, location and socio-demographic context, and shown as counts and rates.In 2017, the total number of DALYs attributable to neurological disorders was 21·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 18·5-23·9) in the EU and 41·1 million (36·7-45·9) in the WHO European region, and the total number of deaths was 1·1 million (1·09-1·14) in the EU and 1·97 million (1·95-2·01) in the WHO European region. In the EU, neurological disorders ranked third after cardiovascular diseases and cancers representing 13·3% (10·3-17·1) of total DALYs and 19·5% (18·0-21·3) of total deaths. Stroke, dementias, and headache were the three commonest causes of DALYs in the EU. Stroke was also the leading cause of DALYs in the WHO European region. During the study period we found a substantial increase in the all-age burden of neurodegenerative diseases, despite a substantial decrease in the rates of stroke and infections. The burden of neurological disorders in Europe was higher in men than in women, peaked in individuals aged 80-84 years, and varied substantially with WHO European region and country. All-age DALYs, deaths, and prevalence of neurological disorders increased in all-age measures, but decreased when using age-standardised measures in all but three countries (Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). The decrease was mostly attributed to the reduction of premature mortality despite an overall increase in the number of DALYs.Neurological disorders are the third most common cause of disability and premature death in the EU and their prevalence and burden will likely increase with the progressive ageing of the European population. Greater attention to neurological diseases must be paid by health authorities for prevention and care.

In addition to being associated with a non-specific acute febrile illness, a number of neurological manifestations, mainly microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been associated with infection. These with other rarer neurological conditions suggest that Zika virus, similar to other flaviviruses, is neuropathogenic. The surge of Zika virus-related microcephaly cases in Brazil has received much attention and the role of the virus in this and in other neurological manifestations is growing. Zika virus has been shown to be transmitted perinatally and the virus can be detected in amniotic fluid, placenta and foetus brain tissue. A significant increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome incidence has also been reported during this, as well as in previous outbreaks. More recently, meningoencephalitis and myelitis have also been reported following Zika virus infection. In summary, while preliminary studies have suggested a clear relationship between Zika virus infection and certain neurological conditions, only longitudinal studies in this epidemic, as well as experimental studies either in animal models or in vitro, will help to better understand the role of the virus and the pathogenesis of these disorders.

The impetus for using various diets to treat – or at least ameliorate symptoms of – these disorders stems from both a lack of effectiveness of pharmacological therapies, and also the intrinsic appeal of implementing a more \"natural\" treatment. The enormous spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the aforementioned diseases would suggest a degree of complexity that cannot be impacted universally by any single dietary treatment. Yet, it is conceivable that alterations in certain dietary constituents could affect the course and impact the outcome of these brain disorders. Further, it is possible that a final common neurometabolic pathway might be influenced by a variety of dietary interventions. The most notable example of a dietary treatment with proven efficacy against a neurological condition is the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) used in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. While the mechanisms through which the KD works remain unclear, there is now compelling evidence that its efficacy is likely related to the normalization of aberrant energy metabolism. The concept that many neurological conditions are linked pathophysiologically to energy dysregulation could well provide a common research and experimental therapeutics platform, from which the course of several neurological diseases could be favorably influenced by dietary means. Here we provide an overview of studies using the KD in a wide panoply of neurologic disorders in which neuroprotection is an essential component.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2012.00059", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2062447656", "source": "openalex"}

Methods We examined neurologic manifestations in 509 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed Covid‐19 within a hospital network in Chicago, Illinois. We compared the severity of Covid‐19 and outcomes in patients with and without neurologic manifestations. We also identified independent predictors of any neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy, and functional outcome using binary logistic regression. Results Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 (42.2%), at hospitalization in 319 (62.7%), and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%).

However, the frequency of these syndromal 'dominant optic atrophy plus' variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.44–6.49; P = 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.08–4.82; P = 0.0271).

However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology. Individuals with dominant optic atrophy plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes, and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant visual impairment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq007", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138704587", "source": "openalex"}

The cellular mechanisms responsible for cell death after activation of these receptors are still being clarified. In acute neurologic diseases such as stroke and head trauma, excitotoxicity may be related to excessive glutamate release.

The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhancement layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzzification outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k -means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership functions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefficients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some popular benchmarks for regression and classification, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches.

CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis. On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic.

Cell replacement therapy and gene transfer to the diseased or injured brain have provided the basis for the development of potentially powerful new therapeutic strategies for a broad spectrum of human neurological diseases. However, the paucity of suitable cell types for cell replacement therapy in patients suffering from neurological disorders has hampered the development of this promising therapeutic approach. In recent years, neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells, and extensive efforts by investigators to develop stem cell‐based brain transplantation therapies have been carried out. We review here notable experimental and preclinical studies previously published involving stem cell‐based cell and gene therapies for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, MS, stroke, spinal cord injury, brain tumor, and lysosomal storage diseases and discuss the future prospects for stem cell therapy of neurological disorders in the clinical setting. There are still many obstacles to be overcome before clinical application of cell therapy in neurological disease patients is adopted: 1) it is still uncertain what kind of stem cells would be an ideal source for cellular grafts, and 2) the mechanism by which transplantation of stem cells leads to an enhanced functional recovery and structural reorganization must to be better understood. Steady and solid progress in stem cell research in both basic and preclinical settings should support the hope for development of stem cell‐based cell therapies for neurological diseases. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.22054", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2073523882", "source": "openalex"}

The levels of [Cl − ] i are also highly labile, being readily altered transiently or persistently by enhanced episodes of activity in relation to synaptic plasticity or a variety of pathological conditions, including seizures and brain insults. Among the plethora of channels, transporters, and other devices involved in controlling [Cl − ] i , two have emerged as playing a particularly important role: the chloride importer NKCC1 and the chloride exporter KCC2. Here, the authors stress the importance of determining how [Cl − ] i is dynamically regulated and how this affects brain operation in health and disease. In a clinical perspective, agents that control [Cl − ] i and reinstate inhibitory actions of GABA open novel therapeutic perspectives in many neurological disorders, including infantile epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, and other developmental disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858412438697", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134218486", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, a renewed emphasis has been placed on managing severe head injury by elevating cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is defined as the mean arterial pressure minus the intracranial pressure (ICP). Some authors have suggested that CPP is more important in influencing outcome than is intracranial hypertension, a hypothesis that this study was designed to investigate. Methods. The authors examined the relative contribution of these two parameters to outcome in a series of 427 patients prospectively studied in an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of the N-methyl- d -aspartate antagonist Selfotel. Mortality rates rose from 9.6% in 292 patients who had no clinically defined episodes of neurological deterioration to 56.4% in 117 patients who suffered one or more of these episodes; 18 patients were lost to follow up. Correspondingly, favorable outcome, defined as good or moderate on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months, fell from 67.8% in patients without neurological deterioration to 29.1% in those with neurological deterioration. In patients who had clinical evidence of neurological deterioration, the relative influence of ICP and CPP on outcome was assessed. The most powerful predictor of neurological worsening was the presence of intracranial hypertension (ICP ≥ 20 mm Hg) either initially or during neurological deterioration. There was no correlation with the CPP as long as the CPP was greater than 60 mm Hg. Conclusions. Treatment protocols for the management of severe head injury should emphasize the immediate reduction of raised ICP to less than 20 mm Hg if possible. A CPP greater than 60 mm Hg appears to have little influence on the outcome of patients with severe head injury.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3171/jns.2000.92.1.0001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124888829", "source": "openalex"}

In-built antioxidant system of body plays its decisive role in prevention of any loss due to free radicals. However, imbalanced defense mechanism of antioxidants, overproduction or incorporation of free radicals from environment to living system leads to serious penalty leading to neuro-degeneration. Neural cells suffer functional or sensory loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from several other environmental or genetic factors, oxidative stress (OS) leading to free radical attack on neural cells contributes calamitous role to neuro-degeneration. Though, oxygen is imperative for life, imbalanced metabolism and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation end into a range of disorders such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, aging and many other neural disorders. Toxicity of free radicals contributes to proteins and DNA injury, inflammation, tissue damage and subsequent cellular apoptosis. Antioxidants are now being looked upon as persuasive therapeutic against solemn neuronal loss, as they have capability to combat by neutralizing free radicals. Diet is major source of antioxidants, as well as medicinal herbs are catching attention to be commercial source of antioxidants at present. Recognition of upstream and downstream antioxidant therapy to oxidative stress has been proved an effective tool in alteration of any neuronal damage as well as free radical scavenging. Antioxidants have a wide scope to sequester metal ions involved in neuronal plaque formation to prevent oxidative stress. In addition, antioxidant therapy is vital in scavenging free radicals and ROS preventing neuronal degeneration in post-oxidative stress scenario.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently the most effective gut microbiota intervention and an accepted treatment for recurrent Clostridioioides difficile infections. To evaluate indications of FMT for patients with neurological disorders, we summarized the available literature on FMT. In addition, we provide suggestions for future directions. Methods In July 2019, five main databases were searched for studies and case descriptions on FMT in neurological disorders in humans or animal models. In addition, the ClinicalTrials.gov website was consulted for registered planned and ongoing trials. Results Of 541 identified studies, 34 were included in the analysis. Clinical trials with FMT have been performed in patients with autism spectrum disorder and showed beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. For multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, several animal studies suggested a positive effect of FMT, supported by some case reports in humans. For epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy some studies suggested a beneficial effect of FMT, but evidence was restricted to case reports and limited numbers of animal studies. For stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Guillain-Barré syndrome only studies with animal models were identified. These studies suggested a potential beneficial effect of healthy donor FMT. In contrast, one study with an animal model for stroke showed an increased mortality after FMT. For Guillain-Barré only one study was identified. Whether the positive findings from animal studies can be confirmed in the treatment of human diseases awaits to be seen. Several trials with FMT as treatment of the above mentioned neurological disorders are planned or ongoing, as well as for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Conclusions Preliminary literature suggests that FMT may be a promising treatment option for several neurological disorders. However, available evidence is still scanty and some contrasting results were observed. Limited studies in humans have been performed or are ongoing, while for some disorders only animal experiments have been conducted. Large double-blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the effect of FMT in neurological disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00098", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3013060838", "source": "openalex"}

Pathologic studies implicate inflammatory demyelination as a principal cause of axonal transection and subsequent axonal degeneration. Axonal degeneration caused by chronic demyelination in the absence of active inflammation may also contribute to progressive disability in the later stages of the disease. Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggest that axonal loss begins at the onset of the disease, and studies using magnetic resonance imaging have documented brain atrophy in the earliest stages of multiple sclerosis. Brain atrophy increases during the relapsing-remitting disease stage without concurrent disability progression. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms maintain neurologic function, despite progressive brain tissue loss during the early stages of the disease. Beyond a threshold, however, further axonal loss leads to continuously progressive neurologic disability. We hypothesize that the rate and extent of axonal loss during relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis determines when a patient enters the secondary progressive stage of the disease. This view of disease pathogenesis has several important implications. First, surrogate markers of axonal loss are needed to monitor the disease process for patient care and for clinical trials. We propose brain parenchymal fraction, a precise measure of whole-brain atrophy, as an attractive candidate for this purpose. Second, disease-modifying therapy should be used early in multiple sclerosis patients, before extensive axonal loss has occurred. Third, neuroprotective drugs should be tested in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs in multiple sclerosis patients. Finally, studies of the time course of axonal loss, and its mechanisms are critical for effective therapeutic intervention.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00019052-199906000-00008", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2325735106", "source": "openalex"}

Methods— Patients (n=413) were randomized to placebo or clazosentan beginning within 56 hours and continued up to 14 days after initiation of treatment. The primary end point was moderate or severe angiographic vasospasm based on centrally read, blinded evaluation of digital subtraction angiography at baseline and 7 to 11 days postsubarachnoid hemorrhage. A morbidity/mortality end point, including all-cause mortality, new cerebral infarct from any cause, delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm, or use of rescue therapy, was evaluated by local assessment. Clinical outcome was assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 12 weeks. Results— Moderate or severe vasospasm was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion from 66% in the placebo group to 23% in the 15 mg/h clazosentan group (risk reduction, 65%; 95% CI, 47% to 78%; P &lt;0.0001). No significant effects were seen on secondary end points. Post hoc analysis using a centrally assessed morbidity/mortality end point that included death and rescue therapy but only cerebral infarcts and delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm on central review showed a trend toward improvement with clazosentan (37%, 28%, and 29% in the 1, 5, and 15 mg/h groups versus 39% in the placebo group, nonsignificant). Clazosentan was associated with increased rates of pulmonary complications, hypotension, and anemia. Conclusions— Clazosentan significantly decreased moderate and severe vasospasm in a dose-dependent manner and showed a trend for reduction in vasospasm-related morbidity/mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage when centrally assessed.

Detection and management of neurosarcoidosis remains problematic. Our interest in immunosuppressive agents for chronic sarcoidosis has given us experience with various agents for the treatment of sarcoidosis, including cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. <h3>Methods:</h3> We analyzed all patients with sarcoidosis seen in our clinic during a 10-year period. Evaluation for neurological disease included routine physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and neural tissue biopsy were performed where clinically indicated. Patients were treated with corticosteroids, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide. <h3>Results:</h3> Neurological disease was identified in 71 of 554 patients with sarcoidosis. Seventh (facial) cranial nerve paralysis was the most common manifestation identified in 39 patients. This included 24 patients with facial nerve palsy as the only manifestation of neurological sarcoidosis in whom complete recovery was seen in all but 1 patient. Forty-eight patients with disease other than facial nerve palsy received corticosteroids or other therapies. Corticosteroids benefited only 14 patients (29%). Methotrexate successfully treated 17 (61%) of 28 patients and cyclophosphamide controlled disease in 9 (90%) of 10 assessable patients. Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide were each associated with a higher response rate than corticosteroids alone (X<sup>2</sup>, 14.6;<i>P</i>&lt;.001). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Neurological symptoms can be significant manifestations of sarcoidosis.

In certain instances, over-stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors has been implicated Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is an endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist synthesized from L-tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway and thereby has the potential of mediating N-methyl-D-aspartate neuronal damage and dysfunction. Conversely, the related metabolite, kynurenic acid, is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and could modulate the neurotoxic effects of QUIN as well as disrupt excitatory amino acid neurotransmission In the present study, markedly increased concentrations of QUIN were found in both lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain tissue of patients with inflammatory diseases (bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections, meningitis, autoimmune diseases and septicaemia) independent of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The concentrations of kynurenic acid were also increased, but generally to a lesser degree than the increases in QUIN. In contrast, no increases in CSF QUIN were found in chronic neurodegenerative disorders, depression or myoclonic seizure disorders, while CSF kynurenic acid concentrations were significantly lower in Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In inflammatory disease patients, proportional increases in CSF L-kynurenine and reduced L-tryptophan accompanied the increases in CSF QUIN and kynurenic acid. These responses are consistent with induction of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, the first enzyme of the kynurenine pathway which converts L-tryptophan to kynurenic acid and QUIN Indeed, increases in both indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity and QUIN concentrations were observed in the cerebral cortex of macaques infected with retrovirus, particularly those with local inflammatory lesions. Correlations between CSF QUIN, kynurenic acid and L-kynurenine with markers of immune stimulation (neopterin, white blood cell counts and lgG levels) indicate a relationship between accelerated kynurenine pathway metabolism and the degree of intracerebral immune stimulation. We conclude that inflammatory diseases are associated with accumulation of QUIN, kynurenic acid and L-kynurenine within the central nervous system, but that the available data do not support a role for QUIN in the aetiology of Huntington's disease or Alzheimer's disease In conjunction with our previous reports that CSF QUIN concentrations are correlated to objective measures of neuropsychological deficits in HIV-1-infected patients, we hypothesize that QUIN and kynurenic acid are mediators of neuronal dysfunction and nerve cell death in inflammatory diseases. Therefore, strategies to attenuate the neurological effects of kynurenine pathway metabolites or attenuate the rate of their synthesis offer new approaches to therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/115.5.1249", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2010145371", "source": "openalex"}

Abnormalities in PCD signalling cascades, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cell death associated with autophagy as well as in unprogrammed necrosis can be observed in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. These cell deaths can be activated in response to various forms of cellular stress (exerted by intracellular or extracellular stimuli) and inflammatory processes. Aberrant activation of PCD pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Conversely, inactivation of PCD is thought to contribute to the development of brain cancers and to impact their response to therapy. For many neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers current treatment strategies have only modest effect, engendering the need for investigations into the origins of these diseases. With many diseases of the brain displaying aberrations in PCD pathways, it appears that agents that can either inhibit or induce PCD may be critical components of future therapeutic strategies. The development of such therapies will have to be guided by preclinical studies in animal models that faithfully mimic the human disease. In this review, we briefly describe PCD and unprogrammed cell death processes and the roles they play in contributing to neurodegenerative diseases or tumorigenesis in the brain. We also discuss the interplay between distinct cell death signalling cascades and disease pathogenesis and describe pharmacological agents targeting key players in the cell death signalling pathways that have progressed through to clinical trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-021-00814-y", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3171124897", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence to support diagnostic decisions on coma and other DoC is limited but accumulating. This guideline provides the state-of-the-art evidence regarding the diagnosis of DoC, summarizing data from bedside examination techniques, functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Sixteen members of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Scientific Panel on Coma and Chronic Disorders of Consciousness, representing 10 European countries, reviewed the scientific evidence for the evaluation of coma and other DoC using standard bibliographic measures. Recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The guideline was endorsed by the EAN. Results: Besides a comprehensive neurological examination, the following suggestions are made: probe for voluntary eye movements using a mirror; repeat clinical assessments in the subacute and chronic setting, using the Coma Recovery Scale – Revised; use the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness score instead of the Glasgow Coma Scale in the acute setting; obtain clinical standard EEG; search for sleep patterns on EEG, particularly rapid eye movement sleep and slow-wave sleep; and, whenever feasible, consider positron emission tomography, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), active fMRI or EEG paradigms and quantitative analysis of high-density EEG to complement behavioral assessment in patients without command following at the bedside. Conclusions: Standardized clinical evaluation, EEG-based techniques and functional neuroimaging should be integrated for multimodal evaluation of patients with DoC. The state of consciousness should be classified according to the highest level revealed by any of these three approaches.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14151", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3008714035", "source": "openalex"}

The study was performed by the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID) from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Neuro-COVID Registry (ENERGY) from March to October 2020. Three cohorts were included: (1) the GCS-NeuroCOVID all COVID-19 cohort (n = 3055), which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without neurological manifestations; (2) the GCS-NeuroCOVID COVID-19 neurological cohort (n = 475), which comprised consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had confirmed neurological manifestations; and (3) the ENERGY cohort (n = 214), which included patients with COVID-19 who received formal neurological consultation. <h3>Exposures</h3> Clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Neurological phenotypes were classified as self-reported symptoms or neurological signs and/or syndromes assessed by clinical evaluation. Composite incidence was reported for groups with at least 1 neurological manifestation. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 3055 patients in the all COVID-19 cohort, 1742 (57%) were men, and the mean age was 59.9 years (95% CI, 59.3-60.6 years). Of the 475 patients in the COVID-19 neurological cohort, 262 (55%) were men, and the mean age was 62.6 years (95% CI, 61.1-64.1 years). Of the 214 patients in the ENERGY cohort, 133 (62%) were men, and the mean age was 67 years (95% CI, 52-78 years). A total of 3083 of 3743 patients (82%) across cohorts had any neurological manifestation (self-reported neurological symptoms and/or clinically captured neurological sign and/or syndrome). The most common self-reported symptoms included headache (1385 of 3732 patients [37%]) and anosmia or ageusia (977 of 3700 patients [26%]). The most prevalent neurological signs and/or syndromes were acute encephalopathy (1845 of 3740 patients [49%]), coma (649 of 3737 patients [17%]), and stroke (222 of 3737 patients [6%]), while meningitis and/or encephalitis were rare (19 of 3741 patients [0.5%]). Presence of clinically captured neurologic signs and/or syndromes was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.99; 95% CI, 4.33-8.28) after adjusting for study site, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Presence of preexisting neurological disorders (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.80-2.75) was associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes with COVID-19. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this multicohort study, neurological manifestations were prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Preexisting neurological disorders were associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes in COVID-19.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.12131", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3161773261", "source": "openalex"}

Over the past decade, there has been growing evidence for the use of NAC in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders, considering its role in attenuating pathophysiological processes associated with these disorders, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and glutamate and dopamine dysregulation. In this systematic review we find favorable evidence for the use of NAC in several psychiatric and neurological disorders, particularly autism, Alzheimer's disease, cocaine and cannabis addiction, bipolar disorder, depression, trichotillomania, nail biting, skin picking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, drug-induced neuropathy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Disorders such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mild traumatic brain injury have preliminary evidence and require larger confirmatory studies while current evidence does not support the use of NAC in gambling, methamphetamine and nicotine addictions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Overall, NAC treatment appears to be safe and tolerable. Further well designed, larger controlled trials are needed for specific psychiatric and neurological disorders where the evidence is favorable.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.04.015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W240506283", "source": "openalex"}

We conducted this study to test whether more advanced imaging selection, recently developed devices, and earlier intervention improve outcomes.We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who were receiving 0.9 mg of alteplase per kilogram of body weight less than 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke either to undergo endovascular thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR (Flow Restoration) stent retriever or to continue receiving alteplase alone. All the patients had occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery and evidence of salvageable brain tissue and ischemic core of less than 70 ml on computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging. The coprimary outcomes were reperfusion at 24 hours and early neurologic improvement (≥8-point reduction on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or a score of 0 or 1 at day 3). Secondary outcomes included the functional score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days.The trial was stopped early because of efficacy after 70 patients had undergone randomization (35 patients in each group). The percentage of ischemic territory that had undergone reperfusion at 24 hours was greater in the endovascular-therapy group than in the alteplase-only group (median, 100% vs. 37%; P<0.001). Endovascular therapy, initiated at a median of 210 minutes after the onset of stroke, increased early neurologic improvement at 3 days (80% vs. 37%, P=0.002) and improved the functional outcome at 90 days, with more patients achieving functional independence (score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin scale, 71% vs. 40%; P=0.01). There were no significant differences in rates of death or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.In patients with ischemic stroke with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT perfusion imaging, early thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR stent retriever, as compared with alteplase alone, improved reperfusion, early neurologic recovery, and functional outcome.

Here, a systems biology approach with the combination of computational analysis and animal experiment is used to investigate this complex issue, ZHENG, in the context of the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) system. By using the methods of literature mining, network analysis and topological comparison, it is found that hormones are predominant in the Cold ZHENG network, immune factors are predominant in the Hot ZHENG network, and these two networks are connected by neuro-transmitters. In addition, genes related to Hot ZHENG-related diseases are mainly present in the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway, whereas genes related to both the Cold-related and Hot-related diseases are linked to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. These computational findings were subsequently verified by experiments on a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis, which indicate that the Cold ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Cold ZHENG network, and the Hot ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Hot ZHENG network. These investigations demonstrate that the thousand-year-old concept of ZHENG may have a molecular basis with NEI as background.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-syb:20060032", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030958001", "source": "openalex"}
