It is increasingly apparent that there are significant limitations to these criteria, which only address the contrast-enhancing component of the tumor. For example, chemoradiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastomas results in transient increase in tumor enhancement (pseudoprogression) in 20% to 30% of patients, which is difficult to differentiate from true tumor progression. Antiangiogenic agents produce high radiographic response rates, as defined by a rapid decrease in contrast enhancement on CT/MRI that occurs within days of initiation of treatment and that is partly a result of reduced vascular permeability to contrast agents rather than a true antitumor effect. In addition, a subset of patients treated with antiangiogenic agents develop tumor recurrence characterized by an increase in the nonenhancing component depicted on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. The recognition that contrast enhancement is nonspecific and may not always be a true surrogate of tumor response and the need to account for the nonenhancing component of the tumor mandate that new criteria be developed and validated to permit accurate assessment of the efficacy of novel therapies. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group is an international effort to develop new standardized response criteria for clinical trials in brain tumors. In this proposal, we present the recommendations for updated response criteria for high-grade gliomas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.26.3541", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162643152", "source": "openalex"}

Nevertheless, survival for patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive glioma, although individually variable, has improved from an average of 10 months to 14 months after diagnosis in the last 5 years due to improvements in the standard of care. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment of these lesions for decades, and the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved greatly. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent with simple oral administration and a favorable toxicity profile, is used in conjunction with and after radiotherapy. Newer surgical techniques, such as fluorescence-guided resection and neuroendoscopic approaches, have become important in the management of malignant gliomas. Furthermore, new discoveries are being made in basic and translational research, which are likely to improve this situation further in the next 10 years. These include agents that block 1 or more of the disordered tumor proliferation signaling pathways, and that overcome resistance to already existing treatments. Targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic therapy with antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (bevacizumab) are finding their way into clinical practice. Large-scale research efforts are ongoing to provide a comprehensive understanding of all the genetic alterations and gene expression changes underlying glioma formation. These have already refined the classification of glioblastoma into 4 distinct molecular entities that may lead to different treatment regimens. The role of cancer stem-like cells is another area of active investigation. There is definite hope that by 2020, new cocktails of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in gliomas and reduce their mortality and morbidity, a positive development for patients, their families, and medical professionals alike.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.20069", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115862526", "source": "openalex"}

Significant differences were established between tension headache and migraine in respect of incidence and severity of symptoms and their time of onset in relation to the headache. In migraine, vestibulocochlear disturbances can occur as an aura, accompanying the headache or during headache-free periods, the highest incidence occurring during the headache.

The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules.

In these conditions, the appropriate processing of emotional expressions is impaired. In autism, it is argued that the basic response to emotional expressions remains intact but that there is impaired ability to represent the referent of the individual displaying the emotion. In psychopathy, the response to fearful and sad expressions is attenuated and this interferes with socialization resulting in an individual who fails to learn to avoid actions that result in harm to others.

For this retrospective study, we examined banked CSF and plasma samples from a subset of AD subjects with CSF Aβ42 <600 ng/ml (biomarker-confirmed AD) at baseline (N = 19 resveratrol-treated and N = 19 placebo-treated). We utilized multiplex Xmap technology to measure markers of neurodegenerative disease and metalloproteinases (MMPs) in parallel in CSF and plasma samples. Compared to the placebo-treated group, at 52 weeks, resveratrol markedly reduced CSF MMP9 and increased macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), interleukin (IL)-4, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Compared to baseline, resveratrol increased plasma MMP10 and decreased IL-12P40, IL12P70, and RANTES.

This requirement has been particularly challenging in neuro-oncology for which contrast enhancement serves as an imperfect surrogate for tumor volume and is influenced by agents that affect vascular permeability, such as antiangiogenic therapies. In addition, most tumors have a nonenhancing component that can be difficult to accurately quantify. To improve the response assessment in neuro-oncology and to standardize the criteria that are used for different CNS tumors, the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group was established. This multidisciplinary international working group consists of neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, neuropsychologists, and experts in clinical outcomes assessments, working in collaboration with government and industry to enhance the interpretation of clinical trials. The RANO working group was originally created to update response criteria for high- and low-grade gliomas and to address such issues as pseudoresponse and nonenhancing tumor progression from antiangiogenic therapies, and pseudoprogression from radiochemotherapy. RANO has expanded to include working groups that are focused on other tumors, including brain metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, spine tumors, pediatric brain tumors, and meningiomas, as well as other clinical trial end points, such as clinical outcomes assessments, seizures, corticosteroid use, and positron emission tomography imaging. In an effort to standardize the measurement of neurologic function for clinical assessment, the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology scale was drafted. Born out of a workshop conducted by the Jumpstarting Brain Tumor Drug Development Coalition and the US Food and Drug Administration, a standardized brain tumor imaging protocol now exists to reduce variability and improve reliability.

Our efforts over the last five years have been focused on answering this question and we will present a few of our clinical results from over 2,000 hours of robot-aided therapy with 76 stroke patients. To determine if exercise therapy influences plasticity and recovery of the brain following a stroke, we needed the appropriate \"microscope\" that would allow us to concomitantly control the amount of therapy delivered to a patient, while objectively measuring patient's performance. Back-driveable robots are the key enabling technology. Our results to date using common clinical scales suggest that robot-aided sensorimotor training does have a genuinely positive effect on reduction of impairment and the reorganization of the adult brain. Yet while clinical scales can help us to examine the impact in the neuro-recovery process, their coarse nature requires extensive and time-consuming trials, and on top of that they fail to show us details important for optimizing therapy. Alternative, robot-based scales offer the potential benefit of new finer measurements-and deeper insight into the process of recovery from neurological injury. We also plan to use present technology to establish the practicality and economic feasibility of clinician-supervised, robot-administered therapy, including classroom therapy.

This systematic review was performed with the objective of determining whether glucocorticoid therapy, to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia, impairs neuro-developmental outcomes in preterm infants. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Medline was searched and articles retrieved using predefined criteria. Data from randomized controlled trials with adequate neuro-developmental follow up (to at least one year) were entered into a meta-analysis to determine the effects of postnatal treatment of preterm infants with glucocorticoids. Cerebral palsy rates, and neuro-developmental impairment (developmental score more than 2SD below the mean, or cerebral palsy or blindness) were analyzed. The studies were divided into 2 groups according to the extent of contamination of the results by treatment of controls with steroids after the initial study period, those with less than 30% contamination, and those with more than 30% contamination or size of contamination not reported. Postnatal steroid therapy is associated with an increase in cerebral palsy and neuro-developmental impairment. The studies with less contamination show a greater effect of the steroids, consistent with a real direct toxic effect of steroids on the developing central nervous system. The typical relative risk for the development of cerebral palsy derived from studies with less than 30% contamination is 2.86 (95% CI 1.95, 4.19). The typical relative risk for the development of neuro-developmental disability among followed up infants from studies with less than 30% contamination is 1.66 (95% CI 1.26, 2.19). From this subgroup of studies, the number of premature infants who need to be treated to have one more infant with cerebral palsy (number needed to harm, NNH) is 7; to have one more infant with neuro-developmental impairment the NNH is 11. Postnatal pharmacologic steroid treatment for prevention or treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with dramatic increases in neuro-developmental impairment. As there is no clear evidence in the literature of long term benefit, their use for this indication should be abandoned.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-1-1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2167847793", "source": "openalex"}

Until now, the use of nanotechnology and molecular self assembly in biomedicine to repair injured brain structures has not been explored. To achieve axonal regeneration after injury in the CNS, several formidable barriers must be overcome, such as scar tissue formation after tissue injury, gaps in nervous tissue formed during phagocytosis of dying cells after injury, and the failure of many adult neurons to initiate axonal extension. Using the mammalian visual system as a model, we report that a designed self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold creates a permissive environment for axons not only to regenerate through the site of an acute injury but also to knit the brain tissue together. In experiments using a severed optic tract in the hamster, we show that regenerated axons reconnect to target tissues with sufficient density to promote functional return of vision, as evidenced by visually elicited orienting behavior. The peptide nanofiber scaffold not only represents a previously undiscovered nanobiomedical technology for tissue repair and restoration but also raises the possibility of effective treatment of CNS and other tissue or organ trauma.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0600559103", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027393834", "source": "openalex"}

Here, a systems biology approach with the combination of computational analysis and animal experiment is used to investigate this complex issue, ZHENG, in the context of the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) system. By using the methods of literature mining, network analysis and topological comparison, it is found that hormones are predominant in the Cold ZHENG network, immune factors are predominant in the Hot ZHENG network, and these two networks are connected by neuro-transmitters. In addition, genes related to Hot ZHENG-related diseases are mainly present in the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway, whereas genes related to both the Cold-related and Hot-related diseases are linked to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. These computational findings were subsequently verified by experiments on a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis, which indicate that the Cold ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Cold ZHENG network, and the Hot ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Hot ZHENG network. These investigations demonstrate that the thousand-year-old concept of ZHENG may have a molecular basis with NEI as background.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-syb:20060032", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2030958001", "source": "openalex"}

The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhancement layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzzification outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k -means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership functions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefficients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some popular benchmarks for regression and classification, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neuro-fuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2018.2857815", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2887576641", "source": "openalex"}

Unfortunately, despite the increasing breadth and scale of openly available data, the vast domain-specific knowledge and computational resources necessary to derive scientifically meaningful information from unprocessed neuroimaging data has limited their accessibility. The Neuro Bureau Preprocessing Initiative [2] has taken on this challenge, generating and openly sharing preprocessed data and common derivatives for the large-scale ADHD-200 dataset [3]. This initiative has grown to include preprocessed DTI data and derivatives for 180 healthy individuals from INDI’s Beijing Enhanced Sample [4]. The next planned release will include resting state and structural data from the 1,112 subject Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset [5]. Methods Four teams are currently participating in the preprocessing initiative, each one using different toolsets and preprocessing strategies (fig. 1). Preprocessed data, derivatives, and quality control metrics are made openly available for download through the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) [6]. The ADHD-200 release included two fMRI preprocessing pipelines as well as maps of grey matter density for voxel-based morphometry (fig. 1). The Beijing diffusion imaging release includes DTI scalars along with voxel specific diffusion distributions for performing probabilistic tractography. Figure 2 illustrates various derivatives generated through these initiatives. The future ABIDE preprocessing initiative will incorporate three functional preprocessing piplines and cortical measures (fig. 3). The analytical procedures employed in the preprocessing are extensively documented on the NITRC website [2]. The Neuro Bureau preprocessing initiative also includes an on-going working group to release derivatives, which can be readily compared across different preprocessing strategies, so that investigators can directly test the impact of the method- ological choices on the scientific outcome of a study. Most of the ong-going work consists of improving and harmonizing the quality control procedures and the derivatives generated by different processing pipelines. Interested teams are welcome to join the effort and contribute new analytical pipelines for future release. Results Intended to buttress the ADHD-200 Global Competition [7] and accelerate ADHD imaging research, the ADHD-200 preprocessing effort has yielded more than 6,500 downloads from 780 unique IP address globally (see fig. 4), inspired a team of biostatisticians to win the competition and resulted in eight peer-reviewed publications - with many more in preparation or submission. The DTI preprocessing initiative has resulted in 572 downloads from 134 unique IP addresses. Based on the success of the previous preprocessing efforts four teams have agreed to continue this effort by preprocessing the recently released ABIDE dataset (fig 3). Conclusion By openly sharing a wide range of preprocessed data and derivatives, the Neuro Bureau Preprocessing Initiative seeks to make neuroimaging research accessible to a wider audience of researchers. It has already enabled computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians who lack neuroimaging expertise to develop and test novel data analysis strategies. We see several important benefits to our initiative: (1) facilitate the generation and test of novel hypotheses about brain function, (2) provide a resource to train future generations of neuroimaging researchers and, (3) facilitate the replication of published results by providing a benchmark set of test images. By providing a breadth of derivatives and preprocessing strategies, we also hope to establish a platform for comparing their relative merits, as well as testing the robustness of neuroscientific findings. This already broad resource will soon be enhanced by the inclusion of the phenotypically rich ABIDE dataset which consists of data from an important clinical population.

This interest is mainly due to the clinical observation that anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, in contrast to the vast majority of anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, frequently respond favorably to chemotherapy. In addition, oligodendroglial tumors are associated with longer survival times than the diffuse astrocytic gliomas. These differences in response to therapy and in prognosis have been associated with distinct genetic aberrations, in particular the frequent loss of alleles on chromosome arms 1p and 19q in oligodendroglial tumors. In addition, other genetic changes have been reported as indicators of poor response to therapy and short survival, including homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene at 9p21, mutation of the PTEN gene at 10q23, and amplification of the EGFR gene at 7p12. In this review we summarize the current state of the art concerning the molecular genetics of oligodendroglial tumors. A particular focus is placed on the role of molecular genetic findings in the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of these neoplasms. As a result of the recent advances in the field, we propose that clinical decisions in the management of patients with oligodendroglial tumors should be based on the combined assessment of clinical and neuroimaging features, histological classification and grading, as well as molecular genetic characteristics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jnen/62.2.111", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2315751647", "source": "openalex"}

The process operation is partitioned into several fuzzy operating regions. Within each region, a local linear model is used to model the process. The global model output is obtained through the centre of gravity defuzzification which is essentially the interpolation of local model outputs. This modeling strategy utilizes both process knowledge and process input/output data. Process knowledge is used to initially divide the process operation into several fuzzy operating regions and to set up the initial fuzzification layer weights. Process I/O data are used to train the network. Network weights are such trained so that the long-term prediction errors are minimized. Through training, membership functions of fuzzy operating regions are refined and local models are learnt. Based on the recurrent neuro-fuzzy network model, a novel type of nonlinear model-based long range predictive controller can be developed and it consists of several local linear model-based predictive controllers. Local controllers are constructed based on the corresponding local linear models and their outputs are combined to form a global control action by using their membership functions. This control strategy has the advantage that control actions can be calculated analytically avoiding the time consuming nonlinear programming procedures required in conventional nonlinear model-based predictive control. The techniques have been successfully applied to the modeling and control of a neutralization process.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750562", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2100654013", "source": "openalex"}

This paper presents a neuro-fuzzy logic controller (NFLC) where all of its parameters can be tuned simultaneously by GA. The structure of the controller is based on the radial basis function neural network (RBF) with Gaussian membership functions. The NFLC tuned by GA can somewhat eliminate laborious design steps such as manual tuning of the membership functions and selection of the fuzzy rules.

Though NBD is relatively uncommon, being potentially treatable, neurologists need to consider it in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory, infective, or demyelinating CNS disorders. Evidence-based information on key issues of NBD diagnosis and management is scarce, and planning for such studies is challenging. We therefore initiated this project to develop expert consensus recommendations that might be helpful to neurologists and other clinicians, created through an extensive literature review and wide consultations with an international advisory panel, followed by a Delphi exercise. We agreed on consensus criteria for the diagnosis of NBD with two levels of certainty in addition to recommendations on when to consider NBD in a neurological patient, and on the use of various paraclinical tests. The management recommendations included treatment of the parenchymal NBD and cerebral venous thrombosis, the use of disease modifying therapies, prognostic factors, outcome measures, and headache in BD. Future studies are needed to validate the proposed criteria and provide evidence-based treatments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-013-7209-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1979534455", "source": "openalex"}

There is classically a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis. An imbalance of the autonomic nervous system is observed in various pathologic conditions. The VN is a mixed nerve with 80% of afferent and 20% of efferent fibers and a key component of the neuro-immune axis and the brain-gut axis through a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. A dual anti-inflammatory role of the VN is observed through the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (activation of vagal afferents) and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (activation of vagal efferents). The sympathetic nervous system and the VN act in synergy, through the splenic nerve, to inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) by macrophages of the peripheral tissues and the spleen. Because of its anti-inflammatory effect, the VN is a therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders where TNF is a key component. In this review, we will focus on the anti-inflammatory role of the VN in inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The anti-inflammatory properties of the VN could be targeted pharmacologically, with enteral nutrition, by VN stimulation (VNS), with complementary medicines or by physical exercise. VNS, used in the treatment of drug resistant epilepsy and depression, could be an effective tool as a non-drug therapy to treat inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and postoperative ileus which are all characterized by an autonomic imbalance with a low vagal tone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01452", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2766962312", "source": "openalex"}

The hydrometeor classification system is implemented by using fuzzy logic and a neural network, where the fuzzy logic is used to infer hydrometeor type, and the neural network learning algorithm is used for automatic adjustment of the parameters of the fuzzy sets in the fuzzy logic system according to prior knowledge. Five radar measurements, namely, horizontal reflectivity (ZH), differential reflectivity (ZDR), differential propagation phase shift (KDP), correlation coefficient [ρHV(0)], and linear depolarization ratio (LDR), and corresponding altitude, have been used as input variables to the neuro-fuzzy network. The output of the neuro-fuzzy system is one of the many possible hydrometeor types: 1) drizzle, 2) rain, 3) dry and low density snow, 4) dry and high-density crystals, 5) wet and melting snow, 6) dry graupel, 7) wet graupel, 8) small hail, 9) large hail, and 10) a mixture of rain and hail. The neuro-fuzzy classifier is more advantageous than a simple neural network or a fuzzy logic classifier because it is more transparent (instead of a “black box”) and can learn the parameter of the system from the past data (unlike a fuzzy logic system).

The possibility that transmission at some non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) neuro-effector junctions is mediated by nitric oxide (NO) arose from the discoveries that NO mediated the effects of nitrovasodilator drugs and that endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) was NO or a NO-yielding substance. 2. NO donated by nitrovasodilator drugs or formed by endothelial cells activates soluble guanylate cyclase in smooth muscle and the consequent increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) results in relaxation. The relaxations produced by stimulation of some NANC nerves are also due to a rise in cGMP. 3. The biosynthesis of NO by oxidation of a terminal guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine is inhibited by some NG-substituted analogues of L-arginine. These substances block EDRF formation by NO synthase and endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, and the blockade is overcome by L-arginine 4. NANC relaxations in some tissues are blocked by NG-substituted analogues of L-arginine and restored by L-arginine. Other agents that affect endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses produce corresponding changes in responses to stimulation of these NANC nerves. Such observations indicate that transmission is mediated by NO: we have termed this mode of transmission nitrergic. 5. There is evidence for nitrergic innervation of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, genito-urinary system, trachea and some blood vessels (penile and cerebral arteries). 6. The recognition of a mediator role for NO in neurotransmission calls for reconsideration of previously accepted generalizations about mechanisms of transmission. 7. Studies on nitrergic transmission will provide new insights into physiological control mechanisms and pathophysiological processes and may lead to new therapeutic developments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1992.tb00433.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1968395684", "source": "openalex"}

The different plasticity mechanisms underlying VC are first reviewed, and the authors present thereafter the dual concept of vestibulo-centric versus distributed learning processes to explain the compensation of deficits resulting from the static versus dynamic vestibular imbalance. The main challenges for the plastic events occurring in the vestibular nuclei (VN) during a post-lesion critical period are neural protection, structural reorganization and rebalance of VN activity on both sides. Data from animal models show that modulation of the ipsilesional VN activity by the contralateral drive substitutes for the normal push–pull mechanism. On the other hand, sensory and behavioural substitutions are the main mechanisms implicated in the recovery of the dynamic functions. These newly elaborated sensorimotor reorganizations are vicarious idiosyncratic strategies implicating the VN and multisensory brain regions. Imaging studies in unilateral vestibular loss patients show the implication of a large neuronal network (VN, commissural pathways, vestibulo-cerebellum, thalamus, temporoparietal cortex, hippocampus, somatosensory and visual cortical areas). Changes in gray matter volume in these multisensory brain regions are structural changes supporting the sensory substitution mechanisms of VC. Finally, the authors summarize the two ways to improve VC in humans (neuropharmacology and vestibular rehabilitation therapy), and they conclude that VC would follow a “top-down” strategy in patients with acute vestibular lesions. Future challenges to understand VC are proposed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-015-7903-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2336545413", "source": "openalex"}

The existence of the so-called gut-brain axis of bi-directional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (CNS) also supports a communication pathway between the gut microbiota and neural circuits of the host, including the CNS. An increasing body of evidence has shown that gut microbiota is able to modulate gut and brain functions, including the mood, cognitive functions, and behavior of humans. Nonetheless, given the extreme complexity of this communication network, its comprehension is still at its early stage. The present contribution will attempt to provide a state-of-the art description of the mechanisms by which gut microbiota can affect the gut-brain axis and the multiple cellular and molecular communication circuits (i.e., neural, immune, and humoral). In this context, special attention will be paid to the microbial strains that produce bioactive compounds and display ascertained or potential probiotic activity. Several neuroactive molecules (e.g., catecholamines, histamine, serotonin, and trace amines) will be considered, with special focus on Glu and GABA circuits, receptors, and signaling. From the basic science viewpoint, \"microbial endocrinology\" deals with those theories in which neurochemicals, produced by both multicellular organisms and prokaryotes (e.g., serotonin, GABA, glutamate), are considered as a common shared language that enables interkingdom communication. With regards to its application, research in this area opens the way toward the possibility of the future use of neuroactive molecule-producing probiotics as therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurogastroenteric and/or psychiatric disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01934", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2558265859", "source": "openalex"}

Gestational, perinatal and neonatal exposures to BPA affect developmental processes, including brain development and gametogenesis, with consequences on brain functions, behavior, and fertility.This review critically analyzes recent findings on the neuro-toxic and reproductive effects of BPA (and its analogues), with focus on neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, glia and microglia activity, cognitive functions, and the central and local control of reproduction.BPA has potential human health hazard associated with gestational, peri- and neonatal exposure. Beginning with BPA's disposition, this review summarizes recent findings on the neurotoxicity of BPA and its analogues, on neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, neuro-degeneration, and impairment of cognitive abilities. Furthermore, it reports the recent findings on the activity of BPA along the HPG axis, effects on the hypothalamic Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), and the associated effects on reproduction in both sexes and successful pregnancy.BPA and its analogues impair neuronal activity, HPG axis function, reproduction, and fertility.

The highest level of syntactic complexity, recursive-embedded clauses, has been singled out by some for a special status as the evolutionary apex of the uniquely - human language faculty - evolutionary yet mysteriously immune to Darwinian adaptive selection. Prof. Givon's book treats syntactic complexity as an integral part of the evolutionary rise of human communication. The book first describes grammar as an adaptive instrument of communication, assembled upon the pre-existing platform of pre-linguistic object- and-event cognition and mental representation. It then surveys the two grand developmental trends of human language: diachrony , the communal enterprise directly responsible for fashioning synchronic morpho-syntax and cross-language diversity; and ontogeny , the individual endeavor directly responsible for acquiring the competent use of grammar. The genesis of syntactic complexity along these two developmental trends is compared with second language acquisition, pre-grammatical pidgin and pre-human communication. The evolutionary relevance of language diachrony, language ontogeny and pidginization is argued for on general bio-evolutionary grounds: It is the organism's adaptive on-line behavior - invention, learning and skill acquisition - that is the common thread running through all three developmental trends. The neuro-cognitive circuits that underlie language, and their evolutionary underpinnings, are described and assessed. Recursive embedding turns out to be not an adaptive target on its own, but the by-product of two distinct adaptive moves: (i) the recruitment of conjoined clauses as modal operators on, or referential specifiers of, other clauses; and (ii) the subsequent condensation of paratactic into syntactic structures.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W1035224590", "source": "openalex"}

But neither provides specific parameters to do so. We hypothesized that a standardized metric to measure neurologic function will permit more effective overall response assessment in neuro-oncology. An international group of physicians including neurologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neurosurgeons with expertise in neuro-oncology drafted the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale as an objective and quantifiable metric of neurologic function evaluable during a routine office examination. The scale was subsequently tested in a multicenter study to determine its overall reliability, inter-observer variability, and feasibility. The NANO scale is a quantifiable evaluation of 9 relevant neurologic domains based on direct observation and testing conducted during routine office visits. The score defines overall response criteria. A prospective, multinational study noted a >90% inter-observer agreement rate with kappa statistic ranging from 0.35 to 0.83 (fair to almost perfect agreement), and a median assessment time of 4 minutes (interquartile range, 3-5). The NANO scale provides an objective clinician-reported outcome of neurologic function with high inter-observer agreement.

To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences.

How post‐transcriptional methylation contributes to the human disease is currently unknown. By comparing gene expression data with global cytosine‐5 RNA methylomes in patient fibroblasts and NSun2‐deficient mice, we find that loss of cytosine‐5 RNA methylation increases the angiogenin‐mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNAs ( tRNA ) leading to an accumulation of 5′ tRNA ‐derived small RNA fragments. Accumulation of 5′ tRNA fragments in the absence of NSun2 reduces protein translation rates and activates stress pathways leading to reduced cell size and increased apoptosis of cortical, hippocampal and striatal neurons. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that angiogenin binds with higher affinity to tRNA s lacking site‐specific NSun2‐mediated methylation and that the presence of 5′ tRNA fragments is sufficient and required to trigger cellular stress responses. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of NSun2‐deficient brains to oxidative stress can be rescued through inhibition of angiogenin during embryogenesis. In conclusion, failure in NSun2‐mediated tRNA methylation contributes to human diseases via stress‐induced RNA cleavage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201489282", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2076772609", "source": "openalex"}

By constructing a barrier type of optimal cost functions for subsystems and employing an observer and the actor-critic architecture, the virtual and actual optimal controllers are developed under the framework of backstepping technique. In addition to ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals, the proposed strategy can also guarantee that system states are confined within some preselected compact sets all the time. This is achieved by means of barrier Lyapunov functions which have been successfully applied to various kinds of nonlinear systems such as strict-feedback and pure-feedback dynamics. Besides, our developed optimal controller requires less conditions on system dynamics than some existing approaches concerning optimal control. The effectiveness of the proposed optimal control approach is eventually validated by numerical as well as practical examples.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3051030", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3124444594", "source": "openalex"}

A variety of AI methods applied to conventional and advanced neuro-oncology MRI data can already delineate infiltrating margins of diffuse gliomas, differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression, and predict recurrence and survival better than methods used in daily clinical practice. Radiogenomics will also advance our understanding of cancer biology, allowing noninvasive sampling of the molecular environment with high spatial resolution and providing a systems-level understanding of underlying heterogeneous cellular and molecular processes. By providing in vivo markers of spatial and molecular heterogeneity, these AI-based radiomic and radiogenomic tools have the potential to stratify patients into more precise initial diagnostic and therapeutic pathways and enable better dynamic treatment monitoring in this era of personalized medicine.

They may even manifest with similar clinical symptoms, further confounding an already difficult process for physicians attempting to characterize a new contrast-enhancing lesion appearing on a patient's follow-up imaging. Distinguishing treatment necrosis from tumor recurrence is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, and therefore, much effort has been put forth to develop noninvasive methods to differentiate between these disparate outcomes. In this article, we review the latest developments and key findings from research studies exploring the efficacy of structural and functional imaging modalities for differentiating treatment necrosis from tumor recurrence. We discuss the possibility of computational approaches to investigate the usefulness of fine-grained imaging characteristics that are difficult to observe through visual inspection of images.

A connectionist topology of fuzzy basis functions with their universal approximation capability is served as a fundamental SANFIS architecture that provides an elasticity to be extended to all existing fuzzy models whose consequent could be fuzzy term sets, fuzzy singletons, or functions of linear combination of input variables. Without a priori knowledge of the distribution of the training data set, a novel mapping-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm is devised to reveal the true cluster configuration in a single pass for an initial SANFIS construction, estimating the location and variance of each cluster. Subsequently, a fast recursive linear/nonlinear least-squares algorithm is performed to further accelerate the learning convergence and improve the system performance. Good generalization capability, fast learning convergence and compact comprehensible knowledge representation summarize the strength of SANFIS. Computer simulations for the Iris, Wisconsin breast cancer, and wine classifications show that SANFIS achieves significant improvements in terms of learning convergence, higher accuracy in recognition, and a parsimonious architecture.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2002.805880", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142899655", "source": "openalex"}

We conducted a retrospective case study of the neuro‐epileptic risk factors predisposing to autism spectrum disorder in individuals with tuberous sclerosis to test current neurobiological theories of autism spectrum disorder. We found that an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was associated with the presence of cortical tubers in the temporal but not other lobes of the brain. Indeed, the presence of tubers in the temporal lobes appeared to be a necessary but not sufficient risk factor for the development of an autism spectrum disorder. However, contrary to the predictions of some theories, the location of tubers in specific regions of the temporal lobe, such as the superior temporal gyrus or the right temporal lobe, did not determine which individuals with temporal lobe tubers developed an autism spectrum disorder. Instead, outcome was associated with various indices of epileptic activity including evidence of temporal lobe epileptiform discharges on EEG, the age to onset of seizures in the first 3 years of life and a history of infantile spasms. The results indicated that individuals with tuberous sclerosis are at very high risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder when temporal lobe tubers are present and associated with temporal lobe epileptiform discharges and early‐onset, persistent spasm‐like seizures. These risk markers constitute useful clinical indicators of prognosis, but further research is required to identify the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for their association with outcome. Most especially, it will be important to test whether, as the findings suggest, there is a critical early stage of brain maturation during which temporal lobe epilepsy perturbs the development of brain systems that underpin ‘social intelligence’ and possibly other cognitive skills, thereby inducing an autism spectrum disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awf124", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2082025223", "source": "openalex"}

Our purpose was to determine the MR patterns in patients with NBS who had neural parenchymal involvement and to correlate our findings with possible vascular pathophysiology.The MR images of 65 patients with NBS and neural parenchymal involvement were reviewed. In a subgroup of patients who had serial MR studies, we evaluated the anatomic-radiologic location and distribution of the lesions and whether they corresponded to any vascular territory, and studied their extension, enhancement patterns, and temporal course.The most common imaging finding in NBS patients who had neural parenchymal involvement was a mesodiencephalic junction lesion with edema extending along certain long tracts in the brain stem and diencephalon in 46% of the patients. The next most common location of involvement was the pontobulbar region, seen in 40% of the cases. Three primary cervical spinal cord lesions and one case of isolated optic nerve involvement were observed.The parenchymal distribution of lesions in NBS appears to support the hypothesis of small-vessel vasculitis; mainly, venular involvement. The anatomic distribution of intraaxial veins of the CNS explains the predominant involvement of the brain stem structures observed in our patients.

This review gives an explanation for the multiple \"co-morbidities\" between depression and a large variety of a) brain disorders related to neurodegeneration, e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke; b) medical disorders, such as cardiovascular disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, leaky gut, diabetes type 1 and 2, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, and HIV infection; and c) conditions, such as hemodialysis, interferon-α-based immunotherapy, the postnatal period and psychosocial stressors. The common denominator of all those disorders/conditions is the presence of microglial activation and/or activation of peripheral IO&NS pathways. There is evidence that shared peripheral and / or central IO&NS pathways underpin the pathophysiology of depression and the previously mentioned disorders and that activation of these IO&NS pathways contributes to shared risk. The IO&NS pathways function as a smoke sensor that detect threats in the peripheral and central parts of the body and signal these threats as melancholic, anxiety, and fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms. The presence of concomitant depression is strongly associated with a lower quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality in medical disorders. This may be explained since depression contributes to increased (neuro)inflammatory burden and may therefore drive the inflammatory and degenerative progression. It is concluded that the activation of peripheral and / or central IO&NS pathways may explain the co-occurrence of depression with the above disorders. This shows that depression belongs to the spectrum of inflammatory and degenerative disorders.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W206135523", "source": "openalex"}

It is a perspective that has developed since associations were first described between pre-natal peripheral nerve tissue and initial osseous bone formation in the craniofacial skeleton (Kjær, 1990a). In this review, the normal connection between the central nervous system and the axial skeleton and between the peripheral nervous system and jaw formation are first discussed. The early central nervous system (the neural tube) and the axial skeleton from the lumbosacral region to the sella turcica forms a unit, since both types of tissue are developmentally dependent upon the notochord. In different neurological disorders, the axial skeleton, including the pituitary gland, is malformed in different ways along the original course of the notochord. Anterior to the pituitary gland/sella turcica region, the craniofacial skeleton develops from prechordal cartilage, invading mesoderm and neural crest cells. Also, abnormal development in the craniofacial region, such as tooth agenesis, is analyzed neuro-osteologically. Results from pre-natal investigations provide information on the post-natal diagnosis of children with congenital developmental disorders in the central nervous system. Examples of these are myelomeningocele and holoprosencephaly. Three steps are important in clinical neuro-osteology: (1) clinical definition of the region of an osseous or dental malformation, (2) embryological determination of the origin of that region and recollection of which neurological structure has developed from the same region, and (3) clinical diagnosis of this neurological structure. If neurological malformation is the first symptom, step 2 results in the determination of the osseous region involved, which in step 3 is analyzed clinically.

By plotting the percentage of labeled metaphases against the tune of thymidine‐H 3 application, the DNA‐synthetic period was found to last five hours, the postduplication (G 2 ) stage and prophase two and one‐half hours and the preduplication (G 1 ) stage to be brief or non‐existent. The total cell cycle time was calculated to be eight hours. During DNA synthesis the nuclei are located near the basement membrane; subsequently they migrate to the lumen to undergo mitosis, after which they return to the outer zone to start DNA synthesis for the next cell division. To determine the life span of the neuro‐epithelial cells by a different method, chick embryos were treated with vincristine, a drug known to arrest the mitosis in the metaphase. Fifteen, 26, 34 and 41% of the neuro‐epithelial cells were arrested in the metaphase, one, two, three and four hours after treatment, respectively. Since the “mitotic index” of the neuro‐epithelial cells was 5.2, the duration of the mitosis was calculated to last 25 minutes, and the life span of the neuro‐epithelial cell to be eight hours. Immediately after closure of the neural tube, a different cell type characterized by a round nucleus, pale nucleoplasm and a dark‐staining nucleolus appeared at the periphery of the tube near the basement membrane. These cells, which originate by division from the neuro‐epithelial cells at the lumen, did not incorporate thymidine‐H 3 at any time during further development. They are considered to be primitive neuroblasts and to form the first representatives of the mantle layer.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.901270308", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2108034643", "source": "openalex"}

To study the impact of IL-17A on CNS inflammation, we generated transgenic mice in which high levels of expression of IL-17A could be initiated after Cre-mediated recombination. Although ubiquitous overexpression of IL-17A led to skin inflammation and granulocytosis, T cell-specific IL-17A overexpression did not have a perceptible impact on the development and health of the mice. In the context of EAE, neither the T cell-driven overexpression of IL-17A nor its complete loss had a major impact on the development of clinical disease. Since IL-17F may be able to compensate for the loss of IL-17A, we also generated IL-17F-deficient mice. This strain was fully susceptible to EAE and displayed unaltered emergence and expansion of autoreactive T cells during disease. To eliminate potential compensatory effects of either cytokine, we treated IL-17F-deficient mice with antagonistic monoclonal antibodies specific for IL-17A and found again only a minimal beneficial impact on disease development. We conclude therefore that both IL-17A and IL-17F, while prominently expressed by an encephalitogenic T cell population, may only marginally contribute to the development of autoimmune CNS disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci35997", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1974228120", "source": "openalex"}

Its neurologic manifestations (neuro-Behçet disease) are relatively rare, but they must be thoroughly investigated due to their grave prognosis. Review Summary: The frequency of neurologic manifestations, more common in male Behçet patients, is between 5% and 30%. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems can be involved. Central nervous system manifestations can be divided into 2 main groups: (1) parenchymal involvement, which includes brainstem involvement, hemispheric manifestations, spinal cord lesions, and meningoencephalitic presentations; (2) nonparenchymal involvement, including dural sinus thrombosis, arterial occlusion, and/or aneurysms. Peripheral neuropathy and myopathy are relatively rare. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals pleocytosis and elevated protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice which often reveals iso-/hypointense lesions in T1-weighted images and hyperintense lesions in T2-weighted images, mostly in the mesodiencephalic junction, cerebellar peduncles, and other parts of the brainstem. Corticosteroids and adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy are used for parenchymal manifestations, and corticosteroids and anticoagulants are used for treatment of dural sinus thrombosis. Conclusion: Neuro-Behçet disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of stroke in young adults, multiple sclerosis, movement disorders, intracranial hypertension, intracranial sinovenous occlusive diseases, and other neurologic syndromes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.nrl.0000156343.16797.c4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2288169203", "source": "openalex"}

The common method for deriving parametric water retention PTFs involves estimating the parameters of a soil hydraulic model by fitting the model to the data, and then forming empirical relationships between basic soil properties and parameters. The latter step usually utilizes multiple linear regression or artificial neural networks. Neural network analysis is a powerful tool and has been shown to perform better than multiple linear regression. However neural‐network PTFs are usually trained with an objective function that fits the estimated parameters of a soil hydraulic model. We called this the neuro‐p method. The estimated parameters may carry errors and since the aim is to be able to estimate water retention, it is sensible to train the network to fit the measured water content. We propose a new objective function for neural network training, which predicts the parameters of the soil hydraulic model and optimizes the PTF to match the measured and observed water content, we called this neuro‐m method. This method was used to predict the parameters of the van Genuchten model. Using Australian soil hydraulic data as a training set, neuro‐m predicted the water retention from bulk density and particle‐size distribution with a mean accuracy of 0.04 m 3 m −3 The relative improvement of neuro‐m over neural networks that was optimized to fit the parameters ( neuro‐p ) is 13%.

Without a priori knowledge, the recurrent neuro-fuzzy system is first trained to model the inverse dynamics of the AUV and then utilized as a feedforward controller to compute the nominal torque of the AUV along a desired trajectory. The PD feedback controller computes the error torque to minimize the system error along the desired trajectory. This error torque also provides an error signal for online updating the parameters in the recurrent neuro-fuzzy control to adapt in a changing environment. A systematic self-adaptive learning algorithm, consisting of a mapping-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm for the structure learning and a recursive recurrent learning algorithm for the parameter learning, has been developed to construct the recurrent neuro-fuzzy system to model the inverse dynamics of an AUV with fast learning convergence. Computer simulations of the proposed recurrent neuro-fuzzy control scheme and its performance comparison with some existing controllers have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tra.2003.808865", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2118542389", "source": "openalex"}

GC are used for the management of malignant brain tumors, either primary of secondary, neoplastlc epidural spinal cord compression (NESC), as adjuvant chemotherapy of some central nervous system tumors and perioperatively in brain surgery. GC are believed to exert their influence on brain tumors mainly by reducing the tumor-associated vasogenic edema, probably by decreasing the increased capillary permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Experimental as well as clinical studies applying computed tomography, magnetic resonance and PET have supported these theories. However, other mechanisms have been proposed and investigated, such as a reduction of cerebral blood flow and oncolytic effects, the latter being controversial. The effect of GC is best observed in patients with cerebral metastases and gllomas. Studies on the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) gave confiding results. Although some prefer methylprednisolone, dexamethasone is the GC given in the majority of neuro-oncologic patients, at an empirically chosen dosage of 4 mg qid. Dose-effect studies in patients with cerebral metastases as well as in patients suffering from NESC have been performed and lower doses in a twice dally regime may be sufficient. Side-effects may be divided in three groups: those originating from the mineralocorticold activity, the withdrawal of the drug and the chronic excess GC administration. Steroid myopathy is the most frequent occurring serious side-effect in neuro-oncologic patients. Others include gastrointestinal perforation and hemorrhage, opportunistic infections, steroid diabetes, and skin and facial changes. The most important interaction is that with phenytoin. The influence of dexamethasone on the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is also discussed.

Introduction THE existence of mechanisms that provide immunity to an infective agent was inferred from empirical observations obtained through the ingenuity and deductive capacity of early investigators. The first procedures for vaccinations and serotherapy resulted from these observations. The implementation of these procedures, probably the most important contribution of immunology to medical science, was, at first, based on a very rudimentary knowledge of the immune system. During the first half of the 20th century, this rather primitive knowledge coincided with evidence showing that the endocrine and nervous systems integrate and regulate different bodily functions. Therefore, based on some supportive data, it was considered that immune mechanisms may also be influenced by these systems. However, at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, most efforts were directed at understanding the molecular and cellular basis of the immune response and the mechanisms of acquisition of immunological diversity and self-tolerance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/er.17.1.64", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4236342100", "source": "openalex"}

A further aim was to establish whether different types of CP are associated with different patterns of visual involvement. Methods A total of 129 patients (54 females, 75 males; mean age 4y 6mo, SD 3y 5mo; range 3mo–15y) with CP (51 with diplegia, 61 with tetraplegia, and 17 with hemiplegia; 62 [48%] of participants were able to walk) and CVI enrolled at the Centre of Child Neuro‐ophthalmology (at the Department of Child Neurology and Psychiatry, IRCCS ‘C.

Results Visual dysfunction in diplegia was characterized mainly by refractive errors (75% of patients), strabismus (90%), abnormal saccadic movements (86%), and reduced visual acuity (82%). The participants with hemiplegia showed strabismus (71%) and refractive errors (88%); oculomotor involvement was less frequent (59%).

Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for oxidative stress in the regulation of neuro-inflammation following stroke. Gene expression studies have revealed that the increase in oxygen radicals post-ischemia triggers the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory genes. These genes are regulated by the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-??B) which is redox-sensitive. It is hypothesised that changes in the oxidative state may modulate alterations in the neuro-inflammatory response following an I/R injury. Furthermore, NF-??B is involved in the transcriptional regulation of adhesion molecules, which play an important role in leukocyte-endothelium interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated that adhesion molecule-mediated leukocyte recruitment is associated with increased tissue damage in stroke, while mice lacking key adhesion molecules conferred neuro-protection. Nevertheless, the involvement of oxidative stress in leukocyte recruitment and the subsequent regulated cell injury is yet to be elucidated. While leukocyte infiltration into the ischemic brain is detrimental, leukocyte accumulation in the microvasculature was shown to be one of the many factors implicated in reduced reperfusion. Although this \" no-reflow \" phenomenon was confirmed in a variety of animal models of cerebral ischemia, the exact mechanism is still uncertain. This review aims to highlight the impact that oxidative stress has in the regulation of post-ischemic neuro-inflammation and the implication for the cerebral microvasculature after injury.

Here we report that transplantation of human dental pulp stem cells into the completely transected adult rat spinal cord resulted in marked recovery of hind limb locomotor functions. Transplantation of human bone marrow stromal cells or skin-derived fibroblasts led to substantially less recovery of locomotor function. The human dental pulp stem cells exhibited three major neuroregenerative activities. First, they inhibited the SCI-induced apoptosis of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, which improved the preservation of neuronal filaments and myelin sheaths. Second, they promoted the regeneration of transected axons by directly inhibiting multiple axon growth inhibitors, including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and myelin-associated glycoprotein, via paracrine mechanisms. Last, they replaced lost cells by differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes under the extreme conditions of SCI. Our data demonstrate that tooth-derived stem cells may provide therapeutic benefits for treating SCI through both cell-autonomous and paracrine neuroregenerative activities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci59251", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156895150", "source": "openalex"}

In each case, routine staining methods and Jabonero's silver impregnation, modified by Van Campenhout, were performed. Cathecholamines were traced according to Falck's method. Each of these techniques revealed in the bronchial and bronchiolar mucosa spherical to ovoid groups of cells, which are distinct, from the surrounding epithelium by their light optical and their histochemical properties and which have been named “Neuroepithelial Bodies.” The Neuroepithelial Body bulges into the corium and is built up of cells with a clear cytoplasm and a rounded nucleus. Its apical part protrudes into the bronchial and bronchiolar lumen mostly above the level of the ciliated cell lining and consists of small non‐ciliated cuboidal cells. After silver impregnation, they display a granular silver deposit, especially in the basal cells and appear to be innervated. The technique of Falck reveals a white to yellow fluorescence, especially in the basal area where also the argyrophilia is most marked. The functions of these corpuscular, argyrophilic, innervated and fluorescent bronchial and bronchiolar Neuroepithelial Bodies remain unsettled. Though a separate entity, they seem to be related to the recently reported bronchial Argyrophil, Fluorescent and Granulated AFG (peptide and amine producing?) cells. They might be involved in mucosal bronchial and bronchiolar neurosecretory processes; most probably, however, they are chemo‐, stretch‐, and/or tactile neuro‐receptor organs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.1091720301", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2108236779", "source": "openalex"}

For this, the assessment and prediction of the pavement conditions are crucial. This study proposes a neuro-fuzzy model to predict the performance of flexible pavements using the parameters routinely collected by agencies to characterize the condition of an existing pavement. These parameters are generally obtained by performing falling weight deflectometer tests and monitoring the development of distresses on the pavement surface. The proposed hybrid model for predicting pavement performance was characterized by multilayer, feedforward neural networks that led the reasoning process of the IF-THEN fuzzy rules. The results of the neuro-fuzzy model were superior to those of the linear regression model in terms of accuracy in the approximation. The proposed neuro-fuzzy model showed good generalization capability, and the evaluation of the model performance produced satisfactory results, demonstrating the efficiency and potential of these new mathematical modeling techniques.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00615.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1953373051", "source": "openalex"}

Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2550120381", "source": "openalex"}

TDP‐43 has also been shown to be a disease signature protein associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the correlation of the physiological functions of TDP‐43 with these diseases remains unknown. We have used the gene targeting approach to disrupt the expression of TDP‐43 in mouse. Loss of the TDP‐43 expression results in peri‐implantation lethality of mice between embryonic days (E) 3.5 and 6.5. Blastocysts of the homozygous Tardbp null mutants are morphologically normal, but exhibit defective outgrowth of the inner cell mass in vitro.

It was found that specific traits are expressed by the neurons when they are grown on homotopic astrocytes (neurons and astrocytes from the same region). These traits are the following: 1. The number of cells stained with an antibody raised against the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) is higher in homotopic than in heterotopic cocultures. This is true for both mesencephalic and striatal neurons. 2. In homotopic conditions, there is an increase in the number of cells having more primary neurites and branching points. This effect is observed for both neuronal populations but is more pronounced in mesencephalic neurons. 3. The intensity of MAP2 staining was correlated with the branching ability of the neurons. First, on comparing MAP2-positive and MAP2-negative cells, it was found that, in any combination (homotopic and heterotopic cocultures), the number of primary neurites and branching points was much higher in MAP2-positive cells. In fact, almost no branching activity was found in MAP2-negative neurons. Second, within the MAP2-positive neuronal population, the higher number of branching points observed under homotopic neuro-astroglial conditions was mostly due to the neuritic compartment, which was strongly and homogeneously stained with the anti-MAP2 antibody. These observations strongly suggest that the astrocytic environment regulates the synthesis and/or intracellular distribution of MAP2, as well as the morphology of the neurons, and that this regulation is region specific.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.07-10-03163.1987", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154771454", "source": "openalex"}

In the current study, three different data-driven models, i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to predict the 28 days compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Recycled aggregate is the current need of the hour owing to its environmental pleasant aspect of re-using the wastes due to construction. 14 different input parameters, including both dimensional and non-dimensional parameters, were used in this study for predicting the 28 days compressive strength of concrete. The present study concluded that estimation of 28 days compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete was performed better by ANN and ANFIS in comparison to MLR. In other words, comparing the test step of all the three models, it can be concluded that the MLR model is better to be utilized for preliminary mix design of concrete, and ANN and ANFIS models are suggested to be used in the mix design optimization and in the case of higher accuracy necessities. In addition, the performance of data-driven models with and without the non-dimensional parameters is explored. It was observed that the data-driven models show better accuracy when the non-dimensional parameters were used as additional input parameters. Furthermore, the effect of each non-dimensional parameter on the performance of each data-driven model is investigated. Finally, the effect of number of input parameters on 28 days compressive strength of concrete is examined.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsbe.2016.09.003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2523984406", "source": "openalex"}

The animals were suspended from an aerodynamic balance in the laminar air-stream from a wind-tunnel. Muscle action potentials, recorded with 25 μ wire, were 5−7 msec, in duration, up to 10 mV. in amplitude and positive in sign. Frequencies were mostly under 20/sec. Frequencies in all the indirect muscles were similar, but these varied together with changes in aerodynamic power. Frequencies in the indirect muscles of the two sides varied by no more than ±10% during extreme turns to right or left (only left or only right wing beating). Electrical records from the non-myogenic direct muscles were made during tethered flight. The potentials were 2−4 msec, in duration, up to 2 mV. positive and had frequencies up to 180/sec. A nearly linear positive correlation exists between impulse frequency in the musculus latus (pleurostemal muscle), the inward movement of the pleural wall, and the wingbeat frequency, suggesting that this muscle is the basic frequency determiner. Strong turning behaviour is associated with opposed frequency changes in the pairs of antagonistic adductor and abductor muscles of the wings on the two sides of the body. The musculus dorsoventralis IV (tergo-trochanteral) is activated by a short impulse burst at the beginning of flight. It apparently acts as an oscillation starter. Flight initiation normally requires 30−60 msec. Usually activity begins in the musculus latus, which stiffens the thorax. Then simultaneously the myogenic muscles are activated and the ‘starter’ muscle causes a jump and the beginning of oscillation of the thorax. Then the wings are drawn gradually forward and full wingbeat amplitude develops within the first six wingbeats. Flight begins with maximal lift and wingbeat frequency and a nearly synchronous burst discharge in all the indirect muscles. Power production and the transmission and distribution of power are under separate control. The myogenic indirect motor varies only in total power output, this being influenced by its own state of excitation and by a muscle-controlling wingbeat frequency. Steering is accomplished by non-myogenic direct muscles which are capable of differentially engaging the two wings with the motor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.47.1.77", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2160890795", "source": "openalex"}

Design: Retrospective non-comparative case series and literature review. Participants: Twenty patients with biopsy proven sarcoidosis cases and neuro-ophthalmic manifestations. Methods: We reviewed 67 consecutive charts with the clinical diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC) Department of Ophthalmology database in Iowa City, Iowa, seen from 1984 to 2006. Main Outcome Measures: Charts were reviewed for the following: 1) demographic information; 2) neuro-ophthalmic findings; 3) biopsy location and results; 4) pre-existing sarcoidosis; 5) neuroimaging studies (e.g., cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans); 6) cerebrospinal fluid results; 7) sarcoid related testing (serum angiotensin converting enzyme, chest radiograph, chest computed tomography scans, Gallium scan, bronchoalveolar lavage, pulmonary function testing); 8) treatment; and 9) course of disease. Results: Twenty of the 67 charts (30%) had biopsy proven sarcoidosis and neuro-ophthalmic manifestations. Of the 20 included cases, 4 (20%) were men and 16 (80%) were women. Six (30%) patients were African-American and 14 (70%) were Caucasian. The average age at diagnosis was 43.1 years with a standard deviation of 14.1 and a range of 22 to 80 years. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations included optic neuropathy (14), cranial neuropathy (4), Horner's Syndrome (1), tonic pupil (1), and optic tract involvement (1). Of the 14 patients presenting with optic neuropathy, 8 had optic disc edema, 5 had optic disc pallor and 1 had an optic disc granuloma. Contrast cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed pathologic contrast enhancement (16 of 19 cases) involving optic nerve (9), optic chiasm (1), optic radiations (1), cavernous sinus (1), leptomeninges (3), and cerebral parenchyma (3). Chest imaging was abnormal in the course of disease for 12 of 18 and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was only elevated in 5 of 15 patients tested. All 20 patients were treated with corticosteroids but five required additional immunosuppressive therapy to control disease activity. The neuro-ophthalmic course was relapsing and remitting in 8 cases, stable or resolved in 7, and chronic in 5 patients. After treatment of patients with optic neuropathy, visual acuity at last follow-up visit was improved in 5, worsened in 5, and stable (i.e., within one Snellen acuity line of baseline) in 4. Conclusion: In our Midwest retrospective case series of biopsy proven neuro-ophthalmic sarcoidosis, patients were predominately white females with a wide age range. Consideration for the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis should therefore not be limited by age, gender, or race. Optic neuropathy was the most common manifestation, typically presenting with optic disc edema and severe visual loss. No light perception vision was relatively common and should be considered a \"red flag\" for the diagnosis. Contrast cranial MRI frequently shows pathologic enhancement of the visual pathway. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme and chest radiography had relatively poor sensitivity for detecting biopsy proven disease in our study and therefore additional testing for tissue diagnosis might still be necessary for extrapulmonary neuro-ophthalmic sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy but some patients may require additional immunosuppressive therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/08820530802007382", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072365783", "source": "openalex"}

VAM is concerned with two main functions of visual attention-that is \"selection-for-object-recognition\" and \"selection-for-space-based-motor-action\". The attentional control processes that perform these two functions restructure the results of stimulus-driven and local perceptual grouping and segregation processes, the \"visual chunks\", in such a way that one visual chunk is globally segmented and implemented as an \"object token\". This attentional segmentation solves the \"inter- and intra-object-binding problem\". It can be controlled by higher-level visual modules of the what-pathway (e.g. V4/IT) and/or the where-pathway (e.g. PPC) that contain relatively invariant \"type-level\" information (e.g. an alphabet of shape primitives, colors with constancy, locations for space-based motor actions). What-based attentional control is successful if there is only one object in the visual scene whose type-level features match the intended target object description.

Evidence for atypical development of sensory and attentional systems highlight the need to move away from localized deficits to models suggesting brain-wide involvement in autism pathology.

Advertising has long been seen as providing reasons to buy, however subtle. In academic research at least, the importance of emotion has often been downplayed. The preliminary experiment reported here shows how emotional ads are more likely to be remembered. The second experiment uses brain imaging to investigate the part of the brain which responds to emotionally‐engaging (‘affective’) and reason‐engaging (‘cognitive’) advertising stimuli.

The new HNFB/sup -1/ allows the extraction of knowledge in the form of interpretable fuzzy rules expressed by the following: If x is A and y is B, then input pattern belongs to class Z. For the process of rule extraction in the HNFB/sup -1/ model, two fuzzy evaluation measures were defined: 1) fuzzy accuracy and 2) fuzzy coverage. The HNFB/sup -1/ has been evaluated with different benchmark databases for the classification task: Iris Dataset, Wine Data, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, Bupa Liver Disorders, and Heart Disease. When compared with several other pattern classification models and algorithms, the HNFB/sup -1/ model has shown similar or better classification performance.

Subsequently, these receptors were identified as mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) that are involved in appraisal processes, choice of coping style, encoding and retrieval. The MR-mediated actions on cognition are complemented by slower actions via glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) on contextualization, rationalization and memory storage of the experience. These sequential phases in cognitive performance depend on synaptic metaplasticity that is regulated by coordinate MR- and GR activation. The receptor activation includes recruitment of coregulators and transcription factors as determinants of context-dependent specificity in steroid action; they can be modulated by genetic variation and (early) experience. Interestingly, inflammatory responses to damage seem to be governed by a similarly balanced MR:GR-mediated action as the initiating, terminating and priming mechanisms involved in stress-adaptation.

The goals of this project are to encourage the ICU team to identify palliative care needs for patients and their families and potential ways to meet those needs. Design: Quality improvement project using a parallel-group prospective cohort design. Setting: Single neuro-ICU at a large, academic medical center. Patients: All patients admitted to the neuro-ICU from September 1, 2013, to November 30, 2013. Interventions: We developed a palliative care needs screening tool consisting of four questions: 1) Does the patient have distressing physical or psychological symptoms? 2) Are there specific support needs for patient or family? 3) Are treatment options matched with patient-centered goals? 4) Are there disagreements among teams and family? We implemented this daily screening tool on morning rounds for one of two neurocritical care services that alternate admitting days to a single neuro-ICU. We examined prevalence and nature of palliative care needs and actions to address those needs, comparing the services with and without screening. Measurements and Main Results: Over the 3-month period, 130 patients were admitted to the service with screening and 132 patients to the service without screening. The two groups did not differ with regard to age, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale, or diagnosis. Palliative care needs were identified in 62% of screened patients (80/130). Needs were mainly social support (53%) and establishing goals of care (28%). Screening was associated with more documented family conferences (p = 0.019) and a trend toward more palliative care consultations (p = 0.056). Conclusions: We developed a brief palliative care needs screening tool that identified palliative care needs for 62% neuro-ICU patients.

An optimum generalization strategy is used in order to avoid over-generalization and achieve accurate results. Comparisons with two empirical equations demonstrate that the new model in general provides a more accurate estimate of the work zone capacity, especially when the data for factors impacting the work zone capacity are only partially available.

It is a systematic computational method to address the situation where an existing device model cannot fit new device data well. By modifying the current and voltage relationships in the model, Neuro-SM produces a new model exceeding the accuracy limit of the existing model. In this paper, a novel analytical formulation of Neuro-SM is proposed to achieve the same accuracy as the basic formulation of Neuro-SM (known as circuit-based Neuro-SM) with much higher computational efficiency. Through our derivations, the mapping between the existing (coarse) model and the overall Neuro-SM model is analytically achieved for dc, small-signal, and large-signal simulation and sensitivity analysis. The proposed analytical formulation is a significant advance over the circuit-based Neuro-SM, due to the elimination of extra circuit equations needed in the circuit-based formulation. A two-phase training algorithm utilizing gradient optimization is also developed for fast training of the analytical Neuro-SM models. Application examples on modeling heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT), metal-semiconductor-field-effect transistor (MESFET), and high-electron mobility transmistor (HEMT) devices and the use of Neuro-SM models in harmonic balance simulations demonstrate that the analytical Neuro-SM is an efficient approach for modeling various types of microwave devices.

A self-organizing fuzzy identification algorithm (SOFIA) for identifying complex systems such as CO concentration is proposed. The main purpose of SOFIA is to reduce the computational requirement for identifying a fuzzy model. In particular, the authors simplify a procedure for finding the optimal structure of fuzzy partition. The /spl delta/ rule, which is a basic learning method in neural networks, is used for parameter identification of a fuzzy model. SOFIA consists of four stages which effectively realize structure identification and parameter identification. The procedure of SOFIA is concretely demonstrated by a simple example which has been used in some modeling exercises. The identification result shows effectiveness of SOFIA. Next, the authors apply SOFIA to a prediction problem for CO concentration in the air at the busiest traffic intersection in a large city of Japan. Prediction results show that the fuzzy model is much better than a linear model. Furthermore, the authors simulate a control system for keeping CO concentration at a constant level by using the identified fuzzy model. A self-learning method for adaptively modifying controller parameters by /spl delta/ rule is introduced because the dynamics of real CO concentration system changes gradually over a long period of time. Two self-learning controllers are designed in this simulation. One is a self-learning linear PI controller. The other is a self-learning fuzzy PI controller. The authors investigate robustness and adaptability of this control system for disturbance and parameter perturbation of the CO concentration model. Simulation results show that the self-learning fuzzy controller is more robust and adaptive.< <ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/91.413233", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110775809", "source": "openalex"}

All 115 patients were treated with corticosteroids; 53 (46.1%) also took cyclophosphamide and 40 (34.8%) also took azathioprine. A trend toward longer event-free survival was observed in patients with severe NBD (i.e., with a Rankin score of ≥3 at onset) receiving intravenous cyclophosphamide compared with those receiving azathioprine (P = 0.06).Our findings indicate that NBD is a severe condition in which patients with the HLA-B51 allele appear to experience a worse prognosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/art.38351", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1518690637", "source": "openalex"}

In this research, we collected multimodal EEG/ECG/EOG and fNIRS data simultaneously to develop algorithms to explore neuro-physiological correlates of drivers' mental states. Each subject performed simulated driving under two different conditions (well-rested and sleep-deprived) on different days. During the experiment, we used 68 electrodes for EEG/ECG/EOG and 8 channels for fNIRS recordings. We extracted the prominent features of each modality to distinguish between the well-rested and sleep-deprived conditions, and all multimodal features, except EOG, were combined to quantify mental fatigue during driving. Finally, a novel driving condition level (DCL) was proposed that distinguished clearly between the features of well-rested and sleep-deprived conditions. This proposed DCL measure may be applicable to real-time monitoring of the mental states of vehicle drivers. Further, the combination of methods based on each classifier yielded substantial improvements in the classification accuracy between these two conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00219", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2371731424", "source": "openalex"}

Besides that OCT testing is considered a powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration and a promising outcome measure for neuroprotective trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) technology allows quantification of retinal individual layers. The Ganglion Cell layer (GCL) investigation has become one of the most useful tools from a neuro-ophthalmic perspective. It has a high correlation with perimetry, is predictive of future progression and is a highly sensitive, specific of several neuro-ophthalmic pathologies. Moreover the superior correlation with clinical measures compared to peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) suggests that GCL analysis might be a better approach to examine MS neurodegeneration. In disorders with optic disk edema, such as ischemic optic neuropathy, papillitis and papilledema, reduction in RNFL thickness caused by axonal atrophy is difficult to distinguish from a swelling resolution. In this setting, and in buried optic nerve head drusen (ONHD), GCL analysis may provide more accurate information than RNFL analysis and it might be an early structural indicator of irreversible neuronal loss. Enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) provides in vivo detail of ONHD, allowing to evaluate and quantify the drusen dimensions. OCT is improving our knowledge in hereditary optic neuropathies.

Over time, some limitations of these criteria were identified, and challenges emerged regarding integrating features of the modified RANO (mRANO) or the immunotherapy RANO (iRANO) criteria. METHODS Informed by data from studies evaluating the different criteria, updates to the RANO criteria are proposed (RANO 2.0). RESULTS We recommend a standard set of criteria for both high- and low-grade gliomas, to be used for all trials regardless of the treatment modalities being evaluated. In the newly diagnosed setting, the postradiotherapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rather than the postsurgical MRI, will be used as the baseline for comparison with subsequent scans. Since the incidence of pseudoprogression is high in the 12 weeks after radiotherapy, continuation of treatment and confirmation of progression during this period with a repeat MRI, or histopathologic evidence of unequivocal recurrent tumor, are required to define tumor progression. However, confirmation scans are not mandatory after this period nor for the evaluation of treatment for recurrent tumors. For treatments with a high likelihood of pseudoprogression, mandatory confirmation of progression with a repeat MRI is highly recommended. The primary measurement remains the maximum cross-sectional area of tumor (two-dimensional) but volumetric measurements are an option. For IDH wild-type glioblastoma, the nonenhancing disease will no longer be evaluated except when assessing response to antiangiogenic agents. In IDH-mutated tumors with a significant nonenhancing component, clinical trials may require evaluating both the enhancing and nonenhancing tumor components for response assessment.

This is based on a self‐organizing rule‐base generator, a feedforward network, and fuzzy control arithmetic. Given the rainfall‐runoff patterns, ANFIS could systematically and effectively construct flood forecast models. The precipitation and flow data sets of the Choshui River in central Taiwan are analysed to identify the useful input variables and then the forecasting model can be self‐constructed through ANFIS. The analysis results suggest that the persistent effect and upstream flow information are the key effects for modelling the flood forecast, and the watershed's average rainfall provides further information and enhances the accuracy of the model performance. For the purpose of comparison, the commonly used back‐propagation neural network (BPNN) is also examined. The forecast results demonstrate that ANFIS is superior to the BPNN, and ANFIS can effectively and reliably construct an accurate flood forecast model.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely considered to be one of the major mechanisms underlying memory acquisition, consolidation and storage in the brain and is known to be controlled at the molecular level by the activation of a number of neuronal signalling pathways. These pathways include the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase B/Akt (Akt), protein kinase C, protein kinase A, Ca–calmodulin kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Growing evidence suggests that flavonoids exert effects on LTP, and consequently memory and cognitive performance, through their interactions with these signalling pathways. Of particular interest is the ability of flavonoids to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the Akt signalling pathways leading to the activation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein, a transcription factor responsible for increasing the expression of a number of neurotrophins important in LTP and long-term memory. One such neurotrophin is brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is known to be crucial in controlling synapse growth, in promoting an increase in dendritic spine density and in enhancing synaptic receptor density.

Despite exhaustive research, the cause of neuronal damage in these degenerative disorders is not completely understood. Elevation of cell surface α-enolase activates various inflammatory pathways, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and some growth factors that are detrimental to neuronal cells. While α-enolase is present in all neurological tissues, it can also be converted to neuron specific enolase (NSE). NSE is a glycolytic enzyme found in neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues that may play a dual role in promoting both neuroinflammation and neuroprotection in SCI and other neurodegenerative events. Elevated NSE can promote ECM degradation, inflammatory glial cell proliferation, and actin remodeling, thereby affecting migration of activated macrophages and microglia to the injury site and promoting neuronal cell death. Thus, NSE could be a reliable, quantitative, and specific marker of neuronal injury. Depending on the injury, disease, and microenvironment, NSE may also show neurotrophic function as it controls neuronal survival, differentiation, and neurite regeneration via activation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.

Allergies are caused by an overactive immune response to a foreign antigen. The peripheral sensory and autonomic nervous system densely innervates mucosal barrier tissues including the skin, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal (GI) tract that are exposed to allergens. It is increasingly clear that neurons actively communicate with and regulate the function of mast cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils, Th2 cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in allergic inflammation. Several mechanisms of cross-talk between the two systems have been uncovered, with potential anatomical specificity. Immune cells release inflammatory mediators including histamine, cytokines or neurotrophins that directly activate sensory neurons to mediate itch in the skin, cough/sneezing and bronchoconstriction in the respiratory tract and motility in the GI tract. Upon activation, these peripheral neurons release neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that directly act on immune cells to modulate their function. Somatosensory and visceral afferent neurons release neuropeptides including calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide, which can act on type 2 immune cells to drive allergic inflammation. Autonomic neurons release neurotransmitters including acetylcholine and noradrenaline that signal to both innate and adaptive immune cells. Neuro-immune signaling may play a central role in the physiopathology of allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis, asthma and food allergies. Therefore, getting a better understanding of these cellular and molecular neuro-immune interactions could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to treat allergic diseases.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxx040", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2736179926", "source": "openalex"}

Islanding detection and prevention is a mandatory requirement for grid‐connected distributed generation (DG) systems. Several methods based on passive and active detection scheme have been proposed. Although passive schemes have a large non‐detection zone (NDZ), concern has been raised on active method due to its degrading power‐quality effect. Reliably detecting this condition is regarded by many as an ongoing challenge as existing methods are not entirely satisfactory. The main emphasis of the proposed scheme is to reduce the NDZ to as close as possible and to keep the output power quality unchanged. In addition, this technique can also overcome the problem of setting the detection thresholds inherent in the existing techniques. In this study, we propose to use a hybrid intelligent system called ANFIS (the adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system) for islanding detection. This approach utilizes rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) at the target DG location and used as the input sets for a neuro‐fuzzy inference system for intelligent islanding detection. This approach utilizes the ANFIS as a machine learning technology and fuzzy clustering for processing and analyzing the large data sets provided from network simulations using MATLAB software. To validate the feasibility of this approach, the method has been validated through several conditions and different loading, switching operation, and network conditions. The proposed algorithm is compared with the widely used ROCOF relays and found working effectively in the situations where ROCOF fails. Simulation studies showed that the ANFIS‐based algorithm detects islanding situation accurate than other islanding detection algorithms. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Neuro control systems are defined as control systems in which at least one artificial neural network (ANN) is directly involved in generating the control command. Initially, neural networks were mostly used to model system dynamics inversely to produce a control command which pushes the system towards a desired or reference value of the output (1989). At the next stage, neural networks were trained to track a reference model, and ANN model reference control appeared (1990). In that method, ANNs were used to extend the application of adaptive reference model control, which was a well‐known control technique. This attitude towards the extension of the application of well‐known control methods using ANNs was followed by the development of ANN model‐predictive (1991), ANN sliding mode (1994) and ANN feedback linearization (1995) techniques. As the first category of neuro controllers, inverse dynamics ANN controllers were frequently used to form a control system together with other controllers, but this attitude faded as other types of ANN control systems were developed. However, recently, this approach has been revived. In the last decade, control system designers started to use ANNs to compensate/cancel undesired or uncertain parts of systems' dynamics to facilitate the use of well‐known conventional control systems. The resultant control system usually includes two or three controllers. In this paper, applications of different ANN control systems are also addressed.

According to the input-output data of the nonlinear system, an effective recurrent neural network is introduced to reconstruct the dynamics of the nonlinear system. Considering the system disturbance as a control input, a two-player zero-sum optimal control problem is established. Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is developed to obtain the optimal control under the worst case of the disturbance. Three single-layer neural networks, including one critic and two action networks, are employed to approximate the performance index function, the optimal control law, and the disturbance, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the ADP method.

Understanding the mechanisms and routes of control could produce novel and powerful ways of promoting and enhancing normal functions as well as preventing or treating abnormal functions. Fragmentation of biological research into specialities has resulted in some failures in recognising and understanding interactions across different systems and this is most striking across immunology, haematology and neuroscience. This reductionist approach does not allow understanding of the in vivo orchestrated response generated through integration of all systems. However, many factors make the understanding of multisystem cross-talk in response to a threat difficult, for instance the nervous and immune systems share communication molecules and receptors for a wide range of physiological signals. But, it is clear that physical, hard-wired connections exist between the two systems, with the key link involving sensory, unmyelinated nerve fibres (c fibres) containing the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and modified macrophages, mast cells and other immune and host defence cells in various locations throughout the body.

The neuro-immune-endocrine interface is mediated by cytokines acting as auto/paracrine or endocrine factors regulating pituitary development, cell proliferation, hormone secretion, and feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. At birth or during neonatal ontogenesis, cytokines produce permanent alterations of HPA axis function and the stress response. Overexpressing IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor leads to significant changes in pituitary development and functions. Pituitary corticotroph POMC gene expression is regulated by CRH as well as several gp130 cytokines acting as neuro-immuno-endocrine modulators. Conversely, HPA axis functions modulate susceptibility or resistance to inflammatory disease. Cytokines (including IL-1, TNF, and members of the gp130 cytokine family) participate as mediators of a complex HPA axis response to stress and inflammation. Prolonged exposure to proinflammatory cytokines increases levels of the dominant negative glucocorticoid receptor isoform. Nonresponsiveness of the HPA axis to glucocorticoid negative feedback control provides a defense from destructive effects of cytokine excess. At the same time, gp130 cytokines stimulate pituitary suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3, which represses cytokine signaling and abrogates cytokine-induced corticotroph POMC gene transcription and ACTH secretion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.143.5.8861", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139627687", "source": "openalex"}

The thoracic ECG is assumed to be almost completely maternal (MECG) while the abdominal ECG is considered to be composite as it contains both the mother's and the fetus' ECG signals. The maternal component in the abdominal ECG signal is a nonlinearly transformed version of the MECG. We use an ANFIS network to identify this nonlinear relationship, and to align the MECG signal with the maternal component in the abdominal ECG signal. Thus, we extract the FECG component by subtracting the aligned version of the MECG signal from the abdominal ECG signal. We validate our technique on both real and synthetic ECG signals. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in extracting the FECG component from abdominal signals of very low maternal to fetal signal-to-noise ratios. The results also show that the technique is capable of extracting the FECG even when it is totally embedded within the maternal QRS complex.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2006.883728", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2023474564", "source": "openalex"}

This study provides a comprehensive picture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes during neuro-inflammation by analyzing multiple cytokines in combination with immune cell subsets and standard CSF parameters. Methods Using multiplex assays, we simultaneously measured 36 cytokines (CCL1–3, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL19, CCL20, CCL22–27, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL11–13, CXCL16, CX3CL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL16, GM-CSF, IFNγ, MIF, TNFα, and MIB1β) in the CSF and serum of 75 subjects. Diagnoses included clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS, n = 18), secondary progressive MS ( n = 8), neuro-syphilis ( n = 6), Lyme neuro-borreliosis ( n = 13), bacterial and viral meningitis ( n = 20), and patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND, n = 10). Cytokine concentrations were correlated with CSF standard parameters and CSF immune cell subsets (CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, plasmablasts, monocytes, and NK cells) quantified by flow cytometry. Results We observed increased levels of multiple cytokines (26/36) in patients with neuro-inflammatory diseases when compared to NIND that consistently correlated with CSF cell count and Q Albumin . Most CSF cytokine concentrations correlated with each other, but correlations between CSF and serum values were scarce (3/36). Within the CSF compartment, CXCL13 showed a strong association with B cells when analyzing all patients, as well as patients with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). NK cells positively correlated with CSF concentrations of multiple cytokines (22/36) when analyzing all patients. These correlations were maintained when looking at patients with a disrupted BBB but not detectable in patients with an intact BBB. Conclusions Under conditions of neuro-inflammation, multiple CSF cytokines are regulated in parallel and most likely produced locally. A combined increase of CSF CXCL13 levels and B cells occurs under conditions of an intact BBB. Under conditions of a disrupted BBB, CSF NK cells show significantly increased values and seem to have a major contribution to overall inflammatory processes, reflected by a strong correlation with multiple cytokines. Future studies are necessary to address the exact kinetics of these cytokines during neuro-inflammation and their relation to specific diseases phenotypes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-019-1601-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2989190040", "source": "openalex"}

Such transformed cell lines often display morphological, developmental, and signaling characteristics that are substantially different from the parental cell type. Consequently, the response of neuroblastoma cells to toxin exposure may differ from that of neurons. An appreciation of the pharmacological and functional differences between neurons and neuron-like cell lines is therefore essential when interpreting data derived from neuroblastoma-based assays. We have compared the effects of several neurotoxins on Ca2+ homeostasis and cell viability in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro-2a).To explore the mechanisms underlying differential sensitivity of intact neurons and neuroblastoma cells to neurotoxins, we also compared CGN and Neuro-2a cells for expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). Cytotoxic potency in neurons was several orders of magnitude greater for Caribbean-ciguatoxin-1 (C-CTX-1) than either domoate (Dom) or brevetoxin-2 (PbTx-2). In addition, the cytotoxic potency of C-CTX-1 was two orders of magnitude greater in CGN than in Neuro-2a cells. The effect of C-CTX-1 and Dom on calcium homeostasis was compared in fluo-3 loaded neurons. Dom caused an elevation in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) at concentrations that paralleled the concentration/response relationship for cytotoxicity in CGN. Conversely, C-CTX-1 did not elevate [Ca2+]i within the dynamic concentration range for cell death. The discordance of the concentration/response relationships for C-CTX-1 induced cytotoxicity and [Ca2+]i elevation suggests that acute C-CTX-1 cytotoxicity may involve mechanisms other than Ca2+ load. C-CTX-1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in neurons was dependent on activation of NMDAR and the reverse mode of operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These data demonstrate that, although C-CTX-1, domoate, and PbTx-2 share the ability to produce neurotoxicity and mobilize calcium, their respective molecular targets and mechanisms of neurotoxicity differ. Neuro-2a cells that were not pretreated with veratridine and ouabain were insensitive to C-CTX-1 and glutamatergic agonists. VGSC expression was 20-fold lower in Neuro-2a cells than in CGN, whereas NMDARs were not expressed in these neuroblastoma cells. It is therefore likely that the enhanced sensitivity of CGN, relative to Neuro-2a cells, to neurotoxins is a consequence of pronounced differences in VGSC and NMDAR expression. These results underscore the need to exercise caution in interpreting negative cytotoxicity data derived from the use of neuroblastoma cell lines.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1615/critrevneurobiol.v17.i1.20", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019665288", "source": "openalex"}

In order to design effective drugs or apply the helpful surgical procedure it is essential to understand physiology of appetite control and pathophysiology of obesity. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy input in the form of food, equals energy expenditure through exercise, basal metabolism, thermogenesis and fat biosynthesis. The control of body weight actually concerns the control of adipose tissue with the key role of hypothalamus, possessing several neuronal centers such as that in lateral hypothalamic nuclei considered to be \"hunger\" center and in ventromedial nuclei serving as the \"satiety\" center. In addition, paraventricular and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei (ARC) are the sites where multiple hormones, released from the gut and adipose tissue, converge to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. There are two distinct types of neurons in ARC that are important in control of food intake; (1) preopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons activated by an orexigenic hormones and releasing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in satiety center and (2) neurons activated by orexigenic peptides such as ghrelin that release the substances including neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP) in hunger center. ARC integrates neural (mostly vagal) and humoral inputs such as enteropeptides including orexigenic (ghrelin and orexins) and an orexigenic peptides (cholecystokinin, polypeptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-1, oxyntomodulin, leptin and others) that exert a physiological role in regulating appetite and satiety.

Efforts to model the biochemical milieu of the AD brain may be greatly facilitated by combining two cutting edge technologies to generate three-dimensional (3D) human neuro-spheroid from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from AD subjects. We created iPSC from blood cells of five AD patients and differentiated them into 3D human neuronal culture. We characterized neuronal markers of our 3D neurons by immunocytochemical staining to validate the differentiation status. To block the generation of pathologic amyloid β peptides (Aβ), the 3D-differentiated AD neurons were treated with inhibitors targeting β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretases. As predicted, both BACE1 and γ-secretase inhibitors dramatically decreased Aβ generation in iPSC-derived neural cells derived from all five AD patients, under standard two-dimensional (2D) differentiation conditions. However, BACE1 and γ-secretase inhibitors showed less potency in decreasing Aβ levels in neural cells differentiated under 3D culture conditions. Interestingly, in a single subject AD1, we found that BACE1 inhibitor treatment was not able to significantly reduce Aβ42 levels. To investigate underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed proteomic analysis of 3D AD human neuronal cultures including AD1. Proteomic analysis revealed specific reduction of several proteins that might contribute to a poor inhibition of BACE1 in subject AD1. To our knowledge, this is the first iPSC-differentiated 3D neuro-spheroid model derived from AD patients' blood. Our results demonstrate that our 3D human neuro-spheroid model can be a physiologically relevant and valid model for testing efficacy of AD drug.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163072", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2527318689", "source": "openalex"}

McFIS has two components: a cognitive component and a metacognitive component. A neuro-fuzzy inference system forms the cognitive component of the McFIS, and a self-regulatory learning mechanism forms its metacognitive component. The learning ability of the cognitive component is monitored and controlled by the self-regulatory learning mechanism. For each sample in the training dataset, the metacognitive component uses its self-adaptive thresholds to choose one of the following learning strategies based on the criteria that depends on class-specific knowledge: 1) sample deletion; 2) sample learning; and 3) sample reserve. Thus, the metacognitive component decides what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn the training samples. When a new rule is added, the parameters of the new rule are assigned such that the rule has minimum overlapping with the adjacent rules as well as the localization property of the Gaussian rules is efficiently exploited. Performance of the McFIS is evaluated using several well-known benchmark multicategory/binary classification datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository and on a practical human action recognition problem.

The proposed recognition scheme utilizing the combined features with an ANFIS classification provided the best result in identifying complex hand movements.

Dizzy subjects were evaluated by blind neuro-otological testing, computerised dynamic posturography, a computerised psychiatric assessment, neuro-otological and general medical examination, and diagnosis. An age matched control group of 18 men and 22 women underwent the same evaluation. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Tests of auditory, vestibular, and oculo-motor function did not discriminate between dizzy subjects and controls, but dizzy subjects had significantly worse balance on posturographic testing, more diagnoses of medical disorder, and a higher prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> The findings suggest that dizziness in the community is typically characterised by mild physical disorder accompanied by some psychiatric disturbance. As the combination of minor physical and psychiatric disorder is known to be unusually persistent and handicapping, treatment programmes must be provided for this prevalent syndrome, perhaps by a partnership between primary care and neuro-otological and psychiatric hospital outpatient clinics with experience and expertise in the diagnosis and management of dizziness and psychiatric disturbance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.65.5.679", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2079668254", "source": "openalex"}

This should be followed by a rapid diagnosis and early intervention, and with such a modern approach many CN can now be healed and deformity prevented. CN can be divided into two phases: acute active phase and chronic stable phase. The acute active phase includes those patients presenting early with normal X-ray and those presenting later with deformity and radiological changes of CN. The acute phase is characterized by unilateral erythema and oedema. The foot is at least 2 °C hotter than the contralateral foot. Patients should have initially an X-ray examination which, at this time, may be normal. We then proceed to two investigations: initially a technetium diphosphonate bone scan, which will detect early evidence of bone damage and also locate the site of this damage. If the result of the bone scan is positive, we would proceed to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, which would describe in more detail the nature of the bony damage. The aim of treatment is immobilization in a plaster cast until there is no longer evidence on X-ray of continuing bone destruction, and the foot temperature is within 2 °C of the contralateral foot. An alternative treatment is a prefabricated walking cast, such as the Aircast. A randomized controlled study of a single 90 mg pamidronate infusion has shown a significant reduction of the markers of bone turnover and skin temperature in treated, compared with control subjects although the fall in skin temperature was similar in both groups. There was a similar finding in a recent study with alendronate. Calcitonin has also been used in the acute stage and there was a more rapid transition to the stable chronic phase in the treated group compared with controls. In the chronic stable phase, the foot is no longer warm and red. There may still be oedema but the difference in skin temperature between the feet is usually less than 2 °C. The X-ray shows fracture healing, sclerosis and bone remodelling. The patient must now be rehabilitated and gradually moved from cast treatment to suitable footwear. The patient needs close observation to detect any relapse, which will be evident from further swelling and heat in the foot. Careful rehabilitation is always necessary after a long period in a cast.

These are complex disorders with multiple causes—genetic, social, and environmental. The contribution of toxic chemicals to these disorders can be prevented. Approach: Leading scientific and medical experts, along with children's health advocates, came together in 2015 under the auspices of Project TENDR: Targeting Environmental Neuro-Developmental Risks to issue a call to action to reduce widespread exposures to chemicals that interfere with fetal and children's brain development. Based on the available scientific evidence, the TENDR authors have identified prime examples of toxic chemicals and pollutants that increase children's risks for neurodevelopmental disorders. These include chemicals that are used extensively in consumer products and that have become widespread in the environment. Some are chemicals to which children and pregnant women are regularly exposed, and they are detected in the bodies of virtually all Americans in national surveys conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vast majority of chemicals in industrial and consumer products undergo almost no testing for developmental neurotoxicity or other health effects. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we assert that the current system in the United States for evaluating scientific evidence and making health-based decisions about environmental chemicals is fundamentally broken. To help reduce the unacceptably high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders in our children, we must eliminate or significantly reduce exposures to chemicals that contribute to these conditions. We must adopt a new framework for assessing chemicals that have the potential to disrupt brain development and prevent the use of those that may pose a risk. This consensus statement lays the foundation for developing recommendations to monitor, assess, and reduce exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. These measures are urgently needed if we are to protect healthy brain development so that current and future generations can reach their fullest potential.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp358", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2460145472", "source": "openalex"}

Lagrangian sampling, which follows a parcel of water as it moves downstream, was used to link hydrological and chemical transformation processes. Wastewater loading of neuro-active compounds varied considerably over a span of several hours, and thus a sampling regime was used to verify that the Lagrangian parcel was being sampled and a mechanism was developed to correct measured concentrations if it was not. In-stream attenuation over the 5.4-km evaluated reach could be modeled as pseudo-first-order decay for 11 of the 14 evaluated neuro-active pharmaceutical compounds, illustrating the capacity of streams to reduce conveyance of neuro-active compounds downstream. Fluoxetine and N-desmethyl citalopram were the most rapidly attenuated compounds (t1/2 = 3.6 ± 0.3 h, 4.0 ± 0.2 h, respectively). Lamotrigine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, and carbamazepine were the most persistent (t1/2 = 12 ± 2.0 h, 12 ± 2.6 h, 21 ± 4.5 h, respectively). Parent compounds (e.g., buproprion, carbamazepine, lamotrigine) generally were more persistent relative to their metabolites. Several compounds (citalopram, venlafaxine, O-desmethyl-venlafaxine) were not attenuated. It was postulated that the primary mechanism of removal for these compounds was interaction with bed sediments and stream biofilms, based on measured concentrations in stream biofilms and a column experiment using stream sediments.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/es402158t", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2322005728", "source": "openalex"}

Likewise, the general failure of neuroscientists to postulate how basic brain circuits might mediate emotional urges has retarded the development of scientific perspectives that could inform new inquiries into the underlying dynamics and treatment of addictions. In this paper, we revisit the argument that prototypically abused substances activate or alter specific emotional brain systems that were evolutionarily designed to signal potential increments or decrements in fitness. We then discuss two distinct emotional systems (reward seeking and separation distress) which may track different types of potential changes in fitness. Based on this evolutionarily inspired approach, we illustrate how a mammalian model of emotion (i.e. rodent ultrasonic vocalizations) may enable scientists to predict drug‐related phenomena such as abuse potential, anatomical location of mediating neural substrates, and the psychological impact of withdrawal. We conclude by discussing some therapeutic and social implications of examining drug addiction processes with multiple emotional brain systems in mind.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00025.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159119970", "source": "openalex"}

There is substantial variation in the severity and persistence of cancer‐related fatigue that may be driven by individual differences in host factors, including characteristics that predate the cancer experience as well as responses to cancer and its treatment. This review examines biobehavioral risk factors linked to fatigue and the mechanisms through which they influence fatigue across the cancer continuum, with a focus on neuro‐immune processes. Among psychosocial risk factors, childhood adversity is a strong and consistent predictor of cancer‐related fatigue; other risk factors include history of depression, catastrophizing, lack of physical activity, and sleep disturbance, with compelling preliminary evidence for loneliness and trait anxiety. Among biologic systems, initial work suggests that alterations in immune, neuroendocrine, and neural processes are associated with fatigue. The identification of key risk factors and underlying mechanisms is critical for the development and deployment of targeted interventions to reduce the burden of fatigue in the growing population of cancer survivors. Given the multidimensional nature of fatigue, interventions that influence multiple systems may be most effective.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.31790", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2907220424", "source": "openalex"}

The NFS, after training with machine condition data, is employed as a prognostic model to forecast the evolution of the machine fault state with time. An online model update scheme is developed on the basis of the probability density function (PDF) of the NFS residuals between the actual and predicted condition data. Bayesian estimation algorithms adopt the model's predicted data as prior information in combination with online measurements to update the degree of belief in the forecasting estimations. In order to simplify the implementation of the proposed approach, a recursive Bayesian algorithm called particle filtering is utilized to calculate in real time a posterior PDF by a set of random samples (or particles) with associated weights. When new data become available, the weights of all particles are updated, and then, predictions are carried out, which form the PDF of the predicted estimations. The developed method is evaluated via two experimental cases-a cracked carrier plate and a faulty bearing. The prediction performance is compared with three prevalent machine condition predictors-recurrent neural networks, NFSs, and recurrent NFSs. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict machine conditions more accurately.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tim.2011.2169182", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1978654022", "source": "openalex"}

Then, a fuzzy IF-THEN rule is extracted from each cluster to form a fuzzy rule-base. Second, a fuzzy neural network is constructed accordingly and parameters are refined to increase the precision of the fuzzy rule-base. To decrease the size of the search space and to speed up the convergence, we develop a hybrid learning algorithm which combines a recursive singular value decomposition-based least squares estimator and the gradient descent method.

Computational approach to motivation deficits in neuro-psychiatric diseases", "text": "Motivation deficits, such as apathy, are pervasive in both neurological and psychiatric diseases. Even when they are not the core symptom, they reduce quality of life, compromise functional outcome and increase the burden for caregivers. They are currently assessed with clinical scales that do not give any mechanistic insight susceptible to guide therapeutic intervention. Here, we present another approach that consists of phenotyping the behaviour of patients in motivation tests, using computational models. These formal models impose a precise and operational definition of motivation that is embedded in decision theory. Motivation can be defined as the function that orients and activates the behaviour according to two attributes: a content (the goal) and a quantity (the goal value). Decision theory offers a way to quantify motivation, as the cost that patients would accept to endure in order to get the benefit of achieving their goal. We then review basic and clinical studies that have investigated the trade-off between the expected cost entailed by potential actions and the expected benefit associated with potential rewards. These studies have shown that the trade-off between effort and reward involves specific cortical, subcortical and neuromodulatory systems, such that it may be shifted in particular clinical conditions, and reinstated by appropriate treatments. Finally, we emphasize the promises of computational phenotyping for clinical purposes. Ideally, there would be a one-to-one mapping between specific neural components and distinct computational variables and processes of the decision model. Thus, fitting computational models to patients' behaviour would allow inferring of the dysfunctional mechanism in both cognitive terms (e.g. hyposensitivity to reward) and neural terms (e.g. lack of dopamine). This computational approach may therefore not only give insight into the motivation deficit but also help personalize treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awx278", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2769518948", "source": "openalex"}

Imaging plays a critical role in the management of the patient with glioma, from initial diagnosis to posttreatment follow-up, which can be particularly challenging for radiologists. Interpreting findings after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy requires profound knowledge about the tumor biology, as well as the peculiar changes expected to ensue as a consequence of each treatment technique. In this article, we discuss the imaging findings associated with tumor progression, tumor response, pseudoprogression, and pseudoresponse according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for high-grade and lower-grade gliomas. We describe relevant practical issues when evaluating patients with glioma, such as the need for imaging in the first 48 hours, the radiation therapy planning and isodose curves, the significance of T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions, the impact of the timing for the evaluation after radiation therapy, and the definition of progressive disease on the histologic specimen. We also illustrate the correlation among the findings on conventional MR imaging with advanced techniques, such as perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging, spectroscopy, and amino acid PET. Because many of the new lesions represent a mixture of tumor cells and tissue with radiation injury, the radiologist aims to identify the predominant component of the lesion and categorize the findings according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria so that the patient can receive the best treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3174/ajnr.a6358", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2994973210", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike opsoclonus, less characteristic eye movement abnormalities are difficult to recognize as presenting symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes. In this setting, the detection of several antibodies, including anti-Hu, Yo, Ma2, Ri, Tr, CV2/CRMP5 or voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies may help to establish that the neuro-ophthalmological disorder is paraneoplastic. Among the recently characterized antibodies, those against the Ma proteins often associate with brainstem encephalitis and vertical gaze paralysis. A small subset of patients with opsoclonus and ataxia harbor anti-Ri antibodies. In other patients, there is preliminary evidence that the autoantigens of opsoclonus reside in the postsynaptic density, but no dominant antibody marker has been identified. Uveitis and optic neuritis are rare accompaniments of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis; some of these patients harbor anti-CV2/CRMP5 in association with other antibodies. Studies on paraneoplastic retinopathy indicate that immunity to retinal proteins other than recoverin can result in a similar syndrome to that associated with recoverin antibodies, and that melanoma-associated retinopathy may associate with several retinal antibodies.There is increasing recognition of an extensive variety of neuro-ophthalmological abnormalities as manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes and of several antineuronal antibodies as clinical markers of these disorders.

Using four songbird species that differ selectively in sociality (one territorial, one modestly gregarious, and two highly gregarious species), we here examined immediate early gene (IEG) responses of relevant brain regions following exposure to a same–sex conspecific. The paradigm limited behavioural performance, thus species differences should reflect divergence in motivational and/or perceptual processes. Within the extended medial amygdala (which is involved in appetitive approach, social arousal and avoidance), we observed species differences in IEG response that are negatively graded in relation to sociality. In addition, brain areas that are involved in social stress and dominance–related behaviour (ventrolateral septum, anterior hypothalamus and lateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus) exhibited IEG responses that dichotomously distinguish the territorial species from the three gregarious species. The IEG responses of areas involved in reward (nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum) and general stress processes (e.g. paraventricular hypothalamus, lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and most areas of the lateral septum) do not correlate with sociality, indicating that social evolution has been accompanied by selection on a relatively discrete suite of motivational systems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2004.2892", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150337458", "source": "openalex"}

Fifty‐nine English language articles and six book chapters were included. The results indicate that exhaustion disorder ( ED ), as described in the Swedish version of the International Classification of Diseases, seems to be the most valid clinical equivalent of burnout. The data supports the notion that sleep impairments are causative and maintaining factors for this condition. Patients with clinical burnout/ ED suffer from cognitive impairments in the areas of memory and executive functioning. The studies on neuro‐biological mechanisms have reported functional uncoupling of networks relating the limbic system to the pre‐frontal cortex, and decreased volumes of structures within the basal ganglia. Although there is a growing body of literature on the physiological correlates of clinical burnout/ ED , there is to date no biomarker for this condition. More studies on the role of sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and neurobiological and physiological correlates in clinical burnout/ ED are warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/sjop.12251", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110371849", "source": "openalex"}

Here we show how this dysfunction differs between major IBS subgroups and how immunocytes communicate with sensory nerves. <h3>Design</h3> Peripheral blood mononuclear cell supernatants from 20 diarrhoea predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients, 15 constipation predominant IBS (C-IBS) patients and 36 healthy subjects were applied to mouse colonic sensory nerves and effects on mechanosensitivity assessed. Cytokine/chemokine concentration in the supernatants was assessed by proteomic analysis and correlated with abdominal symptoms, and expression of cytokine receptors evaluated in colonic dorsal root ganglia neurons. We then determined the effects of specific cytokines on colonic afferents. <h3>Results</h3> D-IBS supernatants caused mechanical hypersensitivity of mouse colonic afferent endings, which was reduced by infliximab. C-IBS supernatants did not, but occasionally elevated basal discharge. Supernatants of healthy subjects inhibited afferent mechanosensitivity via an opioidergic mechanism. Several cytokines were elevated in IBS supernatants, and levels correlated with pain frequency and intensity in patients. Visceral afferents expressed receptors for four cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. TNF-α most effectively caused mechanical hypersensitivity which was blocked by a transient receptor potential channel TRPA1 antagonist. IL-1β elevated basal firing, and this was lost after tetrodotoxin blockade of sodium channels. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Distinct patterns of immune dysfunction and interaction with sensory pathways occur in different patient groups and through different intracellular pathways.

Many patients suffering from neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, also commonly suffer from severe disabling fatigue. Such patients also present with chronic peripheral immune activation and systemic inflammation in the guise of elevated proinflammtory cytokines, oxidative stress and activated Toll-like receptors. This is also true of many patients presenting with severe, apparently idiopathic, fatigue accompanied by profound levels of physical and cognitive disability often afforded the non-specific diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate a positive association between the degree of peripheral immune activation, inflammation and oxidative stress, gray matter atrophy, glucose hypometabolism and cerebral hypoperfusion in illness, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and chronic fatigue syndrome. Most, if not all, of these abnormalities can be explained by a reduction in the numbers and function of astrocytes secondary to peripheral immune activation and inflammation. This is also true of the widespread mitochondrial dysfunction seen in otherwise normal tissue in neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases and in many patients with disabling, apparently idiopathic, fatigue. Given the strong association between peripheral immune activation and neuroinflammation with the genesis of fatigue the latter group of patients should be examined using FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tested for the presence of peripheral immune activation. It is concluded that peripheral inflammation and immune activation, together with the subsequent activation of glial cells and mitochondrial damage, likely account for the severe levels of intractable fatigue and disability seen in many patients with neuroimmune and autoimmune diseases.This would also appear to be the case for many patients afforded a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0259-2", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2041513052", "source": "openalex"}

Specifically, TBI can induce an increase in intestinal permeability, which may lead to bacterial translocation, sepsis, and eventually multi-system organ failure. However, the exact mechanism of increased intestinal permeability following TBI is unknown. We hypothesized that expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 and occludin, responsible for intestinal architectural and functional integrity, will decrease following TBI and increase intestinal permeability. BALB/c mice underwent a weight drop TBI model following anesthesia. Brain injury was confirmed by a neurologic assessment and gross brain pathology. Six hours following injury, FITC-dextran (25 mg 4.4 kDa FITC-dextran) was injected into the intact lumen of the isolated ileum. Intestinal permeability was measured in plasma 30 min following injection, by using spectrophotometry to determine plasma FITC-dextran concentrations. Whole ileum extracts were used to measure expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin by Western blot. TBI caused a significant increase in intestinal permeability (110.0 microg/mL +/-22.2) compared to sham animals (29.4 microg/mL +/- 9.7) 6 h after injury (p = 0.016). Expression of ZO-1 was decreased by 49% relative to sham animals (p < 0.02), whereas expression of occludin was decreased by 73% relative to sham animals (p < 0.001). An increase in intestinal permeability corresponds with decreased expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin following TBI.

Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1611.01855", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2953081964", "source": "openalex"}

This network plays a key role in diseases of the Central Nervous System (CNS) by involving cells (CNS resident cells, platelets, endothelium, and leukocytes) and molecular pathways (protease activity, complement factors, platelet granule content). Endothelial damage prompts platelet activation and the coagulation cascade as the first physiological step to support the rescue of damaged tissues, a flawed rescuing system ultimately producing neuroinflammation. Platelets, indeed, can release chemokines and cytokines (platelet factor 4, CXCL4), and growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Thrombin, plasmin, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), furthermore, activate intracellular transduction through protease-activated receptors (PARs). The complement cascade sustains the cellular response to insults by activating the innate immune system and guiding leukocytes migration or differentiation. Impairment of the neuro-immune hemostasis network induces acute or chronic CNS pathologies related to the neurovascular unit, either directly or by the systemic activation of its main steps. Glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a crucial function in a “pentapartite” synaptic model. Taking into account the neurovascular unit, in this review we thoroughly analyzed the influence of neuro-immune hemostasis on these five elements acting as a functional unit (synapse) in the adaptive and maladaptive plasticity and discuss the relevance of these events in inflammatory, cerebrovascular, Alzheimer, neoplastic and psychiatric diseases. Finally, we show a solid neuro-immune hemostatic network based on protein-protein interactions. We propose that, to better understand and favor the maintenance of adaptive plasticity, it would be useful to construct predictive molecular models, able to enlighten the regulating logic of the complex molecular network, which belongs to different cellular domains. It would be of interest to define how nodes of the network interact with basic cellular functions, such as mitochondrial metabolism, autophagy or apoptosis.

The proposed NF controller (NFC) incorporates fuzzy logic laws with a five-layer artificial neural network scheme. In this controller, only three membership functions are used for each input for low computational burden, which will be suitable for real-time implementation. Furthermore, for the proposed NFC, an improved self-tuning method is developed based on the knowledge of intelligent algorithms and high-performance requirements of motor drives. The main task of the tuning method is to adjust the parameters of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in order to minimize the square of the error between actual and reference outputs. A complete model for indirect field-oriented control of IM incorporating the proposed NFC is developed. The performance of the proposed NFC-based IM drive is investigated extensively both in simulation and in experiment at different operating conditions. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed NFC, the results for the proposed controller are also compared to those obtained by conventional proportional-integral (PI) and FLC controllers. The proposed NFC-based IM drive is found to be more robust as compared to conventional PI and FLC controllers and, hence, suitable for high-performance industrial drive applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tia.2007.900472", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154626487", "source": "openalex"}

METHODS: CT and 3 Tesla (3T) MR images (slice thickness 1 mm with intravenous contrast agent) were obtained from the same patient and subsequently fused. In addition, a 7T MR without intravenous contrast agent was obtained from a healthy volunteer. Based on discussion between experienced radiation oncologists, the clinically relevant organs at risk (OARs) to be included in the atlas for neuro-oncology were determined, excluding typical head and neck OARs previously published. The draft atlas was delineated by a senior radiation oncologist, 2 residents in radiation oncology, and a senior neuro-radiologist incorporating relevant available literature. The proposed atlas was then critically reviewed and discussed by European radiation oncologists until consensus was reached. RESULTS: The online atlas includes one CT-scan at two different window settings and one MR scan (3T) showing the OARs in axial, coronal and sagittal view. This manuscript presents the three-dimensional descriptions of the fifteen consensus OARs for neuro-oncology. Among these is a new OAR relevant for neuro-cognition, the posterior cerebellum (illustrated on 7T MR images). CONCLUSION: In order to decrease inter- and intra-observer variability in delineating OARs relevant for neuro-oncology and thus derive consistent dosimetric data, we propose this atlas to be used in photon and particle therapy.

Studies of chronic-phase out-patients demonstrated that similar benefits could be obtained which also lasted and were accompanied by a concomitant reduction of pain. Exploration of the likely biology of recovery suggested an improvement of robotic treatment in the form of performance-based progressive therapy aimed at accelerating a process akin to motor learning postulated to underlie recovery.

The advantages of (111)-oriented PZT (~1.2 nm) include its multiple ferroelectric switching dynamics, ultrafine ferroelectric domains, and small coercive voltage. The FTJ shows high-precision (256 states, 8 bits), reproducible (cycle-to-cycle variation, ~2.06%), linear (nonlinearity <1) and symmetric weight updates, with a good endurance of >109 cycles and an ultralow write energy consumption. In particular, manipulations among 150 states are realized under subnanosecond (~630 ps) pulse voltages ≤5 V, and the fastest resistance switching at 300 ps for the FTJs is achieved by voltages <13 V. Based on the experimental performance, the convolutional neural network simulation achieves a high online learning accuracy of ~94.7% for recognizing fashion product images, close to the calculated result of ~95.6% by floating-point-based convolutional neural network software.

Neurons use neuro-transmitters to communicate, and a great variety of molecules are known to fit the criteria to be classified as such. A process shared by all neuro-transmitters is their release by excocytosis, and we give an outline of the molecular events and protein complexes involved in this mechanism. Synthesis, transport, inactivation, and cellular signaling can be very diverse when different neuro-transmitters are compared, and these processes are described separately for each neuro-transmitter system. Here we focus on the most well known neuro-transmitters: acetyl-choline, catechol-amines (dopamine and nor-adrenalin), indole-amine (serotonin), glutamate, and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). Glutamate is the major excitatory neuro-transmitter in the brain and its actions are counter-balanced by GABA, which is the major inhibitory substance in the CNS. A balance of neuronal transmission between these two neuro-transmitters is essential to normal brain function. Acetyl-choline, serotonin and catechol-amines have a more modulatory function in the brain, being involved in many neuronal circuits. Apart from summarizing the current knowledge about the synthesis, release and receptor signaling of these transmitters, some disease states due to alteration of their normal neuro-transmission are also described.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2174/092986709787549271", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2121962935", "source": "openalex"}

Previous work identified in this area three groups of neurons encoding the offer value, the chosen value, and the identity of the chosen good. An important and open question is whether and how decisions could emerge from a neural circuit formed by these three populations. Here we adapted a biophysically realistic neural network previously proposed for perceptual decisions (Wang XJ. Neuron 36: 955-968, 2002; Wong KF, Wang XJ. J Neurosci 26: 1314-1328, 2006). The domain of economic decisions is significantly broader than that for which the model was originally designed, yet the model performed remarkably well. The input and output nodes of the network were naturally mapped onto two groups of cells in OFC. Surprisingly, the activity of interneurons in the network closely resembled that of the third group of cells, namely, chosen value cells. The model reproduced several phenomena related to the neuronal origins of choice variability. It also generated testable predictions on the excitatory/inhibitory nature of different neuronal populations and on their connectivity. Some aspects of the empirical data were not reproduced, but simple extensions of the model could overcome these limitations. These results render a biologically credible model for the neuronal mechanisms of economic decisions. They demonstrate that choices could emerge from the activity of cells in the OFC, suggesting that chosen value cells directly participate in the decision process. Importantly, Wang's model provides a platform to investigate the implications of neuroscience results for economic theory.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00184.2015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1869902417", "source": "openalex"}

A new kind of containment controllers consisting of a linear local information-based feedback term, a neuro-adaptive approximation term and a nonsmooth feedback term are designed to complete the goal of quasi-containment. Under the assumption that the subgraph depicting the coupling configuration among followers is detail-balanced and each follower can be influenced by at least one leader, it is proven that the containment error vector of the closed-loop MASs will be uniformly ultimately bounded if the control parameters of the proposed containment controllers are suitably designed. By introducing a pseudo ideal weighting matrix for NN approximator embedded at each follower, a novel class of containment controllers are further designed to precisely achieve asymptotic containment in the considered MASs where the Euclidean norm of containment error vector asymptotically converges to zero. At last, numerical simulations are given to verify the validity of these derived theoretical results.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmc.2017.2722042", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2739263230", "source": "openalex"}

Biological glycation has been commonly implicated in the development of diabetic microvascular complications of neuropathy. Increasing evidence suggests that neuronal cell cycle regulatory failure followed by apoptosis is an important mechanism in the development of diabetic neuropathy complication. Naturally occurring antioxidants, especially phenolic acids have been recommended as the major bioactive compounds to prevent chronic diseases and promote health benefits. The objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory abilities of phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid, syringic acid and vanillic acid) on methylglyoxal‐induced mouse Neuro‐2A neuroblastoma (Neuro‐2A) cell apoptosis in the progression of diabetic neuropathy. The data indicated that methylglyoxal induced mouse Neuro‐2A neuroblastoma (Neuro‐2A) cell apoptosis via alternation of mitochondria membrane potential and Bax/Bcl‐2 ratio, activation of caspase‐3, and cleavage of poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that activation of mitogen‐activated protein kinase signal pathways (JNK and p38) participated in the methylglyoxal‐induced Neuro‐2A cell apoptosis process. Treatment of Neuro‐2A cells with phenolic acids markedly suppresses cell apoptosis induced by methylglyoxal, suggesting that phenolic acids possess cytoprotective ability in the prevention of diabetic neuropathy complication.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700360", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2140509540", "source": "openalex"}

We introduce the Structured Event Memory (SEM) model of event cognition, which accounts for human abilities in event segmentation, memory, and generalization. SEM is derived from a probabilistic generative model of event dynamics defined over structured symbolic scenes. By embedding symbolic scene representations in a vector space and parametrizing the scene dynamics in this continuous space, SEM combines the advantages of structured and neural network approaches to high-level cognition. Using probabilistic reasoning over this generative model, SEM can infer event boundaries, learn event schemata, and use event knowledge to reconstruct past experience. We show that SEM can scale up to high-dimensional input spaces, producing human-like event segmentation for naturalistic video data, and accounts for a wide array of memory phenomena.

Maximum lesion-to-brain ratios (LBRs) were calculated and compared with MRI contrast enhancement (CE), which was graded visually on a 3-point scale (no/moderate/intense). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of brain tumor were 87% and 68%, respectively. Significant differences in LBRs were detected between high-grade brain tumors (LBR, 2.04 ± 0.72) and low-grade brain tumors (LBR, 1.52 ± 0.70; P < .001), as well as among inflammatory (LBR, 1.66 ± 0.33; P = .056) and other brain lesions (LBR, 1.10 ± 0.37; P < .001).

The proposed stock trading with forecast model uses the pseudo outer-product based fuzzy neural network using the compositional rule of inference [POPFNN-CRI(S)] with fuzzy rules identified using the RSPOP algorithm as the underlying predictor model and simple moving average trading rules in the stock trading decision model. Experimental results using the proposed stock trading with RSPOP forecast model on real world stock market data are presented. Trading profits in terms of portfolio end values obtained are benchmarked against stock trading with dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) forecast model, the stock trading without forecast model and the stock trading with ideal forecast model.

In the past years, feature learning methods that are applicable to graph-structured data are becoming available, but have not yet widely been applied and evaluated on structured biological knowledge. Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge graphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledge representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural networks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information within knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings contain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to the prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of function prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein interactions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that matches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually crafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph, and will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledge bases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics.

In this article, we use Williams syndrome and autism spectrum disorders as exemplars to demonstrate how atypicalities of social cognition may contribute to social vulnerability in these populations. The lives of individuals with both these disorders are marred by an increased risk of social isolation, bullying, unsteady relationships, employment difficulties and abuse.

However, the focal width is limited to be half centimeter scale. Minimizing the stimulation region with higher frequency ultrasound will provide a great opportunity to expand its application. This study first time examines the feasibility of using high frequency (5 MHz) ultrasound to achieve neuro-stimulation in brain and verifies the anatomical specificity of neuro-stimulation in vivo . 1 MHz and 5 MHz ultrasound stimulation were evaluated in the same group of mice. Electromyography (EMG) collected from tail muscles together with the motion response videos were analyzed for evaluating the stimulation effects. Our results indicate that 5 MHz ultrasound can successfully achieve neuro-stimulation. The equivalent diameter (ED) of the stimulation region with 5 MHz ultrasound (0.29 ± 0.08 mm) is significantly smaller than that with 1 MHz (0.83 ± 0.11 mm). The response latency of 5 MHz ultrasound (45 ± 31 ms) is also shorter than that of 1 MHz ultrasound (208 ± 111 ms). Consequently, high frequency (5 MHz) ultrasound can successfully activate the brain circuits in mice. It provides a smaller stimulation region, which offers improved anatomical specificity for neuro-stimulation in a non-invasive manner.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24738", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2341993109", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, the control and estimation of settlement is a significant issue in pilling design and construction. The objective of the present study is to introduce a modeling process of a hybrid intelligence system namely neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization (neuro-swarm) for estimation of pile settlement. To do that, properties results of several piles socketed into rock mass together with their settlements were considered as established databased to propose neuro-swarm model. Then, several sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the most influential particle swarm optimization parameters for pile settlement prediction. Eventually, five neuro-swarm models were constructed to understand the behavior of this hybrid model on them in pile settlement prediction. As a result, according to results of five performance indices, dataset number 4 showed the highest prediction capacity among all five datasets. The coefficient of determination (R2) and system error values of (0.851 and 0.079) and (0.892 and 0.099) were obtained respectively for train and test stages of the best neuro-swarm model which reveal the capability level of this hybrid model in predicting pile settlement.

They were treated over a 16-year period (1977–1993). Treatment modalities varied. Surgery and radiotherapy (RT) was the \"gold standard\" management method for the majority of these children. Only in the late 1980s did some of them receive chemotherapy (CT), mainly with vincristine, lomustine (CCNU) and prednisone. The median follow-up of the entire study population is 36 months (average 43 months; range 12 to 214 months). The 10-year overall (OS) and the progression-free survival (PFS) of the study population were 55.5% (CI 41.4–69.4%) and 34.7% (CI 21.4–47.8%), respectively. Age (<5 years; >5 years), sex, site (infratentorial vs. supratentorial), histology (anaplastic/malignant vs. non-anaplastic/non-malignant), type of resection (complete vs. incomplete); use and fields of RT, and of CT employed were entered in a multivariate regression model to test their impact on OS and PFS. On univariate analysis, radical surgery, the use of RT and age more than 5 years at the time of diagnosis achieved statistically significant values for predicting long-term OS and PFS. Histology reached marginal statistical significance but only for PFS. When those variables were entered in a multivariate analysis only radical resection (P = 0.00142 and 0.0001) resulted a significant factor for predicting long-term OS and PFS, while the use of RT reached a marginal statistical significance, but only for PFS (P = 0.05). Children who had the tumour completely resected did significantly better than all the others who had less than a complete resection, with a 10-year OS and PFS for the two groups of patients of 69.8% (CI 53–86.5%) and 57.2% (CI 40.3–75%) and of 32.5% (CI 8.5–57.6%) and 11.1% (0–24.4%), respectively. These findings suggest that, for childhood EPD, radical resection should be pursued as much as reasonably possible. Thus, it seems justified proposing for future trials, patient stratification by entity of surgical resection. Med. Pediatr.

When compared to nuclear DNA, such a double stranded mtDNA is more resistant to nuclease degradation. In fact, it is stable extracellularly where it can be detected in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), here acting as a potential biomarker in various disorders. In neurological diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and end-stage progressive Multiple Sclerosis), a decreased amount of CSF ccf-mtDNA is related with progressive cell dysfunction. This suggests an alteration in neuronal mtDNA levels (mtDNA replication, degradation and depletion) in vulnerable brain regions at early stages of neurodegeneration leading to reduced mtDNA release, which takes place before actual cell death occurs. On the other hand, elevated CSF ccf-mtDNA levels are reported in acute phases of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). This occurs during acute inflammation, which anticipates the neurodegenerative process. Thus, an increase in inflammatory cells in the affected regions is expected to add on mtDNA release into the CSF. In addition, similarly to bacterial DNA, the non-methylated CpG sites of mtDNA, which activate innate immunity and inflammation, are likely to participate in the molecular mechanisms of disease. Thus, ccf-mtDNA may represent a powerful biomarker for disease screening and prognosis at early stage, although its biological role may extend to generating the neurobiology of disease.

However, when it comes to reproductive processes, many of these model species differ notably in their mode of reproduction. A point in case are simultaneously hermaphroditic molluscs. In this review I aim to achieve two things. On the one hand, I provide a comprehensive overview of the neuro-endocrine control of male and female reproductive processes in freshwater snails. Even though the focus will necessarily be on Lymnaea stagnalis, since this is the best-studied species in this respect, extensions to other species are made wherever possible. On the other hand, I will place these findings in the actual context of the whole animal, after all these are simultaneous hermaphrodites. By considering the hermaphroditic situation, I uncover a numbers of possible links between the regulation of the two reproductive systems that are present within this animal, and suggest a few possible mechanisms via which this animal can effectively switch between the two sexual roles in the flexible way that it does. Evidently, this opens up a number of new research questions and areas that explicitly integrate knowledge about behavioral decisions (e.g., mating, insemination, egg laying) and sexual selection processes (e.g., mate choice, sperm allocation) with the actual underlying neuronal and endocrine mechanisms required for these processes to act and function effectively.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2010.00167", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2166925176", "source": "openalex"}

The neuro-metamaterials are fabricated from inhomogeneous metamaterials or transmission metasurfaces, and optimized using, such as topology optimization and deep learning. We demonstrate the concept in experiments where living rabbits play freely in front of the neuro-metamaterials, which enable to perceive in light speed the rabbits' representative postures. Furthermore, we show how this capability enables a new physical mechanism for creating dynamic optical mirages, through which a sequence of rabbit movements is converted into a holographic video of a different animal.

Burnout particularly affects physicians. In medicine as well as other professions, burnout occurrence depends on personal, developmental-psychodynamic, professional and environmental factors. Recently, it has been proposed to specifically define burnout in physicians as \"pathology of care relationship\". That is, burnout would arise, among the above-mentioned factors, from the specificity of the care relationship as it develops between the physician and the patient. Accordingly, experimental studies and theoretical approaches have suggested that burnout and empathy, which is one of the most important skills in physicians, are closely linked. However, the nature of the relation between burnout and empathy remains not yet understood, as reflected in the variety of theoretical and contradictory hypotheses attempting to causally relate these two phenomena. Firstly, we here question the epistemological problem concerning the modality of the burnout-empathy link. Secondly, we hypothesize that considering the multidimensional features of both burnout and empathy, on one hand, and on the other hand, the distinction between empathy and sympathy enables to overcome these contradictions and, consequently, gives a better understanding of the relationship between burnout and empathy in physicians. Thirdly, we propose that clarifying the link between burnout, empathy and sympathy would enable developing specific training in medical students and continuous professional formation in senior physicians and would potentially contribute to the prevention of burnout in medical care.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00763", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2407925834", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1998411339", "title": "A new example of a morphine‐sensitive neuro‐effector junction: Adrenergic transmission in the mouse vas deferens", "text": "The isolated mouse vas deferens possesses an adrenergic excitatory motor innervation which can be inhibited by low concentrations of morphine (ID50 = 0·5 μm). This effect of morphine is mediated by specific receptors which are blocked by naloxone. Activation of the morphine receptors inhibits noradrenaline release. It is concluded that adrenergic neurotransmission in the mouse vas deferens differs in some important way from that at the more common, morphine-insensitive, adrenergic junctions. The effects of morphine on the peripheral nervous system are very selective. For example, morphine inhibits cholinergic transmission in the guinea-pig ileum (Paton, 1957) and rabbit heart (Kosterlitz & Taylor, 1959) but has no effect on cholinergic transmission in the guinea-pig heart (Kosterlitz & Taylor, 1959) or rabbit ileum (Greenberg, Kosterlitz & Waterfield, 1970). This selectivity of action extends to the adrenergic system where the only example of morphine-sensitive neuroeffector transmission found so far is in the cat nictitating membrane (Trendelenburg, 1957; Thompson, 1960; Cairnie, Kosterlitz & Taylor, 1961). We have now discovered that morphine inhibits adrenergic neuroeffector transmission in the mouse vas deferens. Methods.—Male, albino mice, weighing 25–35 g, were killed by cervical dislocation; their vasa deferentia were dissected out and placed in warm Krebs solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl 118, KCl 4·75, CaCl2 2·54, MgSO4 1·19, NaHCO3 25, KH2PO4 0·93, glucose 11, tyrosine 0·25, ascorbic acid 0·1, disodium edetate 0·027. After any semen had been expressed from the lumen, the tissue was set up in an organ bath (4 ml) containing Krebs solution at 37°C and gassed with 95 % O2 and 5% CO2. The responses of the longitudinal muscle were recorded isometrically under a basal tension of 0·5 to 1 gramme. The intramural nerves were excited by rectangular pulses of 1 ms duration and of supra-maximal strength applied through platinum electrodes placed on either side of the vas. Release of endogenous noradrenaline was measured as described by Hughes (1972), the fluid from the donor bath being assayed for noradrenaline activity on superfused strips of rabbit aorta and iliac artery; to obtain a measurable output of noradrenaline, 3–5 vasa deferentia were set up in the same donor bath. All drug concentrations are given as μm. Results.—The vas deferens of the mouse contracts in response to single electrical pulses; continuous electrical stimulation at 0·1 Hz resulted in consistent responses over several hours. Contractions to electrical stimulation at 0·1 Hz were reduced by 80% by phentolamine hydrochloride (360 μm) and abolished by bretylium tosylate (20·6 μm). The inhibition due to bretylium was not affected by washing out the drug but was reversed by dexamphetamine sulphate (18·5 μm). The contractions were not depressed by hyoscine hydrobromide (0·23 μm) or hexamethonium bromide (490 μm). During electrical stimulation a substance was released which behaved like noradrenaline in that phentolamine reduced the contractions of both assay tissues to noradrenaline and the unknown substance to the same extent, whereas responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine or histamine were not reduced. Morphine hydrochloride (0·07–2·3 μm) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the contraction to electrical stimulation at 0·1 Hz; this effect reached its maximum within 2 min and was readily reversed by washing the drug out of the bath. From dose-response curves, the ID50 was calculated to be 0·47 ± 0·03 μm (n = 6). Maximally effective concentrations of morphine inhibited the contractions by 75–85%. Naloxone caused a parallel shift of the dose-response curves for morphine to the right. A plot of log (dose-ratio − 1) against log naloxone (M) gave a straight line (y = 0·937 x+7·82), from which the dissociation equilibrium constant (Ke) for naloxone was calculated to be 0·0045 μm. The pA2 of 8·35 was of the same order of magnitude as the value found in the guinea-pig ileum (Kosterlitz & Watt, 1968). The effect of morphine (0·7 μm) on noradrenaline release is shown in Figure 1. The output of noradrenaline and the contraction of the vas elicited by electrical stimulation at 1 Hz were reduced by 50 to 70 %. The effects of morphine on both the mechanical response and the noradrenaline output, were reversed within 15 min of washing the tissue. These results were repeated in four separate experiments. . Mouse vas deferens. Inhibition by morphine of contractions and of noradrenaline output. Four vasa deferentia were stimulated every 15 min by field stimulation (trains of 120 pulses of 1 ms duration of supramaximal strength at 1 Hz). Morphine (M) was added to the bathing fluid 1 min before stimulation and washed out (W) at the end of the collection period of 3 minutes. Upper panel, contractions recorded isometrically (calibration, 0·5 g tension). Lower panel, noradrenaline output (pg/120 pulses); clear columns, before and after exposure to morphine; solid columns, during exposure to morphine (0·7 μm). Discussion.—Morphine has a potent inhibitory effect on motor transmission in the mouse vas deferens. The results with naloxone leave little doubt that the effect is due to the interaction of morphine with a specific receptor site. Since the dissociation constant obtained for naloxone in this tissue is very similar to that found in the guinea-pig myenteric plexus (Kosterlitz & Watt, 1968) the receptors are probably of a similar nature. Although our evidence is not yet complete, we would suggest that the motor innervation of the mouse vas deferens is noradrenergic. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a cholinergic component responsible for the contractor response to electrical stimulation; a similar conclusion was reached by Farnebo & Malmfors (1971). It is therefore concluded that morphine directly affects the noradrenaline release mechanism, as it does in the cat nictitating membrane (Henderson, Hughes & Thompson, 1972). The mouse vas deferens should prove to be a useful tissue for investigating the mode of action of morphine and it may also be suitable as a screening method for narcotic analgesic drugs. For an understanding of the mode of action of morphine it would appear to be of considerable importance that, whereas transmission in the mouse vas deferens is depressed by morphine, transmission in the vasa deferentia of the rabbit and guinea-pig are not affected by this drug (Hughes, unpublished observations). Moreover, Henderson et al. (1972) have recently shown that, in the guinea-pig myenteric plexus, adrenergic transmission is morphine-insensitive although it is a well-established fact that the cholinergic transmission in this tissue is highly morphine-sensitive. Why some synaptic sites arc sensitive to morphine and others are not is an open question. As more morphine-sensitive sites are found, it is to be hoped that features common to transmission at such synapses, but not at morphine-insensitive sites, will become apparent. From the evidence available so far, two facts may be of importance. First, at junctions where morphine depresses transmission, this effect is observed at low but not at high frequencies of stimulation. Secondly, it has been found that, at such junctions, the output per pulse of acetylcholine or of noradrenaline is particularly high at low frequencies of stimulation; this relationship between frequency of stimulation and output seems to be absent at morphine-insensitive junctions (Greenberg et al., 1972).

Although HDAC inhibitors are used clinically to treat nervous system disorders, such as epilepsy, very little is known about the expression pattern of the HDACs in the central nervous system. Identifying the cell types and developmental stages that express HDAC1 and HDAC2 within the brain is important for determining the therapeutic mode of action of HDAC inhibitors, and evaluating potential side effects. Here, we examined the expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the murine brain at multiple developmental ages. HDAC1 is expressed in neural stem cells/progenitors and glia. In contrast, HDAC2 is initiated in neural progenitors and is up‐regulated in post‐mitotic neuroblasts and neurons, but not in fully differentiated glia. These results identify key developmental stages of HDAC expression and suggest transitions of neural development that may utilize HDAC1 and/or HDAC2.

In addition, the participation of dental nerves in pulpal injury responses and healing is discussed, especially concerning pulp regeneration and reinnervation after tooth replantation. The complex innervation of teeth is highly asymmetric and guided towards specific microenvironments along blood vessels or in the crown pulp and dentin. Pulpal products such as nerve growth factor are distributed in the same asymmetric gradients as the dentinal sensory innervation, suggesting regulation and recruitment of those nerve fibers by those specific factors. The nerve fibers have important effects on pulpal blood flow and inflammation, while their sprouting and cytochemical changes after tooth injury are in response to altered pulpal cytochemistry. Thus, their pattern and neuropeptide intensity are indicators of pulp status, while their local actions continually affect that status. When denervated teeth are injured, either by pulp exposure on the occlusal surface or by replantation, they have more pulpal necrosis than occurs for innervated teeth. However, small pulp exposures on the side of denervated crowns or larger lesions in germ‐free animals can heal well, showing the value of postoperative protection from occlusal trauma or from infection. Current ideas about dental neuroplasticity, neuro‐pulpal interactions, and nerve regeneration are related to the overall topics of tooth biomimetics and pulp/dentin regeneration. Microsc. Res.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2142190440", "title": "A stable pattern of EEG spectral coherence distinguishes children with autism from neuro-typical controls - a large case control study", "text": "The autism rate has recently increased to 1 in 100 children. Genetic studies demonstrate poorly understood complexity. Environmental factors apparently also play a role. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrate increased brain sizes and altered connectivity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence studies confirm connectivity changes. However, genetic-, MRI- and/or EEG-based diagnostic tests are not yet available. The varied study results likely reflect methodological and population differences, small samples and, for EEG, lack of attention to group-specific artifact. Of the 1,304 subjects who participated in this study, with ages ranging from 1 to 18 years old and assessed with comparable EEG studies, 463 children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 571 children were neuro-typical controls (C). After artifact management, principal components analysis (PCA) identified EEG spectral coherence factors with corresponding loading patterns. The 2- to 12-year-old subsample consisted of 430 ASD- and 554 C-group subjects (n = 984). Discriminant function analysis (DFA) determined the spectral coherence factors' discrimination success for the two groups. Loading patterns on the DFA-selected coherence factors described ASD-specific coherence differences when compared to controls. Total sample PCA of coherence data identified 40 factors which explained 50.8% of the total population variance. For the 2- to 12-year-olds, the 40 factors showed highly significant group differences (P < 0.0001). Ten randomly generated split half replications demonstrated high-average classification success (C, 88.5%; ASD, 86.0%). Still higher success was obtained in the more restricted age sub-samples using the jackknifing technique: 2- to 4-year-olds (C, 90.6%; ASD, 98.1%); 4- to 6-year-olds (C, 90.9%; ASD 99.1%); and 6- to 12-year-olds (C, 98.7%; ASD, 93.9%). Coherence loadings demonstrated reduced short-distance and reduced, as well as increased, long-distance coherences for the ASD-groups, when compared to the controls. Average spectral loading per factor was wide (10.1 Hz). Classification success suggests a stable coherence loading pattern that differentiates ASD- from C-group subjects.

We have identified at least 15 enhancers with an astounding complexity in arrangement and substructure that regulate Pox neurofunctions required for the development of the peripheral and central nervous system and of most appendages. Many of these functions are essential for normal male courtship behavior and fertility. Two enhancers regulate the development of the penis, claspers and posterior lobes of male genitalia. Three enhancers, two of which overlap, control the development of chemosensory bristles in the labellum, legs and wings, some or all of which are required for the transmission of gustatory signals elicited by female pheromones. An additional enhancer regulates in the developing brain the connectivity of two specific neuronal clusters entrusted with processing olfactory pheromone signals from the antennal nerve. Finally, functions crucial for the ability of the male to copulate depend on an enhancer that activates Pox neuroexpression in the embryonic ventral cord. In addition to these male courtship and fertility functions of Pox neuro, we have identified enhancers that regulate: (1) proper segmentation of tarsal segments in the leg disc and in homologous segments of the antennal disc; and (2) proper development of the wing hinge and hence the ability of the fly to fly.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.00157", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1989043599", "source": "openalex"}

They shall provide clinicians with guidance as to the course of disease to be expected and the choices of treatment to be made. Nonetheless, patients with histologically identical tumors may have very different outcomes, notably in patients with astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas of WHO grades II and III. In gliomas of adulthood, 3 molecular markers have undergone extensive studies in recent years: 1p/19q chromosomal codeletion, O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, and mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2. However, the assessment of these molecular markers has so far not been implemented in clinical routine because of the lack of therapeutic implications. In fact, these markers were considered to be prognostic irrespective of whether patients were receiving radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or both (1p/19q, IDH1/2), or of limited value because testing is too complex and no chemotherapy alternative to temozolomide was available (MGMT). In 2012, this situation has changed: long-term follow-up of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9402 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 26951 trials demonstrated an overall survival benefit from the addition to RT of chemotherapy with procarbazine/CCNU/vincristine confined to patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors with (vs without) 1p/19q codeletion. Furthermore, in elderly glioblastoma patients, the NOA-08 and the Nordic trial of RT alone versus temozolomide alone demonstrated a profound impact of MGMT promoter methylation on outcome by therapy and thus established MGMT as a predictive biomarker in this patient population. These recent results call for the routine implementation of 1p/19q and MGMT testing at least in subpopulations of malignant glioma patients and represent an encouraging step toward the development of personalized therapeutic approaches in neuro-oncology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nos206", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2163466967", "source": "openalex"}

Expiratory muscles are shown to be innervated by paired lateral nerves whereas the dorso-ventral inspiratory muscles are innervated by the unpaired median nerve system. Normal pumping activity is brought about by alternating bursts of impulses in expiratory and inspiratory motor nerves. Inspiratory bursts are relatively invariant, whereas expiratory bursts show a positive correlation with ventilatory cycle length. The firing patterns of some units within the bursts are described. In general anterior segments fire motor bursts earlier than posterior segments during well synchronized active ventilation, the metathoracic ganglion firing first. However, much variation is seen both within one locust and between different locusts. Burst-formation continues in isolated nerve cords. Activity, phase-locked with expiration, has been recorded in the connectives. The evidence suggests that it occurs in a pair of co-ordinating interneurones which run from the metathoracic ganglion to the last abdominal ganglion and determine the initiation, duration and possibly the intensity of the expiratory motor bursts in each segment. A second parallel system may co-ordinate activity when the metathoracic co-ordinating interneurones are inactive. Inspiratory motor neurones are probably autoactive and the duration of their firing may normally be determined by the discharge phase of a metathoracic oscillator which acts by inhibiting the co-ordinating interneurones.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.59.1.149", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2156064430", "source": "openalex"}

Using high‐pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC‐ECD) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (R)‐salsolinol (SAL) (a dopamine‐related stereo‐specific tetrahydroisoquinoline) was found to be present in neuro‐intermediate lobe as well as median eminence extracts of male, intact‐, and ovariectomized female rats. Moreover, analysis of SAL concentrations in neuro‐intermediate lobe revealed parallel increases with plasma prolactin in lactating rats exposed to a brief (10 min) suckling stimulus following 4‐h separation. SAL appears to be a selective and potent stimulator of prolactin secretion in vivo and it was without effect on the secretion of other pituitary hormones. We have also found that SAL can elevate prolactin release, although to a lesser extent, in pituitary cell cultures as well as in hypophysectomized rats bearing anterior lobe transplants under the kidney capsule. Lack of interference of SAL with [ 3 H]‐spiperone binding to AP homogenates indicates that SAL does not act at the dopamine D 2 receptor. Moreover, [ 3 H]‐SAL binds specifically to homogenate of AL as well as neuro‐intermediate lobe obtained from lactating rats. Taken together, our data clearly suggest that SAL is synthesized in situ and this compound can play a role in the regulation of pituitary prolactin secretion.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2826.2001.00725.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1559145739", "source": "openalex"}

UPF3B and RBM8A, important components of NMD, have been implicated in various forms of intellectual disability (ID) and Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radius (TAR) syndrome, which is also associated with ID. To gauge the contribution of other NMD factors to ID, we performed a comprehensive search for copy number variants (CNVs) of 18 NMD genes among individuals with ID and/or congenital anomalies. We identified 11 cases with heterozygous deletions of the genomic region encompassing UPF2, which encodes for a direct interacting protein of UPF3B. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that the genome-wide consequence of reduced expression of UPF2 is similar to that seen in patients with UPF3B mutations. Out of the 1009 genes found deregulated in patients with UPF2 deletions by at least 2-fold, majority (95%) were deregulated similarly in patients with UPF3B mutations. This supports the major role of deletion of UPF2 in ID. Furthermore, we found that four other NMD genes, UPF3A, SMG6, EIF4A3 and RNPS1 are frequently deleted and/or duplicated in the patients. We postulate that dosage imbalances of these NMD genes are likely to be the causes or act as predisposing factors for neuro-developmental disorders.

Steroids are particularly important in the setting of supportive therapy. They are commonly used to treat tumor-associated edema, and their administration is typically associated with rapid symptom relief, such as the resolution of headaches. Besides their antiedema activity, corticosteroids are characterized by their potent antilymphoma properties and their effects against acute or delayed emesis caused by systemic chemotherapy in cancer patients. Accordingly, steroids are among the most frequently used drugs in oncology. These desirable properties of steroids are counterbalanced by cardiovascular, muscular, and psychiatric side effects. On the cellular level, corticosteroids exert various effects that translate into the desired clinical activity, but they also evoke significant toxicity that may outweigh the beneficial effects. The mode of action and the limitations of steroid treatment are summarized in this review article. Interactions between steroids and other drugs must be considered. A particular challenge to the ongoing use of glucocorticoids is that newer therapeutic approaches are being introduced in neuro-oncology for which concomitant steroids are likely to be contraindicated. These include the emergence of various immunotherapeutic approaches including vaccination strategies and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Since the administration of steroids may interfere with the activity of these novel therapies, an even more critical evaluation of their use will be required.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/nop/npu029", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070119664", "source": "openalex"}

The afferent and efferent pathways are vulnerable to traumatic injury, although the efferent system is more commonly affected.

An unmated individual is an evolutionary dead-end whose genes are lost to future generations of its species. Approximately the same outcome lies in store for the genes of indi­ viduals which mate inappropriately and leave offspring of reduced fitness or no offspring at all. This opening statement serves to emphasize the strength of the selective forces acting on behaviors and physiological mechanisms related to the act of copulation. It may be assumed that each behavior or physiologi­ cal mechanism influencing mating has an adaptive significance in promoting reproductive success. In insects, location and selection of a suitable mate de­ pends primarily on inherited mechanisms owing to limitations of time, neural circuitry, and lack of parental care. Even though internally controlled, the development and performance of mating behavior must be sensitive to envi­ ronmental conditions if for no other reason than that successful copulation demands the cooperation of a member of the opposite sex. Mutual stimula­ tion of mating partners seems to be the predominant pattern in insects; there­ fore, it seems appropriate to look for control mechanisms in the area of coor­ dination of sensory input and motor responses, i.e. in the central nervous sys­ tem. The efficiency of the reproductive effort will be increased if there is some method of synchronizing the act of copulation with the presence of mature or nearly mature gametes and, in the case of the male, the ability to produce the secretions necessary for sperm transfer. Oocyte development and the produc­ tion of accessory gland substances are dependent on the synthesis of specific proteins. This protein synthesis is stimulated in most cases by hormones re­ leased into the blood, of which the hormonal product of the copora allata predominates. Both nervous and hormonal mechanisms are important in coordinating reproductive processes. The neuroendocrine system is the essen­ tial connecting link between the two coordinating systems, operating so that behavior can be coordinated with gamete maturation. There exists a consider­ able body of literature which concerns itself with the identification and de-", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.en.18.010173.002305", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152564314", "source": "openalex"}

Methods MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to January 2004 using the following terms: spinal cord compression, nerve compression syndromes, spinal cord neoplasms, clinical trial, meta-analysis, and systematic review. Results Symptoms for MSCC include sensory changes, autonomic dysfunction, and back pain; however, back pain was not predictive of MSCC. The sensitivity and specificity for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) range from 0.44 to 0.93 and 0.90 to 0.98, respectively, in the diagnosis of MSCC. The sensitivity and specificity for myelography range from 0.71 to 0.97 and 0.88 to 1.00, respectively. A randomized study detected higher ambulation rates in patients with MSCC who received high-dose dexamethasone before radiotherapy (RT) compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids before RT (81% v 63% at 3 months, respectively; P = .046). There is no direct evidence that supports or refutes the type of surgery patients should have for the treatment of MSCC, whether surgical salvage should be attempted if patient is progressing on or shortly after RT, and whether patients with spinal instability should be treated with surgery. Conclusion Patients with symptoms of MSCC should be managed to minimize treatment delay. MRI is the preferred imaging technique. Treatment for patients with MSCC should consider pretreatment ambulatory status, comorbidities, technical surgical factors, the presence of bony compression and spinal instability, potential surgical complications, potential RT reactions, and patient preferences.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2005.00.067", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4236195741", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we consider the optimal control problem of the general highly dissipative SDPs, and propose an adaptive optimal control approach based on neuro-dynamic programming (NDP). Initially, Karhunen-Loève decomposition is employed to compute empirical eigenfunctions (EEFs) of the SDP based on the method of snapshots. These EEFs together with singular perturbation technique are then used to obtain a finite-dimensional slow subsystem of ordinary differential equations that accurately describes the dominant dynamics of the PDE system. Subsequently, the optimal control problem is reformulated on the basis of the slow subsystem, which is further converted to solve a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. HJB equation is a nonlinear PDE that has proven to be impossible to solve analytically. Thus, an adaptive optimal control method is developed via NDP that solves the HJB equation online using neural network (NN) for approximating the value function; and an online NN weight tuning law is proposed without requiring an initial stabilizing control policy. Moreover, by involving the NN estimation error, we prove that the original closed-loop PDE system with the adaptive optimal control policy is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the developed method is tested on a nonlinear diffusion-convection-reaction process and applied to a temperature cooling fin of high-speed aerospace vehicle, and the achieved results show its effectiveness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2014.2320744", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2032704188", "source": "openalex"}

Groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources in the world (Jha et al., 2007). However, it is not an unlimited resource; therefore understanding groundwater potential is crucial to ensure its sustainable use. The aim of the current study is to propose and verify new artificial intelligence methods for the spatial prediction of groundwater spring potential mapping at the Koohdasht–Nourabad plain, Lorestan province, Iran. These methods are new hybrids of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and five metaheuristic algorithms, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), differential evolution (DE), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the bees algorithm (BA). A total of 2463 spring locations were identified and collected, and then divided randomly into two subsets: 70 % (1725 locations) were used for training models and the remaining 30 % (738 spring locations) were utilized for evaluating the models. A total of 13 groundwater conditioning factors were prepared for modeling, namely the slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), terrain roughness index (TRI), distance from fault, distance from river, land use/land cover, rainfall, soil order, and lithology. In the next step, the step-wise assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method was applied to quantify the degree of relevance of these groundwater conditioning factors. The global performance of these derived models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). In addition, the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were carried out to check and confirm the best model to use in this study. The result showed that all models have a high prediction performance; however, the ANFIS–DE model has the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.875), followed by the ANFIS–IWO model, the ANFIS–FA model (0.873), the ANFIS–PSO model (0.865), and the ANFIS–BA model (0.839).

Some of these solutions have used artificial intelligence methods like fuzzy logic and neural networks. However, their individual implementation suffers from certain drawbacks, such as the black-box nature of neural network and the problem of finding suitable membership functions for fuzzy systems. These weaknesses can be avoided by implementing a hybrid structure combining these two approaches, the so-called neuro-fuzzy system. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy system that implements differential neural networks (DNNs) as consequences of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy inference rules is proposed. The DNNs substitute the local linear systems that are used in the common T-S method. In this paper, DNNs are used to provide an effective instrument for dealing with the identification of the uncertain nonlinear system, while the T-S rules are used to provide the framework of previous knowledge of the system. The main idea is to carry out an online identification process of an uncertain nonlinear system with the aim to design a closed-loop trajectory tracking controller. The methodology developed in this study that supports the identification and trajectory control designs is based on the Lyapunov formalism. The DNN implementation results in a time-varying T-S system. As a consequence, the solution of two time-varying Riccati equations was used to adjust the learning laws in the DNN as well as to adjust the gains of the controller. Two results were provided to justify the existence of positive-definite solutions for the class of Riccati equations used in the learning laws of DNNs. A complete description of the learning laws used for the set of DNN identifiers is also obtained. An autonomous underwater vehicle system is used to demonstrate the performance of the controller on tracking a desired 3-D path by this combination of the DNN and the T-S system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2016.2612697", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2523592132", "source": "openalex"}

A Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group of experts in LM critically reviewed published literature regarding randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and trial design in patients with LM. A literature review determined that 6 RCTs regarding the treatment of LM have been published, all of which assessed the response to intra-CSF based chemotherapy. Amongst these RCTs, only a single trial attempted to determine whether intra-CSF chemotherapy was of benefit compared with systemic therapy. Otherwise, this pragmatic question has not been formally addressed in patients with solid cancers and LM. The methodology of the 6 RCTs varied widely with respect to pretreatment evaluation, type of treatment, and response to treatment. Additionally there was little uniformity in reporting of treatment-related toxicity. One RCT suggests no advantage of combined versus single-agent intra-CSF chemotherapy in patients with LM. No specific intra-CSF regimen has shown superior efficacy in the treatment of LM, with the exception of liposomal cytarabine in patients with lymphomatous meningitis. Problematic with all RCTs is the lack of standardization with respect to response criteria. There was considerable variation in definitions of response by clinical examination, neuroimaging, and CSF analysis. Based upon a review of published RCTs in LM, there exists a significant unmet need for guidelines for evaluating patients with LM in clinical practice as well as for response assessment in clinical trials.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nou089", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2171926883", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence of neuro‐inflammation was identified in the ‘binge drinking’ rat model of alcohol abuse after 3 weeks of administration of 2 or 3 g/kg ethanol (EtOH), three times per day for two consecutive days, followed by 5 days of abstinence: Firstly, alveolar macrophages, isolated from these animals, showed significant increases in inducible nitric oxide synthase, as assayed by nitrite release, both before and after lipopolysaccaharide stimulation. Secondly, significant numbers of activated microglia were present in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus of the ‘binge drinking’ model, after major histocompatibility complex class II staining, by comparison with the control. Microdialysis studies in the ventral hippocampus identified a significant increase in the basal extracellular concentration of glutamate, in both the 2 and 3 g/kg administered ‘binge drinking’ rats. In contrast, no changes in the hippocampal extracellular concentrations, of GABA and taurine, or the dopamine and serotonin metabolites were observed under basal conditions. A further dose of EtOH induced a significant decrease in the concentrations of both 3,4‐dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5‐hydroxyindoleacetic acid, whereas glutamate, taurine and GABA levels were unaffected. There was no evidence that EtOH preference was initiated by the ‘binge drinking’ regimen. Our results suggest that the possible toxicity associated with ‘binge drinking’ maybe directed by the elevated glutamate levels, which in turn, activate phagocytic cells to release their inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, ultimately leading to neuro‐inflammation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06389.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046811309", "source": "openalex"}

Moreover, after failing adjuvant therapy, few active treatments are available. In this setting, novel agents, such as new chemotherapy compounds and anticancer agents against specific molecular targets, have therefore been investigated. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an intriguing target in high-grade gliomas because it is frequently overexpressed due to amplification of the EGFR gene. Gefitinib and erlotinib act as ATP mimetic agents, binding to the cytoplasmic ATP pocket domain and blocking receptor phosphorylations and, thereby, EGFR-mediated activation of downstream pathways. These drugs have been evaluated in several clinical trials treating recurrent high-grade gliomas with contrasting results. Retrospective correlative analyses generated a plethora of putative predictive factors of activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The first generations of studies on EGFR inhibitors have not found significant activity of these agents in high-grade gliomas. Furthermore, no clear molecular or clinical predictors have been identified. As with other targeted agents, prospective trials using specific criteria and standardized methods to evaluate tissue biomarkers are required to find predictors of EGFR inhibitors activity in high-grade glioma patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-07-1810", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2101057168", "source": "openalex"}

Due to the nonlinear and fuzzy behaviour of hydrological processes, and in cases of scarcity of relevant data, it is difficult to simulate the desired outflow using physically-based models. Artificial intelligence techniques, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), were used in the reported study to estimate the flow at the downstream stretch of a river using flow data for upstream locations. Comparison of the performance of ANN and ANFIS was made by estimating daily outflow from a barrage located in the downstream region of Mahanadi River basin, India, using daily release data from the Hirakud Reservoir, located some distance upstream of the barrage. To obtain the best input—output mapping, five different models with various input combinations were evaluated using both techniques. The significance of the contribution of two upstream tributaries to barrage outflow estimation was also evaluated. Three feed-forward back-propagation training algorithms were used to train the models. Standard performance indices, such as correlation coefficient, index of agreement, root mean square error, modelling efficiency and percentage deviation in peak flow, were used to compare the performance of the models, as well as the training techniques. The results revealed that the neural network with conjugate gradient algorithm performs better than Levenberg-Marquardt and gradient descent algorithms. The model which considers as input the reservoir release up to three antecedent time steps produced the best results. It was found that barrage outflow could be better estimated by the ANFIS than by the ANN technique. Résumé Le flux sortant d'un barrage devrait être maintenu à un niveau approprié pour éviter les inondations à l'aval durant la saison humide. En raison du comportement non-linéaire et flou des processus hydrologiques, et dans le cas où les données pertinentes sont rares, il est difficile de simuler le flux sortant souhaitable à l'aide de modèles à bases physiques. Des techniques d'intelligence artificielle, en l'occurrence à base de réseau de neurones artificiels (RNA) et de système d'inférence neuro-floue adaptatif (ANFIS), ont été utilisées dans cette étude pour estimer le débit dans le tronçon aval d'une rivière à l'aide des données de débit en des sites amont. La comparaison des performances des RNA et de ANFIS a été menée pour l'estimation du flux journalier issu d'un barrage situé dans la région aval du basin de la Rivière Mahanadi en Inde, à partir des données de lâchure du Barrage Hirakud situé à l'amont. Afin d'obtenir la meilleure cartographie entrées—sorties, cinq modèles différents avec plusieurs combinaisons d'entrées ont été évalués avec les deux techniques. La significativité de la contribution des deux affluents amont pour l'estimation du flux sortant du barrage a également été évaluée. Trois algorithmes d'apprentissage progressif avec rétropropagation ont été utilisés pour renseigner les modèles. Des indices de performance standard, comme le coefficient de corrélation, l'indice de satisfaction, l'erreur quadratique moyenne, l'efficience de modélisation et le pourcentage d'écart du pic de débit, ont été utilisés pour comparer les performances des modèles ainsi que des techniques d'apprentissage. Les résultats montrent que le réseau de neurones avec un algorithme de gradient conjugué donne de meilleurs résultats que les algorithmes de Levenberg-Marquardt et de gradient descendant.

The system of analysis of the electronic environment is not an exception. However, there are a number of problems in the analysis of the electronic environment, namely the signals. They are analyzed in a complex electronic environment against the background of intentional and natural interference. Also, the input signals do not match the standards due to the influence of different types of interference. Interpretation of signals depends on the experience of the operator, the completeness of additional information on a specific condition of uncertainty. The best solution in this situation is to integrate with the data of the information system analysis of the electronic environment and artificial neural networks. Their advantage is also the ability to work in real time and quick adaptation to specific situations. These circumstances cause uncertainty in the conditions of the task of signal recognition and fuzzy statements in their interpretation, when the additional involved information may be incomplete and the operator makes decisions based on their experience. That is why, in this article, an improved method for finding solutions for neuro-fuzzy expert systems of analysis of the electronic environment is developed. Improving the efficiency of information processing (reducing the error) of evaluation is achieved through the use of neuro-fuzzy artificial neural networks that are evolving and learning not only the synaptic weights of the artificial neural network, but also the type and parameters of the membership function. High efficiency of information processing is also achieved through training in the architecture of artificial neural networks by taking into account the type of uncertainty of the information that has to be assessed and work with clear and fuzzy products. This reduces the computational complexity of decision-making and absence of accumulation of an error of training of artificial neural networks as a result of processing of the arriving information on an input of artificial neural networks. The use of the proposed method was tested on the example of assessing the state of the electronic environment. This example showed an increase in the efficiency of assessment at the level of 20–25 % on the efficiency of the processing information", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.21303/2461-4262.2020.001353", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3043853222", "source": "openalex"}

In the majority of cases, this distinction can be made following a careful clinical examination combined with a variety of imaging techniques. Possible mechanisms, which lead to changes in optic disc morphology, are reviewed. Conclusions: Differentiating glaucomatous from nonglaucomatous optic disc cupping can be a formidable challenge for the clinician. Examination of the patient combined with imaging of the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic disc topography provides a basis to resolve this clinical conundrum.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000080", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007022465", "source": "openalex"}

Diabetic retinopathy is now recognized to be an inflammatory, neuro-vascular complication with neuronal injury/dysfunction preceding clinical microvascular damage. Importantly, the same pathophysiologic mechanisms that damage the pancreatic -cell (e.g. inflammation, epigenetic changes, insulin resistance, fuel excess and abnormal metabolic environment), also lead to cell and tissue damage causing organ dysfunction, elevating the risk of all complications, including diabetic retinopathy. Viewing diabetic retinopathy within the context whereby diabetes and all its complications arise from common pathophysiologic factors allows for the consideration of a wider array of potential ocular as well as systemic treatments for this common and devastating complication. Moreover, it also raises the importance of the need for methods that will provide more timely detection and prediction of the course in order to address early damage to the neurovascular unit prior to the clinical observation of microangiopathy. Currently, treatment success is limited as it is often initiated far too late and after significant neurodegeneration has occurred. This forward-thinking approach of earlier detection and treatment with a wider array of possible therapies broadens the physician's armamentarium and increases the opportunity for prevention and early treatment of diabetic retinopathy with preservation of good vision, as well the prevention of similar destructive processes occurring among other organs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2019.00843", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2990284764", "source": "openalex"}

We examined the induction of antitumor immunity with neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells transfected with FasL cDNA (Neuro-2a+FasL). Neuro-2a+FasL cells expressed FasL on the cell surface and secreted soluble FasL. Histologic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that Neuro-2a+FasL cells caused neutrophils to infiltrate into the injected site, resulting in strong inflammation. Neutrophil infiltration was inhibited by treatment with anti-FasL mAb and did not occur in Fas-deficient lpr mice. Normal syngeneic mice rejected Neuro-2a+FasL cells after the inflammation and acquired tumor-specific protective immunity. CD8+ T cells were responsible for the antitumor immunity. Neuro-2a+FasL cells formed tumors after far longer latency compared with mock-transfected Neuro-2a+Neo cells in nude mice, and immune competent mice rejected Neuro-2a cells but not sarcoma S713a cells when they were injected with Neuro-2a+FasL cells in a mixture. These results suggest that neutrophils attracted through the Fas-FasL system may impair tumor cells by inflammation at the initial step, followed by development of CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor-specific antitumor immunity, leading to complete eradication of tumor cells. Importantly, the treatment with Neuro-2a+FasL cells exhibited therapeutic efficacy against growing tumors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.162.12.7350", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2098593116", "source": "openalex"}

Many synthetic materials have been used for dural closure. Neuro-Patch (B. Braun Médical S.A., Boulogne, France) is a nonabsorbable microporous fleece composed of polyester urethane that has been approved for human use by the European Union since 1995. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical series with Neuro-Patch have been published thus far, particularly with regard to septic complications. The aim of our study was to compare the safety of Neuro-Patch with that of pericranium graft with regard to postoperative wound infections. METHODS This is a retrospective study of 1 year’s experience including all patients who underwent dural plasty with a Neuro-Patch (n = 61) or pericranium graft (n = 63). The follow-up period was at least 12 months after surgery. Before wound infection rates in the two groups were compared, factors suspected of being risks for neurosurgical site infection were evaluated. RESULTS Patient characteristics (mean age, neurological diagnosis), surgical procedures, prophylactic antibiotics, and risk factors for surgical infections (including duration of surgery, emergency, contaminated operations, and external cerebrospinal fluid drainage) were similar in the Neuro-Patch and pericranium groups. Deep wound infection rates in the Neuro-Patch and pericranium groups were 15 and 5%, respectively (P = 0.06), and cerebrospinal fluid leaks were significantly more frequent in the Neuro-Patch group (13 versus 1.6%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The results of our investigations show that Neuro-Patch raised the risk of wound infection, as do foreign materials implanted in the body. Synthetic dural grafts should be reserved for when autologous grafts are not sufficient or possible. An extensive prospective multicenter randomized trial is needed to confirm our results.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1227/01.neu.0000108640.45371.1a", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2084718677", "source": "openalex"}

More recently, a line of research has been developed that aims at using musical training and practice as alternative tools for boosting specific perceptual, motor, cognitive and emotional skills both in healthy population and in neurologic patients. These findings are of great hope for a better treatment of language-based learning disorders or motor impairment in chronic non-communicative diseases. In the first part of this review, we highlight several studies showing that learning to play a musical instrument can induce substantial neuroplastic changes in cortical and subcortical regions of motor, auditory and speech processing networks in healthy population. In a second part, we provide an overview of the evidence showing that musical training can be an alternative, low-cost and effective method for the treatment of language-based learning impaired populations. We then report results of the few studies showing that training with musical instruments can have positive effects on motor, emotional and cognitive deficits observed in patients with noncommunicable diseases such as stroke or Parkinson Disease. Despite inherent differences between musical training in educational and rehabilitation contexts, these results favour the idea that the structural, multimodal and emotional properties of musical training can play an important role in developing new, creative and cost-effective intervention programs for education and rehabilitation in the next future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00475", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1964863625", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, an adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach is used to construct a time‐series forecasting system. In particular, the applicability of an ANFIS to the forecasting of the time‐series is investigated. To illustrate the applicability and capability of an ANFIS, the River Great Menderes, located in western Turkey, is chosen as a case study area. The advantage of this method is that it uses the input–output data sets. A total of 5844 daily data sets collected from 1985 to 2000 are used for the time‐series forecasting. Models having various input structures were constructed and the best structure was investigated. In addition, four various training/testing data sets were built by cross‐validation methods and the best data set was obtained. The performance of the ANFIS models in training and testing sets was compared with observations and also evaluated. In order to get an accurate and reliable comparison, the best‐fit model structure was also trained and tested by artificial neural networks and traditional time‐series analysis techniques and the results compared. The results indicate that the ANFIS can be applied successfully and provide high accuracy and reliability for time‐series modelling.

BMP8b is secreted by brown/beige adipocytes and enhances energy dissipation. Here we show that adipocyte-secreted BMP8b contributes to adrenergic-induced remodeling of the neuro-vascular network in adipose tissue (AT). Overexpression of bmp8b in AT enhances browning of the subcutaneous depot and maximal thermogenic capacity. Moreover, BMP8b-induced browning, increased sympathetic innervation and vascularization of AT were maintained at 28 °C, a condition of low adrenergic output. This reinforces the local trophic effect of BMP8b. Innervation and vascular remodeling effects required BMP8b signaling through the adipocytes to 1) secrete neuregulin-4 (NRG4), which promotes sympathetic axon growth and branching in vitro, and 2) induce a pro-angiogenic transcriptional and secretory profile that promotes vascular sprouting. Thus, BMP8b and NRG4 can be considered as interconnected regulators of neuro-vascular remodeling in AT and are potential therapeutic targets in obesity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07453-x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2900761438", "source": "openalex"}

Their growth proceeds inexorably, in part because their cellular constituents have an altered genetic code that enables them to evade the checks and balances of the normal cell cycle. Recently, a number of major advances in molecular biology have led to the identification of several critical genetic and enzymatic pathways that are disturbed in cancer cells resulting in uncontrolled cell cycling. We now know that the progression of a cell through the cell cycle is controlled in part by a series of protein kinases, the activity of which is regulated by a group of proteins called cyclins. Cyclins act in concert with the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to phosphorylate key substrates that facilitate the passage of the cell through each phase of the cell cycle. A critical target of cyclin-CDK enzymes is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, and phosphorylation of this protein inhibits its ability to restrain activity of a family of transcription factors (E2F family), which induce expression of genes important for cell proliferation. In addition to the cyclins and CDKs, there is an emerging family of CDK inhibitors, which modulate the activity of cyclins and CDKs. CDK inhibitors inhibit cyclin˙CDK complexes and transduce internal or external growth-suppressive signals, which act on the cell cycle machinery. Accordingly, all CDK inhibitors are candidate tumor suppressor genes. It is becoming clear that a common feature of cancer cells is the abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints, either by aberrant expression of positive regulators(for example, cyclins and CDKs) or the loss of negative regulators, including p21Cip1 through loss of function of its transcriptional activator p53, or deletion or mutation of p16INK4A (multiple tumor suppressor 1/CDKN2) and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. In this review, we describe in detail our current knowledge of the normal cell cycle and how it is disturbed in cancer cells. Because there have now been a number of recent studies showing alterations in cell cycle gene expression in human brain tumors, we will review the derangements in both the positive and negative cell cycle regulators that have been reported for these neoplasms. A thorough understanding of the molecular events of the cell cycle may lead to new opportunities by which astrocytoma cell proliferation can be controlled either pharmacologically or by gene transfer techniques.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00006123-199705000-00025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007948591", "source": "openalex"}

Using a simple controlled block design and an alternating block design, I first show why 'baseline' should not be modelled (model over-parameterization), and how this affects effect sizes.

Next, using a simple periodic vs. random event related design, I show how the haemodynamic model (haemodynamic function only or using derivatives) can affects parameter estimates, as well as detail the role of orthogonalization.

The hypothesis was initially based on the behavioral observation that children with ADHD behave like younger children who are naturally more active, more impulsive, and have a shorter attention span than older children. This is well expressed in the definition of the disorder in the DSM-IV, where ADHD is characterized by an age-inappropriate display of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. The behavioral observation is further supported by the cognitive profile of ADHD children: They show deficits in late developing higher cognitive functions of inhibitory self-control, attention, and temporal foresight (2, 3). The fact that ADHD symptoms tend to improve with age and up to 80% of children (depending on the follow-up length and definition of persistence) grow out of ADHD in adulthood (4) further supports the theory of a maturational lag that eventually normalizes in a considerable proportion of children. Indirect neurobiological support comes from cross-sectional structural imaging studies finding reduced size in cortico-striatal brain regions that are known to develop late in adolescence (5) and functional imaging studies showing reduced brain activation in ADHD compared with their age-matched peers in precisely those brain areas whose functions develop progressively with age between childhood and adulthood (6–10). Cross-sectional studies, however, are confounded by cohort effects; direct testing of the maturational delay hypothesis requires longitudinal imaging studies that map the developmental trajectories of brain maturation in healthy and ADHD children. In a recent issue of PNAS, Shaw et al. (11) study largely longitudinal data to provide direct neurobiological evidence for the maturational delay hypothesis of ADHD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0710329105", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2032063173", "source": "openalex"}

Design is performed by applying an NN to minimize the cost function that is selected to depend on the distance from the sliding-mode manifold, thus providing that the NN controller enforces sliding-mode motion in a closed-loop system. It has been proven that the selected cost function has no local minima in controller parameter space, so under certain conditions, selection of the NN weights guarantees that the global minimum is reached, and then the sliding-mode conditions are satisfied; thus, closed-loop motion is robust against parameter changes and disturbances. For controller design, the system states and the nominal value of the control input matrix are used. The design for both multiple-input-multiple-output and single-input-single-output systems is discussed. Due to the structure of the (M)ADALINE network used in control calculation, the proposed algorithm can also be interpreted as a sliding-mode-based control parameter adaptation scheme.

This study aimed to examine general intelligence ( IQ ) and executive functioning ( EF ) of adults born VP / VLBW in comparison to term controls. Additionally, the effects of smallness for gestational age ( SGA ) and family socioeconomic status ( SES ) at birth were investigated. Methods The Bavarian Longitudinal Study is a geographically defined prospective cohort study of neonatal at‐risk children born in 1985/86 in Southern Germany. A total of 217 VP / VLBW and 197 controls completed the battery of IQ and EF tests at 26 years of age. Results VP / VLBW adults scored significantly lower than controls in IQ and EF . There was a 1.16 standard deviation ( SD ) unit difference between the VP / VLBW and controls in Full‐Scale IQ . VP / VLBW adults were found to have general and multiple cognitive problems rather than specific deficits in EF . SGA was not a significant predictor of cognitive impairment.

Clinically, these disorders prominently affect the central nervous system at various stages of development, leading to brain malformations, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorders, and neurodegeneration, among others. Frequent early and severe involvement of the central nervous system puts the paediatric neurologist, neurogeneticist, and neurometabolic specialist at the forefront of recognizing and treating these rare conditions. On a molecular level, mutations in key autophagy genes map to different stages of this highly conserved pathway and thus lead to impairment in isolation membrane (or phagophore) and autophagosome formation, maturation, or autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Here we discuss 'congenital disorders of autophagy' as an emerging subclass of inborn errors of metabolism by using the examples of six recently identified monogenic diseases: EPG5-related Vici syndrome, beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration due to mutations in WDR45, SNX14-associated autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability syndrome, and three forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia, SPG11, SPG15 and SPG49 caused by SPG11, ZFYVE26 and TECPR2 mutations, respectively. We also highlight associations between defective autophagy and other inborn errors of metabolism such as lysosomal storage diseases and neurodevelopmental diseases associated with the mTOR pathway, which may be included in the wider spectrum of autophagy-related diseases from a pathobiological point of view. By exploring these emerging themes in disease pathogenesis and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, we discuss how congenital disorders of autophagy inform our understanding of the importance of this fascinating cellular pathway for central nervous system biology and disease. Finally, we review the concept of modulating autophagy as a therapeutic target and argue that congenital disorders of autophagy provide a unique genetic perspective on the possibilities and challenges of pathway-specific drug development. Mutations in autophagy genes cause childhood-onset multisystem diseases with predominant nervous system involvement and provide a 'genetic window' into autophagy's role in neurobiology and disease.

Methods: In this study, we propose a modular processing flow that first extracts the two speech envelopes from the microphone recordings, then selects the attended speech envelope based on the EEG, and finally uses this envelope to inform a multichannel speech separation and denoising algorithm. Results: Strong suppression of interfering (unattended) speech and background noise is achieved, while the attended speech is preserved. Furthermore, EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) is shown to be robust to the use of noisy speech signals. Conclusions: Our results show that AAD-based speaker extraction from microphone array recordings is feasible and robust, even in noisy acoustic environments, and without access to the clean speech signals to perform EEG-based AAD.

We assayed the circulating levels of CNHs (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)), plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, thyroid hormones and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The concentrations of all CNHs and neuro-hormones were higher in patients with heart failure compared to normal subjects, except for free triiodothyronine (FT3), which was below normal values. ANP was positively related to NYHA class, IL-6, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, while negatively with ejection fraction and FT3. BNP was positively related to age, NYHA class, IL-6, TNF-α, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, while negatively with ejection fraction and FT3.

Technological advances, including phased-array transducers and real-time temperature monitoring with magnetic resonance thermometry, have created new opportunities for FUS research and clinical translation. Neuro-oncology, in particular, has become a major area of interest because FUS offers a multifaceted approach to the treatment of brain tumors. FUS has the potential to generate cytotoxicity within tumor tissue, both directly via thermal ablation and indirectly through radiosensitization and sonodynamic therapy; to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents to brain tumors by transiently opening the blood-brain barrier or improving distribution through the brain extracellular space; and to modulate the tumor microenvironment to generate an immune response. In this review, we describe each of these applications for FUS, the proposed mechanisms of action, and the preclinical and clinical studies that have set the foundation for using FUS in neuro-oncology.

Its causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an enveloped single stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus that enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor or several other receptors. While COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, other organs including the brain can be involved. In Western clinical studies, relatively mild neurological dysfunction such as anosmia and dysgeusia is frequent (~70-84%) while severe neurologic disorders such as stroke (~1-6%) and meningoencephalitis are less common. It is unclear how much SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to the incidence of stroke given co-morbidities in the affected patient population. Rarely, clinically-defined cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute necrotizing encephalopathy have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Common neuropathological findings in the 184 patients reviewed include microglial activation (42.9%) with microglial nodules in a subset (33.3%), lymphoid inflammation (37.5%), acute hypoxic-ischemic changes (29.9%), astrogliosis (27.7%), acute/subacute brain infarcts (21.2%), spontaneous hemorrhage (15.8%), and microthrombi (15.2%). In our institutional cases, we also note occasional anterior pituitary infarcts. COVID-19 coagulopathy, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress likely contribute to a number of these findings. When present, central nervous system lymphoid inflammation is often minimal to mild, is detected best by immunohistochemistry and, in one study, indistinguishable from control sepsis cases. Some cases evince microglial nodules or neuronophagy, strongly supporting viral meningoencephalitis, with a proclivity for involvement of the medulla oblongata. The virus is detectable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, or electron microscopy in human cerebrum, cerebellum, cranial nerves, olfactory bulb, as well as in the olfactory epithelium; neurons and endothelium can also be infected. Review of the extant cases has limitations including selection bias and limited clinical information in some cases.

Navigation systems incorporate the global positioning system (GPS) and the inertial navigation system (INS). While GPS provides position information when there is direct line of sight to four or more satellites, INS utilizes the local measurements of angular velocity and linear acceleration to determine both the vehicle's position and attitude. Both systems are integrated together to provide reliable navigation solutions by overcoming each of their respective shortcomings. The present integration schemes, which are predominantly based on Kalman filtering, have several inadequacies related to sensor error models, immunity to noise and observability. This paper aims at introducing a multi-sensor system integration approach for fusing data from an INS and GPS hardware utilizing wavelet multi-resolution analysis (WMRA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The WMRA is used to compare the INS and GPS position outputs at different resolution levels. The ANN module is then trained to predict the INS position errors in real time and provide accurate positioning of the moving vehicle. The field-test results have demonstrated that substantial improvements in INS/GPS positioning accuracy could be obtained by applying the proposed neuro-wavelet technique.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-0233/15/2/013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071361063", "source": "openalex"}

The use of gadolinium (Gd)‐based contrast is discussed in both T 1 ‐ and T ‐weighted sequences. Tradeoffs between speed and image quality are discussed, particularly in the context of long echo train sequences (FSE imaging and EPI).

A portion of patients still suffers from uremic encephalopathy or other signs of nervous system impairment. Several reports demonstrate increased incidence of cardiac infarction and cerebrovascular accidents in chronic renal failure patients, even in those otherwise adequately dialyzed. Epileptic and cognitive symptoms are among the most typical manifestations of uremic encephalopathy. Several guanidino compounds (GCs) may play an important role in the etiology of uremic encephalopathy. Four GCs appeared to be substantially increased as well in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain of uremic patients. These compounds, “uremic” GCs, are creatinine, guanidine (G), guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), and methylguanidine. All four compounds are experimental convulsants in concentrations similar to those found in uremic brain. We described a possible mechanism for the contribution of GCs to uremic hyperexcitability, referring to the in vitro effects of uremic GCs on inhibitory and excitatory amino acid receptors. It was demonstrated that the excitatory effects of uremic GCs on the central nervous system can be explained by the activation of N ‐methyl‐ d ‐aspartate receptors by GSA, concomitant inhibition of γ‐aminobutyric acid type A receptors by uremic GCs, and other depolarizing effects. These effects might also indicate the putative contribution of uremic GCs to the etiology of uremic encephalopathy. In this article, we review the uremic GCs with particular attention to their neurotoxicity. We elaborate in detail on the mechanisms of action of the neurotoxic uremic GCs and summarize the kinetics of these toxins.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-139x.2009.00577.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2120453226", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we propose a local neuro-fuzzy (LNF) approach based on the least-squares support vector machines (LSSVMs). The proposed LNF approach employs LSSVMs, which are powerful in modeling and predicting time series, as local models and uses hierarchical binary tree (HBT) learning algorithm for fast and efficient estimation of its parameters. The HBT algorithm heuristically partitions the input space into smaller subdomains by axis-orthogonal splits. In each partitioning, the validity functions automatically form a unity partition and therefore normalization side effects, e.g., reactivation, are prevented. Integration of LSSVMs into the LNF network as local models, along with the HBT learning algorithm, yield a high-performance approach for modeling and prediction of complex nonlinear time series. The proposed approach is applied to modeling and predictions of different nonlinear and chaotic real-world and hand-designed systems and time series. Analysis of the prediction results and comparisons with recent and old studies demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed LNF approach with the HBT learning algorithm for modeling and prediction of nonlinear and chaotic systems and time series.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2012.2227148", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019821804", "source": "openalex"}

The model predicts flow and occupancy values at a given freeway section based on contributions from their recent temporal profile (over a few minutes) as well the spatial profile (including inputs from neighboring upstream and downstream sections). An in-depth investigation of the variables pertinent to traffic flow prediction was conducted examining the extent of the \"look-back\" in time interval, the extent of prediction in the future, the extent of spatial contribution, the resolution of the input data, and their effects on prediction accuracy. The model's performance is validated using both simulated and real traffic flow data obtained from the ATMS Testbed in Orange County, California. Both temporal and spatial effects were found to be essential for proper prediction. Results obtained indicate that the prediction errors vary inversely with the extent of the spatial contribution, and that the inclusion of three loop stations in both directions of the subject station is sufficient for practical purposes. Also, the longer the extent of prediction, the more the predicted values tend toward the mean of the actual, for which case the optimal look-back interval also shortens. The results also indicate that the level of data aggregation/resolution should be comparable to the prediction horizon for best accuracy.

Such changes in afferent excitability and responses to mechanical stimuli are consistent with relief of discomfort and pain in IBS patients, including relief of referred abdominal hypersensitivity, upon intra-rectal instillation of local anesthetic.

The role of gut dys-biosis in ASD is intriguing and should be elucidated. We investigated the effect of Propionic acid (PPA), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and a product of dys-biotic ASD gut, on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) proliferation, differentiation and inflammation. hNSCs proliferated to 66 neuropsheres when exposed to PPA versus 45 in control. The neurosphere diameter also increased at day 10 post PPA treatment to (Mean: 193.47 um ± SEM: 6.673 um) versus (154.16 um ± 9.95 um) in control, p &lt; 0.001. Pre-treatment with β-HB, SCFA receptor inhibitor, hindered neurosphere expansion (p &lt; 0.001). While hNSCs spontaneously differentiated to (48.38% ± 6.08%) neurons (Tubulin-IIIβ positive) and (46.63% ± 2.5%) glia (GFAP positive), PPA treatment drastically shifted differentiation to 80% GFAP cells (p &lt; 0.05). Following 2 mM PPA exposure, TNF-α transcription increased 4.98 fold and the cytokine increased 3.29 fold compared to control (P &lt; 0.001). Likewise, GPR41 (PPA receptor) and pro-survival p-Akt protein were elevated (p &lt; 0.001).

PPA at 2 mM decreased neurite outgrowth to (80.70 um ± 5.5 um) compared to (194.93 um ± 19.7 um) in control.

Neurosurgical nurses need to be able to assess and support neuro-oncology patients with their spiritual needs from diagnosis and throughout their hospital stay.Data were collected through questionnaires using a Critical Incident Technique (CIT) from neurosurgical nurses, findings were analysed using thematic analysis.Nurses reported some awareness of their patients' spiritual needs during their stay on neurosurgical units although some used expressions approximating what could be described as spiritual needs. Patients' spiritual needs were identified as: need to talk about spiritual concerns, showing sensitivity to patients' emotions, responding to religious needs; and relatives' spiritual needs included: supporting them with end of life decisions, supporting them when feeling being lost and unbalanced, encouraging exploration of meaning of life, and providing space, time and privacy to talk. Participants appeared largely to be in tune with their patients' spiritual needs and reported that they recognised effective strategies to meet their patients' and relatives' spiritual needs.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2993290754", "title": "Neuro-protection and neuro-regeneration of the optic nerve: recent advances and future directions", "text": "Purpose of review Optic neuropathies refer to a collection of diseases in which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the specialized neuron of the retina whose axons make up the optic nerve, are selectively damaged. Blindness secondary to optic neuropathies is irreversible as RGCs do not have the capacity for self-renewal and have a limited capacity for self-repair. Numerous strategies are being developed to either prevent further RGC degeneration or replace the cells that have degenerated. In this review, we aim to discuss known limitations to regeneration in central nervous system (CNS), followed by a discussion of previous, current, and future strategies for optic nerve neuroprotection as well as approaches for neuro-regeneration, with an emphasis on developments in the past two years. Recent findings Neuro-regeneration in the CNS is limited by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Environmental barriers to axon regeneration can be divided into two major categories: failure to clear myelin and formation of glial scar. Although inflammatory scars block axon growth past the site of injury, inflammation also provides important signals that activate reparative and regenerative pathways in RGCs. Neuroprotection with neurotrophins as monotherapy is not effective at preventing RGC degeneration likely secondary to rapid clearance of growth factors. Novel approaches involve exploiting different technologies to provide sustained delivery of neurotrophins. Other approaches include application of anti-apoptosis molecules and anti-axon retraction molecules. Although stem cells are becoming a viable option for generating RGCs for cell-replacement-based strategies, there are still many critical barriers to overcome before they can be used in clinical practice. Adjuvant treatments, such as application of electrical fields, scaffolds, and magnetic field stimulation, may be useful in helping transplanted RGCs extend axons in the proper orientation and assist with new synapse formation. Summary Different optic neuropathies will benefit from neuro-protective versus neuro-regenerative approaches. Developing clinically effective treatments for optic nerve disease will require a collaborative approach that not only employs neurotrophic factors but also incorporates signals that promote axonogenesis, direct axon growth towards intended targets, and promote appropriate synaptogenesis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000777", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2993290754", "source": "openalex"}

This study comprehensively reviews and presents literature from the last five years, showing that acupuncture indeed exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects in multiple biological systems, namely, the immune, digestive, respiratory, nervous, locomotory, circulatory, endocrine, and genitourinary systems. It is well known that localized acupuncture-mediated anti-inflammatory effects involve the regulation of multiple populations and functions of immune cells, including macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells, and T cells. In acupuncture stimulation, macrophages transform from the M1 to the M2 phenotype and the negative TLR4 regulator PPARγ is activated to inhibit the intracellular TLR/MyD88 and NOD signaling pathways. The downstream IκBα/NF-κB and P38 MAPK pathways are subsequently inhibited by acupuncture, followed by suppressed production of inflammasome and proinflammatory mediators. Acupuncture also modulates the balance of helper T cell populations. Furthermore, it inhibits oxidative stress by enhancing SOD activity via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and eliminates the generation of oxygen free radicals, thereby preventing inflammatory cell infiltration. The anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture on different biological systems are also specific to individual organ microenvironments. As part of its anti-inflammatory action, acupuncture deforms connective tissue and upregulates the secretion of various molecules in acupoints, further activating the NF-κB, MAPK, and ERK pathways in mast cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and monocytes/macrophages. The somatic afferents present in acupuncture-activated acupoints also convey sensory signals to the spinal cord, brainstem, and hypothalamic neurons. Upon information integration in the brain, acupuncture further stimulates multiple neuro-immune pathways, including the cholinergic anti-inflammatory, vagus-adrenal medulla-dopamine, and sympathetic pathways, as well as the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, ultimately acting immune cells via the release of crucial neurotransmitters and hormones. This review provides a scientific and reliable basis and viewpoints for the clinical application of acupuncture in various inflammatory conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s341581", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200275282", "source": "openalex"}

Serum platinum was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated with the Scale for Chemotherapy-Induced Neurotoxicity (SCIN), regarding the extent of symptom bother as 0, \"not at all\"; 1, \"a little\"; 2, \"quite a bit\"; or 3, \"very much.\" Summing the six symptom scores yielded a total SCIN score of 0 to 18.

Due to the margins needed to ensure adequate target coverage, many breast cancer patients have been shown to develop late side effects such as pneumonitis and cardiac damage. Breathing-adapted radiation therapy offers the potential for precise radiation dose delivery to a moving target and thereby reduces the side effects substantially. However, the basic requirement for breathing-adapted radiation therapy is to track and predict the target as precisely as possible. Recent studies have addressed the problem of organ motion prediction by using different methods including artificial neural network and model based approaches. In this study, we propose to use a hybrid intelligent system called ANFIS (the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) for predicting respiratory motion in breast cancer patients. In ANFIS, we combine both the learning capabilities of a neural network and reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic in order to give enhanced prediction capabilities, as compared to using a single methodology alone. After training ANFIS and checking for prediction accuracy on 11 breast cancer patients, it was found that the RMSE (root-mean-square error) can be reduced to sub-millimetre accuracy over a period of 20 s provided the patient is assisted with coaching. The average RMSE for the un-coached patients was 35% of the respiratory amplitude and for the coached patients 6% of the respiratory amplitude.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/50/19/020", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976660465", "source": "openalex"}

We report that MT5-MMP is expressed by CGRP-containing peptidergic nociceptors in dorsal root ganglia and that Mmp24-deficient mice display enhanced sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli under basal conditions. Consistently, mutant peptidergic sensory neurons hyperinnervate the skin, a phenotype that correlates with changes in the regulated cleavage of the cell-cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin. In contrast to basal nociception, Mmp24(-/-) mice do not develop thermal hyperalgesia during inflammation, a phenotype that appears associated with alterations in N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions between mast cells and sensory fibers.

Group 2: (9 males and 6 Females) Patients who only received conventional antidepressant medication. Group 1 patients were administered Sahaj Yoga practice for 8 weeks. Neuro-cognitive test battery consisting of Letter cancellation test (LCT), Trail making test 'A' (TTA), Trail making test 'B' (TTB), Ruff figural fluency test (RFFT), Forward digit span (FDS) & Reverse digit span test (RDS) was used to assess following cognitive domains: Attention span, visuo-motor speed, short-term memory, working memory and executive functions. After 8 weeks, both Group 1 and Group 2 subjects showed significant improvement in LCT, TTA & TTB but improvement in LCT was more marked in Group 1 subjects. Also, there was significant improvement in RDS scores in only Group 1 subjects (P < 0.05). The results thereby, demonstrate that Sahaj Yoga practice in addition to the improvement in various other cognitive domains seen with conventional anti-depressants, can lead to additional improvement in executive functions like manipulation of information in the verbal working memory and added improvement in attention span and visuo-motor speed of the depressives.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2339410154", "source": "openalex"}

OCT-measured RNFL in nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies shows thinning, which may mimic those seen in glaucoma. This article aims to provide insight regarding the use of OCT in nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies and sheds light on common patterns of RNFL loss in different nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies.RNFL thinning is most likely to occur in the temporal peripapillary quadrant than in other quadrants in nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies. The pattern of RNFL thinning in ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve head drusen is more likely to mimic the pattern found in glaucoma due to the superior and inferior quadrant predilection. OCT-measured RNFL thickness in Alzheimer's disease reveals thinning superiorly and inferiorly, whereas superior and temporal thinning is seen in Parkinson's disease. The thinning observed in neurodegenerative diseases is believed to be multifactorial including causes such as axonal degeneration and retrograde degeneration. However, more studies are needed to further study these changes.OCT is a valuable tool in evaluating the peripapillary RNFL in both glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies. This technology may be used for both research and clinical purposes to assess disease progression in optic neuropathies and diseases that affect the central nervous system.

Noting previous work linking stress hormone responses with cardiac injury after SAH, we have studied responses in stress hormones, markers of cardiac injury and the temporal changes in ANP and BNP and related them to changes in sodium status post ictus and during recovery from acute SAH. design, patients, measurements Eighteen patients with verified SAH of variable severity were studied in a single unit for a 14‐day period post ictus under controlled conditions of sodium and fluid intake. All received a standardized protocol of daily dexamethasone and nimodipine throughout the study. Severity was graded using criteria of Hess and Hunt at admission. Stress hormones (AVP, catecholamines and admission plasma cortisol), markers of cardiac injury (ECG and daily plasma troponin T) and cardiac hormones (ANP and BNP) were measured daily and related to severity, plasma sodium and renin–aldosterone activity. Hormone levels (ANP, BNP and endothelin) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also measured in nine patients. results Intense neurohormonal activation (AVP, cortisol and catecholamines) at admission was associated with increased levels of both plasma ANP and BNP whereas levels in CSF were unaffected. In individual patients plasma levels of ANP and BNP were strongly correlated ( P &lt; 0·001). Cardiac events (abnormal ECG and/or elevated troponin) occurred in six of seven patients graded severe but neither stress hormones nor cardiac peptides differed significantly in patients with mild ( n = 11) vs. severe ( n = 7) SAH. During the course of a progressive fall in plasma sodium concentration ( P = 0·001), there was a delayed activation of renin–aldosterone which was inversely correlated with declining levels of plasma ANP/BNP ( P &lt; 0·002). conclusions Excessive secretion of both ANP and BNP occurs in all patients after acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and is unrelated to severity, stress hormone activation or markers of cardiac injury. Inhibition of renin–aldosterone by cardiac hormones may impair renal sodium conservation and contribute to developing hyponatraemia. In the absence of evidence for activation of natriuretic peptides within the brain, the prompt and consistent increase in both ANP and BNP strongly supports the view that the heart is the source of increased natriuretic peptide secretion after acute subarachnoid haemorrhage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01285.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2108224685", "source": "openalex"}

The lack of reliable disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures for use in clinical trials prompted the development of the Neurology Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL) instrument, which includes 13 scales that assess physical, emotional, cognitive, and social domains, for use in a variety of neurological illnesses. Objective: The objective of this research paper is to conduct an initial assessment of the reliability and validation of the Neuro-QOL short forms (SFs) in MS. Methods: We assessed reliability, concurrent validity, known groups validity, and responsiveness between cross-sectional and longitudinal data in 161 recruited MS patients. Results: Internal consistency was high for all measures (α = 0.81–0.95) and ICCs were within the acceptable range (0.76–0.91); concurrent and known groups validity were highest with the Global HRQL question.

Purpose: This review emphasizes the importance of neuro‐ophthalmological signs and symptoms in sarcoidosis. The presence of ophthalmological and neuro‐ophthalmological findings may lead to diagnosis of the disease and the initiation of adequate treatment. Material and Methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis during the period 1990 − 2001 were identified from the departmental diagnostic index. The history, clinical, laboratory and imaging data of patients were analysed. Results: Fifteen patients were identified, four men and 11 women, with a mean age of 44.1 years (range 26–65 years). In six of the 15 (40%), neurological deficits were the initial symptoms. Nine (60%) had known sarcoidosis at the time of presentation. Ten patients (66%) had ophthalmological/neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms and signs. Conclusion: Neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms may develop early in neurosarcoidosis. If neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms arise in patients with established biopsy‐proven sarcoidosis, the diagnosis is usually easy to make. However, a number of patients with neurosarcoidosis may present with neuro‐ophthalmic symptoms before systemic involvement becomes obvious. In this situation the diagnosis is challenging, and the major goal is to establish the presence of systemic sarcoidosis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2004.00348.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2047985935", "source": "openalex"}

Neurons have the ability to directly sense danger signals, adapt immune effector functions and integrate these signals to maintain tissue integrity and host defence strategies. The expression pattern of a large set of immune cells in the intestine charterized by receptors for neurotransmitters and neuropeptides suggest a tight neuronal hierarchical control of immune functions in order to systemically control immune reactions. Compelling evidence suggests that targeting neuronal-immune interactions is a promising strategy to dampen immune responses in autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases or rheumatoid arthritis. In fact, electric stimulation of vagal fibers has been shown to be an extremely effective treatment strategy against overwhelming immune reactions, even after exhausted conventional treatment strategies. Such findings argue that the nervous system is underestimated coordinator of immune reactions and underline the importance of neuro-immune crosstalk for body homeostasis.

With the advent of more effective anti-retroviral therapies, HIVE has shifted from a sub-acute to a chronic condition. The neurodegenerative process in patients with HIVE is characterized by synaptic and dendritic damage to pyramidal neurons, loss of calbindin-immunoreactive interneurons and myelin loss. The mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in HIVE might involve a variety of pathways, and several lines of investigation have found that interference with signaling factors mediating neuroprotection might play an important role. These signaling pathways include, among others, the GSK3b, CDK5, ERK, Pyk2, p38 and JNK cascades. Of these, GSK3b has been a primary focus of many previous studies showing that in infected patients, HIV proteins and neurotoxins secreted by immune-activated cells in the brain abnormally activate this pathway, which is otherwise regulated by growth factors such as FGF. Interestingly, modulation of the GSK3b signaling pathway by FGF1 or GSK3b inhibitors (lithium, valproic acid) is protective against HIV neurotoxicity, and several pilot clinical trials have demonstrated cognitive improvements in HIV patients treated with GSK3b inhibitors. In addition to the GSK3b pathway, the CDK5 pathway has recently been implicated as a mediator of neurotoxicity in HIV, and HIV proteins might activate this pathway and subsequently disrupt the diverse processes that CDK5 regulates, including synapse formation and plasticity and neurogenesis. Taken together, the GSK3b and CDK5 signaling pathways are important regulators of neurotoxicity in HIV, and modulation of these factors might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients suffering from HIVE. In this context, the subsequent sections will focus on reviewing the involvement of the GSK3b and CDK5 pathways in neurodegeneration in HIV.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms10031045", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980587324", "source": "openalex"}

Yehuda et al. proposed a hypothesis that, in humans, the hypersensitive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is responsible for the occurrence of differing levels of cortisol in anxiety disorders. Specifically, PTSD subjects have lower cortisol levels during the late subjective night in comparison to normal subjects, and this was assumed to occur due to strong negative feedback loops in the HPA axis. In the present work, to address this hypothesis, we modeled the cortisol dynamics using nonlinear ordinary differential equations and estimated the kinetic parameters of the model to fit the experimental data of three categories, namely, normal, depressed, and PTSD human subjects. We concatenated the subjects (n = 3) in each category and created a model subject (n = 1) without considering the patient-to-patient variability in each case. The parameters of the model for the three categories were simultaneously obtained through global optimization. Bifurcation analysis carried out with the optimized parameters exhibited two supercritical Hopf points and, for the choice of parameters, the oscillations were found to be circadian in nature. The fitted kinetic parameters indicate that PTSD subjects have a strong negative feedback loop and, as a result, the predicted oscillating cortisol levels are extremely low at the nadir in contrast to normal subjects, albeit within the endocrinologic range. We also simulated the phenotypes for each of the categories and, as observed in the clinical data of PTSD patients, the simulated cortisol levels are consistently low at the nadir, and correspondingly the negative feedback was found to be extremely strong. These results from the model support the hypothesis that high stress intensity and strong negative feedback loop may cause hypersensitive neuro-endocrine axis that results in hypocortisolemia in PTSD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002379", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068945449", "source": "openalex"}

Despite the efforts, little is known on how we encode, maintain and retrieve information. One of the hypothesis assumes that transient states are generated in our intricate network of neurons when the brain is stimulated by a sensory input. Based on this idea, powerful computational schemes have been developed. These schemes, known as machine-learning techniques, include artificial neural networks, support vector machine and reservoir computing, among others. In this paper, we concentrate on the reservoir computing (RC) technique using delay-coupled systems. Unlike traditional RC, where the information is processed in large recurrent networks of interconnected artificial neurons, we choose a minimal design, implemented via a simple nonlinear dynamical system subject to a self-feedback loop with delay. This design is not intended to represent an actual brain circuit, but aims at finding the minimum ingredients that allow developing an efficient information processor. This simple scheme not only allows us to address fundamental questions but also permits simple hardware implementations. By reducing the neuro-inspired reservoir computing approach to its bare essentials, we find that nonlinear transient responses of the simple dynamical system enable the processing of information with excellent performance and at unprecedented speed. We specifically explore different hardware implementations and, by that, we learn about the role of nonlinearity, noise, system responses, connectivity structure, and the quality of projection onto the required high-dimensional state space. Besides the relevance for the understanding of basic mechanisms, this scheme opens direct technological opportunities that could not be addressed with previous approaches.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2015.00068", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1582123648", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings A small but growing literature documents cases of new onset neuro-ophthalmic disease, in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 have experienced acute onset vision loss, optic neuritis, cranial neuropathies, and Miller Fisher syndrome. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk of cerebrovascular diseases that can impact the visual system. Summary The literature on COVID-19 continues to evolve. Although COVID-19 primarily impacts the respiratory system, there are several reports of new onset neuro-ophthalmic conditions in COVID-infected patients. When patients present with new onset neuro-ophthalmic issues, COVID-19 should be kept on the differential. Testing for COVID-19 should be considered, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are also present. When screening general patients for COVID-19-associated symptoms, frontline physicians can consider including questions about diplopia, eye pain, pain with extraocular movements, decreased vision, gait issues, and other neurologic symptoms. The presence of these symptoms may increase the overall probability of viral infection, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are present. More research is needed to establish a causal relationship between COVID-19 and neuro-ophthalmic disease, and better understand pathogenesis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000707", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3089270435", "source": "openalex"}

However, the brain can also modulate inflammatory conditions locally induced in the skin. It has been experimentally demonstrated that intracerebral administration of the tridecapeptide alpha-MSH or even its COOH-terminal tripeptide can in fact inhibit cutaneous inflammation induced by the application of topical irritants and intradermal injection of cytokines. The skin can therefore alter the pharmacology of the CNS by releasing large amounts of NPs which obviously do work locally in the skin and beyond the skin. Alpha-MSH may represent a key molecule for understanding this aspect of cutaneous-immune-neuro-endocrine-mental biological communication, being it is also generated in the skin.

For these applications, detecting the intention of the person to perform an activity relieves them from the burden of conscious effort in operating the system. Electromyography (EMG) has been used extensively for intention detection and can be considered a bandlimited stochastic process with Gaussian distribution and zero mean, which has varying spectral characteristics in time. Various EMG features have been used for intention detection including the number of zero crossings, the EMG frequency characteristics, and the mean absolute values. There are a number of drawbacks that have been associated with these methods such as the high electrode sensitivity to electrode displacement, low recognition rate, and a perceivable delay in control. In this article we discuss a technique for EMG applications that decreases global delay time and improves time spectral analysis. The technique is aimed at improving the Gabor matching pursuit (GMP) algorithm through the use of genetic algorithms. The key stage of this design feeds EMG features to a neuro-fuzzy classifier that can be designed to detect the intention of the patient.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/memb.2002.1175148", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2020316512", "source": "openalex"}

Suppose that existing device models (namely, coarse models) cannot match the behavior of a new device (referred to as the fine model). By neural network mapping of the voltage and current signals from the coarse to the fine models, Neuro-SM can modify the behavior of the coarse model to match that of the fine model. However, the efficiency of mapping depends on both the mapping structure and the coarse model. In this paper, a structural optimization technique is presented to achieve optimal combinations of mapping structure and coarse model. An aggressive optimization formulation exploring detailed structural variations in both the mapping and the coarse model is proposed, where the internal branches of coarse models and separate mappings for the voltage and current at gate and drain are used as basic topology variables. The formulation of such a structural optimization by an evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed. Numerical examples of metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor and high electron-mobility transistor modeling demonstrate that, by using the proposed algorithm, optimal combinations of space mapping and coarse model structures can be achieved leading to the best modeling accuracy with the simplest mapping function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tmtt.2010.2090169", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2114929484", "source": "openalex"}

It predicts that early social interactions with significant others shape the emergence of distinct self- and other-representations, the latter affecting how we initiate and maintain social relationships across the lifespan. A person's attachment history will therefore associate with inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive mechanisms sustaining representations, modeling, and understanding of others on the biological and brain level. This review aims at summarizing the currently available social neuroscience data in healthy participants on how inter-individual differences in attachment associate with brain anatomy and activity across the lifespan, and to integrate these data into an extended and refined functional neuro-anatomical model of human attachment (NAMA). We first propose a new prototypical initial attachment pathway and its derivatives as a function of attachment security, avoidance, and anxiety. Based on these pathways, we suggest a neural attachment system composed of two emotional mentalization modules (aversion and approach) and two cognitive mentalization modules (emotion regulation and mental state representation) and provide evidence on their functionality depending on inter-individual differences in attachment. We subsequently expand this first-person social neuroscience account by also considering a second-person social neuroscience perspective comprising the concepts of bio-behavioral synchrony and particularly inter-brain coherence. We hope that such extended and refined NAMA can inform attachment theory and ultimately help devising new prevention and intervention strategies for individuals and families at risk for attachment-related psychopathology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.01.010", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3003785262", "source": "openalex"}

The neuro-developmental processes that underpin the performance of neuro-psychomotor functions have not been widely explored,nor is it clear whether there areneuro-psychomotor functions specifically affected in ASD. Our objective was to focus on the semiology of motor disorders among children with ASD using a neuro-developmental assessment tool. Method: Thirty-four children with ASD, with or without intellectual deficit (ID) were recruited in a child psychiatry department and Autism Resource Centers. Initial standard evaluations for diagnosis (psychiatric; psychological; psychomotor) were supplemented by a standardized assessment battery for neuro-developmental psychomotor functions (NP-MOT). Results: The results of some NP-MOT tests differed between children with ASD with intellectual deficit (ID) and those without. However, on the NP-MOT battery, neither of the two groups did well in the bi-manual and finger praxia tests (36% and 52% respectively failed). Manual and digital gnosopraxia showed some deficit (63% and 62% respectively failed). Postural deficits were found in tests for both static equilibrium (64%) and dynamic (52%). There were also difficulties in coordination between the upper and lower limbs in 58% of children. We found 75% failure in motor skills on the M-ABC test. Concerning muscular tone, significant laxity was observed in distal parts of the body (feet and hands), but hypertonia was observed in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs (reduced heel-ear angle). Discussion: The results of manual and digital gnosopraxia tests point to a planning deficit in children with autism. A gesture programming deficit is also highlighted by the poor results in manual praxis, and by failures in the M-ABC tests despite prior training of the child. However, concerning global motor function, a significant difference was observed between children with and without ID. Our findings suggest a semiology of tone deregulation between proximal versus distal muscles, indeterminate tonic laterality,postural control deficit (proprioceptive), impairment of inter-hemispheric coordination (corpus callosum), and neurological soft signs such asdysdiadochokinesia, which leads us to hypothesize a general impairment of motor functions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01292", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2517843132", "source": "openalex"}

Dietary phytochemicals include a large group of non-nutrients compounds from a wide range of plant-derived foods and chemical classes. Over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made to realize that oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) and chronic, low-grade inflammation are major risk factors underlying brain aging. Accumulated data strongly suggest that phytochemicals from fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices may exert relevant negative immunoregulatory, and/or anti-O&NS activities in the context of brain aging. Despite the translational gap between basic and clinical research, the current understanding of the molecular interactions between phytochemicals and immune-inflammatory and O&NS (IO&NS) pathways could help in designing effective nutritional strategies to delay brain aging and improve cognitive function. This review attempts to summarise recent evidence indicating that specific phytochemicals may act as positive modulators of IO&NS pathways by attenuating pro-inflammatory pathways associated with the age-related redox imbalance that occurs in brain aging. We will also discuss the need to initiate long-term nutrition intervention studies in healthy subjects. Hence, we will highlight crucial aspects that require further study to determine effective physiological concentrations and explore the real impact of dietary phytochemicals in preserving brain health before the onset of symptoms leading to cognitive decline and inflammatory neurodegeneration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-016-0070-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2338675929", "source": "openalex"}

While most evidence indicates that a genetic component plays an important role in the aetiology of both autism and ID, a number of studies suggest that immunological dysfunctions may participate in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Brain-specific autoantibodies have been detected in the sera of many autistic children and autoimmune disorders are increased in families of children with autism. Furthermore, cytokine imbalance has been reported in children with autism. These results may reflect an inappropriate immune response to environmental factors, such as infectious or toxic exposure. The role of microglia as sensors of pre- and post-natal environmental stimuli and its involvement in the regulation of synaptic connectivity, maturation of brain circuitry and neurogenesis has recently emerged. An abnormal immune response during critical windows of development and consequent abnormal production of neuro-inflammatory mediators may have an impact on the function and structure of brain and can play a role in the pathogenesis of non syndromic autism. Recent evidence suggests an involvement of neuro-inflammation also in syndromic forms of autism and ID. Immune dysregulation has been found in children with Fragile X syndrome and an intrinsic microglia dysfunction has been recently reported in Rett syndrome.

Experiments were carried out in opened segments of guinea‐pig ileum in an organ bath that was partitioned so that three regions could be independently exposed to drugs. Ascending excitatory reflexes evoked by either distension from the serosal side or compression of the mucosa were depressed by 55% and 85%, respectively, in the presence of hexamethonium (200 μ m ) and by 30% and 45%, respectively, by a desensitizing concentration of the selective NK 3 receptor agonist, senktide (1 μ m ), in the chamber in which reflexes were initiated. Together, hexamethonium and senktide abolished reponses to compression. A residual response to distension persisted. This was abolished by hyoscine (1 μ m ). Hexamethonium (200 μ m ) abolished ascending reflexes when applied to the region between the stimulus and the recording sites, or to the recording chamber. Descending reflex responses were reduced by 35% by synaptic blockade in the stimulus chamber with physiological saline containing 0.1 mM Ca 2+ plus 10 mM Mg 2+ . Senktide (1 μ m ) in the stimulus chamber reduced distension reflexes to the same extent as synaptic blockade, whereas hexamethonium (200 μ m ) and hyoscine (1 μ m ) depressed responses by less than 20%. Responses to compression were reduced by 40% by senktide alone, while senktide and hexamethonium together reduced responses by 60%, an effect similar to synaptic blockade. Under these conditions, hyoscine in the stimulus chamber restored reflexes evoked by distension, but did not alter those evoked by mucosal compression. Total synaptic blockade in the intermediate chamber, between stimulus and recording sites, reduced descending reflex responses by more than 90%. In contrast, hexamethonium (200 μ m ) had no effect and hyoscine (1 μ m ) reduced only the responses to distension (by 30%). Senktide (1 μ m ) depressed responses to both stimuli by approximately 80%. Application of hexamethonium (200 μ m ) to the recording chamber depressed descending reflex responses to distension applied in the near stimulation chamber by 15%, but had no effect on responses to compression in the near chamber or to either stimulus applied in the far chamber. Descending reflexes evoked by near chamber stimuli were unaffected by hyoscine (1 μ m ) or senktide (1 μ m ) applied to the recording chamber; hyoscine enhanced reflexes evoked by compression in the far chamber by 50%. For the ascending excitatory reflex pathway, it is concluded that transmission from sensory neurones is mediated by ACh acting via both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and by tachykinins acting at NK 3 receptors. Transmission from ascending interneurones appears to be predominantly via nicotinic receptors. The descending inhibitory pathways are more complex, and while transmission from sensory neurones involves nicotinic, muscarinic and NK 3 receptor‐dependent components, transmission from descending interneurones to inhibitory motor neurones is neither cholinergic nor due to tachykinins acting via NK 3 receptors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1996.tb15495.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064982621", "source": "openalex"}

Quantitatively, the efferent nerve terminals with many synaptic vesicles are distributed mainly beside arterial smooth muscle cells (Type I: 58.8%) or between the layers of PAA cells (Type III: 33.2%), and rarely in hematopoietic parenchyma (Type II: 5.3%) or on sinus walls (Type IV: 2.7%). In the case of Type II-IV nerve terminals, efferent (autonomic) nerves and bone marrow stromal cells which are connected by gap junctions (sinus adventitial reticular cells, intersinusoidal reticular cells, and PAA cells) appear to constitute a potential functional unit for signal conduction. We would like to propose a new term for this anatomical unit in marrow, the \"neuro-reticular complex.\"", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1001870306", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088668587", "source": "openalex"}

SOCS proteins as inhibitors of the JAK-STAT cascadeThe JAK-STAT cascade is an intracellular signaling pathway shared by a variety of cytokines, including gp130 cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor), as well as leptin, GH, and prolactin.Ligand binding to cytokine receptors, which themselves lack intrinsic kinase activity, activates receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK's) by autophosphorylation and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain and of associated proteins termed STATs for signal transducers and activators of transcription.Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs enables homo-or heterodimerization of various STAT proteins.The dimerized STAT complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they transactivate their target genes by binding to specific promoter elements (1, 2).A family of proteins able to inhibit the JAK-STAT signaling cascade has synonymously been described as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein (3), JAK-binding protein (4), and STAT-induced STAT inhibitor.The SOCS protein family (5) encompasses SOCS-1 (3, 4, 6), SOCS-2 (3), SOCS-3 (3), CIS (7), and SOCS-4 to SOCS-7 (5).While the role of the former four proteins is increasingly well understood, the roles of SOCS-4 to SOCS-7 remain poorly characterized.In vitro overexpression studies demonstrate that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 exert similar effects and represent the most potent and broadly acting suppressors of cytokine signaling.These factors potently inhibit JAK-STAT signaling of several gp130 cytokines (see Arzt, this Perspective series, ref. 8; and refs.3,4,[9][10][11][12], GH (13-15), and prolactin (16).The common protein structure of SOCS proteins is a variable N-terminal region, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal domain, termed SOCS-box motif (5).The central SH2 domain alone is not sufficient for inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling (4), as part of the N-terminal region, termed pre-SH2 domain/kinase inhibitory region, is also required (10,17,18).The C-terminal SOCS-box interacts with elongin BC complex (19), although the physiological significance of this interaction is still unclear.Some observations suggest that this interaction protects SOCS proteins from degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, whereas others suggest that it actually directs these proteins to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and sets the stage for their degradation (19,20).Conversely, the significance of the proteasome in the turnover of these molecules is not in doubt.The halflives of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in COS-7 cells have been calculated to be as short as 1.5 hours ( 21), but incubation with proteasome inhibitors stabilizes them significantly (18,19).Therefore, the C-terminal SOCS-box also appears not to be essential for direct inhibitory interaction with JAK (10, 17) but might be required to control SOCS protein degradation and thus might modulate the intracellular level of the SOCS protein (18).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci200114662", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4254648623", "source": "openalex"}

Atrophy of hippocampus and other basal brain regions is one of the most predominant structural imaging findings related to AD. Most studies have evaluated the pre-clinical and initial stages of AD through clinical trials using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Structural biomarkers for advanced AD stages have not been evaluated yet, being considered only hypothetically. To evaluate the brain morphometry of AD patients at all disease stages, identifying the structural neuro-degeneration profile associated with AD severity. AD patients aged 60 years or over at different AD stages were recruited and grouped into three groups following the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score: CDR1 (n = 16), CDR2 (n = 15), CDR3 (n = 13). Age paired healthy volunteers (n = 16) were also recruited (control group). Brain images were acquired on a 3T magnetic resonance scanner using a conventional Gradient eco 3D T1-w sequence without contrast injection. Volumetric quantitative data and cortical thickness were obtained by automatic segmentation using the Freesurfer software. Volume of each brain region was normalized by the whole brain volume in order to minimize age and body size effects. Volume and cortical thickness variations among groups were compared. Atrophy was observed in the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal region, temporal pole and temporal lobe of patients suffering from AD at any stage. Cortical thickness was reduced only in the parahippocampal gyrus at all disease stages. Volume and cortical thickness were correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in all studied regions, as well as with CDR and disease duration. As previously reported, brain regions affected by AD during its initial stages, such as hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal region, were found to be altered even in individuals with severe AD. In addition, individuals, specifically, with CDR 3, have multiple regions with lower volumes than individuals with a CDR 2. These results indicate that rates of atrophy have not plateaued out at CDR 2–3, and in severe patients there are yet neuronal loss and gliosis. These findings can add important information to the more accepted model in the literature that focuses mainly on early stages. Our findings allow a better understanding on the AD pathophysiologic process and follow-up process of drug treatment even at advanced disease stages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2017.04.001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2605234249", "source": "openalex"}

NBD is quite common in adult patients and occurs rarely during childhood and adolescence. Young patients may share symptoms and signs of NBD with other neuro-ophthalmological disorders (e.g. idiopathic intracranial hypertension); thus, making the differential diagnosis difficult. Neuroimaging is mandatory and necessary for a correct NBD diagnosis but in children radiological examinations are often difficult to perform without sedation. From 1971 to 2011, 130 patients aged ≤16 years have been reported with NBD, according to retrospective surveys, case series, and case reports. The origin of the reported cases met the well-known geographical distribution of Behçet’s disease (BD); the mean age at presentation of neurological findings was 11.8 years, with male gender prevalence (ratio, 2.9:1). We considered in detail the neuro-ophthalmological features of the 53 cases whose neuroimaging alterations were described with an assigned radiological pattern of the disease (parenchymal: 14 cases, non-parechymal: 35 cases, and mixed: 4 cases). In 19/53 patients (36%), neuro-ophthalmological symptoms anticipated any pathognomonic sign for a BD diagnosis, or only occasional aphtae were recalled by the patients. Family history was positive in 17% of subjects. Headache was reported in 75% of the patients; in those presenting with cerebral vascular involvement, headache was combined to other symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Papilledema was the most frequently reported ophthalmological finding, followed by posterior uveitis. Treatment consisted of systemic steroids in 93% of patients, often combined with other immunosuppressive drugs (especially colchicine and azathioprine). Clinical recovery or improvement was documented in the large majority of patients. Nine subjects had definitive alterations, and one died.

Based on research with patients with specific lesions and disease, animal models, and neuroimaging studies, the neural substrate that supports declarative memory in adults has been relatively well articulated. By contrast, studies of the neural bases of memory in development is in its infancy. Yet joint consideration of the processes involved in building a memory trace, and of the time course of development of the neural structures involved, has contributed to the generation of specific predictions regarding the sources of age‐related change. Specifically, there are suggestions that in infancy and very early childhood, encoding and consolidation processes account for substantial age‐related variance in long‐term declarative memory. With development, the locus of age‐related variability in the vulnerability of memory traces shifts to the later‐stage processes of memory storage and retrieval.

The author is a well recognized authority in the field of radiology, who has made many contributions to our knowledge of neuroradiology and radiologic diseases of the head and neck. In this volume he has collected material which usually extends outside the classic boundaries of neuroradiology. The textbook has been needed and will remain unchallenged for some time. It is up to date in references and also includes the pertinent references of the past. Each of the ten chapters listed in the Table of Contents is furnished with an adequate number of excellent quality x-ray reproductions accompanied by clear legends. The radiologist who is responsible for the radiographic evaluation of the head and neck should be well acquainted with the neuro-ophthalmologic problems; pneumoencephalography and angiography must be supplemented by tomography, orbitography, and venography. The book may be divided into three parts—problems of the optic orbit and of the parasellar and paranasal regions. These problems, of course, are common to the ophthalmologist, the neurosurgeon, and the otorhinologist. A complete radiologic approach is needed in these select areas where too often mistakes have occurred when too great a reliance was placed upon clinical acumen and judgment.

In accordance with such view, the self-representing attitude of the human mind has been usually related to individual development and to neuro-plastic acquisitions of the cortico-limbic network. On the other hand, Carl Gustav Jung considered the Self as the inborn dynamic core of our personality, in its conscious and unconscious aspects as well as in its actual and potential forms. According to Jung, the Self integrates those essential bio-psychological drives leading to instinctual behavioral actions and archetypal psychological experiences and influencing all forms of learning and memory. Interestingly, recent neuroethological studies indicate that our subjective identity rests on ancient neuro-psychic processes that humans share with other animals as part of their inborn constitutional repertoire. Indeed, the brain activity within subcortical midline structures (SCMS) is intrinsically related to the emergence of prototypical affective states, that influence our behavior in a flexible way and alter our conscious field, giving rise to specific feelings or moods, which constitute the first form of self-orientation in the world. Moreover, such affective dynamics play a central role in the organization of individual personality, informing about the meaning of our personal experience and harmonizing our instinctual vestiges within the experience-dependent learning functions of the \"mind-brain\". Therefore, on the base of the convergence between contemporary cutting-edge scientific research and some psychological intuition of Jung, we intend here to explore the first neuro-evolutional layer of human mind, that we call the affective core of the Self.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01424", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2752218122", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine characteristics of Sjögren's syndrome as a cause for severe neuropathy with limb weakness. Methods: One hundred and eighty four patients with polyneuropathy associated with limb weakness underwent routine diagnostics including investigations for Sjögren's syndrome. Forty-four patients with Sjögren's syndrome (ACR-EULAR classification criteria) and severe neuropathy were identified. Results: Sjögren's syndrome was found at a median age of 63 years and the gender distribution showed a balanced female-male ratio of 1:1. Anti-SSA(Ro) antibodies were detected in 48% while seronegative patients were diagnosed with Sjögren's syndrome based on sialadenitis on minor salivary gland biopsy with a focus score ≥1. The majority of patients (93%) were diagnosed with Sjögren's syndrome after neurological symptoms appeared. Limbs were symmetrically involved in 84% of patients (57% tetraparesis, 27% paraparesis). Sensory function was not affected in 11% of patients indicating that Sjögren's syndrome associated neuropathy can present as a pure motor syndrome. Electrophysiological measurements did not reveal pathognomonic findings (23% demyelinating pattern, 36% axonal pattern, 41% both demyelinating and axonal damage signs). More than half of our patients fulfilled the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) diagnostic criteria for CIDP indicating that distinction between Neuro-Sjögren and other causes of neuropathy such as CIDP is challenging.

The inverted fetus perspective of the somatotopic arrangement of auricular acupuncture points was first described in the 1950's by Dr. Paul Nogier of France, and has received scientific support from double blind studies examining auricular diagnosis of musculoskeletal and of coronary disorders. Acupuncture points on the ear and on the body have lower levels of electrical skin resistance than surrounding tissue. These electrodermal differences are apparently related to autonomic control of blood vessels rather than increased sweat gland activity. The heightened tenderness of reactive acupuncture points may be explained by the accumulation of noxious, subdermal substances.

However, it is extremely difficult for researchers to inadequately extract knowledge and insights from multiple overlapping and interdependent fuzzy datasets from the current changing and interconnected big data sources. This paper proposes a deep neuro-cognitive co-evolution for fuzzy attribute reduction (DNCFAR) that contains a combination of quantum leaping particle swarm optimization with nearest-neighbor memeplexes. A key element of DNCFAR resides in its deep neuro-cognitive cooperative co-evolution structure, which is explicitly permitted to identify interdependent variables and adaptively decompose them in the same neuro-subpopulation, with minimizing the complexity and nonseparability of interdependent variables among different fuzzy attribute subsets. Next DNCFAR formalizes to the different types of quantum leaping particles with nearest-neighbor memeplexes to share their respective solutions and deeply cooperate to evolve the assigned fuzzy attribute subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that DNCFAR can achieve competitive performance in terms of average computational efficiency and classification accuracy while reinforcing noise tolerance. Furthermore, it can be well applied to clearly identify different longitudinal surfaces of infant cerebrum regions, which indicates its great potential for brain disorder prediction based on fMRI.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2018.2834390", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2804031762", "source": "openalex"}

Some evaluative comments are made about the coherence of Neuro‐linguistic Programming as it currently stands, both in terms of its internal consistency, and in relation to established learning theories. In relation to its internal structure, questions are asked as to how far copying an expert's behaviour can really lead a learner to becoming an expert, and about the lack of attention within the theory given to the domain of application. Two other important areas are examined: the dissonance between the claim that Neuro‐linguistic Programming caters to individuality in learning while also proposing a view that learning is best done experientially; and a specific aspect of the theory, named the ‘logical levels’, asking whether learners are really as predictable and as subject to cause/effect as this theory would suggest. Finally,the epistemological basis of Neurolinguistic Programming is questioned. It is argued that, though Neuro‐linguistic Programming has begun to make an impact in education, it remains a set of strategies rather than a theory or a model, and these internal inconsistencies need to be addressed if it is to have a place among the dominant learning theories of our age.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09585170122455", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969882993", "source": "openalex"}

These reconstructions are prone to be influenced by several factors, which may result in false memories. A false memory is the recollection of an event, or details of an episode, that did not actually occur. Memory formation comprises at least three different sub-processes: encoding, consolidation and the retrieval of the learned material. All of these sub-processes are vulnerable for specific errors and consequently may result in false memories. Whereas, processes like imagery, self-referential encoding or spreading activation can lead to the formation of false memories at encoding, semantic generalization during sleep and updating processes due to misleading post event information, in particular, are relevant at the consolidation stage. Finally at the retrieval stage, monitoring processes, which are assumed to be essential to reject false memories, are of specific importance. Different neuro-cognitive processes have been linked to the formation of true and false memories. Most consistently the medial temporal lobe and the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex have been reported with regard to the formation of true and false memories. Despite the fact that all phases entailing memory formation, consolidation of stored information and retrieval processes, are relevant for the forming of false memories, most studies focused on either memory encoding or retrieval. Thus, future studies should try to integrate data from all phases to give a more comprehensive view on systematic memory distortions. An initial outline is developed within this review to connect the different memory stages and research strategies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-9081-8-35", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2162828392", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this paper is to propose a model demonstrating how neurohormonal processes, in particular oxytocinergic mechanisms, not only control the physiological aspects of labor and birth, but also contribute to the subjective psychological experiences of birth. In addition, sensory information from the uterus as well as the external environment might influence these neurohormonal processes thereby influencing the progress of labor and the experience of birth. Methodology In this new model of childbirth, we integrated the findings from two previous systematic reviews, one on maternal plasma levels of oxytocin during physiological childbirth and one meta-synthesis of women´s subjective experiences of physiological childbirth. Findings The neurobiological processes induced by the release of endogenous oxytocin during birth influence maternal behaviour and feelings in connection with birth in order to facilitate birth. The psychological experiences during birth may promote an optimal transition to motherhood. The spontaneous altered state of consciousness, that some women experience, may well be a hallmark of physiological childbirth in humans. The data also highlights the crucial role of one-to-one support during labor and birth. The physiological importance of social support to reduce labor stress and pain necessitates a reconsideration of many aspects of modern maternity care. Conclusion By listening to women's experiences and by observing women during childbirth, factors that contribute to an optimized process of labor, such as the mothers' wellbeing and feelings of safety, may be identified. These observations support the integrative role of endogenous oxytocin in coordinating the neuroendocrine, psychological and physiological aspects of labor and birth, including oxytocin mediated. decrease of pain, fear and stress, support the need for midwifery one-to-one support in labour as well as the need for maternity care that optimizes the function of these neuroendocrine processes even when birth interventions are used. Women and their partners would benefit from understanding the crucial role that endogenous oxytocin plays in the psychological and neuroendocrinological process of labor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230992", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3045965548", "source": "openalex"}

Optic nerve optical coherence tomography (OCT) can quantify optic atrophy reproducibly, and is of prognostic value for postoperative visual recovery. Diplopia most often involves decompensation of heterophoria, visual field fusion being hampered by the visual field defect; such diplopia without ocular motor deficit is known as \"hemifield slide\". Diplopia associated with ocular motor palsy is caused by tumoral invasion of the cavernous sinus (IIIrd, IVth or VIth nerve palsy); in large impairment, restricted eye movement is easily observed; milder palsies require neuro-ophthalmologic assessment and/or Lancaster test. Pituitary apoplexy induces ocular motor impairment in 70% of cases, strongly guiding diagnosis. Visual impairment is associated in 75% of cases.

The proposed neuro-fuzzy controller (NFC) incorporates fuzzy logic laws with a five-layer artificial neural network (ANN) scheme. In this controller only three membership functions are used for each input keeping in mind for low computational burden, which will be suitable for real-time implementation. Furthermore, for the proposed NFC an improved self-tuning method is developed based on the IM theory and its high performance requirements. The main task of the tuning method is to adjust the parameters of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in order to minimize the square of the error between actual and reference outputs. This work also demonstrates how the proposed NFC can easily be adjusted to work with different size of induction motors. A complete simulation model for indirect field oriented control of IM incorporating the proposed NFC is developed. The performance of the proposed NFC based IM drive is investigated extensively at different operating conditions in simulation. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed NFC, the results for the proposed controller are also compared to those obtained by a conventional PI controller. The proposed NFC based IM drive is found to be more robust as compared to conventional PI controller based drive and hence found suitable for high performance industrial drive applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ias.2004.1348846", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2585768673", "source": "openalex"}

Neuro-fuzzy modeling (NFM), another AI method, has a transparent functional layer and is without many of the drawbacks of ANN. We have compared the predictive accuracies of NFM, ANN, and traditional statistical methods, for the behavior of bladder cancer.Experimental molecular biomarkers, including p53 and the mismatch repair proteins, and conventional clinicopathological data were studied in a cohort of 109 patients with bladder cancer. For all three of the methods, models were produced to predict the presence and timing of a tumor relapse.Both methods of AI predicted relapse with an accuracy ranging from 88% to 95%. This was superior to statistical methods (71-77%; P < 0.0006). NFM appeared better than ANN at predicting the timing of relapse (P = 0.073).The use of AI can accurately predict cancer behavior.

We performed a systematic review of the neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE reported in the English literature from 1970 to 2010 by a Medline search. The prevalence of neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations is 3.6% in adult and 1.6% in childhood SLE patients. Neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are highly variable, with the commonest presentation being optic neuritis, followed by myasthenia gravis, visual field defects and pseudotumor cerebri. The underlying pathology was thought to be either SLE activity or its vascular complications. Most neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are responsive to high‐dose glucocorticoids. Anticoagulation is indicated when there is concomitant antiphospholipid syndrome. SLE ‐related neuromyelitis optica is often refractory to treatment and 92% of patients require multiple immunosuppressive protocols. Neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are uncommon but heterogeneous. The prognosis of neuro‐ophthalmologic manifestations in SLE is generally good because of their rapid response to glucocorticoids. Relapses of these manifestations may be reduced by the use of maintenance immunosuppression. Cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab can be considered in glucocorticoid‐dependent or refractory cases.

Although it is well-known that fibrotic tissue formation around the electrode array can interfere with hearing performance in implanted patients, and that associated intracochlear inflammation can initiate loss of residual hearing, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that promote this response in the cochlea. In vitro studies in neonatal rats and in vivo studies in adult mice were performed to gain insight into the pro-inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling phases of pathological wound healing that occur in the cochlea following an electrode analog insertion. Resident Schwann cells (SC), macrophages, and fibroblasts had a prominent role in the inflammatory process in the cochlea. Leukocytes were recruited to the cochlea following insertion of a nylon filament in adult mice, where contributed to the inflammatory response. The reparative stages in wound healing are characterized by persistent neuro-inflammation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and expression of regenerative monocytes/macrophages in the cochlea. Accordingly, genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling were up-regulated in implanted cochleae. Maturation of scar tissue occurs in the remodeling phase of wound healing in the cochlea. Similar to other damaged peripheral nerves, M2 macrophages and de-differentiated SC were observed in damaged cochleae and may play a role in cell survival and axonal regeneration. In conclusion, the insertion of an electrode analog into the cochlea is associated with robust early and chronic inflammatory responses characterized by recruitment of leukocytes and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote intracochlear fibrosis and loss of the auditory hair cells (HC) and SGN important for hearing after CI surgery.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2015.00303", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1523259102", "source": "openalex"}

In NAWM of all MS disease types (primary progressive, relapsing‐remitting, and secondary progressive), the concentration ratio of total N ‐acetyl‐aspartate (tNAA)/total creatine (tCr) was decreased compared to controls. Remarkably, this was entirely due to an increase of tCr in MS patients, whereas there was no difference in tNAA. Separate quantification of the two tNAA components yielded no significant difference in NAA ( N ‐acetyl‐aspartate), while the concentration of NAAG ( N ‐acetyl‐aspartyl‐glutamate) was slightly—but significantly—elevated in MS patients. Myo‐inositol (Ins) was strongly increased in MS patients, and choline‐containing compounds (Cho) were mildly increased. There were no metabolite differences between disease types, and no correlations with disability scores. The results are supported by measures of spectral quality, which were identical for patients and controls. In conclusion, MS NAWM containing very little perilesional tissue is characterized by increased glial cell numbers (increase of Ins and tCr) without evidence of axonal dysfunction (normal NAA).

We examined motor-related features in neurodevelopmental (schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders), \"functional\" (nonschizophrenic nonaffective psychoses, mood disorders) and neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease) disorders. Examination of the literature revealed that there have been very few comparisons of motor-related features across diagnoses and we had to rely mainly in disorder-specific studies to compare it transdiagnostically. One or more motor domains had a substantial prevalence in all the diagnoses examined.

In this paper, we present an ultrasound neuro-modulation chip, capable of initiating reversal behaviour and activating neurons of C. elegans under the stimulation of a single-shot, short-pulsed ultrasound. About 85.29% ± 6.17% of worms respond to the ultrasound stimulation exhibiting reversal behaviour. Furthermore, the worms can adapt to the ultrasound stimulation with a lower acoustic pulse duration of stimulation. In vivo calcium imaging shows that the activity of ASH, a polymodal sensory neuron in C. elegans, can be directly evoked by the ultrasound stimulation. On the other hand, AFD, a thermal sensitive neuron, cannot be activated by the ultrasound stimulation using the same parameter and the temperature elevation during the stimulation process is relatively small. Consistent with the calcium imaging results, the tax-4 mutants, which are insensitive to temperature increase, do not show a significant difference in avoidance probability compared to the wild type. Therefore, the mechanical effects induced by ultrasound are the main reason for neural and behavioural modulation of C. elegans. With the advantages of confined acoustic energy on the surface, compatible with standard calcium imaging, this neuro-modulation chip could be a powerful tool for revealing the molecular mechanisms of ultrasound neuro-modulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1039/c7lc00163k", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2606119932", "source": "openalex"}

Patients and Methods Data acquisition comprised electronic search on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online ( MEDLINE ) database and the EMBASE database in A ugust 2014 to retrieve E nglish language studies. MEDLINE and EMBASE search included the following medical subject heading ( MeSH ) terms: (i) neurogenic bladder and (ii) neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Each of these terms was crossed with (i) long‐term care and (ii) long‐term surveillance. Only studies related to NLUTD and urological follow‐up were included. Studies were also identified by hand search of reference lists and review articles. Results Initial records identified through database searching included 265 articles. In all, 23 articles were included in the quantitative synthesis. The proposed time schedule of investigations as well as the amount and type of investigation were different according to specific neurological lesions. They depend on the dysfunctional pattern of the lower urinary tract ( LUT ) and its risk profile. However, there is a lack of high‐evidence level studies to support an optimal long‐term follow‐up protocol. Conclusions The goal of neuro‐urological management is the best possible preservation of upper urinary tract ( UUT ) and LUT function in relation to the individual neurological disorder. Regular and risk adapted controls (‘urochecks’) allow detection of risk‐factors in time before irreversible changes of the LUT and UUT have occurred. With risk‐ and patient‐oriented lifelong regular urological care an optimised quality of life and life‐expectancy can be achieved, although there is a complete lack of high‐evidence level studies on this topic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13084", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1867577353", "source": "openalex"}

There are unique considerations for many adult patients with gliomas who are vulnerable to the novel coronavirus due to older age and immunosuppression. As patients with terminal illnesses, they present ethical challenges for centers that may need to ration access to ventilator care due to insufficient critical care capacity. It is urgent for the neuro-oncology community to develop a pro-active and coordinated approach to the care of adults with gliomas in order to provide them with the best possible oncologic care while also reducing their risk of viral infection during times of potential healthcare system failure. In this article, we present an approach developed by an international multi-disciplinary group to optimize the care of adults with gliomas during this pandemic. We recommend measures to promote strict social distancing and minimize exposures for patients, address risk and benefit of all therapeutic interventions, pro-actively develop end of life plans, educate patients and caregivers and ensure the health of the multi-disciplinary neuro-oncology workforce.

In the current report, 12 consecutive patients were evaluated to document operative ocular morbidity referable to the brain stem as well as visual deficits secondary to occipital lobe retraction. Before craniotomy, ophthalmological findings related to dorsal midbrain dysfunction were evident in four of the 10 patients who had previously undergone ventricular shunting. The other patients developed a partial or complete Parinaud's syndrome in the early postoperative period and some suffered additional deficits such as cranial nerve palsies. These deficits improved to varying degrees in all patients. Although each had full visual fields preoperatively, an absolute or incomplete left homonymous hemianopsia developed in the immediate postoperative period. Such visual field deficits fully resolved over a variable period of time in 10 of the 12 patients. One patient has a permanent left homonymous hemianopsia, while another has a left homonymous paracentral scotoma. Eight patients were able to return to preoperative pursuits. While ocular abnormalities related to dorsal midbrain dysfunction are most probably independent of operative approach, visual field deficits attributable to occipital lobe retraction were common in patients after a occipital transtentorial approach performed in the semisitting position.

SOCS proteins as inhibitors of the JAK-STAT cascadeThe JAK-STAT cascade is an intracellular signaling pathway shared by a variety of cytokines, including gp130 cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor), as well as leptin, GH, and prolactin.Ligand binding to cytokine receptors, which themselves lack intrinsic kinase activity, activates receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK's) by autophosphorylation and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain and of associated proteins termed STATs for signal transducers and activators of transcription.Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs enables homo-or heterodimerization of various STAT proteins.The dimerized STAT complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they transactivate their target genes by binding to specific promoter elements (1, 2).A family of proteins able to inhibit the JAK-STAT signaling cascade has synonymously been described as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein (3), JAK-binding protein (4), and STAT-induced STAT inhibitor.The SOCS protein family (5) encompasses SOCS-1 (3, 4, 6), SOCS-2 (3), SOCS-3 (3), CIS (7), and SOCS-4 to SOCS-7 (5).While the role of the former four proteins is increasingly well understood, the roles of SOCS-4 to SOCS-7 remain poorly characterized.In vitro overexpression studies demonstrate that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 exert similar effects and represent the most potent and broadly acting suppressors of cytokine signaling.These factors potently inhibit JAK-STAT signaling of several gp130 cytokines (see Arzt, this Perspective series, ref. 8; and refs.3,4,[9][10][11][12], GH (13-15), and prolactin (16).The common protein structure of SOCS proteins is a variable N-terminal region, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal domain, termed SOCS-box motif (5).The central SH2 domain alone is not sufficient for inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling (4), as part of the N-terminal region, termed pre-SH2 domain/kinase inhibitory region, is also required (10,17,18).The C-terminal SOCS-box interacts with elongin BC complex (19), although the physiological significance of this interaction is still unclear.Some observations suggest that this interaction protects SOCS proteins from degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, whereas others suggest that it actually directs these proteins to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and sets the stage for their degradation (19,20).Conversely, the significance of the proteasome in the turnover of these molecules is not in doubt.The halflives of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in COS-7 cells have been calculated to be as short as 1.5 hours ( 21), but incubation with proteasome inhibitors stabilizes them significantly (18,19).Therefore, the C-terminal SOCS-box also appears not to be essential for direct inhibitory interaction with JAK (10, 17) but might be required to control SOCS protein degradation and thus might modulate the intracellular level of the SOCS protein (18).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci14662", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2014222871", "source": "openalex"}

Methods PubMed, Web of Science and COVID‐dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID‐19 terminology and neurology terminology up to 10 May 2020. Social media channels were followed up between 15 March and 10 May 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified papers and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. Results Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID‐19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and autoimmune disorders such as the Guillain–Barré syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID‐19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild to moderate COVID‐19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. Conclusion Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID‐19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms.

Their levels in the intestinal lumen, circulation and tissues fluctuate after feeding and fasting, and as a result of certain diseases and therapies. BAs regulate many cell types in the gut wall and beyond by activating nuclear and plasma membrane receptors. Of these, the G protein‐coupled receptor TGR5 has emerged as a key mediator of the non‐genomic actions of BAs. TGR5 is a cell‐surface receptor that couples to Gαs, formation of cAMP, activation of protein kinase A and extracellular signal‐regulated kinases, and inhibition of inflammatory signalling pathways. TGR5 has been implicated in mediating the actions of BAs on secretion of glucagon‐like peptide 1 and glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal motility and transit, electrolyte and fluid transport in the colon, bile formation and secretion, sensory transduction and inflammation. TGR5 agonists have been developed as treatments for metabolic, inflammatory and digestive disorders, and emerging evidence suggests that TGR5 mutations are associated with inflammatory diseases.

OBJECTIVE To present our series of LITT in surgical neuro-oncology to better evaluate procedural safety and outcomes. METHODS An exploratory cohort study of all patients receiving LITT for brain tumors by a single senior neurosurgeon at a single center between 2013 and 2018. Primary outcomes included extent of ablation (EOA), time to recurrence (TTR), local control at 1-yr follow-up, and overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included complication rate. Outcomes were compared by tumor subtype. Predictors of outcomes were identified. RESULTS A total of 91 patients underwent 100 LITT procedures; 61% remain alive with 72% local control at median 7.2 mo follow-up. Median TTR and OS were 31.9 and 16.9 mo, respectively. For lesion subtypes, median TTR (months, not applicable [N/A] if &lt;50% rate observed), local control rates at 1-yr follow-up, and median OS (months) were the following: dural-based lesions (n = 4, N/A, 75%, 20.7), metastases (n = 45, 55.9, 77.4%, 16.9), newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n = 11, 31.9, 83.3%, 32.3), recurrent glioblastoma (n = 14, 5.6, 24.3%, 7.3), radiation necrosis (n = 20, N/A, 67.2%, 16.4), and other lesions (n = 6, 12.3, 80%, 24.4). TTR differed by tumor subtype ( P = .02, log-rank analysis). EOA predicted local control ( P = .009, multivariate proportional hazards regression); EOA &gt; 85% predicted longer TTR ( P = .006, log-rank analysis). Complication rate was 4%. CONCLUSION Our series of LITT in surgical neuro-oncology, 1 of the largest to date, further evidences its safety and outcomes profile.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyz424", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2990554694", "source": "openalex"}

In-built antioxidant system of body plays its decisive role in prevention of any loss due to free radicals. However, imbalanced defense mechanism of antioxidants, overproduction or incorporation of free radicals from environment to living system leads to serious penalty leading to neuro-degeneration. Neural cells suffer functional or sensory loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from several other environmental or genetic factors, oxidative stress (OS) leading to free radical attack on neural cells contributes calamitous role to neuro-degeneration. Though, oxygen is imperative for life, imbalanced metabolism and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation end into a range of disorders such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, aging and many other neural disorders. Toxicity of free radicals contributes to proteins and DNA injury, inflammation, tissue damage and subsequent cellular apoptosis. Antioxidants are now being looked upon as persuasive therapeutic against solemn neuronal loss, as they have capability to combat by neutralizing free radicals. Diet is major source of antioxidants, as well as medicinal herbs are catching attention to be commercial source of antioxidants at present. Recognition of upstream and downstream antioxidant therapy to oxidative stress has been proved an effective tool in alteration of any neuronal damage as well as free radical scavenging. Antioxidants have a wide scope to sequester metal ions involved in neuronal plaque formation to prevent oxidative stress. In addition, antioxidant therapy is vital in scavenging free radicals and ROS preventing neuronal degeneration in post-oxidative stress scenario.

The objective of this study was to define the form of cell death induced by Al-malt and to establish an in vitro model system amenable to mechanistic investigations of Al-malt-induced cell death. Neuro-2a cells, a murine neuroblastoma cell line, were treated with Al-malt for 24 h, following which mode of cell death and alterations in apoptosis-related gene expression were studied. Al-malt concentration-dependently increased cell death. The mode of cell death was a combination of apoptosis and necrosis. Treatment with Al-malt resulted in caspase 3 activation and the externalization of phosphatidyl serine, both indicative of apoptosis. In addition, nuclear condensation and fragmentation were evident. Interestingly, pretreatment with cycloheximide (CHX), a potent protein synthesis inhibitor markedly reduced Al-malt-induced apoptosis, indicating that altered gene expression was critical for this form of cell death. Pretreatment with CHX had no effect on necrosis induced by Al-malt. Analysis of gene expression showed that p53 mRNA was increased following treatment with Al-malt. This increase was accompanied by a marked inhibition of Bcl2 expression and an increase in BAX expression, a pattern of gene expression suggestive of a pro-apoptotic shift. Results show for the first time that p53 is induced by Al in neuron-like cells and suggest that the p53-dependent intrinsic pathway may be responsible for Al-induced apoptosis. Future studies investigating the role of p53 in Al neurotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro are warranted.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfi028", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2130942861", "source": "openalex"}

As rat models provide the advantage of recording and stimulating different disease-related regions simultaneously, this paper proposes a battery-less, implantable neuro-electronic interface suitable for studying DBS mechanisms with a freely-moving rat. The neuro-electronic interface mainly consists of a microsystem able to interact with eight different brain regions bi-directionally and simultaneously. To minimize the size of the implant, the microsystem receives power and transmits data through a single coil. In addition, particular attention is paid to the capability of recording neural activities right after each stimulation, so as to acquire information on how stimulations modulate neural activities. The microsystem has been fabricated with the standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The chip area is 7.74 mm (2) , and the microsystem is able to operate with a single supply voltage of 1 V. The wireless interface allows a maximum power of 10 mW to be transmitted together with either uplink or downlink data at a rate of 2 Mbps or 100 kbps, respectively. The input referred noise of recording amplifiers is 1.16 μVrms, and the stimulation voltage is tunable from 1.5 V to 4.5 V with 5-bit resolution. After the electrical functionality of the microsystem is tested, the capability of the microsystem to interface with rat brain is further examined and compared with conventional instruments.

Big data represent the immense volume of complex data that show more details about behaviours, activities, and events that occur around the world. As a result, big data analytics needs to access diverse types of resources within a decreased response time to produce accurate and stable business experimentation that could help make brilliant decisions for organizations in real-time. These developments have spurred a revolutionary transformation in research, inventions, and business marketing. User behaviour analysis for classification and prediction is one of the hottest topics in data science. This type of analysis is performed for several purposes, such as finding users’ interests about a product (for marketing, e-commerce, etc.) or toward an event (elections, championships, etc.) and observing suspicious activities (security and privacy) based on their traits over the Internet. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy approach for the classification and prediction of user behaviour is proposed. A dataset, composed of users’ temporal logs containing three types of information, namely, local machine, network and web usage logs, is targeted. To complement the analysis, each user’s 360-degree feedback is also utilized. Various rules have been implemented to address the company’s policy for determining the precise behaviour of a user, which could be helpful in managerial decisions. For prediction, a Gaussian Radial Basis Function Neural Network (GRBF-NN) is trained based on the example set generated by a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS) and the 360-degree feedback of the user. The results are obtained and compared with other state-of-the-art schemes in the literature, and the scheme is found to be promising in terms of classification as well as prediction accuracy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13677-019-0144-9", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2990837002", "source": "openalex"}

HK156 and HK483 required 200 and 5 p.f.u. of virus, respectively, to give a 50% lethal dose to the mice when the volume of inoculum was set at 10 μl. Both viruses caused encephalitis and severe bronchopneumonia in infected mice. The severity of lung lesions caused by the viruses was essentially similar, whereas HK483 caused more extensive lesions in the brain than did HK156. This was supported by the results of virus titration of organ homogenates, which showed that the virus titres in brains of HK483-infected mice were more than 100-fold higher than those of HK156-infected mice, while those in lungs were almost equivalent. Both viruses were detected in homogenates of the heart, liver, spleen and kidney and blood of the infected mice. Virus antigen was detected by immunohistology in the heart and liver, albeit sporadically, but caused no degenerative change in these organs. The antigen was not detected in the thymus, spleen, pancreas, kidney or gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, virus antigen was found frequently in adipose tissues attached to those organs. The adipose tissues showed severe degenerative change and the virus titres in the tissues were high and comparable to those in lungs. Thus, infection of HK156 and HK483 in our mouse model was pneumo-, neuro- and adipotropic, but not pantropic.

Region of interest/threshold analysis was performed on the TRAMs and on relative cerebral blood volume maps, and correlation with histology was studied. Relative cerebral blood volume was also assessed by the study neuroradiologist. Histological validation confirmed that regions of contrast agent clearance in the TRAMs >1 h post contrast injection represent active tumor, while regions of contrast accumulation represent nontumor tissues with 100% sensitivity and 92% positive predictive value to active tumor. Significant correlation was found between tumor burden in the TRAMs and histology in a subgroup of lesions resected en bloc (r2 = 0.90, P < .0001).

This approach has recently resurfaced and modified in both neuroscientific and philosophical concepts of embodiment of emotional feelings. In addition to the body, the role of the environment in emotional feeling needs to be considered. I here claim that the environment has not merely an indirect and instrumental, i.e., modulatory role on emotional feelings via the body and its sensorimotor and vegetative functions. Instead, the environment may have a direct and non-instrumental, i.e., constitutional role in emotional feelings. This implies that the environment itself is constitutive of emotional feeling rather than the bodily representation of the environment. I call this the relational concept of emotional feeling. The present paper discusses recent data from neuroimaging that investigate emotions in relation to interoceptive processing and the brain's intrinsic activity. These data show the intrinsic linkage of interoceptive stimulus processing to both exteroceptive stimuli and the brain's intrinsic activity. This is possible only if the differences between intrinsic activity and intero- and exteroceptive stimuli is encoded into neural activity. Such relational coding makes possible the assignment of subjective and affective features to the otherwise objective and non-affective stimulus. I therefore consider emotions to be intrinsically affective and subjective as it is manifest in emotional feelings. The relational approach thus goes together with what may be described as neuro-phenomenal approach. Such neuro-phenomenal approach does not only inform emotions and emotional feeling but is also highly relevant to better understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying consciousness in general.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00303", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159565318", "source": "openalex"}

Loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN also frequently contributes to upregulation of PI3K/Akt. Several compounds, such as wortmannin and LY-294002, can target PI3K and inhibit activity of this pathway.

These neurotransmitters, involved in emotional behaviors, depend on neuron aromatic hydoxylases functioning with iron as essential cofactor. Noradrenaline also has impact on neuroplasticity via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is key for prefrontal and hippocampus neurons playing a role in depression. Establishing the formal relationship between depression and AID remains difficult. Intracerebral reduced iron is still hard to quantify by neuroimaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) now tends to explore the neurotransmission pathways. AID has to be looked for and identified in the context of depression, major episode or resistant to conventional treatment such as serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and even in the absence of anemia, microcytosis or hypochromia (non-anemic ID). Confronted to brain imaging, blood iron status evaluation is indicated, especially in depressed, treatment-resistant, iron-deficient young women. In patients suffering from depression, increase in the prevalence of AID should be considered, in order to deliver a suitable treatment, considering both anti-depressive program and iron supplementation if AID.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jha2.321", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4200290315", "source": "openalex"}

Current practices and literature review were performed to identify major confounding issues and justify subsequently developed recommendations; in areas lacking scientific investigations, recommendations were based on experience of committee members and consensus was reached after discussion. Recommendations apply to both adult and pediatric patients with medulloblastoma and other seeding tumors. Response should be assessed using MR imaging (brain and spine), CSF cytology, and neurologic examination. Clinical imaging standards with minimum mandatory sequence acquisition that optimizes detection of leptomeningeal metastases are defined. We recommend central review prior to inclusion in treatment cohorts to ensure appropriate risk stratification and cohort inclusion.

For a developing country such as Malaysia which is prone to flood disaster having such an expert model for runoff forecasting is a very vital matter. In this article, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is proposed to forecast the rainfall for Klang River in Malaysia on monthly basis. To be able to train and test the ANFIS and ANN models, the statistical data from 1997 to 2008, was obtained from Klang gates dam data. The optimum structure and optimum input pattern of model was determined through trial and error. Different combinations of rainfall were produced as inputs and five different criteria were used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of each network and its ability to make precise prediction. The performance of the ANFIS model is compared to artificial neural network (ANN) model. The five criteria are root mean square error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (), and Nash Sutcliffe coefficient (NE), gamma coefficient (GC) Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). The result indicate that the ANFIS model showed higher rainfall forecasting accuracy and low error compared to the ANN model.

At a fundamental level, however, uncertainty still abounds regarding the nature of the processes that mediate this effect. In the present paper, we propose that two contrasting approaches may be derived from theoretical accounts of AB. According to a first class of models, called the \"valence-specific bias\" models, modifying AB requires the modification of valence-specific attentional selectivity. According to a second class of models, called the \"attention control models,\" modifying AB requires the modification of attention control, driven by the recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Conversely, all forms of pathogenic stimuli which disturb astrocytic functions compromise neuronal functionality and viability. Support of neuroprotective functions of astrocytes is thus an important strategy for enhancing neuronal survival and improving outcomes in disease states. In this review, we first briefly examine how astrocytic dysfunction contributes to major neurological disorders, which are traditionally associated with malfunctioning of processes residing in neurons. Possible molecular entities within astrocytes that could underpin the cause, initiation and/or progression of various disorders are outlined. In the second section, we explore opportunities enhancing neuroprotective function of astroglia. We consider targeting astrocyte-specific molecular pathways which are involved in neuroprotection or could be expected to have a therapeutic value. Examples of those are oxidative stress defense mechanisms, glutamate uptake, purinergic signaling, water and ion homeostasis, connexin gap junctions, neurotrophic factors and the Nrf2-ARE pathway.

Gliomas account for over 60% of primary brain tumours and usually present with one or more symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, progressive neurological deficit, seizures, focal or global cognitive decline. The diagnosis is made by a combination of imaging and histological examination of tumour specimen. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the gold standard imaging modality and provides highly sensitive anatomical information about the tumour. Advanced imaging modalities provide complementary information about brain tumour metabolism, blood flow and ultrastructure and are being increasingly incorporated into routine clinical sequences. Imaging is essential for guiding surgery and radiotherapy treatments and for monitoring response to, and progression of, therapy. However, changes in imaging over time may be misinterpreted and lead to incorrect assumptions about the effectiveness of treatments. Thus, the disappearance of contrast enhancement and resolution of oedema after anti-angiogenesis treatments is seen early while conventional T2 weighted/FLAIR sequences demonstrate continual tumour growth (pseudoregression). Conversely imaging may suggest lack of efficacy of treatment e.g. increasing tumour size and contrast enhancement following chemoradiation for malignant gliomas (pseudoprogression), which then stabilise or resolve after a few months of continued treatment and that paradoxically may be associated with a better outcome.

These advanced neuroimaging techniques are currently under investigation in an attempt to optimize them and substantiate their clinical relevance in individual patients. However, the data currently available confine their use to the research arena for group comparisons, and there remains insufficient evidence at the time of this writing to conclude that these advanced techniques can be used for routine clinical use at the individual patient level.

What has not been extensively investigated, however, is the interactive nature of the development of the endocrine and immune systems and whether this might alter predisposition to inflammatory disease or stress-related pathologies. Increasing attention is now being focused on the role of early life environments determining long-term predisposition to disease, and a role for the HPA axis in disease predisposition is emerging. Stress generally refers to the condition where coping with actual or perceived stimuli alters the homeostatic state of the organism. The classic stress response involves the activation of central and peripheral catecholamine systems and HPA responses. Increased glucocorticoid levels are thought to protect the organism, both by providing energy substrates to deal with immediate environmental demands and by blocking potentially harmful overreaction by the immune system and other stress-reactive systems (1). However, to avoid immunosuppression and degenerative pathologies associated with increased glucocorticoid levels, the HPA stress response must terminate efficiently once the environmental demands are removed (2). Consequently, disturbances in endocrine-immune interactions upset the normal regulatory homeostatic balance and alter susceptibility to a variety of disease states associated with immune dysregulation (3). The physiological impact of stress is variable across individuals, and susceptibility to stress apparently depends on attributes of the organism, such as genetic endowment and age, and experiential factors, such as previous stress experiences, and early life events (4, 5). Indeed, the endocrine and immune systems and the CNS all respond to environmental pressures during development, and the interactive nature of these systems suggests that alterations in one system could have developmental consequences for the others and potential long-term implications for disease vulnerability. Plasticity in most developing physiological systems is thought to be of adaptive importance, enabling an organism to better meet the demands of the environment in which it matures and will most likely reside. However, the short-term reorganization or re-setting of regulatory systems to deal with immediate demands may also have long-term consequences for normal physiological function, thereby predisposing an organism to pathology. This may particularly be the case when the environmental pressures differ between development and adulthood. A number of epidemiological studies have indicated that nutritional factors early in life have long-term implications for cardiovascular and metabolic disease in adulthood. Most data suggest that maternal nutrition and limited intrauterine growth are responsible for reorganizing metabolic regulation and results in metabolic and cardiovascular pathologies in adult life (6). The concept of “perinatal programming” is not new and has long been investigated in neuroendocrine development of both the adrenal and the gonadal axes (see review, ref. 7). Immune responses, too, are influenced by early life experiences, and it has been suggested that pathogen exposure during development is important for the developing immune repertoire and that too little activation may be associated with the development of allergy (8). Available data also indicate that there are long-term consequences following endocrine-immune interactions during the first week of life. Thus, the administration of steroids during antigen exposure alters the development of immune tolerance (9), and immune challenge during the first week of life is associated with altered endocrine development (10, 11). These data demonstrate the interactive nature of both the immune and the neuroendocrine systems during development and show that these interactions can alter both immune and endocrine function in the long term. Maternal factors represent some of the most salient environmental influences altering endocrine development (12–14). Indeed, there is an extensive literature detailing both prenatal and postnatal influences on the development of the HPA axis. It is also well established that immune factors passed in utero and also to the neonate via milk have a direct impact on the its immunocompetence (15, 16). However, evidence examining the neuro-immune interface and maternal factors is limited.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci14592", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2013929399", "source": "openalex"}

Approximately 3.4 million individuals in the USA and up to 1% of the world population is afflicted by epilepsy. This necessitates the real-time detection of seizures which can be done by the use of an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for smart healthcare. In this paper, we propose an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure detection system in the IoT framework which uses the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Hjorth parameters (HPs), statistical features, and a machine learning classifier. Seizure detection is done in two stages. In the first stage, EEG signals are decomposed by the DWT into sub-bands and features (activity, signal complexity, and standard deviation) were extracted from each of these sub-bands. In the second stage, a deep neural network (DNN) classifier is used to classify the EEG data. A prototype of the proposed neuro-detect was implemented using the hardware-in-the-loop approach. The results demonstrate a significant difference in HP values between interictal and ictal EEG with ictal EEG being less complex than interictal EEG. In this approach, we report an accuracy of 100% for a classification of normal versus ictal EEG and 98.6% for normal and interictal versus ictal EEG.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tce.2019.2917895", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2945280224", "source": "openalex"}

For ECG diagnosis, the system benefits from the reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic as well as the learning ability of neural networks. This hybrid system consists of two phases: (1) Use fuzzy logic to establish the diagnosis system in the form of symbolic IF-THEN rules based on expert cardiac knowledge; (2) Through a training process, use a backpropagation network to automatically adjust the parameters of the system. A total of 124 ECGs from patients with or without acute myocardial infarction have been studied and eight diagnostic classes have been taken into account regarding the different locations of AMI. Sensitivity, specificity, partial and total accuracy are used for evaluation of the system. After the training process, the neuro-fuzzy system correctly identified 89.4% of the patients with AMI and 95.0% of the patients without AMI.

In laboratory rodents, factors extracted from the SMG were shown to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation, to affect the weight of the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes and to induce immunosuppression in several in vivo animal models. The SMG produces significant quantities of nerve growth factor (NGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β and kallikreins, which are secreted into the saliva and affect immune and mucosal tissues and nerve endings in the gastrointestinal tract. These factors play a role in regulating mucosal immuno/inflammatory response and in regeneration and healing. The major salivary glands also produce antimicrobial proteins and secretory IgA antibodies which are essential factors in mucosal host defense. SMG-derived NGF, EGF and glandular kallikrein are delivered into the bloodstream where they may act as important systemic immunoregulators and also have major regulatory influences on the central neuroendocrine system. There is evidence to indicate that EGF is involved in the regulation of gonadal function. Growth hormone, prolactin, androgens, thyroid hormone and corticosteroids regulate protein synthesis in the SMG, whereas secretory activity is regulated by sympathetic (α- and β-adrenergic) parasympathetic (muscarinic) and peptidergic (substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide) nerve fibers. Fluid and electrolyte secretion is promoted by parasympathetic, whereas protein secretion is stimulated by sympathetic nerve impulses. Steroid hormones and cytokines (interleukin-1α, -β, tumor necrosis factor, interferon-γ) have a major regulatory influence on protein secretion, including the secretion of immunoglobulin into the saliva. The SMG interacts with the mucosal and systemic compartments of the immune system, with the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the pituitary gland, and with peripheral endocrine organs. These interactions enable the SMG to exert regulatory influences on immune/inflammatory reactions in the gastrointestinal tract, in the lungs, and possibly elsewhere. It is suggested that these functions make this gland a key regulatory organ in the neuroimmunoregulatory network. Evidence is increasing that the major salivary glands fulfill similar functions in other species, including humans.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000097197", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973503426", "source": "openalex"}

A linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is designed to estimate the optimal control force. The required voltage for the MR damper to produce the control force estimated by LQG controller is calculated by a neural network predictive control algorithm (NNPC). The LQG controller and the NNPC are linked to control the structure. The coupled LQG and NNPC system are then used to train a semi-active neuro-controller designated as SANC, which produces the necessary control voltage that actuates the MR damper. The effectiveness of the NNPC and SANC is illustrated and verified using simulated response of a 3-story full-scale, nonlinear, seismically excited, benchmark building excited by several historical earthquake records. The semi-active system using the NNPC algorithm is compared with the performances of passive as well as active and clipped optimal control (COC) systems, which are based on the same nominal controller as is used in the NNPC algorithm. The results demonstrate that the SANC algorithm is quite effective in seismic response reduction for wide range of motions from moderate to severe seismic events, compared with the passive systems and performs better than active and COC systems.

Palliative care (PC) is a proactive and systematic approach to manage issues that are important to patients and families affected by serious illness. The goal is to improve quality of life and symptom control and thereby reduce suffering. Most PC interventions take place during the end-of-life phase; however, newer data suggest that early PC interventions might improve symptom control and quality of life. Methods A literature review focusing on PC, hospice care, and end-of-life care was performed with the aim to describe the integration of PC into neuro-oncology practice. Results Recently there has been increased interest in the effects of PC and brain tumor patients. The origins, methodology, and conceptual models of delivering PC and how it might be applied to the field of neuro-oncology were reviewed. Patterns of referral and utilization in neuro-oncology are described based on the findings of a recent survey.

Methods: The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro-ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information.

Part 1: growth factor and Ras signaling pathways", "text": "Brain tumors are a diverse group of malignancies that remain refractory to conventional treatment approaches, including radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Molecular neuro-oncology has now begun to clarify the transformed phenotype of brain tumors and identify oncogenic pathways that may be amenable to targeted therapy. Growth factor signaling pathways are often upregulated in brain tumors and may contribute to oncogenesis through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Excessive growth factor receptor stimulation can also lead to overactivity of the Ras signaling pathway, which is frequently aberrant in brain tumors. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antireceptor monoclonal antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides are targeted approaches under investigation as methods to regulate aberrant growth factor signaling pathways in brain tumors. Several receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®), gefitinib (Iressa®) and erlotinib (Tarceva®), have entered clinical trials for high-grade glioma patients. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors, such as tipifarnib (Zarnestra®), which impair processing of proRas and inhibit the Ras signaling pathway, have also entered clinical trials for patients with malignant gliomas. Further development of targeted therapies and evaluation of these new agents in clinical trials will be needed to improve survival and quality of life of patients with brain tumors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1586/14737140.3.5.595", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2064325114", "source": "openalex"}

Currently, a significant clinical challenge in neuro-oncology is to tailor therapies for patients based on a priori knowledge of their survival outcome or treatment response to conventional or experimental therapies. Radiomics or the quantitative extraction of subvisual data from conventional radiographic imaging has recently emerged as a powerful data-driven approach to offer insights into clinically relevant questions related to diagnosis, prediction, prognosis, as well as assessing treatment response. Furthermore, radiogenomic approaches provide a mechanism to establish statistical correlations of radiomic features with point mutations and next-generation sequencing data to further leverage the potential of routine MRI scans to serve as “virtual biopsy” maps. In this review, we provide an introduction to radiomic and radiogenomic approaches in neuro-oncology, including a brief description of the workflow involving preprocessing, tumor segmentation, and extraction of “hand-crafted” features from the segmented region of interest, as well as identifying radiogenomic associations that could ultimately lead to the development of reliable prognostic and predictive models in neuro-oncology applications. Lastly, we discuss the promise of radiomics and radiogenomic approaches in personalizing treatment decisions in neuro-oncology, as well as the challenges with clinical adoption, which will rely heavily on their demonstrated resilience to nonstandardization in imaging protocols across sites and scanners, as well as in their ability to demonstrate reproducibility across large multi-institutional cohorts.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/noajnl/vdaa148", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3122013445", "source": "openalex"}

The diseases encompassed in the neuro-oncology field and our understanding of them have increased rapidly during the past 30 years. In part, progress has been driven by technological achievements in neuroimaging, in particular, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. These advances have allowed unprecedented opportunities to view the anatomy and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS) and, to an extent, portions of the peripheral nervous system that could be affected by cancer or its treatment. Clear gains have occurred in diagnostic accuracy, neurosurgical safety, ease of tumor resection, and safer and more accurate radiotherapy. After carmustine chemotherapy was introduced in the late 1960s, neurosurgeons and a new breed of physician, the neuro-oncologist, investigated the clinical benefits of an increasing number of anticancer agents against gliomas, medulloblastomas, and metastatic tumors in the CNS. In parallel, another sector of neuro-oncology developed that was more closely allied with neurology.

The diagnosis of Lyme disease usually is based on several clinical criteria, with supportive data from laboratory testing. The presence of the bullseye skin lesion, erythema migrans, is the single pathognomonic criterion. In the 20 years since the initial description of Lyme disease in the United States, B. burgdorferi has been implicated as an etiologic agent in numerous ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic syndromes, involving most structures from the cornea to the cranial nerves. Neuro-ophthalmic and ocular manifestations of Lyme disease include meningitis with papilledema, cranial neuropathies, follicular conjunctivitis, nummular keratitis, and intraocular inflammation. Although an association with Lyme disease has been purported for numerous other syndromes, a definite causal relationship has not been proved in many cases. During a period of rapidly increasing awareness of Lyme disease, a high index of suspicion and poorly defined criteria for its presence have resulted in over-diagnosis of Lyme disease. In the authors' experience, the incorrect diagnosis of Lyme disease initially has been made in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, keratoconus, morning glory syndrome, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, CNS lymphoma, paraneoplastic syndrome, multiple sclerosis, sarcoid, syphilis, and functional illness.

Neuropathological data derived from both SuS patients and a newly-developed transgenic mouse model recapitulating the disease indicate that CTLs adhere to CNS microvessels in distinct areas and polarize granzyme B, which most likely results in the observed endothelial cell injury and microhemorrhages.

However, the variety of blast sources and the complexity of blast wave biophysics have made data on injury mechanisms and biomarkers difficult to analyze and compare. Recently, we showed the importance of rat position towards blast generated by an external shock tube. In this study, we further characterized blast producing moderate TBI and defined 'composite' blast and primary blast exposure set-ups. Schlieren optics visualized interaction between the head and a shock wave generated by external shock tube, revealing strong head acceleration upon positioning the rat on-axis with the shock tube (composite blast), but negligible skull movement upon peak overpressure exposure off-axis (primary blast). Brain injury signatures of a primary blast hitting the frontal head were assessed and compared to damage produced by composite blast. Low to negligible levels of neurodegeneration were found following primary blast compared to composite blast by silver staining. However, persistent gliosis in hippocampus and accumulation of GFAP/CNPase in circulation was detected after both primary and composite blast. Also, markers of vascular/endothelial inflammation integrin alpha/beta, sICAM, and L-selectin along with neurotrophic factor NGF-beta were increased in serum within 6 hours post-blasts and persisted for 7 days thereafter. In contrast, systemic IL-1, IL-10, fractalkine, neuroendocrine peptide Orexin A, and VEGF receptor Neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) were raised predominantly after primary blast exposure. In conclusion, biomarkers of major pathological pathways were elevated at all blast setups. The most significant and persistent changes in neuro-glial markers were found after composite blast, while primary blast instigated prominent systemic cytokine/chemokine, Orexin A, and Neuropilin-2 release, particularly when primary blast impacted rats with unprotected body.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2012.00015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2108560309", "source": "openalex"}

Five criteria for future conduct of clinical trials are proposed. The usefulness of animal models for traumatic brain injury and their ability are discussed. Clearly, it is now becoming accepted that mechanism-driven trials, in which individual pathophysiological mechanisms are targeted, may be preferable in this heterogeneous patient population. The degree of brain penetration, the safety and tolerability of the compound, and end points used for outcome assessment are major influences upon the success of these trials.

RA remains a major clinical problem with the development of several new therapies targeted at cytokine inhibition in recent years. In RA, biologic therapies targeted at inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have been shown to reduce joint inflammation, limit erosive change, reduce disability and improve quality of life. The cytokine TNFα has a central role in systemic RA inflammation and has also been shown to have pro-inflammatory effects in the brain. Emerging data suggests there is an important bidirectional communication between the brain and immune system in inflammatory conditions like RA. Recent work has shown how TNF inhibitor therapy in people with RA is protective for Alzheimer's disease. Functional MRI studies to measure brain activation in people with RA to stimulus by finger joint compression, have also shown that those who responded to TNF inhibition showed a significantly greater activation volume in thalamic, limbic, and associative areas of the brain than non-responders. Infections are the main risk of therapies with biologic drugs and infections have been shown to be related to disease flares in RA. Recent basic science data has also emerged suggesting that bacterial components including lipopolysaccharide induce pain by directly activating sensory neurons that modulate inflammation, a previously unsuspected role for the nervous system in host-pathogen interactions. In this review, we discuss the current evidence for neuro-inflammation as an important factor that impacts on disease persistence and pain in RA.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2014.00357", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1999701352", "source": "openalex"}

Although biomaterial implantation that mimics native skeletal tissue is extensively studied, the nerve-vascular network reconstruction is neglected in the design of biomaterials. Our goal here is to establish a periosteum-simulating bilayer hydrogel and explore the efficiency of bone repair via enhancement of angiogenesis and neurogenesis. In this contribution, we designed a bilayer hydrogel platform incorporated with magnesium-ion-modified black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets for promoting neuro-vascularized bone regeneration. Specifically, we incorporated magnesium-ion-modified black phosphorus (BP@Mg) nanosheets into gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to prepare the upper hydrogel, whereas the bottom hydrogel was designed as a double-network hydrogel system, consisting of two interpenetrating polymer networks composed of GelMA, PEGDA, and β-TCP nanocrystals. The magnesium ion modification process was developed to enhance BP nanosheet stability and provide a sustained release platform for bioactive ions. Our results demonstrated that the upper layer of hydrogel provided a bionic periosteal structure, which significantly facilitated angiogenesis via induction of endothelial cell migration and presented multiple advantages for the upregulation of nerve-related protein expression in neural stem cells (NSCs). Moreover, the bottom layer of the hydrogel significantly promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) activity and osteogenic differentiation. We next employed the bilayer hydrogel structure to correct rat skull defects. Based on our radiological and histological examinations, the bilayer hydrogel scaffolds markedly enhanced early vascularization and neurogenesis, which prompted eventual bone regeneration and remodeling.

This heterogeneity has been the source of significant clinical challenges facing patients with GBM and has hampered the drive toward more precision or personalized medicine approaches to treating these challenging tumors. Over the last two decades, the field of Mathematical Neuro-oncology has grown out of desire to use (often patient-specific) mathematical modeling to better treat GBMs. Here, we will focus on a series of clinically relevant results using patient-specific mathematical modeling. The core model at the center of these results incorporates two hallmark features of GBM, proliferation [Formula: see text] and invasion (D), as key parameters. Based on routinely obtained magnetic resonance images, each patient's tumor can be characterized using these two parameters. The Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model uses [Formula: see text] and D to create patient-specific growth predictions. The PI model, its predictions, and parameters have been used in a number of ways to derive biological insight. Beyond predicting growth, the PI model has been utilized to identify patients who benefit from different surgery strategies, to prognosticate response to radiation therapy, to develop a treatment response metric, and to connect clinical imaging features and genetic information.

Second, to test the hypothesis that dizziness in patients without abnormal neuro-otologic findings would be induced by psychiatric disorders rather than by unnoticed neuro-otologic diseases. Nineteen patients with neuro-otologic diseases (Group I) and 22 patients in whom standard vestibular tests revealed no abnormal findings (Group II) were treated by fluvoxamine (200 mg/day) for eight weeks. Subjective handicaps due to dizziness using a questionnaire, anxiety and depressive symptoms measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and stress hormones (vasopressin and cortisol) were examined before and 8 weeks after treatment. Overall, fluvoxamine decreased subjective handicaps of both Groups I and II. Fluvoxamine decreased HADS of only patients whose subjective handicaps were reduced (=responders) in both groups, suggesting that fluvoxamine was effective for dizziness via psychiatric action rather than a recovery of vestibular function through serotonergic activation. In non-responders of Group II, pre-treatment HADS was higher than in Group I non-responders and it was not decreased by the treatment, suggesting that dizziness of Group II non-responders was due to severe psychiatric disorders rather than unnoticed neuro-otologic diseases. Anxiety and depression components of HADS showed a good correlation at both pre- and post-treatment periods. No post-therapeutic decrease was observed in either vasopressin or cortisol even in responders, suggesting that dizziness was not the sole cause of stress in chronic dizziness patients. In conclusion, patients with or without physical neuro-otologic deficits who report chronic dizziness accompanied by anxiety and depression (as measured by HADS) showed improvements across a full range of subjective handicaps and psychological distress, while patients with physical neuro-otologic defects and minimal anxiety or depression did not benefit. The main causes of dizziness in patients without physical neuro-otologic findings were psychiatric disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3233/ves-2007-17101", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2119020616", "source": "openalex"}

These compounds can be divided into two groups, i.e. competitive inhibitors with respect to ubiquinone, such as piericidine A, and non-competitive inhibitors such as rotenone. Complex I inhibitors such as MPP(+) have been reported to induce anatomical, behavioral, and biochemical changes similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuro-degeneration. Spectroscopic analyses and structure-activity relationship studies have indicated that the V-shaped structure of the rotenone molecule is critical for binding to the rotenone binding site on complex I. Many isoquinoline derivatives, some of them endogenous, are also complex I inhibitors. Many lines of evidence show that complex I inhibitors elicit neuronal cell death. Recently, it was reported that chronic and systemic exposure to low-dose rotenone reproduces the features of Parkinson's disease. This work further focused attention on compounds acting on mitochondria, such as MPP(+). In Guadeloupe, the French West Indies, patients with atypical parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear palsy are frequently encountered. These diseases seem to be associated with ingestion of tropical herbal teas or tropical fruits of the Annonaceae family, which contain complex I inhibitors such as benzylisoquinoline derivatives and acetogenins. Complex I inhibitors may not simply result in reactive oxygen species generation or ATP exhaustion, but may influence complex downstream signal transduction processes.

But it is unknown whether Ipt is beneficial to therapy of depression by modulating neurogenesis and neuro-inflammation.

The exact anatomical interaction between the vagus nerve and the intestinal immune system remains however a matter of debate. In the present study, we provide additional evidence on the direct and indirect vagal innervation of the spleen and analyzed the anatomical evidence for neuroimmune modulation of macrophages by vagal preganglionic and enteric postganglionic nerve fibers within the intestine. Methods Dextran conjugates were used to label vagal preganglionic (motor) fibers projecting to the small intestine and spleen. Moreover, identification of the neurochemical phenotype of the vagal efferent fibers and enteric neurons was performed by immunofluorescent labeling. F4/80 antibody was used to label resident macrophages. Results Our anterograde tracing experiments did not reveal dextran-labeled vagal fibers or terminals in the mesenteric ganglion or spleen. Vagal efferent fibers were confined within the myenteric plexus region of the small intestine and mainly endings around nNOS, VIP and ChAT positive enteric neurons. nNOS, VIP and ChAT positive fibers were found in close proximity of intestinal resident macrophages carrying α7 nicotinic receptors. Of note, VIP receptors were found on resident macrophages located in close proximity of VIP positive nerve fibers. Conclusion In the present study, we show that the vagus nerve does not directly interact with resident macrophages in the gut or spleen. Instead, the vagus nerve preferentially interacts with nNOS, VIP and ChAT enteric neurons located within the gut muscularis with nerve endings in close proximity of the resident macrophages.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087785", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1986367298", "source": "openalex"}

Design/methodology/approach Over the last few years in many manufacturing organizations, multiple response optimization problems were resolved using the past experience and engineering judgment, which leads to increase in uncertainty during the decision‐making process. In this paper, a four‐step procedure is proposed to resolve the parameter design problem involving multiple responses. This approach employs the advantage of both artificial intelligence tool (neuro‐fuzzy model) and Taguchi method of experimental design to tackle problems involving multiple responses optimization. Findings The proposed methodology is validated by revisiting a case study to optimize the three responses for a double‐sided surface mount technology of an electronic assembly. Multiple signal‐to‐noise ratios are mapped into a single performance statistic through neuro‐fuzzy based model, to identify the optimal level settings for each parameter. Analysis of variance is finally performed to identify parameters significant to the process. Research limitations/implications The proposed model will be validated in future by conducting a real life case study, where multiple responses need to be optimized simultaneously. Practical implications It is believed that the proposed procedure in this study can resolve a complex parameter design problem with multiple responses. It can be applied to those areas where there are large data sets and a number of responses are to be optimized simultaneously.

Although important for determining the most suitable treatment and optimal management strategy for patients, staging continues to present significant challenges to clinicians. Clinical test results such as the pre-treatment Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) level, the biopsy most common tumor pattern (Primary Gleason pattern) and the second most common tumor pattern (Secondary Gleason pattern) in tissue biopsies, and the clinical T stage can be used by clinicians to predict the pathological stage of cancer. However, not every patient will return abnormal results in all tests. This significantly influences the capacity to effectively predict the stage of prostate cancer. Herein we have developed a neuro-fuzzy computational intelligence model for classifying and predicting the likelihood of a patient having Organ-Confined Disease (OCD) or Extra-Prostatic Disease (ED) using a prostate cancer patient dataset obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network. The system input consisted of the following variables: Primary and Secondary Gleason biopsy patterns, PSA levels, age at diagnosis, and clinical T stage. The performance of the neuro-fuzzy system was compared to other computational intelligence based approaches, namely the Artificial Neural Network, Fuzzy C-Means, Support Vector Machine, the Naive Bayes classifiers, and also the AJCC pTNM Staging Nomogram which is commonly used by clinicians. A comparison of the optimal Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) points that were identified using these approaches, revealed that the neuro-fuzzy system, at its optimal point, returns the largest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), with a low number of false positives (FPR = 0.274, TPR = 0.789, AUC = 0.812). The proposed approach is also an improvement over the AJCC pTNM Staging Nomogram (FPR = 0.032, TPR = 0.197, AUC = 0.582).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155856", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2410444641", "source": "openalex"}

Besides the well-characterized and critical process of local regulation of bone remodeling, achieved by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, recent genetic studies have shown that there is a central control of bone formation, mediated by a neuroendocrine mechanism. This central regulation involves leptin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone that controls body weight, reproduction and bone remodeling, and which binds to and exerts its effect through the cells of the hypothalamic nuclei in the brain. This genetic result in mice is in line with clinical observations in humans and generates a whole new direction of research in bone physiology.

However, such fire alarm systems are sometimes error-prone and can react to non-actual indicators of fire presence classified as false warnings. There is a need for high-quality and intelligent fire alarm systems that use multiple sensor values (such as a signal from a flame detector, humidity, heat, and smoke sensors, etc.) to detect true incidents of fire. An Adaptive neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used in this paper to calculate the maximum likelihood of the true presence of fire and generate fire alert. The novel idea proposed in this paper is to use ANFIS for the identification of a true fire incident by using change rate of smoke, the change rate of temperature, and humidity in the presence of fire. The model consists of sensors to collect vital data from sensor nodes where Fuzzy logic converts the raw data in a linguistic variable which is trained in ANFIS to get the probability of fire occurrence. The proposed idea also generates alerts with a message sent directly to the user's smartphone. Our system uses small size, cost-effective sensors and ensures that this solution is reproducible.

The Enhancement of Emotions via Neuro-Psychopharmacology", "text": "This article will examine how the notion of emotional authenticity is intertwined with the notions of naturalness and artificiality in the context of the recent debates about 'neuro-enhancement' and 'neuro-psychopharmacology.' In the philosophy of mind, the concept of authenticity plays a key role in the discussion of the emotions. There is a widely held intuition that an artificial means will always lead to an inauthentic result. This article, however, proposes that artificial substances do not necessarily result in inauthentic emotions. The literature provided by the philosophy of mind on this subject usually resorts to thought experiments. On the other hand, the recent literature in applied ethics on 'enhancement' provides good reasons to include real world examples. Such case studies reveal that some psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants actually cause people to undergo experiences of authenticity, making them feel 'like themselves' for the first time in their lives. Beginning with these accounts, this article suggests three non-naturalist standards for emotions: the authenticity standard, the rationality standard, and the coherence standard. It argues that the authenticity standard is not always the only valid one, but that the other two ways of assessing emotions are also valid, and that they can even have repercussions on the felt authenticity of emotions. In conclusion, it sketches some of the normative implications if not ethical intricacies that accompany the enhancement of emotions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-010-9075-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2110864333", "source": "openalex"}

Unlike other cells, neurons convey \"hunger\" signals to the vascular network via an intervening layer of glial cells (astrocytes); vessels dilate and release glucose which fuels neuronal firing. Existing computational models focus on only parts of this loop (neuron→astrocyte→vessel→neuron), whereas the proposed model describes the entire loop. Neuronal firing causes release of a neurotransmitter like glutamate which triggers release of vasodilator by astrocytes via a cascade of biochemical events. Vasodilators released from astrocytic endfeet cause blood vessels to dilate and release glucose into the interstitium, part of which is taken up by the astrocyticendfeet. Glucose is converted into lactate in the astrocyte and transported into the neuron. Glucose from the interstitium and lactate (produced from glucose) influx from astrocyte are converted into ATP in the neuron. Neuronal ATP is used to drive the Na+/K+ATPase pumps, which maintain ionic gradients necessary for neuronal firing. When placed in the metabolic loop, the neuron exhibits sustained firing only when the stimulation current is more than a minimum threshold. For various combinations of initial neuronal [ATP] and external current, the neuron exhibits a variety of firing patterns including sustained firing, firing after an initial pause, burst firing etc. Neurovascular interactions under conditions of constricted vessels are also studied. Most models of cerebral circulation describe neurovascular interactions exclusively in the \"forward\" neuron→vessel direction. The proposed model indicates possibility of \"reverse\" influence also, with vasomotion rhythms influencing neural firing patterns. Another idea that emerges out of the proposed work is that brain's computations may be more comprehensively understood in terms of neuro-glial-vascular dynamics and not in terms of neural firing alone.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048802", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2074090413", "source": "openalex"}

Treatment was instituted only in cases of progressive disease or clinical deterioration. Treatment modalities were chemotherapy (based on vincristine/carboplatin) for children younger than 5 years and radiotherapy for all others. Ten boys and 10 girls (seven with a positive family history) entered the trial (median age at diagnosis of OPG, 29 months). At a median follow-up time of 78 months, seven patients had been treated with chemotherapy only, four with radiotherapy, and four with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Five patients were observed only. Currently, 18 are alive and two have died. Eight patients were treated for progressive visual loss in the face of stable disease, five for tumor volume increase without visual deterioration, and two for symptomatic tumor volume increase. At referral, six children had a visual acuity (VA) of < 30% in both eyes; eight children had 100% VA bilaterally. At referral, the visual field (VF) could be assessed in three children: One had VF loss in both eyes, one had VF loss in one eye, and one had normal VF. At last follow-up, eight children had VA < 20% in both eyes; only two children had 100% VA in both eyes. Among 11 children who had some visual function, three had VF loss in one eye and three in both eyes, and five had an intact VF. Contrast and color sensitivity were abnormal in seven and six patients, respectively. Thirteen children fell into the WHO hypovision category.

Therefore, we aimed to study the association between the use of antihypertensive drugs and CRPS onset. We conducted a population-based case-control study in the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database in the Netherlands. Cases were identified from electronic records (1996–2005) and included if they were confirmed during an expert visit (using IASP criteria), or if they had been diagnosed by a medical specialist. Up to four controls per cases were selected, matched on gender, age, calendar time, and injury. Exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics was assessed from the automated prescription records. Data were analyzed using multivariate conditional logistic regression. A total of 186 cases were matched to 697 controls (102 confirmed during an expert visit plus 84 with a specialist diagnosis). Current use of ACE inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of CRPS (ORadjusted: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1–6.8).

Different from designing controllers using the time-triggering mechanism, the event-triggered controller is updated only when the system state deviates more than a certain threshold from a prescribed value. To obtain the event-triggered optimal controller, we develop an identifier-critic architecture under the framework of reinforcement learning. The identifier network, composed of a feedforward neural network (FNN), aims to derive the knowledge of unknown system dynamics, and the critic network, constituted of an FNN, intends to derive the event-triggered optimal controller. The identifier network is tuned via the combination of a standard back-propagation algorithm and an e-modification method, and the critic network is updated using a modification of the gradient descent method. By introducing an additional stability term to update the critic network, the initial admissible control is no longer required. Meanwhile, by using historical and instantaneous state data together, the persistence of excitation condition is relaxed. A stability analysis of the closed-loop system is provided based on the Lyapunov method.

At the outset, this concept is applied to a simple device such as thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) connected in a single-machine infinite bus power system and is then extended to interline power-flow controller (IPFC) connected in a multimachine power system. The RBFNN uses single neuron architecture and its parameters are dynamically updated in an online fashion with TS-fuzzy scheme designed with only four rules and triangular membership function. The rules of the TS-fuzzy scheme are derived from the real- or reactive-power error and their derivatives either at the TCSC or IPFC buses depending on the device. Further, to implement this combined scheme only one coefficient in the TS-fuzzy rules needs to be optimized. The optimization of this coefficient as well as the coefficient for auxiliary signal generation is performed through genetic algorithm. The performance of the new controller is evaluated in single-machine and multimachine power systems subjected to various transient disturbances. The new genetic-neuro-fuzzy control scheme exhibits a superior damping performance as well as a greater critical clearing time in comparison to the existing PI and RBFNN controller with updating of its parameters through the extended Kalman filter (EKF).

We have revealed that AM promotes not only vasodilation but also vascular regeneration. In this study, we focused on the roles of AM in the ischemic brain and examined its therapeutic potential. We developed novel AM-transgenic (AM-Tg) mice that overproduce AM in the liver and performed middle cerebral artery occlusion for 20 min (20m-MCAO) to examine the effects of AM on degenerative or regenerative processes in ischemic brain. The infarct area and gliosis after 20m-MCAO was reduced in AM-Tg mice in association with suppression of leukocyte infiltration, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the ischemic core. In addition, vascular regeneration and subsequent neurogenesis were enhanced in AM-Tg mice, preceded by increase in mobilization of CD34+ mononuclear cells, which can differentiate into endothelial cells. The vasculo-neuro-regenerative actions observed in AM-Tg mice in combination with neuroprotection resulted in improved recovery of motor function. Brain edema was also significantly reduced in AM-Tg mice via suppression of vascular permeability. In vitro, AM exerted direct antiapoptotic and neurogenic actions on neuronal cells. Exogenous administration of AM in mice after 20m-MCAO also reduced the infarct area, and promoted vascular regeneration and functional recovery. In summary, this study suggests the neuroprotective and vasculo-neuro-regenerative roles of AM and provides basis for a new strategy to rescue ischemic brain through its multiple hormonal actions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2005-1038", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150922547", "source": "openalex"}

The comprehensive details of each class along with the explanation of every parameter are provided, and the dynamics of novel COVID-19 are represented by calculating the solution of the mathematical SITR system using feed-forward artificial neural networks (FF-ANNs) trained with global search genetic algorithms (GAs) and speedy fine tuning by sequential quadratic programming (SQP)—that is, an FF-ANN-GASQP scheme. In the proposed FF-ANN-GASQP method, the objective function is formulated in the mean squared error sense using the approximate differential mapping of FF-ANNs for the SITR model, and learning of the networks is proficiently conducted with the integrated capabilities of GA and SQP. The correctness, stability, and potential of the proposed FF-ANN-GASQP scheme for the four different cases are established through comparative assessment study from the results of numerical computing with Adams solver for single as well as multiple autonomous trials.

The proposed machine learning algorithms combine neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) with future trip information to effectively estimate the expected future energy cost (expected cost-to-go) for a given vehicle state and control actions. The convergences of these learning algorithms were demonstrated on both fixed and randomly selected drive cycles.

Automatic medical image classification is a progressive area in image classification, and it is expected to be more developed in the future. Because of this fact, automatic diagnosis can assist pathologists by providing second opinions and reducing their workload. This paper reviews the application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a classifier in medical image classification during the past 16 years. ANFIS is a fuzzy inference system (FIS) implemented in the framework of an adaptive fuzzy neural network. It combines the explicit knowledge representation of an FIS with the learning power of artificial neural networks. The objective of ANFIS is to integrate the best features of fuzzy systems and neural networks. A brief comparison with other classifiers, main advantages and drawbacks of this classifier are investigated.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.4103/2228-7477.108171", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1494636597", "source": "openalex"}

The hybrid model consists of two components: a fuzzy C-means (FCM) method, which classifies traffic flow patterns into a couple of clusters, and a radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network, which develops forecasting models associated with each cluster. The new hybrid model was compared with previously developed clustering-based RBF models. In addition, the dynamic linear model was studied for comparison. The study results showed that the clustering-based hybrid method did not produce time-lag phenomena, whereas the dynamic linear model and the RBF model without clustering revealed apparent time-lag phenomena. The forecasting performance for freeway traffic volumes from the San Antonio, Texas, TransGuide system shows that even though the hybrid of the FCM and RBF models appears to be promising, additional research efforts should be devoted to achieving more reliable traffic forecasting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3141/1802-21", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2129308996", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2008475222", "title": "NEURO‐MUSCULAR TRANSMISSION IN INVERTEBRATES", "text": "Summary 1. This article deals principally with recent experimental work on crustacean nerve‐muscle systems. A number of observations have been made which are likely to affect our views of synaptic function in vertebrates. Neuro‐muscular transmission in Crustacea, and possibly other invertebrate animals, involves three factors which in vertebrates are regarded as characteristic properties of reflex centres: convergence of excitatory impulses from different nerve fibres on to one effector cell, prolonged facilitation of motor impulses, and interplay of excitatory and inhibitory impulses. It can now be regarded as established that different nerve fibres supplying the same muscle fibres are responsible for inhibition of contraction, and for fast and slow types of facilitation (Wiersma, 1941). 2. Many invertebrate motor systems are distinguished by the extremely small number of nerve axons which supply large and powerful muscles. The question arises how the speed and strength of such muscles is regulated. In vertebrates regulation is brought about by a play of numerous motor units, involving within each unit a ‘non‐stop’ transmission from the motor nerve cell to the ends of the muscle fibres. This mechanism would not permit fine gradation in muscles which are only provided with one or two motor axons. Two types of invertebrate motor systems have been described: ( a ) Certain specialized muscles, e.g. the ‘jet‐propelling’ mantle muscle of cephalopods, which act as units, and, like the vertebrate heart or the electric organ, invariably give a maximum response. ( b ) Many other muscles, e.g. in all crustacean limbs, which are capable of extremely fine gradation, despite their sparse nerve supply. In these latter muscles, the motor unit response has been broken down into much smaller ‘quanta’ by means of a barrier system and of facilitation at the nerve‐muscle junctions. 3. The nature of neuro‐muscular facilitation in arthropods is discussed. There are certain analogies with partly curarized vertebrate muscle, in the existence of junctional barriers in both cases, which can be overcome by the summated action of several successive nerve impulses. There are, however, some important differences. In curarized vertebrate muscle, facilitation involves the recruitment of an increasing number of muscle fibres, each of which contributes a propagated maximum response. In normal crustacean muscle, facilitation can occur in the absence of any propagated muscle impulses and is then due to a progressive growth of local electrical and mechanical responses in the vicinity of the nerve endings. Electric recording reveals the existence of ‘end‐plate potentials’ (e.p.p.'s) which increase in size with each successive motor nerve impulse, and, at high rates of stimulation, summate to a plateau several times higher than their initial amplitude. These non‐propagated action potentials are accompanied by a local contraction whose rate and strength can be controlled continuously by the number and frequency of the motor impulses. 4. In addition to these graded local responses, crustacean muscle fibres can be thrown into propagated activity, both by direct and by nerve stimulation. If the frequency of the motor nerve impulses is raised, e.p.p.'s summate and at a certain level propagated spike potentials are initiated, associated with vigorous twitches of the whole muscle fibres. Thus, the motor response in Crustacea is either local or propagated, depending upon the rate of the nerve impulses. Both kinds of response have been observed in the excised limb as well as in situ. 5. There are enormous differences in the rate and power of facilitation in different muscles. Fast and slow systems have been distinguished, according as facilitation of e.p.p.'s takes several milliseconds or about one second to complete. Many muscle fibres receive branches of two motor axons, one providing a fast, the other a slow facilitation system. Thus, the rate and intensity of a muscle fibre response can be regulated, not only by the number and frequency of nerve impukes, but also by a ‘switching’ of axons. 6. If the inhibitory nerve fibre is stimulated in the absence of motor activity, no electrical or mechanical change can be detected in the muscle. The inhibitory impulse is capable of breaking the transmission of motor activity at two separate stages: (a) between the motor nerve impulse and the production of the e.p.p. (a‐action), and (V) between the e.p.p. and the local contraction of the muscle (j3‐action). The two effects can be dissociated by varying the time interval between motor and inhibitory impulses. If the inhibitory impulse precedes the motor by a few milliseconds, it interferes with the production of the e.p.p. The inhibitory impulse can be made to arrive too late to affect the e.p.p. and yet in time to prevent local contraction. In both cases, the inhibitory influence is restricted to the vicinity of the motor nerve endings. Once a propagated impulse has been initiated in the muscle fibre, it cannot be stopped by an inhibitory impulse, and a twitch invariably occurs. 7. Certain gaps and controversial matters in our present evidence are discussed. (a) The relative functional importance of local and propagated responses in invertebrate muscle remains to be cleared up. (b) The relation between structure and function of the various types of nerve‐muscle contacts in Crustacea, and their distribution within individual muscle fibres, require much further investigation, (c) In Crustacea as well as in many other invertebrate animals there is as yet no information about the nature of the processes, or chemical agents, involved in the facilitation and production of the ‘end‐plate potential’ and the two inhibitory mechanisms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-185x.1949.tb00568.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2008475222", "source": "openalex"}

In this method firstly, four different filter indexes are applied on extracted features from steering wheel data. After that, output values of each filter index are imported as inputs to a fuzzy inference system to determine the importance degree of each feature and select the most important features. Then, the selected features are imported to a support vector machine (SVM) for binary classification to classify the driving conditions in two classes of drowsy and awake. Finally, the classifier accuracy is exploited to adjust parameters of an adaptive fuzzy system using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The experimental data were collected from about 20.5 h of driving in the simulator. The results show that the drowsiness detection system is working with a high accuracy and also confirm that this method is more accurate than the recent available algorithms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s19040943", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2915964483", "source": "openalex"}

This paperback version is hardly compact. But at 487 pages, it is shorter than the previous paperback edition published in 2007. The first author, Neil R. Miller, MD, remains on top.

They are appropriately given credit. As in the previous editions, the authors have jettisoned the bibliography and the many case examples. They are aiming at a teaching text and have succeeded marvelously. What makes this book a top choice? First, the authors have again performed a superb job of presenting the principles of examination. Second, the writing is fluid. Not having tons of references and case citations to interrupt the flow makes the text read more like a story. Of course, the reader must accept the authors' often overarching assertions, but then these are brilliant neuro-ophthalmologists with a track record of solid contributions to the field.

Most of the clinical photographs and cartoons come from the host institution. Where they needed illustrations from elsewhere, they have chosen the classics.

During the past decade, it has become apparent that even blast injury as a form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may lead to multiple different adverse outcomes, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms and long-term cognitive disability. Blast injury is characterized by blast overpressure (BOP), blast duration, and blast impulse. While the blast injuries of a victim close to the explosion will be severe, majority of victims are usually at a distance leading to milder form described as mild blast TBI (mbTBI). A major feature of mbTBI is its complex manifestation occurring in concert at different organ levels involving systemic, cerebral, neuronal and neuropsychiatric responses; some of which are shared with other forms of brain trauma such as acute brain injury and other neuropsychiatric disorders such as PTSD. The pathophysiology of blast injury exposure involves complex cascades of chronic psychological stress, autonomic dysfunction and neuro/systemic inflammation. These factors render blast injury as an arduous challenge in terms of diagnosis and treatment as well as identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers distinguishing mTBI from other non-TBI pathologies and from neuropsychiatric disorders with similar symptoms. This is due to the \"distinct\" but shared and partially identified biochemical pathways and neuro-histopathological changes that might be linked to behavioral deficits observed.

In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the involvement of the gut microbiota in the modulation of multiple neurochemical pathways through the highly interconnected gut-brain axis. Although amazing scientific breakthroughs over the last few years have expanded our knowledge on the communication between microbes and their hosts, the underpinnings of microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk remain to be determined. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main metabolites produced in the colon by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers and resistant starch, are speculated to play a key role in neuro-immunoendocrine regulation. However, the underlying mechanisms through which SCFAs might influence brain physiology and behavior have not been fully elucidated. In this review, we will outline the current knowledge about the involvement of SCFAs in microbiota-gut-brain interactions. We will also highlight how the development of future treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders can take advantage of the intimate and mutual interactions of the gut microbiota with the brain by exploring the role of SCFAs in the regulation of neuro-immunoendocrine function.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3003912482", "source": "openalex"}

Recent Findings Advanced MRI techniques including perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and MR chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) offer significant advantages over conventional MR imaging when evaluating tumor extent, predicting grade, and assessing treatment response. PET performed in addition to advanced MRI provides complementary information regarding tumor metabolic properties, particularly when performed simultaneously. 18 F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET improves the specificity of tumor diagnosis and evaluation of post-treatment changes. Incorporation of radiogenomics and machine learning methods further improve advanced imaging.

This article review recent evidence outlining the clinical presentation of acute central and peripheral dizzy syndromes and suggest when clinicians may consider acute neuro-imaging.Recent evidence highlights the difficulty that acute vertigo may sometimes pose to the clinician. For example, migrainous vertigo may have oculomotor abnormalities suggestive of either central neurological or peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Furthermore, vertebrobasilar stroke syndromes may mimic peripheral disorders such as vestibular neuritis, or when there is hearing involvement may be misdiagnosed as Meniere's disease. In addition to the need for identifying serious conditions in acute vertigo, recent evidence suggests that early steroid treatment in vestibular neuritis may improve long term outcome. Further trials regarding symptomatic outcome are required, however, before routine use of steroids can be recommended in this condition.Recent findings have not made the assessment of acute vertigo any easier for the nonspecialist. Although the commonest vertigo syndromes are benign, serious conditions such as stroke may masquerade as a peripheral labyrinthine disorder and conversely benign conditions such as migrainous vertigo may have clinical characteristics of central disorders.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W1975403441", "title": "gp130 cytokine signaling in the pituitary gland: a paradigm for cytokine–neuro-endocrine pathways", "text": "Unlike most other classes of receptors, where the cytoplasmic domain is necessary for signal transduction, receptors for IL-6 and other related cytokines signal solely by virtue of their ability to form a larger receptor complex with a common subunit, the transmembrane glycoprotein gp130 (1). For instance, binding of IL-6 to IL-6Rα, the α subunit of the functional receptor, triggers the association of IL-6Rα with gp130 (1, 2). Indeed, even a soluble form of IL-6Rα, entirely lacking the intracellular region of the protein, can bind to its ligand and to surface-expressed gp130, producing a normal IL-6 signal (1). The ligands of these various receptors are therefore referred to as the gp130 cytokine receptor family. As summarized in Figure ​Figure1,1, gp130 functions as a common cytokine signal transducer for IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotropin-1 (CT-1), all of which bind specific receptors (their α subunits) but use the gp130 protein as the initial cellular signal transducer (2, 3). Because of this broad physiological role, the term gp130 is commonly used, in addition to its official human genome organization (HUGO) designation as the IL-6 signal transducer, or IL6ST. Figure 1 Schematic model of the IL-6/gp130 receptor system. The specific cytokine-binding subunits and gp130 belong to a cytokine receptor superfamily characterized by four positionally conserved cysteine residues and a WSXWS motif. Functional receptor complexes ... The human gp130 consists of an extracellular domain of 597 amino acids, with a single transmembrane domain of 22 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 277 amino acids. As with other hemopoietic cytokine receptors, gp130 contains a cytokine receptor homology region that includes fibronectin type III domains as well as four positionally conserved cysteine residues and a WSXWS motif (1, 3) (Figure ​(Figure1).1). While the expression of the gp130 cDNA alone does not confer the binding of IL-6 or the other family cytokines, gp130 and IL-6Ra together form a high-affinity IL-6 binding site. In the mouse, gp130 is ubiquitously expressed in adult organs, as well as in embryonic stem cells and in embryos as early as day 6 of gestation (3). Expression of gp130 therefore does not parallel that of the α subunit of any of the receptors of the cytokine family, nor of any specific cytokine of the IL-6 family. These factors show some functional redundancy in the immune, hematopoietic, nervous, and neuro-endocrine systems. For example, macrophage differentiation, expression of acute-phase proteins by hepatocytes, and neuronal survival and differentiation can all be induced by multiple gp130 cytokines. Conversely, as is extensively reviewed in refs. 3–5, these cytokines also exhibit specific biological activities. Considering that gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, the time and place at which gp130 functions in vivo appears to be determined by spatially and temporally regulated expression of specific cytokine-binding receptor chains or of the cytokines themselves. In addition, soluble gp130, probably translated from an alternative spliced mRNA, can neutralize receptor signaling complexes, thereby acting as an antagonist (6). Below, I discuss the regulation of cytokine and cytokine receptor function in the pituitary gland and its importance for neuro-endocrine–stress responses.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci14660", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975403441", "source": "openalex"}

This review coalesces current literature on the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of sarcoidosis and discusses the epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of this disease. Recent findings Recent investigations strongly identify a genetic component as well as a host of candidate antigenic triggers. Certain human leukocyte antigen polymorphisms may influence not only the susceptibility of individuals to sarcoidosis but also the course of the disease. Diagnostic advances include the finding of two additional potential biomarkers of sarcoidosis as well as the use of positron emission tomography technology in localization of disease sites for biopsy.

Genome‐wide association analyses were performed using PLINK. SNP‐heritability and SNP‐genetic correlations with ADHD in Caucasians were estimated with genome‐wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). Pathway analyses were performed using the Interval enRICHment Test (INRICH), the Disease Association Protein–Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE), and the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT). We did not find genome‐wide significance for single SNPs but did find an increased burden of large, rare CNVs in the ADHD sample ( P = 0.038). SNP‐heritability was estimated to be 0.42 (standard error, 0.13, P = 0.0017) and the SNP‐genetic correlation with European Ancestry ADHD samples was 0.39 (SE 0.15, P = 0.0072).

The distal pivot point of the flap is designed at the lowest septocutaneous perforator from the peroneal artery of the posterolateral septum, which is, on average, 5 cm (4–7 cm) above the lateral malleolus. A longer neuro-veno-adipofascial pedicle would be needed to reversely reach the distal foot defect when the flap is dissected based on this perforating branch, which may result in more trauma in flap elevation and morbidity of the donor site. In this article, we explored new pivot points for this distally based flap in an anatomic study of 30 fresh cadavers. The results showed that the peroneal artery terminates into two branches: the posterior lateral malleolus artery and lateral calcaneal artery. These two branches also send off cutaneous perforators at about 3 and 1 cm above the tip of lateral malleolus, respectively, which can be used as arterial pivot points for the flap. A communicating branch between the lesser saphenous vein and the peroneal venae comitantes was found, accompanied by the perforator of the posterior lateral malleolus artery. This modified, distally based sural flap with lower pivot points was successfully transferred for repair of soft-tissue defects in 21 patients. The size of flaps ranged from 4 × 3 cm to 18 × 12 cm. All flaps survived without complications. Neither arterial ischemia nor venous congestion was noted. In conclusion, the vascular pivot point of a distally based sural flap can be safely designed at 1.5 cm proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus.

A conventional wisdom is that in the brain the quantum fluctuations are self-averaging and thus functionally negligible. However, this intuition might be misleading in the case of non-linear complex systems. Because of an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, in complex systems the microscopic fluctuations may be amplified and thereby affect the system's behavior. In this way quantum dynamics might influence neuronal computations. Accumulating evidence in non-neuronal systems indicates that biological evolution is able to exploit quantum stochasticity. The recent rise of quantum biology as an emerging field at the border between quantum physics and the life sciences suggests that quantum events could play a non-trivial role also in neuronal cells.

The findings suggest that nonspecific histopathology exists in the limbic system, diencephalon, and prefrontal cortex, that the pathology occurs early in development, and that the causative process is inactive long before the diagnosis is made. If these findings are valid and not epiphenomena, then the pathogenesis of schizophrenia does not appear to fit either traditional metabolic, posttraumatic, or neurodegenerative models of adult mental illness. The data are more consistent with a neurodevelopmental model in which a fixed \"lesion\" from early in life interacts with normal brain maturational events that occur much later. Based on neuro-ontological principles and insights from animal research about normal brain development, it is proposed that the appearance of diagnostic symptoms is linked to the normal maturation of brain areas affected by the early developmental pathology, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The course of the illness and the importance of stress may be related to normal maturational aspects of dopaminergic neural systems, particularly those innervating prefrontal cortex.

The control technique is presented and tested in a numerical study that involves two types of building models. The energy of each building is dissipated through magnetorheological (MR) dampers whose damping properties are continuously updated by a fuzzy controller. This semi-active control scheme relies on development of a correlation between accelerations of the building (controller input) and voltage applied to the MR damper (controller output). This correlation forms the basis for development of an intelligent neuro-fuzzy control strategy. To establish a context for assessing the effectiveness of the semi-active control scheme, responses to earthquake excitation are compared with passive strategies that possess similar authority for control. According to numerical simulation, MR dampers are less effective control mechanisms than passive dampers with respect to a single degree of freedom (DOF) building model. On the other hand, MR dampers are predicted to be superior when used with multiple DOF structures for reduction of lateral acceleration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/acc.2001.945866", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112456770", "source": "openalex"}

Forty patients (80 eyes) were evaluated by SWAP and standard automated perimetry. Thirteen patients (26 eyes) had recovered from optic neuritis and/or multiple sclerosis, 15 (30 eyes) were in various stages of treatment for pseudotumor cerebri, and 12 (24 eyes) had other miscellaneous neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. Six additional patients (12 eyes) with neuro-ophthalmologic conditions were tested twice on different days during a 2-week period, with the order of SWAP and standard perimetric testing being reversed on the second day. <h3>Results:</h3> Of the 80 eyes tested, 38 (48%) had SWAP visual fields that were worse than standard automated perimetry results; 29 (36%) showed no difference between standard and SWAP visual fields; and 13 (16%) had standard automated perimetry results that were worse than SWAP visual fields. Of the 26 eyes in patients with optic neuritis and/or multiple sclerosis, 15 (58%) had SWAP results that were worse than standard visual fields. Ten (33%) of the 30 eyes with pseudotumor cerebri had SWAP results worse than standard automated perimetry results, and 13 (54%) of 24 eyes with miscellaneous neuro-ophthalmologic conditions had SWAP results worse than standard automated perimetry results. For the 12 eyes undergoing repeated testing, SWAP visual fields were worse when they were performed last, perhaps indicating that some fatigue effect was present. This was observed for standard visual fields as well, but to a smaller extent. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Preliminary findings suggest that SWAP may be useful in detecting certain neuro-ophthalmologic deficits more readily than standard automated visual field testing, especially for optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis. Further evaluations will be necessary to define the effects of fatigue for SWAP visual fields in neuro-ophthalmologic disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.1995.01100040095033", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991906117", "source": "openalex"}

Aim To investigate the potential utility of FDG PET imaging in the setting of acute neuropathic osteoarthropathy (Charcot's foot). Patients and methods A total of 63 patients, in four groups, were evaluated. The groups were: (A) 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Charcot's neuroarthropathy (11 men, six women; mean age: 59.4±8.6 years); (B) 21 patients with uncomplicated diabetic foot (16 men, five women; mean age: 63±10 years); (C) 20 non-diabetic patients with normal lower extremities (12 men, eight women; mean age 54±19 years); and (D) five patients with proven osteomyelitis secondary to complicated diabetic foot (three men, two women; mean age: 61.2±13.9 years). Five patients in group A had foot ulcer and intermediate to high degree of suspicion for superimposed osteomyelitis. Each subject underwent FDG PET imaging of the lower extremities in addition to MRI and the findings were compared with the final diagnostic outcome based on histopathology and clinical follow-up. The images were examined visually for focal abnormalities. Regions of interest were assigned to the sites of abnormal FDG uptake for calculating maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Two important clinical decision-making issues were explored: (1) whether FDG PET shows a definitive uptake pattern in Charcot's neuroarthropathy and if so whether that could be utilized to differentiate it from other complicated forms of diabetic foot like osteomyelitis and cellulitis, which is frequently a diagnostic challenge in this clinical setting; and (2) how accurate FDG PET is in detection soft tissue infection in patients with Charcot's foot. These issues were examined by utilizing FDG PET findings along with MRI results in the same patient. Results We observed a low degree of diffuse FDG uptake in the Charcot's joints. This was clearly distinguishable from the normal joints. The SUVmax in the Charcot's lesions varied from 0.7 to 2.4 (mean, 1.3±0.4) while those of midfoot of the normal control subjects and the uncomplicated diabetic foot ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 (mean 0.42±0.12) and from 0.2 to 0.8 (mean 0.5±0.16), respectively. The only patient with Charcot's foot with superimposed osteomyelitis had an SUVmax of 6.5. The SUVmax of the sites of osteomyelitis as a complication of diabetic foot was 2.9–6.2 (mean: 4.38±1.39). Unifactorial analysis of variance test yielded a statistical significance in the SUVmax between the four groups (P<0.01). The SUVmax between the normal control groups and the uncomplicated diabetic foot was not statistically significant by the Student's t-test (P>0.05). In the setting of concomitant foot ulcer FDG PET accurately ruled out osteomyelitis. Overall sensitivity and accuracy of FDG PET in the diagnosis of Charcot's foot was 100 and 93.8%, respectively; and for MRI were 76.9 and 75%, respectively. FDG PET showed foci of abnormally enhanced uptake in the soft tissue which was suggestive of inflammation in seven cases (43.75%) which were proven pathologically to be secondary to infection. In only two of these cases the features of soft tissue infection were noted on the magnetic resonance images. Conclusion The results support a valuable role of FDG PET in the setting of Charcot's neuroarthropathy by reliably differentiating it from osteomyelitis both in general and when foot ulcer is present.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0b013e328174447f", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027674498", "source": "openalex"}

The accuracy of ANFIS–SC method is compared with two other ANFIS methods embedded with fuzzy C-mean clustering and grid partitioning (ANFIS–FCM and ANFIS–GP). The decisive factors on the abutment scour hole depth include the ratio of the average diameter of particle size to abutment transverse length (d50/l), excess Froude number of the abutment (Fe), shape factor (Ks), and the ratio of approach stream depth to abutment transverse length (h/l). Eleven different input combinations were evaluated with four, three, and two input variables to survey the effect of each dimensionless parameter on the abutment scour depth.

This paper presents the design and application of a novel transductive neuro-fuzzy inference method to control force in a high-performance drilling process. The main goal is to study, analyze, and verify the behavior of a transductive neuro-fuzzy inference system for controlling this complex process, specifically addressing the dynamic modeling, computational efficiency, and viability of the real-time application of this algorithm as well as assessing the topology of the neuro-fuzzy system (e.g., number of clusters, number of rules). A transductive reasoning method is used to create local neuro-fuzzy models for each input/output data set in a case study. The direct and inverse dynamics of a complex process are modeled using this strategy. The synergies among fuzzy, neural, and transductive strategies are then exploited to deal with process complexity and uncertainty through the application of the neuro-fuzzy models within an internal model control (IMC) scheme. A comparative study is made of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and the suggested method inspired in a transductive neuro-fuzzy inference strategy. The two neuro-fuzzy strategies are evaluated in a real drilling force control problem. The experimental results demonstrated that the transductive neuro-fuzzy control system provides a good transient response (without overshoot) and better error-based performance indices than the ANFIS-based control system. In particular, the IMC system based on a transductive neuro-fuzzy inference approach reduces the influence of the increase in cutting force that occurs as the drill depth increases, reducing the risk of rapid tool wear and catastrophic tool breakage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnn.2010.2050602", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2150397584", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this review is to draw the different strands together to produce an overview describing the clinical presentation of immune-mediated inner-ear disorders and to discuss useful diagnostic criteria with a focus on tissue-specific and tissue-non-specific antibodies.The importance of diagnosing an immune-mediated inner-ear disorder is highlighted in the context of it being one of few forms of treatable inner-ear disorder with a good response to immunosuppressive therapy. Due to a lack of reliable tests, the criteria upon which the diagnosis of immune-mediated inner-ear disease is based are often arbitrary. Previous and current research focuses mainly on the investigation of the aetiology of immune-mediated disorders, studying the presence of autoantibodies and the antigens responsible for their production. The prognostic and therapeutic values of inner-ear-specific antibodies are still unclear. Various antigens have been suggested. However, most antigens identified have been ubiquitous proteins not specific to the inner ear and therefore lack logical association with localized inner-ear pathology.Early diagnosis of immune-mediated inner-ear disorders with prompt treatment may prevent irreversible damage to inner-ear structures. Accordingly, it is important to include immune-mediated inner-ear disorders in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with 'idiopathic' audiovestibular dysfunction. To enable early diagnosis, we recommend that the current available routine immunological laboratory tests (antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antiendothelial cell, antiphospholipid/anticardiolipin and antithyroid antibodies) are used when assessing a patient with suspected immune-mediated inner-ear disorder.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.wco.0000194143.02171.46", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1968698545", "source": "openalex"}

Lidar data gives a sequence of laser backscatter intensities obtained from laser shots generated from an airborne object at various altitudes above the earth surface. Lidar data is pre-filtered to remove high frequency noise. As the Lidar shots are taken from above the earth surface, it has some air backscatter information, which is of no importance for detecting underwater objects. Because of these, the air backscatter information is eliminated from the data and a segment of this data is subsequently selected to extract features for classification. This is then encoded using linear predictive coding (LPC) and polynomial approximation. The coefficients thus generated are used as inputs to the two branches of a parallel neural architecture. The decisions obtained from the two branches are vector multiplied and the result is fed to an SVM-based IE that presents the final inference. Two parallel neural architectures using multilayer perception (MLP) and hybrid radial basis function (HRBF) are considered in this paper. The proposed structure fits the Lidar data classification task well due to the inherent classification efficiency of neural networks and accurate decision-making capability of SVM. A Bayesian classifier and a quadratic classifier were considered for the Lidar data classification task but they failed to offer high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a single-layered artificial neural network (ANN) classifier was also considered and it failed to offer good accuracy.

We present evidence that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a major role in excitatory neuro-neuronal transmission in ascending and descending reflex pathways to the longitudinal (LM) and circular muscle (CM). 2. A partitioned bath was used for the pharmacological isolation of a segment of guinea-pig ileum ( approximately 6 cm in length), allowing drugs to be selectively applied to an intermediate region between the region where mucosal stimulation was applied and that where mechanical recordings were made. 3. Brush stroking the mucosa (3 strokes) elicited a synchronous contraction of the LM and CM both above (ascending excitation) and below (descending excitation) the site of stimulation. All reflexes were abolished when tetrodotoxin (1 microM) was applied to the intermediate chamber. 4. Hexamethonium (300 microM) added to the intermediate chamber abolished the ascending contraction in 15 % of oral preparations (from 26 preparations, 18 animals) and the descending contraction in 13% of anal preparations studied (from 53 preparations, 48 animals). In the remaining 85% of oral preparations, hexamethonium usually attenuated the oral contraction of the LM and CM. However, in the remaining 87% of anal preparations, hexamethonium had no effect on the anal contraction of the LM and CM. 5. Oral and anal reflexes that were hexamethonium resistant were either abolished or attenuated by the further addition of the P2 purinergic receptor antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 10 microM) or alpha,beta-methylene ATP (50-100 microM) to the intermediate chamber. 6. 1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP, 20 microM) or alpha,beta-methylene ATP (50-100 microM) stimulated both ascending and descending excitatory pathways, when applied to the intermediate chamber. 7. In conclusion, ascending and descending neuro-neuronal transmission in excitatory nervous pathways to the LM and CM is complex and clearly involves neurotransmitter(s) other than acetylcholine (ACh).

ISBN: 0721665330, Price: $129.00 Scope: This basic text presents a thorough and clinically useful overview of neuro-ophthalmologic diseases. Included are helpful reviews of neuroanatomy, visual fields, ancillary tests, and electrophysiology. As a volume of more than 700 pages, this book is more extensive than an introduction but less extensive than a definitive reference. The major focus is on clinical differential diagnosis and management, with supplementary discussions of neuroanatomy, physiology, and ancillary studies used in neuro-ophthalmology. Contents: The book is divided into four main sections: history and examination, afferent disorders, efferent disorders, and headache. The afferent and efferent sections are subdivided neuroanatomically, and lead the reader from anterior visual pathways to higher cortical dysfunction. Each subsequent chapter provides an organized and thoughtful presentation of a topical disorder by covering pertinent review of the anatomy, then pathophysiology, clinical presentations, differential diagnosis, relevant diagnostic-imaging studies, discussion of specific disease entities, and management. There are also symptom-based discussions that emanate from the patient report precipitating the physician visit. Each subsection succinctly discusses the disease process and, where appropriate, includes fundus photos, neuroradiologic illustrations, and tables of distinguishing features. Important differential characteristics are emphasized, which clarify information for the reader. In addition, each subsection is followed by an up-todate bibliography. The initial section of two chapters teaches the history and examination. The subsequent section deals with visual loss and dysfunction. Chapter 3 encompasses a topical overview of afferent disorders, visual pathways, visual field, and electrophysiologic diagnostic testing. Chapter 4 presents a useful discussion of retinal disorders that mimic optic neuropathies. Chapters 5 through 8 focus on topographic neuro-ophthalmology from nerve to cortex, and in particular update the prognosis and management of optic neuritis. The last four chapters elaborate on diseases of higher cortical function and the entities of transient visual loss, functional visual loss, and visual hallucinations and illusions. The third major section discusses efferent disorders including ocular motility-related cranial neuropathies and pupillary, eyelid and facial nerve, and movement abnormalities. The last chapter of this section is devoted to orbital disease. The final section focuses on headache, facial pain and disorders of facial sensation. Strengths: The text is particularly useful for the all-in-one systematic overview of the clinical field, from anatomy to management. The thoroughness of disease discussion (by the use of key charts, tables, outlines, and clinically significant photos and neuroimaging scans) is commendable. The brief yet pertinent references direct readers to more detailed investigations and primary sources. The publisher's use of chapter numbers on each page allows one to efficiently scan for information. Deficiencies: The length of the book may overwhelm residents looking for one resource for their 3-month rotation. Although the book focuses on diagnosis and management, it may do so at the expense of neuroanatomy, visual field testing, neuroimaging, and electrophysiology. Recommended audience: Residents in ophthalmology and neurology and fellows in neuro-ophthalmology would benefit from this text. Critical appraisal: This text's readability, organization, clear outlines, and tables for differential diagnosis are extremely beneficial for those who treat neuro-ophthalmology patients. The thorough discussions and references relating to management will reassure practitioners that the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities have been adequately considered as they look for help in the care of their patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00041327-200112000-00018", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975149038", "source": "openalex"}

This happens primarily due to the use of T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus, there are hardly any work dealing with datasets having features more than hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle datasets with even more than 7000 features! In this context, we propose an adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of \"numeric underflow\" and \"fake minimum\" that arise for existing fuzzy systems while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an adaptive Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design an enhanced fuzzy rule base, which maintains adequate rules but does not grow the number of rules exponentially with features that typically happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated feature selection and rule extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: 1) feature selection; 2) rule extraction; and 3) fine tuning. The effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five are in more than 2000 dimension including two with more than 7000 features. This may be the first attempt to develop fuzzy rule-based classifiers that can directly deal with more than 7000 features without requiring separate selection of features or any other dimensionality reduction method.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2022.3220950", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4312547100", "source": "openalex"}

Project performance is contingent on whether the adopted risk-allocation strategy can lead to efficient risk management. Founded primarily on the transaction cost economics, a theoretical framework was recently developed to model the risk allocation decision-making process in privately financed public infrastructure projects. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy model adapted from an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system was further designed based on the framework by combining fuzzy logic and artificial neural network techniques. Real project data were used to train and validate the neuro-fuzzy models. To evaluate the neuro-fuzzy models, multiple linear regression models and fuzzy inference systems established in previous studies were used for a systematic comparison. The neuro-fuzzy models can serve the purpose of forecasting efficient risk-allocation strategies for privately financed public infrastructure projects at a highly accurate level that multiple linear regression models and fuzzy inference systems could not achieve. This paper presents a significant contribution to the body of knowledge because the established neuro-fuzzy model for efficient risk allocation represents an innovative and successful application of neuro-fuzzy techniques. It is thus possible to accurately predict efficient risk-allocation strategies in an ever-changing business environment, which had not been achieved in previous studies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000365", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975295028", "source": "openalex"}

The load of each symptom and the corresponding severity of depression are measured by the psychiatrists (i.e. the domain experts). Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) out of fourteen symptoms (as features) seven has been extracted as latent factors. Using these features as inputs, a hybrid system consisting of Mamdani's Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) on a Feed Forward Multilayer Neural Net (FFMNN) has been developed. The output of the hybrid system was tuned by a back propagation (BPNN) algorithm. Finally, the model is validated using 302 real-world adult depression cases and 50 controls (i.e. normal population). The study concludes that the hybrid controller can diagnose and grade depression with an average accuracy of 95.50%.

Nevertheless, the experimental time required to screen putative AMPs makes computational simulations based on peptide sequence analysis and/or molecular modeling extremely attractive. Artificial intelligence methods acting as simulation and prediction tools are of great importance in helping to efficiently discover and design novel AMPs. In the present study, state‐of‐the‐art published outcomes using different prediction methods and databases were compared to an adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model. Data from our study showed that ANFIS obtained an accuracy of 96.7% and a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.936, which proved it to be an efficient model for pattern recognition in antimicrobial peptide prediction. Furthermore, a lower number of input parameters were needed for the ANFIS model, improving the speed and ease of prediction. In summary, due to the fuzzy nature of AMP physicochemical properties, the ANFIS approach presented here can provide an efficient solution for screening putative AMP sequences and for exploration of properties characteristic of AMPs. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There is little academic work on NLP to date. This article offers an informed introduction to, and appraisal of, the field for educators. We review the origins of NLP, and summarise its nature as a method of, and conceptual framework for, education and teaching, with brief examples of applications. We argue that NLP offers an innovative praxis, underpinned in principle by Bateson's epistemological thinking, which informs a distinctive methodology known as 'modelling'. The credibility of the field relies, in our view, on its ability to address seven critical issues. These form a possible research agenda and a focus for dialogue between NLP practitioner and academic communities.

Cutaneous innervation is a key part of the peripheral nervous system; therefore, the skin should be considered a sensory organ and an important part of the central nervous system, an ‘active interface’ and the first connection of the body to the outside world. Peripheral nerves are a complex class of neurons within these systems, subsets of functions are conducted, including mechanoreception, nociception and thermoception. Epidermal and dermal cells produce signalling factors (such as cytokines or growth factors), neurites influence skin cells (such as via neuropeptides), and peripheral nerves have a role in both early and late stages of the inflammatory response. One way this is achieved, specifically in the cutaneous system, is through neuropeptide release and signalling, especially via substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Cutaneous, neuronal and immune cells play a central role in many conditions, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, UV‐induced immunosuppression, herpes and lymphomas. Therefore, it is critical to understand the connections and interplay between the peripheral nervous system and the skin and immune systems, the NIC system. Relevant in vitro tissue models based on human skin equivalents can be used to gain insight and to address impact across research and clinical needs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.12677", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2969704529", "source": "openalex"}

Wilcoxon 2-sample and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess differences in responses. Results Five hundred fifty-two evaluable responses were received. The most significant differences were found between Asia-Oceania (AO) and Europe as well as AO and United States/Canada (USA-C). USA-C providers had more subspecialty training in neuro-oncology, but most providers had received no or minimal training in palliative care independent of region. Providers in all 3 regions reported referring patients at the onset of symptoms requiring palliation, but USA-C and European responders refer a larger total proportion of patients to PC (P &lt; .001). Physicians in AO and Europe (both 46%) as well as 29% of USA-C providers did not feel comfortable dealing with end-of-life issues. Most USA-C patients (63%) are referred to hospice compared with only 8% and 19% in AO and Europe (P &lt; .001), respectively. Conclusion This is the first report describing global differences of PC utilization in neuro-oncology. Significant differences in provider training, culture, access, and utilization were mainly found between AO and USA-C or AO and Europe. PC patterns are more similar in Europe and USA-C.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/nop/npu037", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2127096344", "source": "openalex"}

Furthermore, the Nussbaum function and neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are adopted to deal with the problem of the unknown control directions and unknown nonlinear functions existing in the system. Moreover, by introducing the compensation and prediction mechanism to controller design, the adaptive controllers, and adaptive laws are constructed to ensure that all the signals of the controlled systems are bounded.

However, little attention has been paid to how living with children positively and negatively affects quality of life of a pet dog. In this exploratory study we conducted semi-structured interviews with parents of neuro-typically developing children (n = 18) and those with a neuro-developmental disorder (n = 18) who owned a pet dog, until no new factors were identified. Living with children brought potentially positive benefits to the dog's life including: imposition of a routine, participation in recreational activities and the development of a strong bond between the child and the dog. The importance of maintaining a routine was particularly prevalent in families with children with neuro-developmental disorders. Potential negative factors included having to cope with child meltdowns and tantrums, over stimulation from child visitors, harsh contact and rough and tumble play with the child. The regularity and intensity of meltdowns and tantrums was particularly evident in responses from parents with children with a neuro-developmental disorder. However, child visitors and rough play and contact were mentioned similarly across the groups. Protective factors included having a safe haven for the dog to escape to, parent's awareness of stress signs and child education in dog-interaction. Parents were also asked to complete a stress response scale to provide an initial quantitative comparison of stress responses between dogs living with the two family-types. Parents with neuro-typically developing children more frequently observed their dog rapidly running away from a situation and less frequently observed their dog widening their eyes, than parents with children with a neuro-developmental disorder. We propose the development of a stress audit based on the findings reported here, to prevent potential dangerous situations, which may lead to dog bites and dog relinquishment and allow owners to maximise the benefits of dog ownership.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185300", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2757810214", "source": "openalex"}

The imaging solutions are based on a balance between the “palette” of available image contrasts derived from nuclear spin physics and tissue biophysics, and clinical determinants such as the anticipated pathology and efficient use of imaging time. Imaging is therefore optimized to maximize diagnostic sensitivity and specificity through the development of protocols organized along the lines of major disease categories. In the other part of this two‐part review, the primary determinants of image contrast, including T1, T2, and T2*, were highlighted. The development of pulse sequences designed to optimize each of these image contrasts was discussed and the impact of technological innovation (parallel imaging and high‐field systems) on the manner in which these sequences could be modified to improve clinical efficacy was further emphasized. The scope of that discussion was broadened to include the application of: 1) water diffusion imaging used primarily for detection of pathologies that restrict the free movement of water in the tissues and for defining fiber tracts in the brain; 2) the intravenous administration of exogenous contrast agents (gadolinium‐diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [GdDTPA]) for assessment of blood‐brain‐barrier (BBB) defects and brain blood flow; and 3) MR spectroscopy (MRS) for assessment of brain metabolites. The goal of this part is to discuss how these acquisitions are combined into specific protocols that can effectively detect and characterize, or in keeping with our artistic analogy, “paint” each of the major diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS). This work concludes with a discussion of image artifacts and pitfalls in image interpretation, which, in spite our best efforts to minimize or eliminate them, continue to occur. Much of the ensuing discussion is based on our own institutional experience. Protocols, therefore, do not necessarily match those from other institutions due to variability in clinical emphasis, MR instruments, and available software. An attempt was made to focus on basic clinical sequences that are available on most modern MR systems, with protocols employing generally accepted clinical imaging philosophies. J. Magn. Reson.

Neuronal Cx gap junctions form electrical synapses across biochemically similar GABAergic networks, allowing rapid and extensive inhibition in response to principle neuron excitation. Glial Cx gap junctions link astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the pan‐glial network that is responsible for removing excitotoxic ions and metabolites. In addition, glial gap junctions help constrain excessive excitatory activity in neurons and facilitate astrocyte Ca 2+ slow wave propagation. Panxs do not form gap junctions in vivo, but Panx hemichannels participate in autocrine and paracrine gliotransmission, alongside Cx hemichannels. ATP and other gliotransmitters released by Cx and Panx hemichannels maintain physiologic glutamatergic tone by strengthening synapses and mitigating aberrant high frequency bursting. Under pathological depolarizing and inflammatory conditions, gap junctions and hemichannels become dysregulated, resulting in excessive neuronal firing and seizure. In this review, we present known contributions of Cxs and Panxs to physiologic neuronal excitation and explore how the disruption of gap junctions and hemichannels lead to abnormal glutamatergic transmission, purinergic signaling, and seizures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24088", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2620754782", "source": "openalex"}

Here, we aimed to systematically assess all available evidence on urodynamics predicting UUTD in patients with NLUTD. Methods A systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) Statement was performed in March 2017. Only neuro‐urological patients assessed by urodynamics were included. Any outcome of upper urinary tract function were evaluated. Results Forty‐nine studies (1 randomized controlled trial, 9 prospective, and 39 retrospective case series) reported urodynamic data on 4930 neuro‐urological patients. Of those, 2828 (98%) were spina bifida (SB) children. The total number of adults was 2044, mainly having spinal cord injury (SCI) (60%). A low bladder compliance was found in 568 (46.3%) and 341 (29.3%) of the paediatric and adult population, respectively. Hydronephrosis (HDN) was detected in 557 children (27.8%) in 19/28 studies and 178 adults (14.6%), mainly SCI, in 14/21 studies. Nine out of 30 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients affected by HDN (16.8%) showed low compliance in 4/14 studies. Conclusions Patients with SB and SCI have a higher risk of developing UUTD (mainly reported as HDN) compared to those with MS. Reduced compliance and high DLPP were major risk factors for UUTD. Although our findings clarify the mandatory role of urodynamics in the management of NLUTD, standardization and better implementation of assessments in daily practice may further improve outcomes of neuro‐urological patients based on objective measurements, that is, urodynamics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.23501", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2789294887", "source": "openalex"}

There are several parameters that affect FSW process, so it is important to understand the relationship between different process parameters to maximize the quality and strength of the joint. This paper proposed an alternative method to predict FSW parameters and make a decision using a modified version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) integrated with harris hawks optimizer (HHO). HHO was used to search for optimal values of ANFIS parameters and to determine the optimal operating conditions of the FSW process. The shared effect of welding speed, tool rotational speed, and plunge force on the mechanical properties of welded aluminium plates was simulated. The proposed model, called ANFIS-HHO, was used to predict the mechanical properties of FSW Al plates in terms of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) as functions of welding speed, tool rotational speed, and plunge force. The adequacy of the model was tested; the predicted data were in good agreement with the experimental data. The tool rotational speed and the empirical force index (EFI) have a significant impact on the mechanical properties of the welded joints. ANFIS-HHO technique was found to be a powerful optimization tool for predicting FSW parameters to achieve high joint strength.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmrt.2019.09.060", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2982053294", "source": "openalex"}

However, the common training algorithms of ANNs (e.g., back-propagation and gradient algorithms) are featured with specific drawbacks in terms of slow convergence and probable entrapment in local minima. Alternatively, novel training techniques, e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) algorithms might be employed for conquering these shortcomings. In this paper, ANN-PSO and ANN-DE models were applied for modeling groundwater qualitative parameters, i.e., SO4 and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Three statistical parameters including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2) were used for assessing the models' capabilities. The results showed that the ANN-DE presents more accurate results than ANN-PSO in modeling SAR and electrical conductivity (EC).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.206", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2592330325", "source": "openalex"}

In this paper, we propose a novel control methodology that is based on synergistic combination of neural networks with sliding-mode control (SMC) for controlling FES. The main advantage of SMC derives from the property of robustness to system uncertainties and external disturbances. However, the main drawback of the standard sliding modes is mostly related to the so-called chattering caused by the high-frequency control switching. To eliminate the chattering, we couple two neural networks with online learning without any offline training into the SMC. A recurrent neural network is used to model the uncertainties and provide an auxiliary equivalent control to keep the uncertainties to low values, and consequently, to use an SMC with lower switching gain. The second neural network consists of a single neuron and is used as an auxiliary controller. The control law will be switched from the SMC to neural control, when the state trajectory of system enters in some boundary layer around the sliding surface. Extensive simulations and experiments on healthy and paraplegic subjects are provided to demonstrate the robustness, stability, and tracking accuracy of the proposed neuroadaptive SMC. The results show that the neuro-SMC provides accurate tracking control with fast convergence for different reference trajectories and could generate control signals to compensate the muscle fatigue and reject the external disturbance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2009.2017030", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2154887015", "source": "openalex"}

Yet, the neuro-pathophysiological basis underlying it remains to be clarified. Neuroimaging techniques have provided a deeper understanding of what happens to brain structure and function in TMD patients with chronic pain. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies investigating structural and functional brain alterations in TMD patients to further unravel the neurobiological underpinnings of TMD-related pain. Online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science) were searched up to August 3, 2019, as complemented by a hand search in reference lists. A total of 622 papers were initially identified after duplicates removed and 25 studies met inclusion criteria for this review. Notably, the variations of MRI techniques used and study design among included studies preclude a meta-analysis and we discussed the findings qualitatively according to the specific neural system or network the brain regions were involved in. Brain changes were found in pathways responsible for abnormal pain perception, including the classic trigemino-thalamo-cortical system and the lateral and medial pain systems. Dysfunction and maladaptive changes were also identified in the default mode network, the top-down antinociceptive periaqueductal gray-raphe magnus pathway, as well as the motor system. TMD patients displayed altered brain activations in response to both innocuous and painful stimuli compared with healthy controls. Additionally, evidence indicates that splint therapy can alleviate TMD-related symptoms by inducing functional brain changes. In summary, MRI research provides important novel insights into the altered neural manifestations underlying chronic pain in TMD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-020-01131-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3036410631", "source": "openalex"}

Nonetheless, results reported in literature do not allow to unequivocally explain whether and, in case, how a cerebrovascular accident affects muscle synergies underlying the control of the upper limb. These discrepancies suggest that a complete understanding of the modular re-organization of muscle activity due to a stroke is still lacking. This pilot study aimed at investigating the effects of the conjunction between the natural ongoing of the pathology and the intense robot-mediated treatment on muscle synergies of the paretic upper limb of subacute post-stroke patients. Methods Six subacute patients, homogenous with respect to the age and the time elapsed from the trauma, and ten healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled. The protocol consisted in achieving planar movement of the upper limb while handling the end-effector of a robotic platform. Patients underwent 6 weeks long treatment while clinical scores, kinematics of the end-effector and muscle activity were recorded. Then we verified whether muscle coordination underlying the motor task was significantly affected by the cerebrovascular accident and how muscle synergies were modified along the treatment. Results Results show that although muscle synergies in subacute stroke patients were qualitatively comparable to those of healthy subjects, those underlying the movement of the shoulder can reflect the functional deficit induced by the pathology. Moreover, the improvement of motor performance due to the treatment was achieved in conjunction with slight modifications of muscle synergies. In this regard, modifications of muscle synergies appeared to be influenced by the different recovering mechanisms across patients presumably due to the heterogeneity of lesions, sides and location of the accident. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that muscle synergies reflect the injury of the cerebrovascular accident and could document the effects of the functional recovery due to a suitable and customized treatment. Therefore, they open up new possibilities for the development of more effective neuro-rehabilitation protocols.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-0003-10-103", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2107249996", "source": "openalex"}

Patients with damage to the neuro-ophthalmic sensory visual pathways have different patterns of visual loss than patients with glaucoma. The current study was designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of FDT as a screening test, compared with conventional automated perimetry (CAP) in neuro-ophthalmic disorders and to test the extent to which it may isolate the M(y) cells.FDT and CAP were performed in 97 patients with sensory neuro-ophthalmic disorders and 42 subjects from the general population. The total and pattern-deviation probability plots for test loci common to the two perimetric tests were compared. The gold standard was an unequivocal clinical diagnosis.The sensitivity of FDT was 81.3%, with a specificity of 76.2%. The difference in sensitivity and specificity of CAP, 87.5% and 81.0%, respectively, was not statistically significant (by chi(2) test). In subjects with optic neuropathies, the similarity of the defect shown on FDT and CAP was judged good or fair in 62 of 72 cases. The extent of the defect as seen with FDT and CAP was equal in 41 of 72 cases, more extensive with FDT in 12, and more extensive with CAP in 19. In the patients with hemianopia, scattered abnormal test locations with FDT testing masked the hemianopic nature of the defect in 15 of 25 patients. Also, test locations along the vertical midline in densely hemianopic areas were seen with FDT testing in some patients with hemianopia, probably due to light scatter across the vertical midline and into the uninvolved hemianopic field.FDT has sensitivity and specificity similar to that of CAP for detecting visual field defects in patients with optic neuropathies. However, defects in patients with hemianopias may be missed because of the presence of scattered abnormal test locations and failure to detect test locations along the vertical meridian. The defects demonstrated by both tests in patients with optic neuropathies are similar in number, extent, and shape of the defects. This suggests FDT may not be isolating the magnocellular (M) cells with nonlinear responses to stimulus contrast (M(y) cells) in patients with visual loss.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W205413827", "source": "openalex"}

Electrode- and optical- based stimulation methods have been used widely for neuro-modulation with high resolution. However, they are suffering from inherent invasive surgical procedure. Ultrasound has been proved as a promising technology for neuro-stimulation in a non-invasive manner. However, no portable ultrasound system has been developed particularly for neuro-stimulation. The utilities used currently are assembled by traditional functional generator, power amplifier, and general transducer, therefore, resulting in lack of flexibility. This paper presents a portable system to achieve ultrasonic neuro-stimulation to satisfy various studies. The system incorporated a high voltage waveform generator and a matching circuit that were optimized for neuro-stimulation. A new switching mode power amplifier was designed and fabricated. The noise generated by the power amplifier was reduced (about 30 dB), and the size and weight were smaller in contrast with commercial equipment.

Consistent with expectation, a series of regression analyses demonstrated that the Neurological Predictor Scale significantly predicted composite intellectual functioning (r(2) = 0.21, p < .05), short-term memory (r(2) = 0.16, p = .05), and abstract visual reasoning abilities (r(2) = 0.28, p < .05). With the exception of chemotherapy, the Neurological Predictor Scale accounted for a significant amount of the variance in child intellectual functioning above and beyond individually examined variables.

First, we estimated the dynamic con tribution of the patient from robot's torque and kinematic data. Second, we adapted the stiffness parameter of the robot's impedance control according to the purported patient's participation.

The oculomotor dysfunction was presumed to represent an unusually symmetrical peripheral cranial nerve dysfunction. To investigate the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations in this rare syndrome we reviewed 109 reports describing 243 cases. The ophthalmoplegia was remarkable in its constant association with a cerebellar type ataxia. It was described to be remarkably symmetrical at all stages of development and recovery. From the early description of the syndrome by Fisher the ophthalmoplegia was observed to evolve as a symmetrical failure of upgaze followed by loss of lateral gaze and last by downgaze, recovery develops in the opposite pattern. Despite the severe nature of the ophthalmoplegia, 58 patients were reported to have sparing of downgaze and 192 (79%) had relative sparing of the eye lids. Active lid retraction and preserved Bell's phenomenon, despite upgaze paralysis, were described in 22 and 15 patients respectively. Upper lid jerks were described in 2, Parinaud's syndrome in 2, convergence spasm in 6, internuclear ophthalmoplegia in 15 and horizontal dissociated nystagmus in 11. Interestingly 23 were reported to present with paralysis of abduction progressing to lateral gaze paralysis and 5 had paralysis of abduction and contralateral gaze paralysis. Four had defective vestibulo-ocular reflex despite recovery of upgaze, 10 had central type nystagmus including rotatory, retractory and rebound nystagmus. Relative preservation of optokinetic nystagmus and preservation of vestibulo-ocular reflex despite an otherwise complete ophthalmoplegia were reported in 6 and 2 patients repectively. Dissociated pupillary response was reported in 4. We thus feel that central neuro-ophthalmic signs occur so regularly in cases of Fisher's syndrome that their presence can not be explained by chance alone. We contend that Fisher's syndrome represents one of the brainstem syndromes rather than being a simple unusual variant of the Guillain-Barré syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.1994.tb01654.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2011562820", "source": "openalex"}

In the recent literature, neuro dynamic programming (NDP) techniques, based on value and policy iterations, have been widely reported to solve the optimal control of general affine nonlinear systems. However, for realtime control, value and policy iterations-based methodology are not suitable and time-based NDP techniques are preferred. In addition, output feedback-based controller designs are preferred for implementation. Therefore, in this paper, a novel NNCS representation incorporating the system uncertainties and network imperfections is introduced first by using input and output measurements for facilitating output feedback. Then, an online neural network (NN) identifier is introduced to estimate the control coefficient matrix, which is subsequently utilized for the controller design. Subsequently, the critic and action NNs are employed along with the NN identifier to determine the forward-in-time, time-based stochastic optimal control of NNCS without using value and policy iterations. Here, the value function and control inputs are updated once a sampling instant. By using novel NN weight update laws, Lyapunov theory is used to show that all the closed-loop signals and NN weights are uniformly ultimately bounded in the mean while the approximated control input converges close to its target value with time.

As a treatment option for NDDs, RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising approach to suppress the activation of abnormal genes and negative regulators of antioxidant genes. Efficient neuro-targeted siRNA delivery requires a delicate optimization of nucleic acid carriers, quite distinct from putative pDNA carriers in regard to stable condensation and serum protection of siRNA, blood-brain barrier (BBB) bypass, effective siRNA delivery to brain cells, and functional release of bioactive siRNA at therapeutic levels. Here, we propose that a myristic acid conjugated, cell-penetrating peptide (transportan; TP), equipped with a transferrin receptor-targeting peptide (myr-TP-Tf), will lead to stable encapsulation of siRNA and targeted delivery of siRNA to brain cells overcoming the BBB. Myr-TP-Tf was successfully prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis with high purity. Myr-TP-Tf-siRNA complexes formulated at a 20:1 (peptide-siRNA) molar ratio provided prolonged siRNA stability against serum and ribonuclease treatment. Fluorescence images clearly indicated that siRNA uptake was successfully achieved by myr-TP-Tf complexes in both a murine brain endothelioma and a human glioma cell line. The luciferase assay and the human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPAP) reporter assay results demonstrated the functional gene silencing effect of myr-TP-Tf-siRNA complexes in a human glioma cell line as well as in primary murine neurons/astrocytes, supportive of successful release of bioactive siRNA into the cytosol. Finally, the transcytosis assay revealed that favorable siRNA transport via receptor-mediated transcytosis was mediated by myr-TP-Tf complexes. In summary, these data suggest that myr-TP-Tf peptides possess promising properties as a vehicle for neuro-targeted siRNA delivery. We will further study this peptide in vitro and in vivo for transport mechanism kinetics and to validate its capability to deliver siRNA to the brain, respectively.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1021/mp400446v", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2315015256", "source": "openalex"}

The availability of such information in the dataset affects the performance of the classification model. In this paper, a Linguistic Neuro-Fuzzy with Feature Extraction (LNF-FE) model is utilized for the analysis of medical data for disease classification. Initially, this model uses a linguistic fuzzification process to generate membership values that handle the uncertainty problems. These membership values may not significantly contribute to the model, but it will increase the dimensions, for which more time will be required to train the model. To address this issue, Feature Extraction (FE) algorithms are hybridized in the Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) model to extract only those features (a reduced feature set) that are significantly contributing to the network. These reduced features are again passed to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for classification. This proposed model is tested and validated through eight benchmark datasets, and the performance is compared with other models. The obtained results were tested using statistical techniques such as Friedman and Holm-Bonferroni for the proof of correctness.

Considerable work indicates oscillatory synchronization through phase alignment is a major agent of inter-regional communication. In the brain, different oscillatory phases correspond to low- and high-excitability states. Optimally aligned phases (or high-excitability states) promote inter-regional communication. Studies have also shown that sensory stimulation can modulate or reset the phase of ongoing cortical oscillations. For example, auditory stimuli can reset the phase of oscillations in visual cortex, influencing processing of a simultaneous visual stimulus. Such cross-regional phase reset represents a candidate mechanism for aligning oscillatory phase for inter-regional communication. Here, we explored the role of local and inter-regional phase alignment in driving a well established behavioral correlate of multisensory integration: the redundant target effect (RTE), which refers to the fact that responses to multisensory inputs are substantially faster than to unisensory stimuli. In a speeded detection task, human epileptic patients ( N = 3) responded to unisensory (auditory or visual) and multisensory (audiovisual) stimuli with a button press, while electrocorticography was recorded over auditory and motor regions. Visual stimulation significantly modulated auditory activity via phase reset in the delta and theta bands. During the period between stimulation and subsequent motor response, transient synchronization between auditory and motor regions was observed. Phase synchrony to multisensory inputs was faster than to unisensory stimulation. This sensorimotor phase alignment correlated with behavior such that stronger synchrony was associated with faster responses, linking the commonly observed RTE with phase alignment across a sensorimotor network.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4527-14.2015", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1562975277", "source": "openalex"}

In a sample of 22 students with dyslexia (20 women) and 27 students without dyslexia (25 women) (18–21 years), a classification performance of 80% (p < 0.001; d-prime = 1.67) was achieved on the basis of differences in gray matter (sensitivity 82%, specificity 78%). The voxels that were most reliable for classification were found in the left occipital fusiform gyrus (LOFG), in the right occipital fusiform gyrus (ROFG), and in the left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). Additionally, we found that classification certainty (e.g. the percentage of times a subject was correctly classified) correlated with severity of dyslexia (r = 0.47).

No correlations were found with behavioural measures of short-term memory and visual/attentional confusion.

Mental capacity was formally assessed using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MACCAT-T) conducted by a dual-qualified physician and lawyer. To assess the relationship between cognition and mental capacity, cognitive function was assessed after the MACCAT-T interview using the Addenbrooke9s Cognitive Examination–revised (ACE-R). Decisions about capacity made by the assessor were compared with the informal assessment of capacity of the neurosurgical team. <h3>Results:</h3> Of 100 patients, 25 were identified by the assessor as lacking the necessary mental capacity to give valid consent to neurosurgery. Mental incapacity was most common among patients with World Health Organization grade IV tumors (38%) and was more common in men than women (36% of men lacked capacity vs 14% of women). Patients lacking mental capacity were significantly more cognitively impaired than those with capacity (median [interquartile range (IQR)] total ACE-R of 44 [0, 65.5] for incapable patients compared with a median [IQR] total ACE-R score of 88 [82, 95] for patients with capacity). Of 25 patients found to lack capacity by the assessor, 13 (52%) were identified as lacking capacity by the neurosurgical team and were treated under the provisions of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. A score of &lt;4/7 in the semantic verbal fluency subset of the ACE-R (naming up to 10 animals in 1 minute) was predictive of incapacity (96% sensitivity, 63% specificity). <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Mental incapacity in patients with intracranial tumors is common and is underestimated by clinicians seeking consent for neuro-oncologic treatment. Cognitive impairment is associated with incapacity. We propose a simple, brief cognitive screening test to identify patients who warrant a more rigorous interrogation of their mental capacity as part of the process of seeking consent for neuro-oncologic treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000000671", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1980562639", "source": "openalex"}

Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with tubercular meningoencephalitis underwent evaluation for optic nerve functions, supra- and infranuclear oculomotor involvement, and raised intracranial tension, Patients underwent follow-up for 9 months. Results: In 100 patients with tubercular meningoencephalitis, 67 had neuro-ophthalmic features. Common findings were retrobulbar neuritis (32) and gaze palsy (20). Others, in decreasing prevalence, were third and sixth nerve palsy, conjugate deviation, primary optic atrophy, and complete ophthalmoplegia. Raised intracranial tension was associated with neuro-ophthalmic features in 53 of 67 patients (P&lt;.05). Complete ophthalmoplegia was significantly associated with mortality on logistic regression analysis (relative risk, 6.35; P=.012). By 6 months, 56% of patients with retrobulbar neuritis progressed to optic atrophy.

Moreover, adaptive neuro-fuzzy and statistical approaches, nearest neighbor/naive Bayes classifiers and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) are used to predict seventeen CVD risk factors. Mixed-data transformation and classification methods are employed for categorical and continuous variables predicting CVD risk. We compare our hybrid models and existing ML techniques on a CVD real dataset collected from a hospital. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence and exhibit the essential variables with regard to CVDs, such as the patient's age, cholesterol level and glucose level.

This study focuses on the association between the severity of intimal proliferation on temporal artery biopsy (TAB) histology and neuro-ophthalmic complications (NOCs) of GCA.We identified 30 cases of biopsy-proven temporal arteritis. One histopathologist (blinded to the clinical details) evaluated the TAB specimens and categorized the degree of maximum stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia into four grades: grade 1 is <50% luminal occlusion due to intimal hyperplasia, grade 2 is 50-75%, grade 3 is >75% and grade 4 is complete luminal occlusion. A second histopathologist (also blinded to the clinical details) independently evaluated the TAB specimens using the same grading system. The NOCs in these patients were noted after a case record review.Of the 30 patients, 12 had NOC-10 with eye complications (complete visual loss, anterior ischaemic neuropathy, visual field defects), one patient had cerebral infarcts and one had both cerebral infarcts and vision loss. There was evidence for a statistically significant trend of NOC associated with higher intimal hyperplasia scores (P = 0.001). The scores of the histopathologists agreed for 23 (77%) patients and differed by 1 category for the remaining 7 (kappa-statistic 0.88).Our study suggests that the degree of intimal hyperplasia on TAB histology (routinely available to all hospital units) seems to be closely associated with NOCs of GCA.

The complete assessment of landslide susceptibility needs uniformly distributed detailed information on the territory. This information, which is related to the temporal occurrence of landslide phenomena and their causes, is often fragmented and heterogeneous. The present study evaluates the landslide susceptibility map of the Natural Archaeological Park of Matera (Southern Italy) (Sassi and area Rupestrian Churches sites). The assessment of the degree of \"spatial hazard\" or \"susceptibility\" was carried out by the spatial prediction regardless of the return time of the events. The evaluation model for the susceptibility presented in this paper is very focused on the use of innovative techniques of artificial intelligence such as Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic and Neuro-fuzzy Network. The method described in this paper is a novel technique based on a neuro-fuzzy system. It is able to train data like neural network and it is able to shape and control uncertain and complex systems like a fuzzy system. This methodology allows us to derive susceptibility maps of the study area. These data are obtained from thematic maps representing the parameters responsible for the instability of the slopes. The parameters used in the analysis are: plan curvature, elevation (DEM), angle and aspect of the slope, lithology, fracture density, kinematic hazard index of planar and wedge sliding and toppling. Moreover, this method is characterized by the network training which uses a training matrix, consisting of input and output training data, which determine the landslide susceptibility. The neuro-fuzzy method was integrated to a sensitivity analysis in order to overcome the uncertainty linked to the used membership functions. The method was compared to the landslide inventory map and was validated by applying three methods: a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, a confusion matrix and a SCAI method. The developed neuro-fuzzy method showed a good performance in the determination of the landslide susceptibility map.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-13-395-2013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1971263248", "source": "openalex"}

With exception of ultraviolet B (UVB) requirement in the production of vitamin D3, the positive role of UVR in modulation of homeostasis is underappreciated. Skin exposure to UVR triggers local responses secondary to the induction of chemical, hormonal, immune, and neural signals that are defined by the chromophores and extent of UVR penetration into skin compartments. These responses are not random and are coordinated by the cutaneous neuro-immuno-endocrine system, which counteracts the action of external stressors and accommodates local homeostasis to the changing environment. The UVR induces electrical, chemical, and biological signals to be sent to the brain, endocrine and immune systems, as well as other central organs, which in concert regulate body homeostasis. To achieve its central homeostatic goal, the UVR-induced signals are precisely computed locally with transmission through nerves or humoral signals release into the circulation to activate and/or modulate coordinating central centers or organs. Such modulatory effects will be dependent on UVA and UVB wavelengths. This leads to immunosuppression, the activation of brain and endocrine coordinating centers, and the modification of different organ functions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the underlying mechanisms of UVR electromagnetic energy penetration deep into the body, with its impact on the brain and internal organs.

Neuropathic pain (NP) results from a dysfunction and derangement in the transmission and signal processing along the nervous system and it is a recognized disease in itself. The prevalence of NP is estimated to be between 6.9% and 10% in the general population. This condition can complicate the recovery from stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord lesions, and several neuropathies promoting persistent disability and poor quality of life. Subjects suffering from NP describe it as burning, itching, lancing, and numbness, but hyperalgesia and allodynia represent the most bothersome symptoms. The management of NP is a clinical challenge and several non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions have been proposed with variable benefits. Botulinum toxin (BTX) as an adjunct to other interventions can be a useful therapeutic tool for the treatment of disabled people. Although BTX-A is predominantly used to reduce spasticity in a neuro-rehabilitation setting, it has been used in several painful conditions including disorders characterized by NP. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms that operate in reducing pain are still unclear and include blocking nociceptor transduction, the reduction of neurogenic inflammation by inhibiting neural substances and neurotransmitters, and the prevention of peripheral and central sensitization. Some neurological disorders requiring rehabilitative intervention can show neuropathic pain resistant to common analgesic treatment. This paper addresses the effect of BTX-A in treating NP that complicates frequent disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system such as spinal cord injury, post-stroke shoulder pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy, which are commonly managed in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, BTX-A has an effect in relief pain that may characterize less common neurological disorders including post-traumatic neuralgia, phantom limb, and complex regional pain syndrome with focal dystonia. The use of BTX-A could represent a novel therapeutic strategy in caring for neuropathic pain whenever common pharmacological tools have been ineffective. However, large and well-designed clinical trials are needed to recommend BTX-A use in the relief of neuropathic pain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins7072454", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1567540988", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of two types of intelligent learning methods, artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems, in order to estimate breeding values (EBV) of Iranian dairy cattle. Initially, the breeding values of lactating Holstein cows for milk and fat yield were estimated using conventional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) with an animal model. Once that was established, a multilayer perceptron was used to build ANN to predict breeding values from the performance data of selection candidates. Subsequently, fuzzy logic was used to form an NFS, a hybrid intelligent system that was implemented via a local linear model tree algorithm. For milk yield the correlations between EBV and EBV predicted by the ANN and NFS were 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. Corresponding correlations for fat yield were 0.93 and 0.93, respectively. Correlations between multitrait predictions of EBVs for milk and fat yield when predicted simultaneously by ANN were 0.93 and 0.93, respectively, whereas corresponding correlations with reference EBV for multitrait NFS were 0.94 and 0.95, respectively, for milk and fat production.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/127130", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2090263242", "source": "openalex"}

However, understanding the precise role of PAR2 on neuro-immune communication in AD has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. Methods We used a recently established mouse model with epidermal overexpression of Par2 (Par2OE) and littermate WT mice to study the impact of increased Par2 expression in epidermal cells on spontaneous and house dust mite (HDM)-induced skin inflammation, itch, and barrier dysfunction in AD, in vivo and ex vivo. Results Par2OE newborns displayed no overt abnormalities, but spontaneously developed dry skin, severe pruritus, and eczema. Dermatological, neurophysiological, and immunological analyses revealed the hallmarks of AD-like skin disease. Skin barrier defects were observed before onset of skin lesions. Application of HDM onto Par2OE mice triggered pruritus and the skin phenotype. Par2OE mice displayed an increased density of nerve fibers, increased nerve growth factor and endothelin-1 expression levels, alloknesis, enhanced scratching (hyperknesis) and responses of DRG cells to non-histaminergic pruritogens. Conclusion Par2 in keratinocytes, activated by exogenous and endogenous proteases, is sufficient to drive barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and pruritus and sensitize skin to the effects of HDM in a mouse model that mimics human AD. Par2 signaling in keratinocytes appears to be sufficient to drive several levels of neuro-epidermal communication, another feature of human AD.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01740", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3048733953", "source": "openalex"}

SANS is a potential risk to astronaut health and will likely require mitigation prior to planetary travel with prolonged exposures to microgravity. While the exact pathogenesis of SANS is not completely understood, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this neuro-ocular phenomenon. In this paper, we briefly discuss the current hypotheses and contributing factors underlying SANS pathophysiology as well as analogues used to study SANS on Earth.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to full-band specific phase space trajectory matrix (PSTM) extracted from short emotional EEG segment of 6 s, then the first principal component is used to measure the level of local neuronal complexity. As well, Phase Locking Value (PLV) between right and left hemispheres is estimated for in order to observe the superiority of local neuronal complexity estimation to regional neuro-cortical connectivity measurements in clustering nine discrete emotions (fear, anger, happiness, sadness, amusement, surprise, excitement, calmness, disgust) by using Long-Short-Term-Memory Networks as deep learning applications. In tests, two groups (healthy females and males aged between 22 and 33 years old) are classified with the accuracy levels of $\\text{68.52}{\\%}$ and $\\text{79.36}{\\%}$ through the proposed emotional complexity markers and and connectivity levels in terms of PLV in amusement. The groups are found to be statistically different ($p\\ll 0.5$) in amusement with respect to both metrics, even if gender difference does not lead to different neuro-cortical functions in any of the other discrete emotional states. The high deep learning classification accuracy of $\\text{98.00}{\\%}$ is commonly obtained for discrimination of positive emotions from negative emotions through the proposed new complexity markers. Besides, considerable useful classification performance is obtained in discriminating mixed emotions from each other through full-band connectivity features. The results reveal that emotion formation is mostly influenced by individual experiences rather than gender. In detail, local neuronal complexity is mostly sensitive to the affective valance rating, while regional neuro-cortical connectivity levels are mostly sensitive to the affective arousal ratings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2019.2959843", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2996553713", "source": "openalex"}

When eels are placed on an illuminated white background the synaptic junctions between Type A 2 neurosecretory fibres and pituicytes are very frequent.

Numerous works have been put in to uncover the effective mechanisms of acupuncture. And the interdependent interaction between acupuncture and acupoint microenvironment is a crucial topic. As a benign minimally invasive stimulation, the insertion and manipulation of needle at acupoint could cause deformation of local connective tissue and secretion of various molecules, such as high mobility group box 1 and ATP. The molecules are secreted into extracellular space and bind to the corresponding receptors thus active NF-κB, MAPK, ERK pathways on mast cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, among others. This is supposed to trigger following transcription and translation of immune factors and neural active substance, as well as promote the free ion movement (such as Ca2+ influx) and the expansion of blood vessels to recruit more immune cells to acupoint. Finally, acupuncture could enhance network connectivity of local microenvironment at acupoints. The earlier mentioned substances further act on a variety of receptors in local nerve endings, transmitting electrical and biochemical signals to the CNS, and giving full play to the acupuncture action. In conclusion, we portrayed a neuro-immune microenvironment network of acupoints that medicates the acupuncture action, and would lay a foundation for the systematic study of the complex network relationship of acupoints in the future.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.3ab0420-361rr", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3042177268", "source": "openalex"}

This paper describes the problem of choice of road route under conditions of uncertainty which drivers are faced with as they carry out their task of transportation. The choice of road route depends on the needs stated in the transport requirements, the location of the users and the conditions under which the transport task is performed. The route guidance system developed in this paper is an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Guidance System (ANFIGS) that provides instructions to drivers based upon optimum route solutions. A dynamic route guidance (DRG) system routes drivers using the current traffic conditions. ANFIGS can provide actual routing advice to the driver in light of the real-time traffic conditions. In the DRG system for the choice of road route, the experiential knowledge of drivers and dispatchers is accumulated in a neuro-fuzzy network which has the capability of generalizing a solution. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy network is trained to select an optimal road route on the basis of standard and additional criteria. As a result of the research, it is shown that the suggested adaptable fuzzy system, which has the ability to learn, has the capability of imitating the decision making process of the drivers and dispatchers and of showing a level of competence which is comparable with the level of their competence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31181/dmame180113p", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2900951555", "source": "openalex"}

The main eye movement abnormality concerned saccades, which were \"multistep,\" consisting of a series of small saccades and larger movements that showed transient decelerations. Larger saccades ended earlier and more abruptly (greater peak deceleration) in LOTS patients than in control subjects; these changes can be attributed to premature termination of the saccadic pulse.

The NF dynamic-inversion constructed by a dynamic NF (DNF) system is used to compensate for the robot inverse dynamics for a better tracking performance. By assigning the dynamics of the DNF system, the dynamic performance of a robot control system can be guaranteed at the initial control stage, which is very important for enhancing system stability and adaptive learning. The discrete-time adaptive control composed of the NF dynamic-inversion and NF variable structure control (NF-VSC) is developed to stabilize the closed-loop system and ensure the high-quality tracking. The NF-VSC enhances the stability of the controlled system and improves the system dynamic performance during the NF learning. The system stability and the convergence of tracking errors are guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability theory, and the learning algorithm for the DNF system is obtained thereby.

They play a central role in the organization and maintenance of the axonal domains: the node, paranode, and juxtaparanode. In particular, CAMs are essential for the accumulation of voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodal gap that ensures the rapid and saltatory propagation of the action potentials. The mechanisms regulating node formation are distinct in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and recent studies have highlighted the relative contribution of paranodal junctions and nodal extracellular matrix. In addition, CAMs at the juxtaparanodal domains mediate the clustering of voltage-gated potassium channels which regulate the axonal excitability. In several human pathologies, the axo-glial contacts are altered leading to disruption of the nodes of Ranvier or mis-localization of the ion channels along the axons.

Integration of 18F-FET PET into surgical planning allows better delineation of the extent of resection beyond margins visible with standard MRI. For biopsy planning, 18F-FET PET is particularly useful in identifying malignant foci within non-contrast-enhancing gliomas. 18F-FET PET may improve the radiation therapy planning in patients with gliomas. This metabolic imaging method may be useful to evaluate treatment response in patients with gliomas and it improves the differential diagnosis between brain tumours recurrence and posttreatment changes. 18F-FET PET may provide useful prognostic information in high-grade gliomas.Based on recent literature data 18F-FET PET may provide additional diagnostic information compared to standard MRI in neuro-oncology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867325666171123202644", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768482184", "source": "openalex"}

Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs) can handle such uncertainties; however they have a computational overhead associated with the iterative type-reduction process which can diminish the FLC real-time performance. Furthermore, manually designing a type-2 FLC is a difficult task particularly as the number of membership function parameters and rules increase. In this paper, we will introduce an embedded Real-Time Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (RT2NFC) which overcomes the iterative type-reduction overhead and learns the parameters of interval type-2 FLC for marine engines. We have performed numerous experiments on a real diesel engine testing platform in which we compared our RT2NFC to a T2NFC based on the iterative type reduction procedure. Both T2NFCs were embedded on an industrial microcontroller platform where they handled the uncertainties to produce accurate and robust speed controllers that outperformed the currently used commercial engine controller. The RT2NFC gave approximately the same control response as the T2NFC, whilst the RT2NFC avoided the type-reduction overhead thus giving a faster real-time response.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/fuzzy.2006.1681899", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2116579452", "source": "openalex"}

Increasing fossil-fuel-based electricity generation has serious impacts on environment. As a result, interest in renewable resources has risen, as they are environmentally friendly and may prove to be economical in the long run. However, the intermittent character of renewable energy sources is a major disadvantage. It is important to integrate them with the rest of the grid so that their benefits can be reaped while their negative impacts can be mitigated. In this article, an energy management algorithm is recommended for a grid-connected microgrid consisting of loads, a photovoltaic (PV) system and a battery for efficient use of energy. A model predictive control-inspired approach for energy management is developed using the PV power and consumption estimation obtained from daylight solar irradiation and temperature estimation of the same area. An energy management algorithm, which is based on a neuro-fuzzy inference system, is designed by determining the possible operating states of the system. The proposed system is compared with a rule-based control strategy. Results show that the developed control algorithm ensures that microgrid is supplied with reliable energy while the renewable energy use is maximized.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9060900", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3030406608", "source": "openalex"}

The most important tools for quality assessment of power transformers are PD detection, measurement, and classification. As for the maintenance and repair of transformers, the major importance is the techniques for locating a PD source. The transfer function-based (TF) method for power transformers' winding in the high-frequency range is commonly used in power engineering applications, such as transient analysis, insulation coordination, and in transformer design. Although it is possible to localize PD in transformer winding using the transfer function (TF) method, this method cannot be used for transformers with no design data. Previous attempts toward finding a feature that localizes PD in transformers in general that lineate with PD location were found to be less successful. Therefore, in this paper, a neuro-fuzzy technique that uses unsupervised pattern recognition was proposed to localize PD source in power transformers. The proposed method was tested on a medium-voltage transformer winding in the laboratory.

From this review it is clear that neuro-muscular dysfunction occurs in the presence of LBP, although the manner of the dysfunction is variable. LBP is sometimes associated with a loss of strength and often a loss of endurance of the trunk muscles. LBP is commonly associated with varied and complex patterns of neuro-muscular dysfunction both between and within trunk muscle synergies. This results in disrupted patterns of co-contraction and co-ordination between and within trunk synergists and appears to reflect altered patterns of neuro-motor control. There is also evidence that the muscles commonly affected are those whose primary role is to provide segmental control and dynamic stability to the spine.

The advent of fNIRS, which is relatively robust to the body movements of ADHD children, raised the possibility of introducing functional neuroimaging diagnosis in younger ADHD children. Using fNIRS, we monitored the oxy-hemoglobin signal changes of 16 ADHD children (6 to 13 years old) performing a go/no-go task before and 1.5 h after MPH or placebo administration, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. 16 age- and gender-matched normal controls without MPH administration were also monitored. Relative to control subjects, unmedicated ADHD children exhibited reduced activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) during go/no-go tasks. The reduced right IFG/MFG activation was acutely normalized after MPH administration, but not after placebo administration. The MPH-induced right IFG/MFG activation was significantly larger than the placebo-induced activation. Post-scan exclusion rate was 0% among 16 right-handed ADHD children with IQ > 70.

Here we analyzed the protective effect of Neuro-EPO in APPSwe mice, a reference transgenic mouse model of AD. Mice were administered 3 times a day, 3 days in the week with Neuro-EPO (125, 250 μg/kg) intranasally, between 12 and 14 months of age. Motor responses, general activity, and memory responses were analyzed during and after treatment. The deficits in spontaneous alternation, place learning in the water-maze, and novel object recognition observed in APPSwe mice were alleviated by the low dose of Neuro-EPO. Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, trophic factor levels, and a synaptic marker were analyzed in the hippocampus or cortex of the animals. The increases in lipid peroxidation or in GFAP and Iba-1 contents in APPSwe mice were significantly reduced after Neuro-EPO. Activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways was analyzed. The increases in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, TNFα, or Fas ligand levels observed in APPSwe mice were reduced by Neuro-EPO. Finally, immunohistochemical and ELISA analyses of Aβ1–42 levels in the APPSwe mouse cortex and hippocampus showed a marked reduction in Aβ deposits and in soluble and insoluble Aβ1–42 forms. This study therefore confirmed the neuroprotective activity of EPO, particularly for an intranasally deliverable formulation, devoid of erythropoietic side effects, in a transgenic mouse model of AD.

Obesity is recognized as a low-grade inflammatory disease and is linked with several comorbidities such as diabetes, circulatory disease, common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as chronic pain. Adipocytes are a major neuroendocrine organ that continually, and systemically, releases pro-inflammatory factors. While the exact mechanisms driving obesity-induced pain remain poorly defined, nociceptors hypersensitivity may result from the systemic state of inflammation characteristic of obesity as well as weight surplus-induced mechanical stress. Obesity and pain also share various genetic mutations, lifestyle risk factors, and metabolic pathways. For instance, fat pads are often found hyper-innervated and rich in immune cell types of multiple origins. These immunocytes release cytokines, amplifying nociceptor function, which, in turn, via locally-released neuropeptides sustain immunocytes' function. Here, we posit that along with mechanical stressed stemming from extra weight, the local neuro-immune interplay occurring within the fat pads maintains the state of chronic low-grade inflammation and heightens sensory hypersensitivity. Overall, stopping the harmful neuro-immune crosstalk may constitute a novel pathway to prevent obesity-associated comorbidities, including neuronal hypersensitivity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00181", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3035124045", "source": "openalex"}

As these two objectives usually exert contradictory requirements on the neuro-fuzzy model, certain compromise has to be undertaken. This letter proposes a novel rule reduction algorithm, namely, Hebb rule reduction, and an iterative tuning process to balance interpretability and accuracy. The Hebb rule reduction algorithm uses Hebbian ordering, which represents the degree of coverage of the samples by the rule, as an importance measure of each rule to merge the membership functions and hence reduces the number of the rules. Similar membership functions (MFs) are merged by a specified similarity measure in an order of Hebbian importance, and the resultant equivalent rules are deleted from the rule base. The rule with a higher Hebbian importance will be retained among a set of rules. The MFs are tuned through the least mean square (LMS) algorithm to reduce the modeling error. The tuning of the MFs and the reduction of the rules proceed iteratively to achieve a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Three published data sets by Nakanishi (Nakanishi, Turksen, &amp; Sugeno, 1993), the Pat synthetic data set (Pal, Mitra, &amp; Mitra, 2003), and the traffic flow density prediction data set are used as benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A database of 298 instances is developed from the peer-reviewed published work. The database consists of the ten most prominent explanatory variables and f_c^' of FGPC as a response parameter. The statistical error checks and criteria suggested in the literature are considered for the verification of the predictive strength of the models. The statistical measures considered in this study are MAE, RSE, RMSE, RRMSE, R, and performance index (ρ). These checks verify that ANFIS predictive model gives an outstanding performance followed by GEP and ANN predictive models.

Generally, GEP predictive model is ideal as it delivers a simplistic and easy mathematical equation for future use. The k-fold cross-validation (CV) of the GEP model is also conducted, which verifies the robustness of the GEP predictive model. Furthermore, the parametric study is carried via proposed GEP expression. This confirms that the GEP model accurately covers the influence of all the explanatory variables used for the prediction of f_c^' of FGPC.

Other factors containing mislabeling or misleading MI EEG trials might also cause more uncertainties in training datasets that lead to decline in classification performance. This paper proposes a new framework to achieve more efficient classification in multiclass MI EEG-based BCIs. An artifact rejected common spatial pattern (AR-CSP) method is proposed for feature extraction in order to cope with the interferences of artifacts. A self-regulated adaptive resonance theory based neuro-fuzzy classifier that is referred to as \"self-regulated supervised Gaussian fuzzy adaptive system Art (SRSG-FasArt)\" is introduced to deal with EEG nonstationarities. A metacognitive self-regulatory-based learning algorithm is also proposed to more efficiently deal with the uncertainties. The algorithm captures the training data samples by priority and automatically creates, upgrades, or prunes the fuzzy rules by scanning the knowledge content existing in the data patterns and the created rules. The mechanism improves the generalization capability of the SRSG-FasArt and prevents over-training. The performance of the proposed cooperative framework of AR-CSP and SRSG-FasArt is evaluated using the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. The results indicate more accurate and efficient BCI classification compared to the existing frameworks.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2017.2728521", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2737825951", "source": "openalex"}

Curcumin (Cur), as a natural phytochemical compound, has the potential characteristics on anti-inflammatory and microglia phenotype transformation. In this study, we verified the hypothesis curcumin promotes M2 polarization to inhibiting neuro-inflammation, which through suppressing TLR4 signaling pathway after SAH. In tlr4-/- mice and wild type (WT) subjected to prechiasmatic cistern blood injection, Western blotting, brain water content, neurological score, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were performed to investigate the role of TLR4 on neuro-inflammation response and microglia polarization. Curcumin with three different concentrations (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 15 min after SAH. The levels of TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB), Iba-1, CD86, CD206 and pro/anti-inflammation cytokines were measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining at 24 h after SAH. SAH induction increased the protein levels of TLR4, pro-inflammation cytokines and proportion of M1 phenotype. Curcumin with 100 mg/kg treatment dramatically inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and elevated the protein levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and promoted microglia switch to M2. Meanwhile, curcumin treatment also decreased the expressions of TLR4, Myd88 and NF-κB at 24 h post SAH. TLR4 deficiency ameliorated brain water content, neurological deficit and reduced pro-inflammation cytokines after SAH. Moreover, curcumin treatment in tlr4-/- mice further induced M2 polarization, while had no statistic difference on brain water content and neurological score at 24 h post SAH. Our results indicated that curcumin treatment alleviated neuro-inflammation response through promoting microglia phenotype shift toward M2, and which might inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway after SAH.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.01223", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2985389420", "source": "openalex"}

In Italy, due to the aging of the population, increase in chronicity and morbidity of pathologies, and presence of islands and rural areas, health needs to be supported by innovative technologies. Telemedicine is a method of providing healthcare services at distance, remotely connecting health professionals and patients (or two professionals). In Italy, telemedicine is under development, and the NHS has not yet exploited and independently developed all the possibilities that telemedicine offers. Telerehabilitation consists in the use of information and communication technologies for the remote support of rehabilitation services. By allowing \"home care\", it represents a valid support during the home rehabilitation process. This review is aimed at evaluating the role of telerehabilitation in Italy, with regard to the motor and cognitive rehabilitation programs applied to neurological pathologies, in both pediatric and adult patients. We screened the studies published between 2010 and 2019 on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Sciences databases. Using the PICO model, the search combined the terms \"telerehabilitation\"; \"neurological disorders\"; \"neurodegenerative disease\", \"motor telerehabilitation\"; \"cognitive rehabilitation\". This review showed that telerehabilitation is a promising healthcare tool, as it guarantees continuity of care over time (after discharge) and in space (from hospital to patient's home), especially in patients with stroke. Furthermore, it allows to increase the frequency and intensity of rehabilitation programs, provide individualized rehabilitation treatment in comfortable and familiar environment for patient, monitor and evaluate patients' needs and progress, stimulate patient motivation and achieve better patient satisfaction, verify the results achieved by the patients, and potentially reduce the service costs. Unfortunately, almost all neurorehabilitation studies are characterized by small samples and wide variability of results, and would benefit from standardized procedures, aims and targets. Future telerehabilitation trials should include cost-effectiveness analysis associated with clinical outcomes to better assess the validity of this promising tool.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.563375", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3090975934", "source": "openalex"}

In general, this information is the average of the wind speed over time. The wind reports are crucial for designing wind turbine controllers. But when working with floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT), two problems arise regarding the wind measurement. On the one hand, there are no buoys at deep sea, but near the coast where the wind is not so strong neither so stable; so the measurements do not fully correspond to reality. On the other hand, these floating devices are subjected to extreme environmental conditions (waves, currents, ...) that produce disturbances and thus may distort wind measurements. To address this problem, this work presents a novel pitch neuro-control architecture based on neuro-estimators of the effective wind. The control system is composed of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, a lookup table, a neuro-estimator, and a virtual sensor. The neuro-estimator is used to estimate the effective wind in the FOWT and to forecast its future value. Both current and future wind signals are combined and power the controller. The virtual sensor also provides a measure of the effective wind based on other available signals related to the wind turbine, such as the pitch angle and the angular velocity of the generator. Neural networks are trained online to adapt to changes in the environment. Intensive simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of this neuro control approach. Controller performance is compared to a PID, obtaining better results. Indeed, an improvement of 16% for sinusoidal wind and an average improvement of 8% are observed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3051063", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3120458475", "source": "openalex"}

Study 1 demonstrated that temptations augment the effect of habit on technology use, and reduce the effect of satisfaction on use. Study 2 showed that temptations strengthen the effect of habit on impulsive technology use, and weaken the effect of behavioral expectations on impulsive technology use. Hence, the results consistently support the notion that information technology users' behaviors are influenced by reflective and impulsive information processing systems; and that the equilibrium of these systems is determined, at least in part, by one's temptations.

Neuro-spike communication is an example of this communication paradigm which transfers vital information about external and internal conditions of the body through the nervous system. The analysis of this communication paradigm is beneficial to exploit in the artificial neural systems where nano-machines are linked to neurons to treat the neurodegenerative diseases. In these networks, nano-machines are used to replace the damaged segments of the nervous system and they exactly behave like biological entities. In neuro-spike communication, neurons / nano-machines exploit the electro-chemical spikes and molecular communication to transfer information. This communication paradigm can be divided into three main parts, namely the axonal pathway, the synaptic transmission, and the spike generation. In this paper, we focus on the axonal transmission part as a separate channel since the capacity of the axonal pathway has a significant effect on the capacity of neuro-spike communication channel. In thinner axons, the capacity of this part is the bottleneck of the neuro-spike communication channel capacity. Hence, we investigate the restricting factors of the axonal transmission which limit its capacity. We derive the capacity of single-input single-output and multiple-input single-output (MISO) axonal channels. In the MISO case, we investigate the effect of the correlation among inputs on the channel capacity. Moreover, we derive a closed form description for the optimum value of the input spike rate to maximize the capacity of the axonal channel when the information is encoded by firing rate of neurons / nano-machines.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnb.2018.2800899", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2791848227", "source": "openalex"}

In this review, we analyse the interactions between the cytokine, the neuropeptide and the hormonal networks in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We first consider pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in RA. An inappropriate response to cortisol in chronic inflammation has been reported, i.e., a decrease of the corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH) secretion by the hypothalamus. In contrast, the immunostimulant hormone prolactin (PRL) is upregulated. PRL is released by the pituitary after stimulation by neuropeptides [serotonin, thyroid-releasing-hormone (TRH), or vasoactive-intestinal-peptide (VIP)], and is down-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6). The decreased testosterone concentration observed in male RA patients is associated with HLA B 15. Thus, an altered sex hormone status and a genetic predisposition are related to HLA antigens, and increase the subject's susceptibility to the development of RA. The terminal C fibres release neurotransmitters such as substance P, neurokinin A and calcitonin-gene-related-peptide (CGRP) within the joints, and contribute to local inflammation, synoviocyte proliferation and collagenase production. The parasympathetic system may attenuate the immune response through the neuropeptide VIP.

Access is currently limited by the relatively small number of neuro-ophthalmologists, and consequently, patients may be affected by incorrect or delayed diagnosis. The objective of this study is to analyze referral patterns to neuro-ophthalmologists, characterize rates of misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses in patients ultimately referred, and delineate outcomes after neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 300 new patients seen over 45 randomly chosen days between June 2011 and June 2015 in one tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology clinic. Demographics, distance traveled, time between onset and neuro-ophthalmology consultation (NOC), time between appointment request and NOC, number and types of providers seen before referral, unnecessary tests before referral, referral diagnoses, final diagnoses, and impact of the NOC on outcome were collected. Results: Patients traveled a median of 36.5 miles (interquartile range [IQR]: 20–85). Median time from symptom onset was 210 days (IQR: 70–1,100). Median time from referral to NOC was 34 days (IQR: 7–86), with peaks at one week (urgent requests) and 13 weeks (routine requests). Median number of previous providers seen was 2 (IQR: 2–4; range:0–10), and 102 patients (34%) had seen multiple providers within the same specialty before referral. Patients were most commonly referred for NOC by ophthalmologists (41% of referrals). Eighty-one percent (242/300) of referrals to neuro-ophthalmology were appropriate referrals. Of the 300 patients referred, 247 (82%) were complex or very complex; 119 (40%) were misdiagnosed; 147 (49%) were at least partially misdiagnosed; and 22 (7%) had unknown diagnoses. Women were more likely to be at least partially misdiagnosed—108 of 188 (57%) vs 39 of 112 (35%) of men ( P &lt; 0.001). Mismanagement or delay in care occurred in 85 (28%), unnecessary tests in 56 (19%), unnecessary consultations in 64 (22%), and imaging misinterpretation in 16 (5%). Neuro-ophthalmologists played a major role in directing treatment, such as preserving vision, preventing life-threatening complications, or avoiding harmful treatment in 62 (21%) patients.

This impairment leads to aberrant craving behavior and other behaviors such as Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Neurogenetic research in both animal and humans revealed that there is a well-defined cascade in the reward site of the brain that leads to normal dopamine release. This cascade has been termed the \"Brain Reward Cascade\" (BRC). Any impairment due to either genetics or environmental influences on this cascade will result in a reduced amount of dopamine release in the brain reward site.

Next, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is designed to produce the optimal control force. Thereafter, the LQG controller and the INV-MR models are linked to control the structure. The coupled LQG and INV-MR system was used to train a semi-active neuro-controller, designated as SA-NC, which produces the necessary control voltage that actuates the MR damper. To evaluate the proposed method, the SA-NC is compared to passive lead–rubber bearing isolation systems (LRBs). Results revealed that the SA-NC was quite effective in seismic response reduction for wide range of motions from moderate to severe seismic events compared to the passive systems. In addition, the semi-active MR damper enjoys many desirable features, such as its inherent stability, practicality and small power requirements. The effectiveness of the SA-NC is illustrated and verified using simulated response of a six-degree-of-freedom model of a base-isolated building excited by several historical earthquake records.

In this study, two different optimized adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference systems ( ANFIS ), ANFIS with grid partition ( ANFIS‐GP ) and ANFIS with subtractive clustering ( ANFIS‐SC ), and M5Tree ( M5Tree ) methods are proposed for modelling daily global solar radiation (G). Daily meteorological variables at 21 stations in China are used for training and testing the applied models, which is evaluated through root mean square errors ( RMSE ), mean absolute errors ( MAE ) and determination coefficient ( R 2 ). Above models will be compared with a calibrated empirical Ångström model and the results indicate that the ANFIS models provide better accuracy than the M5Tree and empirical method, for example, the RMSE values for ANFIS‐SC , ANFIS‐GP , M5Tree and the Ångström model range 2.10–3.08, 2.07–3.08, 2.79–3.87 and 2.54–3.69 MJ m −2 day −1 , respectively. The model performances also show some differences at different stations for each model, for example, the ANFIS models produce the most accurate estimations at station 58238, while M5Tree brings the best accuracy at the station 51777. Meanwhile, the models underestimate high radiation values for some stations, which may due to the differences in training and testing data ranges and distribution of the stations.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2394710979", "title": "Postural Control in the Lamprey: A Study With a Neuro-Mechanical Model", "text": "The swimming lamprey normally maintains the dorsal-side-up orientation due to activity of the postural control system driven by vestibular organs. Commands for postural corrections are transmitted from the brain stem to the spinal cord mainly by the reticulospinal (RS) pathways. As shown in previous studies, RS neurons are activated by contralateral roll tilt, they exhibit a strong dynamic response, but much weaker static response. Here we test a hypothesis that decoding of these commands in the spinal cord is based on the subtraction of signals in the left and right RS pathways. In this study, we used a neuro-mechanical model. An intact lamprey was mounted on a platform that restrained its postural activity but allowed lateral locomotor undulations to occur. The activity in the left and right RS pathways was recorded by implanted electrodes. These natural biological signals were then used to control an electrical motor rotating the animal around its longitudinal axis toward the stronger signal. It was found that this “hybrid” system automatically stabilized a normal orientation of the lamprey in the gravitational field. The system compensated for large postural disturbances (lateral tilt up to ±180°) due to wide angular zones of the gravitational sensitivity of RS neurons. In the nonswimming lamprey, activity of RS neurons and their vestibular responses were considerably reduced, and the system was not able to stabilize the normal orientation. However, the balance could be restored by imposing small oscillations on the lamprey, which elicited additional activation of the vestibular organs. This finding indicates that head oscillations caused by locomotor movements may contribute to postural stabilization. In addition to postural stabilization, the neuro-mechanical model reproduced a number of postural effects characteristic of the lamprey: 1) unilateral eye illumination elicited a lateral tilt (“dorsal light response”) due to a shift of the equilibrium point in the vestibular-driven postural network; 2) removal of one labyrinth resulted in a loss of postural control due to an induced left-right asymmetry in the vestibulo-reticulospinal reflexes, which 3) could be compensated for by asymmetrical visual input. The main conclusion of the present study is that natural supraspinal commands for postural corrections in the roll plane can be effectively decoded on the basis of subtraction of the effects of signals delivered by the left and right RS pathways. Possible mechanisms for this transformation are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2000.84.6.2880", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2394710979", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this study was to simulate instrumented, clinical assessment of the hamstring muscles in CP using a conceptual model of contracture and spasticity, and to determine to what extent contracture can be explained by altered passive muscle stiffness, and spasticity by (purely) velocity-dependent stretch reflex. Instrumented hamstrings spasticity assessment was performed on 11 children with CP and 9 typically developing children. In this test, the knee was passively stretched at slow and fast speed, and knee angle, applied forces and EMG were measured. A dedicated OpenSim model was created with motion and muscles around the knee only. Contracture was modeled by optimizing the passive muscle stiffness parameters of vasti and hamstrings, based on slow stretch data. Spasticity was modeled using a velocity-dependent feedback controller, with threshold values derived from experimental data and gain values optimized for individual subjects. Forward dynamic simulations were performed to predict muscle behavior during slow and fast passive stretches. Both slow and fast stretch data could be successfully simulated by including subject-specific levels of contracture and, for CP fast stretches, spasticity. The RMS errors of predicted knee motion in CP were 1.1 ± 0.9° for slow and 5.9 ± 2.1° for fast stretches. CP hamstrings were found to be stiffer compared with TD, and both hamstrings and vasti were more compliant than the original generic model, except for the CP hamstrings. The purely velocity-dependent spasticity model could predict response during fast passive stretch in terms of predicted knee angle, muscle activity, and fiber length and velocity. Only sustained muscle activity, independent of velocity, was not predicted by our model. The presented individually tunable, conceptual model for contracture and spasticity could explain most of the hamstring muscle behavior during slow and fast passive stretch. Future research should attempt to apply the model to study the effects of spasticity and contracture during dynamic tasks such as gait.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-016-0170-5", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2469455623", "source": "openalex"}

Our objective was to determine the frequency of ocular OMG in patients referred to an academic neuro-ophthalmologist and determine alternate diagnoses and response to therapy.We performed a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the University of Kansas Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic with suspected OMG over 9 years. We defined OMG as isolated ptosis/diplopia at initial presentation supported by at least one of the following abnormal tests: edrophonium test, ice test, Cogan lid twitch, fatigability on sustained upgaze, acetylcholine receptor binding antibody, greater than 10% decrement on repetitive stimulation, or abnormal single-fiber jitter. We also determined the cause of ptosis/diplopia if it was not the result of OMG. Patients who progressed from OMG to generalized disease were termed transformed myasthenia gravis (TMG).One hundred thirty-eight patients were referred with mean age at presentation 58 ± 19 years. Myasthenia gravis was diagnosed in 101 patients; 95 had OMG; six had generalized MG. Diagnosis in the other 37 was cranial nerve palsies (nine), levator dehiscence (five), multiple sclerosis (two), blepharospasm (two), decompensated phorias (three), accommodation spasm (four), exophoria (three), skew deviation (two), Graves disease (one), hypertropia (one), myopathy (one), neurosarcoidosis (one), progressive supranuclear palsy (one), Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (one), and obstructive sleep apnea (one). Mean follow-up was 3.0 ± 2.8 years. Test sensitivity/specificity in OMG was fatigability on sustained upgaze 0.80/0.63; ice pack 0.80/0.25; Cogan lid twitch 0.59/1.00; edrophonium 0.88/0.50; acetylcholine receptor binding antibody 0.38/1.00; repetitive nerve stimulation 0.24/1.00; and single-fiber electromyography 0.90/1.00. Pyridostigmine was used without prednisone in 59 of 97 patients with OMG and 12 of 59 developed TMG.

We compared the RANO criteria with updated modifications (modified RANO [mRANO] and immunotherapy RANO [iRANO] criteria) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) and recurrent GBM (rGBM) to evaluate the performance of each set of criteria and inform the development of the planned RANO 2.0 update. MATERIALS AND METHODS Evaluation of tumor measurements and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences were performed by blinded readers to determine disease progression using RANO, mRANO, iRANO, and other response assessment criteria. Spearman's correlations between progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. RESULTS Five hundred twenty-six nGBM and 580 rGBM cases were included. Spearman's correlations were similar between RANO and mRANO (0.69 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.75] v 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.73]) in nGBM and rGBM (0.48 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.55] v 0.50 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.57]). In nGBM, requirement of a confirmation scan within 12 weeks of completion of radiotherapy to determine progression was associated with improved correlations. Use of the postradiation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as baseline scan was associated with improved correlation compared with use of the pre-radiation MRI (0.67 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.73] v 0.53 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.62]). Evaluation of FLAIR sequences did not improve the correlation. Among patients who received immunotherapy, Spearman's correlations were similar among RANO, mRANO, and iRANO. CONCLUSION RANO and mRANO demonstrated similar correlations between PFS and OS. Confirmation scans were only beneficial in nGBM within 12 weeks of completion of radiotherapy, and there was a trend in favor of the use of postradiation MRI as the baseline scan in nGBM. Evaluation of FLAIR can be omitted.

Research in neuro-architecture—the neural basis of human perception of and interaction with the surrounding architecture—promises to advance our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying this common human experience and also to inspire evidence-based architectural design principles. This article examines the current state of the field and offers a path for moving closer to fulfilling this promise. The paper is structured in three sections, beginning with an introduction to neuro-architecture, outlining its main objectives and giving an overview of experimental research in the field. Afterward, two methodological limitations attending current brain-imaging architectural research are discussed: the first concerns the limited focus of the research, which is often restricted to the aesthetic dimension of architectural experience; the second concerns practical limitations imposed by the typical experimental tools and methods, which often require participants to remain stationary and prevent naturalistic interaction with architectural surroundings. Next, we propose that the theoretical basis of ecological psychology provides a framework for addressing these limitations and motivates emphasizing the role of embodied exploration in architectural experience, which encompasses but is not limited to aesthetic contemplation. In this section, some basic concepts within ecological psychology and their convergences with architecture are described. Lastly, we introduce Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) as one emerging brain imaging approach with the potential to improve the ecological validity of neuro-architecture research. Accordingly, we suggest that combining theoretical and conceptual resources from ecological psychology with state-of-the-art neuroscience methods (Mobile Brain/Body Imaging) is a promising way to bring neuro-architecture closer to accomplishing its scientific and practical goals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.833528", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4229368736", "source": "openalex"}

The results from the German-Austrian Glioma trial (GAG, 1983 to 1988) demonstrated a survival benefit for chemotherapy using carmustine (BCNU) plus teniposide (VM26) over BCNU alone in addition to radiotherapy in patients with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) more than 60. The Neuro-Oncology Working Group (NOA) of the German Cancer Society therefore compared the efficacy of nimustine (ACNU) plus VM26 and ACNU plus cytarabine (Ara-C) chemotherapy in addition to standard radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. Patients and Methods: From 1994 to 2000, 375 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and cycles of ACNU 90 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) on day 1 and VM26 60 mg/m 2 IV on days 1 to 3 (n = 183), or ACNU 90 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 and Ara-C 120 mg/m 2 IV on days 1 to 3 (n = 179), in 6-week intervals. Thirteen patients were not eligible after central neuropathology review. The remaining 362 patients had glioblastoma (n = 301) or anaplastic glioma (n = 61). Results: Median survival and 2-year survival rates were 17.3 months and 25% for ACNU plus VM26, and 15.7 months and 29% for ACNU plus Ara-C in glioblastoma, and 60 months and 88% for ACNU plus VM26 and 62.5 months and 72% for ACNU plus Ara-C in anaplastic glioma. Multivariate analysis revealed no survival advantage for either arm or for subpopulations defined by histology, age, or KPS. Hematologic toxicity was more prominent in the ACNU plus Ara-C arm. Conclusion: The median survival times and 2-year survival rates for patients with anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma achieved in the NOA-01 trial compare favorably with historical trials and with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group database. The toxicity profile favors ACNU plus VM26 for further evaluation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2003.03.509", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2400892281", "source": "openalex"}

This article summarizes our current understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of glial differentiation based on data obtained in cell culture and reviews current hypotheses regarding the transcriptional control of the gene switching that controls differentiation. Understanding normal glial differentiation has potentially far-reaching implications for developing new forms of treatment for patients with glial neoplasms. If oncogenesis truly involves a blockage or a short circuiting of the differentiation process in adult glial progenitor cells, or if it results from dedifferentiation of previously mature cells, then a clear understanding of differentiation may provide a key to understanding and potentially curtailing malignancy. Differentiation agents represent a relatively new class of drugs that effect cellular gene transcription at the nuclear level, probably through alterations in chromatin configuration and/or differential gene induction. These exciting new agents may provide a means of preventing the dedifferentiation of low-grade gliomas or inducing malignant glioma cells to differentiate with minimal toxicity.

In fact, the continuous operation of many industrial machines such as sub-sea pumps and gas turbines relies on the correct performance of their rotating equipment. In order to reduce the probability of malfunctions in this equipment, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis systems are essential. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to perform fault diagnosis in rotating equipment based on permutation entropy, signal processing, and artificial intelligence. To that aim, vibration signals are employed for an indication of bearing performance. In order to facilitate fault diagnosis, fault detection and isolation are performed in two separate steps. As first, once a vibration signal is received, the faulty state of the bearing is determined by permutation entropy. In case a faulty state is detected, the fault type is determined using an approach based on signal processing and artificial intelligence. Wavelet packet transform and envelope analysis of the vibration signals are utilized to extract the frequency components of the fault. The proposed approach allows for the automatic selection of a frequency band that includes the characteristic resonance frequency of the fault, which is subject to change in different operational conditions. The method works by extracting the proper features of the signals that are used to decide about the faulty bearing's condition by a multi-output adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system classifier. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed by the Case Western Reserve University dataset: the analysis demonstrates the proposed method's capabilities in accurately diagnosing faults in rotating equipment as compared to existing approaches.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117754", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4290958435", "source": "openalex"}

By using solar active trackers, it is possible to maximize generation capacity through real-time positioning. However, if the engines that update the position of the panels use more energy than the difference in efficiency, the solar tracker system becomes ineffective. In this way, a time series forecasting method can be assumed to determine the generation capacity in a pre-established horizon prediction to evaluate if a position update would provide efficient results. Among a wide range of algorithms that can be used in forecasting, this work considered a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System due to its combined advantages such as smoothness property from Fuzzy systems and adaptability property from neural networks structures. Focusing on time series forecasting, this article presents a model and evaluates the solar prediction capacity using the Wavelet Neuro-Fuzzy algorithm, where Wavelets were included in the model for feature extraction. In this sense, this paper aims to evaluate whether it is possible to obtain reasonable accuracy using a hybrid model for electric power generation forecasting considering solar trackers. The main contributions of this work are related to the efficiency improvement of PV panels.

Emerging evidence has shown the virus to cause hemorrhagic and immunologic responses, which impact all organs, including lungs, kidneys, and the brain, as well as extremities. SARS-CoV-2 also affects patients’, families’, and society’s mental health at large. There is growing evidence of re-infection in some patients. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, its mechanism of infection, diagnostics, therapeutics, and treatment strategies, while also focusing on less attended aspects by previous studies, including nutritional support, psychological, and rehabilitation of the pandemic and its management. We performed a systematic review of &gt;1,000 articles and included 425 references from online databases, including, PubMed, Google Scholar, and California Baptist University’s library. COVID-19 patients go through acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, acute hypercoagulable state, and autonomic dysfunction, which must be managed by a multidisciplinary team including nursing, nutrition, and rehabilitation. The elderly population and those who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia related illnesses seem to be at the higher risk. There are 28 vaccines under development, and new treatment strategies/protocols are being investigated. The future management for COVID-19 should include B-cell and T-cell immunotherapy in combination with emerging prophylaxis. The mental health and illness aspect of COVID-19 are among the most important side effects of this pandemic which requires a national plan for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-200831", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3085523713", "source": "openalex"}

Impaired self-awareness after acquired brain injury is also common and can, along with other factors, affect the identity change a person may experience. Holistic rehabilitation programmes attempt to address both cognitive and emotional difficulties and specifically problems of self-awareness after brain injury. Does identity change require longer-term rehabilitation interventions? This paper describes a community-based neuro-rehabilitation service that has incorporated some principles from more traditional holistic programmes with a view to providing long-term, low-intensity brain injury rehabilitation. Specific reference is made to problems of identity and how these may be addressed during long-term psychotherapeutic follow-up. The potential relevance of the total duration of rehabilitation input rather than simply the number of sessions when working with adjustment and identity change after brain injury in community settings is discussed. The service model is compared to more traditional holistic rehabilitation programmes. A case study and early outcome data are presented to illustrate some of these points and to provide more information about the nature of the programme.

Abnormal neuronal distribution, layer formation, and dopaminergic neuronal projections were observed in the neocortex. Disruption of microglial differentiation (M1/M2 microglial ratio) and abnormal expression of pro-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors were induced, and these abnormalities were ameliorated by co-treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug (pioglitazone).

We combined cytosolic calcium uncaging of individual enteric neurons with calcium imaging of enteric glial cells expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator and demonstrate that enteric neurons signal to enteric glial cells through pannexins using paracrine purinergic pathways. Sparse labeling of enteric neurons and high‐resolution analysis of the structural relation between neuronal cell bodies, varicose release sites and enteric glia uncovered that this form of neuron‐to‐glia communication is contained between the cell body of an enteric neuron and its surrounding enteric glial cells.

In order to avoid matrix interferences the maximal concentration of wet weight fish tissue exposed to the neuro-2a cells was set at 20 mg tissue equivalent (TE) ml−1 according to the sample preparation procedure applied. In the present study, the limit of quantification (LOQ) of CTX1B equivalents in fish extract was set at the limit of detection (LOD), being defined as the concentration of CTX1B equivalents inhibiting 20% cell viability (IC20). The LOQ was estimated as 0.0096 ng CTX1B eq. g TE−1 with 23–31% variability between experiments. These values were deemed sufficient even though quantification given at the IC50 (the concentration of CTX1B equivalents inhibiting 50% cell viability) is more accurate with a variability of 17–19% between experiments. Among the 13 fish samples tested, four fish samples were toxic to the neuro-2a cells with estimations of the content in CTX1B g−1 of TE ranging from 0.058 (±0.012) to 6.23 (±0.713) ng CTX1B eq. g TE−1. The high sensitivity and specificity of the assay for CTX1B confirmed its suitability as a screening tool of CTX-like compounds in fish extracts at levels that may cause ciguatera fish poisoning. Species identification of fish samples by DNA sequence analysis was conducted in order to confirm tentatively the identity of ciguatera risk species and it revealed some evidence of inadvertent misidentification.

A multitude of molecular profiling studies in recent years has unveiled a number of genetic abnormalities unique to pediatric brain tumors. It has now become clear that brain tumors that arise in children have distinct pathogenesis and biology, compared with their adult counterparts, even for those with indistinguishable histopathology. Some of the molecular features are so specific to a particular type of tumors, such as the presence of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene for pilocytic astrocytomas or SMARCB1 mutations for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, that they could practically serve as a diagnostic marker on their own. Expression profiling has resolved the existence of 4 molecular subgroups in medulloblastomas, which positively translated into improved prognostication for the patients. The currently available molecular markers, however, do not cover all tumors even within a single tumor entity. The molecular pathogenesis of a large number of pediatric brain tumors is still unaccounted for, and the hierarchy of tumors is likely to be more complex and intricate than currently acknowledged. One of the main tasks of future molecular analyses in pediatric neuro-oncology, including the ongoing genome sequencing efforts, is to elucidate the biological basis of those orphan tumors. The ultimate goal of molecular diagnostics is to accurately predict the clinical and biological behavior of any tumor by means of their molecular characteristics, which is hoped to eventually pave the way for individualized treatment.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nos204", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2099464829", "source": "openalex"}

This method demonstrates that as women age, the transfer of sympathetic nerve activity into vascular tone is increased, so that for a given level of sympathetic activity there is more vasoconstriction. In men, this measure decreases with age. Test–re‐test analysis demonstrated that the new method is a reliable estimate of sympathetic transduction. We conclude that increased sympathetic vascular coupling contributes to the age‐related increase in blood pressure that occurs in women only. This measure is a reliable estimate of sympathetic transduction in populations with high sympathetic nerve activity. Thus, it will provide information regarding whether treatment targeting the sympathetic nervous system, which interrupts the transfer of sympathetic nerve activity into vascular tone, will be effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients. This may provide insight into which populations will respond to certain types of anti‐hypertensive medication. Abstract Sex and age differences in the sympathetic control of resting blood pressure (BP) may be due to differences in the transduction of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) into vascular tone. Current methods for dynamically quantifying transduction focus on the relationship between SNA and vasoconstriction during a pressor stimulus, which increases BP and may be contra‐indicated in patients. We describe a simple analytical method for quantifying transduction under resting conditions. We performed linear regression analysis of binned muscle SNA burst areas against diastolic BP (DBP). We assessed whether the slope of this relationship reflects the transduction of SNA into DBP. To evaluate this, we investigated whether this measure captures differences in transduction in different populations. Specifically, we (1) quantified transduction in young men (YM), young women (YW), older men (OM) and postmenopausal women (PMW); and (2) measured changes in transduction during β‐blockade using propranolol in YW, YM and PMW. YM had a greater transduction vs . OM (0.10 ± 0.01 mmHg (% s) −1 , n = 23 vs . 0.06 ± 0.01 mmHg (% s) −1 , n = 18; P = 0.003). Transduction was lowest in YW (0.02 ± 0.01 mmHg (% s) −1 , n = 23) and increased during β‐blockade (0.11 ± 0.01 mmHg (% s) −1 ; P &lt; 0.001). Transduction in PMW (0.07 ± 0.01 mmHg (% s) −1 , n = 23) was greater compared to YW ( P = 0.001), and was not altered during β‐blockade (0.06 ± 0.01 mmHg (% s) −1 ; P = 0.98). Importantly, transduction increased in women with age, but decreased in men. Transduction in women intersected that in men at 55 ± 1.5 years. This measure of transduction captures age‐ and sex‐differences in the sympathetic regulation of DBP and may be valuable in quantifying transduction in disease. In particular, this measure may help target treatment strategies in specific hypertensive subpopulations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1113/jp272167", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2336020467", "source": "openalex"}

It raises the questions of whether the current laws regarding helmet use are satisfactory, and whether helmets currently used are of an adequate standard.The records over a 20-year period of one neuro-ophthalmologist in Adelaide were reviewed producing 22 patients with neuro-ophthalmological sequelae of head injuries as a result of horse-related accidents.There were 22 patients (16 female, six male), one of whom was involved in three separate accidents, Of these, seven were professional riders and 15 amateur.

The most common neuro-ophthalmological complication found was a fourth-nerve palsy in 11 patients. Five patients had a significant loss of vision and two of these were severe enough to warrant a blind pension.Horse riding and working around horses constitute an occupation or recreation with inherent dangers. Previous studies have shown that wearing of protective headgear reduces the risk and severity of head injuries, and helmet use should be vigorously promoted.

Resident brain glial cells, such as astrocytes not only contribute to neuroinflammation after stroke, but also secrete a wide range of trophic factors that can promote post–stroke brain repair. Alternatively, activated microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils in the innate immune system, traditionally considered as major damaging factors after stroke, have been suggested to be extensively involved in brain repair after stroke. The adaptive immune system may also have its bright side during the late regenerative phase, affecting the immune suppressive regulatory T cells and B cells.

It has been argued that neuro-enhancement discourses implicitly propagate new responsibilities that oblige individuals to continually 'work on' their brain to ensure its health and productivity. However, much of this critique relies on rather abstract analyses of discursive trends, with relatively little consideration of empirical evidence illuminating the role played by more 'micro' social dynamics, such as interpersonal relationships, in the logics and practices of neuro-enhancement. This article proposes a novel perspective on neuro-enhancement by reviewing existing empirical literature enlightening everyday engagements with neuro-enhancement, and suggesting that relationality, rather than pure individualism, may be a better framework for conceptualising these findings. The article advances this argument through a particular focus on two major preoccupations of neuro-enhancement discourses, namely enhancing children's brains and preventing age-related cognitive deterioration. The article synthesises the empirical evidence showing that these two concerns are essentially relational in experience, and considers how familial relationships and conceptualisations of caregiving lie at the core of how neuro-enhancement concepts and technologies unfold in everyday life. The article offers insights from the philosophical literature on relationality as a conceptual framework to steer further investigation of neuro-enhancement's impact on contemporary society. A more holistic understanding of the relational dynamics that characterise everyday engagement with neuro-enhancement practices will enable better anticipation of the risks and benefits such practices may entail, due to greater insight into how they are likely to be enacted in context.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2017.00001", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2598559438", "source": "openalex"}

A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is then utilized to estimate the preceding vehicle model, and the predicted state sequence of the preceding vehicle can be obtained. Second, based on these predicted data, the following vehicle is controlled by the proposed ANFPC scheme to maintain each vehicle within the desired distance headway and thus achieve string stability of vehicle platooning and fuel efficiency. The experimental results on the CarSim environment show that the proposed control strategy for the CACC system can significantly reduce the fuel consumption while ensuring driving comfort and safety.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2901498", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2924471456", "source": "openalex"}

We now use qualitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR to demonstrate that LIF and LIF-receptor (LIF-R) are constitutively expressed in the normal mouse hypothalamus and pituitary. Hypothalamic and pituitary LIF and LIF-R are significantly induced (up to 6- and 4-fold, respectively) in vivo in response to lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) administered to B6D2F1 and C57BL/6 mice. In contrast to the nearly exclusive expression of matrix-associated LIF messenger RNA (mRNA) in control hypothalamus and pituitary, both diffusible and matrix-associated LIF mRNA alternate transcripts are induced by LPS. Furthermore, the time course of peripheral ACTH-response to LPS peaks at 60 min, whereas hypothalamic LIF mRNA increase occurs at 30 min and pituitary LIF induction occurs at 60 min. These results show that mLIF is a novel LPS-inducible proinflammatory neuroendocrine cytokine and the alternatively spliced diffusible LIF may play a paracrine role in activating pituitary ACTH secretion in synergy with hypothalamic CRH, implying a mechanism for central nervous system cytokine responses to immune signals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.137.7.8770918", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2061014281", "source": "openalex"}

The proposed technique is an advance over a recent linear statistical mapping technique. It uses nonlinear mapping to overcome the accuracy limitations of the linear mapping in modeling large statistical variations among different devices. For a given population of device samples, the nominal device model is determined from dc, small-, and large-signal data. The behavior of a random device in the population is obtained by a nonlinear mapping from that of the nominal device. The unknown mapping function is represented by neural networks trained using dc and small-signal data of various devices in the population. A novel statistical mapping is formulated by introducing a compact set of statistical variables to control the mapping to map from the nominal device toward different devices in the population. A new training method is proposed for simultaneous statistical parameter extraction and neural-network training. The proposed technique is confirmed by statistical modeling of microwave transistor examples, and use of the models in statistical analyses of a two-stage amplifier. It is demonstrated that, for small or large statistical variations, the proposed technique outperforms the existing methods, using a minimum amount of expensive large-signal data to provide the most accurate large-signal statistical model.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tmtt.2008.2004894", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2157288474", "source": "openalex"}

However, the ophthalmic features and their relationship to the neurologic features of SCA7 have not been widely reported. The goal of this study was to provide increased documentation.The medical records of 10 consecutive patients with SCA7 examined in the Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic at Kresge Eye Institute between 2000 and 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. Each patient underwent a standardized ophthalmologic and neurologic examination. Some patients also underwent electroretinography (ERG). Eight patients had genetically confirmed disease and 2 patients had presumptive SCA7 based on their clinical presentation. Patients were excluded if they had visual loss or ataxia due to other causes.Nine patients reported visual symptoms at presentation, including hemeralopia, photophobia, dyschromatopsia, and blurred vision. In 3 of these patients, the visual symptoms had preceded the onset of ataxic symptoms. Visual acuity was abnormal in all patients at presentation. Four patients with visual dysfunction had normal or minimally abnormal macular pigmentary changes, but all patients had abnormal electroretinograms (ERGs) showing primarily cone dysfunction. The severity of visual loss and the severity of ataxia were frequently discordant.Based on this study, patients with SCA7 often have visual symptoms that may precede, accompany, or follow the onset of ataxic symptoms. The severity of vision loss and ataxia may be discordant. Ophthalmoscopic evidence of macular abnormalities may be scant, but results of ERG will always be abnormal.

Pathophysiology of Type II DM and co-morbidities in Type II DM has been correlated with stress mechanisms. Stress suppresses body's immune system and neuro-humoral actions thereby aff ecting normal psychological state. It would not be wrong to state that correlation of diabetes with stress, anxiety and other psychological factors are bidirectional and lead to difficulty in understanding the interrelated mechanisms. Type II DM cannot be understood in isolation with psychological factors such as stress, anxiety and depression, neuro-endocrine and immunological factors. There is no review which tries to understand these mechanisms exclusively. The present literature review aims to understand interrelated Psycho-Neuro-Endocrine and Immunological mechanisms of action of Yoga in Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Published literature concerning mechanisms of action of Yoga in Type II DM emphasizing psycho-neuro-endocrine or immunological relations was retrieved from Pubmed using key words yoga, Type II diabetes mellitus, psychological, neural, endocrine, immune and mechanism of action. Those studies which explained the psycho-neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms of action of yoga were included and rest were excluded. Although primary aim of this study is to explain these mechanisms in Type II DM, some studies in non-diabetic population which had a similar pathway of stress mechanism was included because many insightful studies were available in that area. Search was conducted using terms yoga OR yogic AND diabetes OR diabetic IN title OR abstract for English articles. Of the 89 articles, we excluded non-English articles (22), editorials (20) and letters to editor (10). 37 studies were considered for this review. The postulated mechanism of action of yoga is through parasympathetic activation and the associated anti stress mechanism. It reduces perceived stress and HPA axis activation thereby improving overall metabolic and psychological profiles, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism.

In support of future imaging studies of mental health disorders and their treatment, the Neuro/PsyGRID consortium commissioned a calibration experiment to acquire functional and structural MRI from twelve healthy volunteers attending five centers on two occasions. Measures were derived of task activation from a working memory paradigm, fractal scaling (Hurst exponent) from resting fMRI, and grey matter distributions from T 1 ‐weighted sequences. At each intracerebral voxel a fixed‐effects analysis of variance estimated components of variance corresponding to factors of center, subject, occasion, and within‐occasion order, and interactions of center‐by‐occasion, subject‐by‐occasion, and center‐by‐subject, the latter (since there is no intervention) a surrogate of the expected variance of the treatment effect standard error across centers. A rank order test of between‐center differences was indicative of crossover or noncrossover subject‐by‐center interactions. In general, factors of center, subject and error variance constituted &gt;90% of the total variance, whereas occasion, order, and all interactions were generally &lt;5%. Subject was the primary source of variance (70%–80%) for grey‐matter, with error variance the dominant component for fMRI‐derived measures. Spatially, variance was broadly homogenous with the exception of fractal scaling measures which delineated white matter, related to the flip angle of the EPI sequence. Maps of P values for the associated F ‐tests were also derived. Rank tests were highly significant indicating the order of measures across centers was preserved. In summary, center effects should be modeled at the voxel‐level using existing and long‐standing statistical recommendations.

The recurrent neuro-fuzzy network allows the construction of a \"global\" nonlinear long-range prediction model from the fuzzy conjunction of a number of \"local\" linear dynamic models. In this recurrent neuro-fuzzy network, the network output is fed back to the network input through one or more time delay units. This particular structure ensures that predictions from a recurrent neuro-fuzzy network are long-range or multi-step-ahead predictions. Long-range predictions are particularly important for batch processes where the interest lies in the product quality and quantity at the end of a batch. To enhance batch process control and monitoring, a model capable of predicting accurately the product quality/quantity at the end of a batch is required. Process knowledge is used to initially partition the process nonlinear characteristics into several local operating regions and to aid in the initialization of the corresponding network weights. Process input output data is then used to train the network. Membership functions of the local regimes are identified and local models are discovered through network training. An advantage of this recurrent neuro-fuzzy network model is that it is easy to interpret. This helps process operators in understanding the process characteristics.

For example, in the command \"If it snows at night then wake me up early because I don't want to be late for work\" the speaker relies on commonsense reasoning of the listener to infer the implicit presumption that they wish to be woken only if it snows enough to cause traffic slowdowns. We consider here the problem of understanding such imprecisely stated natural language commands given in the form of if-(state), then-(action), because-(goal) statements. More precisely, we consider the problem of identifying the unstated presumptions of the speaker that allow the requested action to achieve the desired goal from the given state (perhaps elaborated by making the implicit presumptions explicit). We release a benchmark data set for this task, collected from humans and annotated with commonsense presumptions. We present a neuro-symbolic theorem prover that extracts multi-hop reasoning chains, and apply it to this problem. Furthermore, to accommodate the reality that current AI commonsense systems lack full coverage, we also present an interactive conversational framework built on our neuro-symbolic system, that conversationally evokes commonsense knowledge from humans to complete its reasoning chains.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16623", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3176075895", "source": "openalex"}

However, partly due to the lack of disease-defining biomarkers, understanding the aetiology of this complex and multifactorial disease remains elusive. This common gastrointestinal disorder is characterised by alterations in bowel habit such as diarrhoea and/or constipation, bloating and abdominal pain, and symptom exacerbation has been linked with periods of stress, both psychosocial and infection-related. Indeed, a high level of comorbidity exists between IBS and stress-related mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Moreover, studies have observed alterations in autonomic output and neuro-endocrine signalling in IBS patients. Accumulating evidence indicates that a maladaptive stress response, probably mediated by the stress hormone, corticotropin-releasing factor contributes to the initiation, persistence and severity of symptom flares. Other risk factors for developing IBS include a positive family history, childhood trauma, dietary factors and prior gastrointestinal infection. An emerging role has been attributed to the importance of immune factors in the pathophysiology of IBS with evidence of altered cytokine profiles and increased levels of mucosal immune cells. These factors have also been shown to have direct effects on neural signalling. This review discusses how pathological changes in neural, immune and endocrine pathways, and communication between these systems, contribute to symptom flares in IBS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i27.8846", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1677067231", "source": "openalex"}

Nonetheless, they still suffer from some limitations that affect their outcome. One of them is the lack of force feedback which restricts the surgeon's sense of touch and might reduce precision during a procedure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel force estimation approach that combines a vision based solution with supervised learning to estimate the applied force and provide the surgeon with a suitable representation of it. The proposed solution starts with extracting the geometry of motion of the heart's surface by minimizing an energy functional to recover its 3D deformable structure. A deep network, based on a LSTM-RNN architecture, is then used to learn the relationship between the extracted visual-geometric information and the applied force, and to find accurate mapping between the two. Our proposed force estimation solution avoids the drawbacks usually associated with force sensing devices, such as biocompatibility and integration issues. We evaluate our approach on phantom and realistic tissues in which we report an average root-mean square error of 0.02 N.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/toh.2016.2640289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2567653866", "source": "openalex"}

LOH at the RB locus was strongly correlated with the absence of RB protein in malignant NE carcinomas, and this association was strongly correlated with the neuro‐endocrine phenotype. Inactivation of the RB protein in primary NE carcinomas, excluding carcinoids, therefore seems to imply in the majority of cases the mutation of one allele and loss of the remaining allele of the Rfl gene, leading to loss of RB‐protein expression.

Here, we identified TGF-beta1 as the major mediator of this event. Identification of TGF-beta1 in neuronal and astrocyte extracts revealed that both cell types might synthesize this factor, however, addition of neurons to astrocyte monolayers greatly increased TGF-beta1 synthesis and secretion by astrocytes. Further, by exploiting the advantages of cell culture system we investigated the influence of neuron and astrocyte developmental stage on such interaction. We demonstrated that younger neurons derived from 14 embryonic days wild-type mice were more efficient in promoting astrocyte differentiation than those derived from 18 embryonic days mice. Similarly, astrocytes also exhibited timed-schedule developed responsiveness to neuronal influence with embryonic astrocytes being more responsive to neurons than newborn and late postnatal astrocytes. RT-PCR assays identified TGF-beta1 transcripts in young but not in old neurons, suggesting that inability to induce astrocyte differentiation is related to TGF-beta1 synthesis and secretion.

The oculomotor system is sensitive to brain trauma; however, neuro-ophthalmologic response to subconcussive head impacts remains unclear. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine whether subconcussive head impacts cause impairments in neuro-ophthalmologic function as measured by the King-Devick test (KDT) and oculomotor function as measured by the near point of convergence. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> In this randomized clinical trial, adult soccer players were randomized into either a heading group or kicking (control) group. The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph. The kicking-control group followed the same protocol but with 10 kicks. Peak linear and rotational head accelerations were assessed with a triaxial accelerometer. The KDT speed and error and near point of convergence were assessed at baseline (preheading or prekicking) and at 0, 2, and 24 hours after heading or kicking. <h3>Exposures</h3> Ten soccer-ball headings or kicks. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> The primary outcome was the group-by-time interaction of KDT speed at 0 hours after heading or kicking. The secondary outcomes included KDT speed at 2 hours and 24 hours after heading or kicking, KDT error, and near point of convergence. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 78 individuals enrolled (heading group, n = 40; kicking-control group, n = 38). Eleven individuals (heading group: 4 women; mean [SD] age, 22.5 [1.0] years; kicking-control group, 3 women and 4 men; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [1.1] years) voluntarily withdrew from the study. Data from 67 participants with a mean (SD) age of 20.6 (1.7) years were eligible for analysis (heading, n = 36; kicking-control, n = 31). Mean (SD) peak linear accelerations and peak rotational accelerations per impact for the heading group were 33.2 (6.8)<i>g</i>and 3.6 (1.4) krad/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

In this paper, several fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy models are presented and their results for short-term water demand forecasting in Tehran are compared. Weather data from three Tehran weather stations is weighted with the Thissen method and effective input data parameters are selected with regression of weighted effective weather and consumption data. The effective parameters include daily average temperature, relative humidity percent and last day, last week and last year water consumption. Consumption of all days between last day and the last week were also used. For the construction of fuzzy models a fuzzy rule-based approach is applied. The working rules are formulated from a set of past observations such as the relation between the parameters and the given input/output data sets. For neuro fuzzy modeling the toolbox function of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) constructs a Sugeno Inference System (SFIS). The membership function parameters are adjusted using a back propagation algorithm in combination with a least squares method. Outputs of the fuzzy and the neuro fuzzy models demonstrate that the results of fuzzy models do not show high accuracy, but neuro fuzzy models produce better results. Besides, outputs of the neuro fuzzy models with just water consumption inputs have high accuracy. A comparison of outputs with the results of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach shows the capability of the ANFIS model to predict Tehran water consumption.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2279704847", "source": "openalex"}

In bilaterians, Wnt signalling plays multiple fundamental roles during embryonic development and in adult tissues, notably in axial patterning, neural development and stem cell regulation. Studies in various cnidarian species have particularly highlighted the evolutionarily conserved role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in specification and patterning of the primary embryonic axis. However in another key non-bilaterian phylum, Ctenophora, Wnts are not involved in early establishment of the body axis during embryogenesis. We analysed the expression in the adult of the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus of 11 orthologues of Wnt signalling genes including all ctenophore Wnt ligands and Fz receptors and several members of the intracellular β-catenin pathway machinery. All genes are strongly expressed around the mouth margin at the oral pole, evoking the Wnt oral centre of cnidarians. This observation is consistent with primary axis polarisation by the Wnts being a universal metazoan feature, secondarily lost in ctenophores during early development but retained in the adult. In addition, local expression of Wnt signalling genes was seen in various anatomical structures of the body including in the locomotory comb rows, where their complex deployment suggests control by the Wnts of local comb polarity. Other important contexts of Wnt involvement which probably evolved before the ctenophore/cnidarian/bilaterian split include proliferating stem cells and progenitors irrespective of cell types, and developing as well as differentiated neuro-sensory structures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0084363", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1967931013", "source": "openalex"}

Several methods are used for fault diagnosis in transformers, e.g., dissolved gas analysis (DGA), measurement of breakdown voltage, and tan δ, pollution, sludge, and interfacial tension tests [2]. Of these, DGA is the most frequently used. Thermal and electrical stresses result in fracture of the insulating materials and the release of several gases. Analysis of these gases may provide information on the type of fault. Various standards have been suggested for the identification of transformer faults based on the ratio of dissolved gases in the transformer oil, e.g., International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards [3]–[7], and these standards has been quoted in many papers, e.g., [8]–[15]. However, they are incomplete in the sense that, in some cases, the fault cannot be diagnosed or located accurately. Intelligent algorithms, e.g., wavelet networks [16], neuro-fuzzy networks [17], [18], fuzzy logic [8], [12], and artificial neural networks (ANN) [2], [9], [10], [19], [20] have been used to improve the reliability of the diagnosis. In these algorithms, the type of fault is diagnosed first, and the fault is then located using the ratio of the concentrations of CO2 and CO dissolved in the transformer oil [21], [22]. The algorithms are not entirely satisfactory. The wavelet network has high efficiency but low convergence, the fuzzy logic method has a limited number of inputs and, in some cases, it is very difficult to derive the logic rules, and the ANN need reliable training patterns to improve their fault diagnosis performance. In this paper, we present a new method for simultaneous diagnosis of fault type and fault location. It uses an adaptive neuro- fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) [23]–[27], based on DGA. The ANFIS is first \"trained\" in accordance with IEC 599 [3], so that it acquires some fault determination ability. The CO2/CO ratios are then considered additional input data, enabling simultaneous diagnosis of the type and location of the fault. The results obtained by applying it to six transformers are presented and compared with the corresponding results obtained using ANN and some other standards and methods.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/mei.2012.6268440", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2029364429", "source": "openalex"}

The 2016 world health organization (WHO) classification update (“blue book”) introduced molecular diagnostic criteria into the definitions of specific entities as a response to the plethora of evidence that key molecular alterations define distinct tumor types and are clinically meaningful. While in the past such diagnostic alterations included specific mutations, copy number changes, or gene fusions, the emergence of DNA methylation arrays in recent years has similarly resulted in improved diagnostic precision, increased reliability, and has provided an effective framework for the discovery of new tumor types. In many instances, there is an intimate relationship between these mutations/fusions and DNA methylation signatures. The adoption of methylation data into neuro-oncology nosology has been greatly aided by the availability of technology compatible with clinical diagnostics, along with the development of a freely accessible machine learning-based classifier.

Few effective chemotherapeutics are currently available, and much effort has been expended to identify new drugs capable of slowing tumor progression. The phase 0 trial design was developed to facilitate early identification of promising agents for cancer that should undergo accelerated approval. This design features an early in-human study that enrolls a small number of patients who receive subtherapeutic doses of medication with the goals of describing pharmacokinetics through drug blood level measurements and determining intratumoral concentrations of the investigational compound as well as pharmacodynamics by studying the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs. In neuro-oncology, however, the presence of the blood–brain barrier and difficulty in obtaining brain tumor tissue warrant a separate set of considerations. In this paper, we critically reviewed the protocols used in all brain tumor related in-human phase 0 and phase 0–like (“window of opportunity”) studies between 1993 and 2018, as well as ongoing clinical trials, and identified major challenges in trial design as applied to central nervous system tumors that include surgical specimen collection and storage, brain tumor drug level analysis, and confirmation of drug action. We therefore propose that phase 0 trials in neuro-oncology should include (i) only patients in whom a resection of the tumor is planned, (ii) use of clinical doses of an investigational agent, (iii) tissue sampling from enhancing and non-enhancing portions of the tumor, and (iv) assessment of drug-specific target effects.

The navigation is based on a fuzzy technique for the idea of artificial potential fields (APFs) using analytic harmonic functions.

A computationally efficient processing scheme for fuzzy navigation to reasoning about obstacle avoidance using APF is described, namely, the intelligent dynamic motion planning. An integration of a robust controller and a modified Elman neural networks (MENNs) approximation-based computed-torque controller is proposed to deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and/or unstructured unmodeled dynamics of the robot arm. The MENN weights are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. The stability of the overall closed-loop system, composed by the nonlinear robot dynamics and the robust neuro-fuzzy controller, is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. The purpose of the robust neuro-fuzzy controller is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the robot so it may choose its way to its goal autonomously, while reacting in real-time to unexpected events.

Methodology/Principal Findings Using cDNA microarrays, we analyzed the genome-wide expression patterns of human fibroblasts homozygous for the I1061T NPC1 mutation that is characterized by a severe defect in the intracellular processing of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. A distinct gene expression profile was identified in NPC fibroblasts from different individuals when compared with fibroblasts isolated from normal subjects. As expected, NPC1 mutant cells displayed an inappropriate homeostatic response to accumulated intracellular cholesterol. In addition, a number of striking parallels were observed between NPC disease and Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions/Significance Many genes involved in the trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein and the microtubule binding protein, tau, were more highly expressed.

The procedure used to build the neuro‐wavelet model is reusable and can be applied to any high‐frequency financial series to specify the model characteristics associated with that particular series.

This review aims to provide an update on these additional features, with respect to the management of a diverse range of neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. Recent findings Macular ganglion cell complex (mGCC) analysis has been shown to be superior to peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) analysis in certain settings, such as differentiating Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy from functional visual loss; monitoring neurodegenerative diseases or multiple sclerosis; and predicting visual loss in nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy. mGCC analysis also demonstrates high correlation with perimetry and might serve as an early structural indicator of irreversible neuronal loss. Compared to pRNFL, retinal thickness analysis of the optic nerve head demonstrates better correlation with the severity of papilledema, thus enabling its possible application in detecting raised intracranial pressure, especially in the pediatric group. Upcoming research on emerging OCT technologies including OCT-angiography, enhanced depth imaging, retinal single-layer analysis and portable systems will hopefully further enhance the utility of OCT in the field.

However, these studies have also shown concurrent activation in vision-related cortical areas which have often been interpreted as evidence for the role of visual mental imagery in reasoning. The aim of the paper is to resolve the inconsistencies in the previous literature on reasoning and imagery and to develop a neurally and cognitively plausible theory of human relational reasoning. The main assumption is that visual brain areas are only involved if the problem information is easy to visualize and when this information must be processed and maintained in visual working memory. A regular reasoning process, however, does not involve visual images but more abstract spatial representations—spatial mental models—held in parietal cortices. Only these spatial representations are crucial for the genuine reasoning processes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13875860902887605", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2103041502", "source": "openalex"}

That implies that the fuzzy controller could yield a similar control result for a set of plants with a similar dynamic behavior. This idea lends to modeling of a plant with unknown structure by defining several types of dynamic behaviors. On the basis of dynamic behavior classification, a new method is presented for the design of a neuro-fuzzy control system in two steps: 1) we model a plant with unknown structure by choosing a set of simplified systems with equivalent behavior as \"templates\" to optimize their fuzzy controllers off-line; and 2) we use an algorithm for system identification to perceive dynamic behavior and a neural network to adapt fuzzy logic controllers by matching the \"templates\" online. The main advantage of this method is that convergence problem can be avoided during adaptation process.

Activation of this cascade is controlled by cycling of the RAS protein between an inactive and an active state and by phosphorylation of downstream proteins. The signalling cascade regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Disturbed RAS signalling in malignancies is caused by acquired somatic mutations in RAS genes or other components of this pathway. Recently, germline mutations in genes coding for different components of the RAS signalling cascade have been recognized as the cause of several phenotypically overlapping disorders, recently referred to as the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes. Neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan, LEOPARD, Costello and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes all present with variable degrees of psychomotor delay, congenital heart defects, facial dysmorphism, short stature, skin abnormalities and a predisposition for malignancy. These findings point to important roles for this evolutionary conserved pathway in oncogenesis, development, cognition and growth. Conclusion: it has become obvious in recent years that the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes all share a common genetic and pathophysiologic basis. Dysregulation of the RAS-MAPKinase pathway is caused by germline mutations in genes involved in this pathway. Undoubtedly more genes causing related syndromes will be discovered in the near future since there are still a substantial number of genes in the pathway that are not yet associated with a known syndrome.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-007-0535-7", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007119474", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of the current study was to investigate outcomes after salvage chemotherapy in this setting. METHODS A retrospective review was made of the charts of 28 adults (≥ 18 years) with progressive or recurrent ependymal tumors after surgery and radiotherapy, who received chemotherapy between 1993 and 2003 in 3 institutions of the Gruppo Italiano Cooperativo di Neuro‐Oncologia network. RESULTS Thirteen patients (46.3%) received cisplatin‐based chemotherapy (Group A) and 15 (53.7%) received regimens without cisplatin (Group B). Platinum‐based chemotherapy yielded 2 complete responses (CR) (15.4%) and 2 (15.4%) partial responses (PR), whereas 7 patients (53.8%) remained stable (SD). After regimens without cisplatin, there were no CR, 2 PR (13.3%), and 11 SD (73.3%). The overall median time to progression was 9.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 7.5–21.7 months), 9.9 months (5.2–not reached) for Group A and 10.9 months (95% CI, 7.17–23.9 months) for Group B. The overall median survival (OS) was 40.7 months (95% CI, 16–not reached), 31 months (21–not reached) for Group A and 40.7 months (13.4–not reached) for Group B.

In multicellular organisms, more complex systems of integration and coordination of activities are necessary. In most animals, the processing of information is performed by a nervous system. Among the most basal taxa, sponges are nerveless so that it is traditionally assumed that the integrated neuro‐sensory system originated only once in Eumetazoa, a hypothesis not in agreement with some recent phylogenomic studies. The aim of this review is to show that recent data on sponges might provide clues for understanding the origin of this complex system. First, sponges are able to react to external stimuli, and some of them display spontaneous movement activities. These coordinated behaviors involve nervous system‐like mechanisms, such as action potentials and/or neurotransmitters. Second, genomic analyses show that sponges possess genes orthologous to those involved in the patterning or functioning of the neuro‐sensory system in Eumetazoa. Finally, some of these genes are expressed in specific cells (flask cells, choanocytes). Together with ultrastructural data, this gives rise to challenging hypotheses concerning cell types that might play neuro‐sensory‐like roles in sponges.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-4877.2009.00167.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2009696123", "source": "openalex"}

Glutamic acid was formed by electropolymerization on the electrode surface. The parameters that can affect the performance of the biosensing probe were optimized. The techniques used in the design of the immobilization steps, the optimization studies, and the evaluation of the analytical performance of the targeted neuro-biosensor are electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). Charge transfer resistance (Rct) changes were highly linear and sensitive with the alpha-SYN concentration in the 4-2000 pg mL-1 range and associated with a limit of detection of 0.135 pg mL-1. With the designed disposable neuro-biosensor system, the amount of alpha-SYN found in CSF samples was determined by the standard addition technique and found to be strikingly sensitive to the target analyte. Morphological and chemical changes on the sensing surface were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

The article therefore provides a close-up perspective on the intersection of neuroscience and translational research. In the scientific setting we studied, the neuro was multiple and irreducible to any particular entity or set of practices across a laboratory and clinical divide. Despite this multiplicity, the group’s work was held together through the ‘promise of porosity’ – that one day there would be translation of lab findings into clinically effective intervention. This promise was embodied in the figure of the Group Leader whose expertise spanned clinical and basic neurosciences. This is theorized in terms of a contrast between cohesion and adhesion in interdisciplinary groupings.

GlioblastomaGBM remains an uncommon diagnosis.However, for those patients and carers affected, it is life-changing from first diagnosis.The median overall survival for patients receiving GBM therapy is 14 months, and fewer than 10% of patients are alive at 5 years following diagnosis. 1,2Further, patients older than 70 years and/or those with poor KPS may not benefit from current palliative anticancer therapies and can have significantly worse outcomes.Indeed, population-based management surveys document median survivals of ,10 months and negligible 5-year survival rates. 3any clinicians view GBM as having the worst of all cancer prognoses; however, median and long-term survival of GBM patients compare favorably with those of patients with other incurable cancers, such as metastatic pancreatic and metastatic lung. 2 GBM results in significant morbidity, which can be challenging for patients and their carers, as well as for health professionals.Physical symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, easy fatigue, and excessive somnolence. 4Local tumor effects, depending on site, may result in focal or generalized neurologic problems such as seizure, motor weakness, aphasia, and impaired vision. 5,6Mood and cognitive disturbance are common. 7 multidisciplinary approach including neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neuro-oncology, and allied health is recommended to optimize treatment outcomes. 3,4However, few of these multidisciplinary teams would routinely include palliative care, despite the lack of curative treatment options and significant symptom burden.The palliative care needs of patients with GBM can be complex, with a paucity of published data in this area. 5 -9 Parallels do exist, however, between the needs of patients with GBM and those of patients with other, more common cancer diagnoses and nonmalignant chronic neurologic illness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nos209", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112990473", "source": "openalex"}

Cascade model analysis", "text": "A micro‐angiographic detector was designed and its performance was previously tested to evaluate its feasibility as an improvement over current x‐ray detectors for neuro‐interventional imaging. The detector was shown to have a modulation transfer function value of about 2% at the Nyquist frequency of 10 cycles/mm and a zero frequency detective quantum efficiency [DQE(0)] value of about 55%. An assessment of the system was required to evaluate whether the current system was performing at its full potential and to determine if any of its components could be optimized to further improve the output. For the purpose, in this study, the parallel cascade theory was used to analyze the performance of the detector under neuro‐angiographic conditions by studying the output at the various stages in the imaging chain. A simple model for the spread of light in the CsI(Tl) entrance phosphor was developed and the resolution degradation due to ‐fluorescence absorption was calculated. The total gain of the system was found to result in (rms) detected at the charge coupled device per absorbed x‐ray photon. The gain and the spread of quanta in the imaging chain were used to calculate theoretically the DQE using the parallel cascade model. The results of the model‐based calculations matched fairly well with the experimental data previously obtained. This model was then used to optimize the phosphor thickness for the detector. The results showed that the area under the DQE curve had a maximum value at 150 μm of CsI(Tl), though when weighted by the squared signal in frequency space of a 100‐μm‐diam iodinated vessel, the integral DQE reached a maximum at 250 μm of CsI(Tl). Further, possible locations for gain increase in the imaging chain were determined, and the output of the improved system was simulated. Thus a theoretical analysis for the micro‐angiographic detector was performed to better assess its potential.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1118/1.1617550", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2012879849", "source": "openalex"}

However, both training and execution of large-scale Deep Networks require vast computing resources, leading to high power requirements and communication overheads. The on-going work on design and construction of spike-based hardware platforms offers an alternative for running deep neural networks with significantly lower power consumption, but has to overcome hardware limitations in terms of noise and limited weight precision, as well as noise inherent in the sensor signal. This article investigates how such hardware constraints impact the performance of spiking neural network implementations of DBNs. In particular, the influence of limited bit precision during execution and training, and the impact of silicon mismatch in the synaptic weight parameters of custom hybrid VLSI implementations is studied. Furthermore, the network performance of spiking DBNs is characterized with regard to noise in the spiking input signal. Our results demonstrate that spiking DBNs can tolerate very low levels of hardware bit precision down to almost two bits, and show that their performance can be improved by at least 30% through an adapted training mechanism that takes the bit precision of the target platform into account. Spiking DBNs thus present an important use-case for large-scale hybrid analog-digital or digital neuromorphic platforms such as SpiNNaker, which can execute large but precision-constrained deep networks in real time.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2015.00222", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1596035946", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) as neuro-fuzzy classifier is applied to churn prediction modeling and benchmarked to traditional rule-based classifier such as C4.5 and RIPPER. In this paper, we have built two ANFIS models including ANFIS-Subtractive (subtractive clustering based fuzzy inference system (FIS)) and ANFIS-FCM (fuzzy C-means (FCM) based FIS) models. The results showed that both ANFIS-Subtractive and ANFIS-FCM models have acceptable performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. In addition, ANFIS-Subtractive and ANFIS-FCM clearly induce much less rules than C4.5 and RIPPER. Hence ANFIS-Subtractive and ANFIS-FCM are the most comprehensible techniques tested in the experiments. These results indicate that ANFIS shows acceptable performance in terms of accuracy and comprehensibility, and it is an appropriate choice for churn prediction applications.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W126100224", "source": "openalex"}

The depth ratio (ratio of water depth in floodplain to that in main channel), coherence parameter, and the discharge ratio [ratio of flow discharge calculated from vertical divided channel method (VDCM) to the bank full discharge] are considered as input parameters to represent a functional relationship between input and output parameters. The performances of training and testing stages for NF-GMDH models were quantified in terms of statistical error parameters.

However, the mechanism of diabetic retinopathy is not clearly defined. The present study was undertaken to investigate neuroretinal apoptosis in different stages in a mouse model for type 2 diabetes mellitus and the mechanism of diabetic retinopathy. KKAY mouse with genetic diabetes, an animal model for type 2 diabetes, was used in this study. Mice were divided into a control group and a diabetic group. The mice in both groups were sacrificed at one month and three months, and the mouse eyeballs were used for making retinal histologic sections. We showed in this study that the apoptotic cell numbers for retinal neural cells in the ganglion cell layer were significantly greater in the diabetic group than in the control group (p<0.01), as determined by the TUNEL assay. In addition, many more apoptotic retinal neuronal cells were found in the retinal ganglion cell layer and medial part of the inner nuclear layer in the diabetic group when the mice were sacrificed at three months as compared to those sacrificed at one month (p<0.01). We also studied the ultrastructure of the retinal nerve cells and microvesseles by electron microscopy and demonstrated that the ultrastructure changes for retinal neural cells and retinal microangiopathy were observed in, as early as, the early stage of diabetes. These findings indicate that: i) retinal neuropathy and microangiopathy occur in the early stage of diabetes, ii) apoptosis may be an important mechanism through which retinal neurodegeneration is developed, and iii) both retinal neurodegeneration and retinal microangiopathy should be considered as the diabetic retinopathy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.13.1.87", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2049521810", "source": "openalex"}

The best outcome regarding progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) is achieved by maximal resection. The foundation of a specialized neuro-oncology care center (NOC) has enabled the implementation of a large technical portfolio including functional imaging, awake craniotomy, PET scanning, fluorescence-guided resection, and integrated postsurgical therapy. This study analyzed whether the technically improved neurosurgical treatment structure yields a higher rate of complete resection, thus ultimately improving patient outcome. Patients and methods: The study included 149 patients treated surgically for newly diagnosed GBM. The neurological performance score (NPS) and the Karnofsky performance score (KPS) were measured before and after resection. The extent of resection (EOR) was volumetrically quantified. Patients were stratified into two subcohorts: treated before (A) and after (B) the foundation of the Regensburg NOC. The EOR and the PFS and OS were evaluated. Results: Prognostic factors for PFS and OS were age, preoperative KPS, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status and EOR. Patients with volumetrically defined complete resection had significantly better PFS (9.4 vs. 7.8 months; p = 0.042) and OS (18.4 vs. 14.5 months; p = 0.005) than patients with incomplete resection. The frequency of transient or permanent postoperative neurological deficits was not higher after complete resection in both subcohorts. The frequency of complete resection was significantly higher in subcohort B than in subcohort A (68.2% vs. 34.8%; p = 0.007). Accordingly, subcohort B showed significantly longer PFS (8.6 vs. 7.5 months; p = 0.010) and OS (18.7 vs. 12.4 months; p = 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed complete resection, age, preoperative KPS, and MGMT promoter status as independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Our data show a higher frequency of complete resection in patients with GBM after the establishment of a series of technical developments that resulted in significantly better PFS and OS without increasing surgery-related morbidity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci8010005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2778881268", "source": "openalex"}

We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using \"visual\" explanations only.

Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the correlation between disturbances of ocular motility and the degree of hydrocephalus, tectal plate deformity and dislocation of the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. All patients had Chiari malformations. Strabismus and spontaneous nystagmus were strongly related mainly to the degree of hydrocephalus and to some extent to the amount of lower brainstem deformities. Ocular motility defects with regard to oblique muscle functions and horizontal and vertical gaze and saccadic control often correlated with lower brainstem lesions.

Diagnostic emphasis has shifted from the morphology of a tumor under the microscope to an integrated approach based on morphologic and molecular features, including gene mutations, chromosomal copy number alterations, and gene rearrangements. In 2016, the World Health Organization provided guidelines for making an integrated diagnosis that incorporates both morphologic and molecular features in a subset of brain tumors. The integrated diagnosis now applies to infiltrating gliomas, a category that includes diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma grades II, III, and IV, and oligodendroglioma, grades II and III, thereby encompassing the most common primary intra-axial central nervous system tumors. Other neoplasms such as medulloblastoma, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, certain supratentorial ependymomas, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor are also eligible for integrated diagnosis, which can sometimes be aided by characteristic immunohistochemical markers. Since 2016, advances in molecular neuro-oncology have resulted in periodic updates and clarifications to the integrated diagnostic approach. These advances reflect expanding knowledge on the molecular pathology of brain tumors, but raise a challenge in rapidly incorporating new molecular findings into diagnostic practice. This review provides a background on the molecular characteristics of primary brain tumors, emphasizing the molecular basis for classification of infiltrating gliomas, the most common entities that are eligible for an integrated diagnosis. We then discuss entities within the diffuse gliomas that do not receive an integrated diagnosis by WHO 2016 criteria, but have distinctive molecular features that are important to recognize because their clinical behavior can influence clinical management and prognosis. Particular attention is given to the histone H3 G34R/G34V mutant astrocytomas, an entity to consider when faced with an infiltrating glioma in the cerebral hemisphere of children and young adults, and to the group of histologically lower grade diffuse astrocytic gliomas with molecular features of glioblastoma, an important category of tumors to recognize due to their aggressive clinical behavior.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13000-019-0802-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2942860617", "source": "openalex"}

For coordinated motion, however, decoupling sometimes causes damage to the overall performance objective. Therefore, a better way to control multiaxis systems is to introduce intelligent control actions in the controller so that the coordination objective of the desired motion is maintained. A method for achieving the synchronization of two motion axes using a neural network is described. We introduce a new cost function for better synchronization performance.

The coordination relies on a leader-followers conception which means related to the leader position, the followers will behave. The method consists of two fuzzy level controllers architecture based on a fuzzy probabilistic control and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Each robot has low level probabilistic fuzzy controller to eliminate the stochastic uncertainties as well as to make the multi-robots team navigates from the start point to the target point without any dangerous collision. The first order Sugeno fuzzy inference system is utilized to model the leader robot system and create the high level controller. The approach starts by generating the input/output data. Then, the subtractive clustering algorithm along with least square estimation (LSE) generates the fuzzy rules that describe the relationship between input/output data. A learning algorithm based on neural network is developed to tune parameters of membership function and the fuzzy rules are tuned by ANFIS. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Anti-inflammatory actions of niacin and a possible role of its receptor GPR109A have been studied previously.

Here we observed that niacin reduced the translocation of phosphorylated nuclear kappa B (p-NF-κB) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the nucleus of RAW264.7 cells. The reduction in the nuclear translocation in turn decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells.

The physiological effects during reperfusion include stabilization of the systemic circulation without significantly increased total peripheral resistance, moderately increased cerebral cortical blood flow, a decrease of lipid peroxidation and inflammation, and less anoxic tissue injury in the brain and the heart.

In this respect, the implementation of the circular economy model, which requires engineers to acquire appropriate competencies, enabling companies to establish this model at the manufacturing level. Moreover, competence has always been a priority for both the professional and the company. In this sense, connectivism has been called a learning theory for the digital era; this is the reason why a review of the state-of-the-art developments of this paradigm focused on engineering has been carried out. In this sense, the potential of the digital transformation in instruction to formulate an engineering model based on neuro-competences is of great interest, taking the connectivist paradigm as a methodological axis. To this end, a first bibliometric analysis has been carried out to identify the drivers on which to base the design of the neuro-competencies of the instructional engineering environment and the trend towards curriculum development under dual training models. The bibliographical research carried out on the connectivist paradigm has served to identify the trends followed to date in education within the subject area of engineering. These trends have not fully taken into account the leading role of the human factor within the socio-technical cyber-physical systems of sustainable manufacturing (SCSSM). The focus was more on the technology than on the adaptation of the uniqueness of the human factor and the tasks entrusted to him, which entails an additional complexity that needs to be addressed in both academic and professional contexts. In light of the foregoing, an improvement to the acquisition and management of competencies has been proposed to the academic, professional and dual engineering contexts. It is based on the transversal inclusion of the concept of neuro-competence applied to the competence engineering (CE) model, transforming it into the neuro-competence engineering (NCE) model. The foregoing provides a better match between the characteristics of the human factor and the uniqueness of the tasks performed by the engineer, incorporating activity theory (AT), the law of variety required (LVR), the connectivist paradigm and neuroscience as a transversal driver of innovation through fractality.

Immune-active substances such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-l and tumor necrosis factor, either directly or indirectly via interactions with neurotransmitters or neurohormones are involved in the regulation of sleep.

The leasing process and existing methods of performance evaluation are highlighted. The specificity of neuropsycholinguistics in the approach to the analysis of the mental activity of the individual in the acquisition and use of language is shown. The ultimate goal of this neuropsycholinguistic study is to find out what exactly pleases the voter and what prompts the candidate to support the electorate of a particular region, which in turn will allow him to adjust the content of political advertising by making it highly effective. Methods and Techniques of the Research. The EMOTIV Epoc + mobile 14 channel neurointerface was used to study the neuropsychological study of political slogans from outdoor advertising. In addition, we have used professional EEG monitoring software to visualize brain electrical activity and to transform transformed EEG indicators in the form of basic cognitive-emotional indicators: EmotivPRO and EMOTIV Brain Activity Map. Ranking of slogans on the effectiveness of influence on the electorate was carried out on the basic raw EEG data and their transformation into cognitive-emotional indicators: stress, interaction, interest, excitement, concentration, relaxation. This set of neuropsychological techniques is a relevant highlight. The poll was attended by potential voters in the 2019 presidential election. The sample size is 30 men and 30 women. Results. As a result of a neuropsychological study of political slogans on outdoor advertising, it was found out which slogans are the best, good, mediocre, ambiguous, ineffective, ineffective and negative for voters.

Além disso, receptores deste hormônio podem ser encontrados em quase todos os tecidos do organismo e outras ações não relacionadas ao metabolismo mineral têm sido imputadas a ele. Na célula muscular esquelética, a vitamina D atua através do mecanismo clássico de ligação a um receptor nuclear e também através da ligação a um receptor de membrana, realizando ações que envolvem o transporte de cálcio, a síntese protéica e a velocidade de contração muscular. Clinicamente, a deficiência de vitamina D, que é bastante comum em idosos, inclusive em nosso país, tem sido relacionada a um aumento da incidência de quedas, a uma diminuição da força muscular e a uma deterioração do equilíbrio, avaliada pela oscilação do corpo na postura ereta. Por outro lado, tem sido demonstrado que a suplementação associada de cálcio e vitamina D em idosos deficientes contribui para melhoria destes aspectos da função neuro-muscular. Nesta revisão, serão discutidos os mecanismos conhecidos envolvidos na associação entre vitamina D e função neuro-muscular, e também a suplementação de vitamina D e cálcio na prevenção de fraturas osteoporóticas não-vertebrais sob a perspectiva dos efeitos neuro-musculares.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1590/s0004-27302005000400005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2087399712", "source": "openalex"}

The underlying pathogenesis of SANS remains ill-defined, but several emerging translational applications of terrestrial head-mounted, visual assessment technology and machine learning frameworks are being studied for potential use in SANS. To develop such technology requires close consideration of the spaceflight environment which is limited in medical resources and imaging modalities. This austere environment necessitates the utilization of low mass, low footprint technology to build a visual assessment system that is comprehensive, accessible, and efficient. In this paper, we discuss the unique considerations for developing this technology for SANS and translational applications on Earth. Several key limitations observed in the austere spaceflight environment share similarities to barriers to care for underserved areas on Earth.

We have examined the feasibility of capturing the neurological examination as machine-readable codes based on UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. Methods We created a target ontology for capturing the neurological examination using 1100 concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus. We created a dataset of 2386 test-phrases based on 419 published neurological cases. We then mapped the test-phrases to the target ontology. Results We were able to map all of the 2386 test-phrases to 601 unique UMLS concepts. A neurological examination ontology with 1100 concepts has sufficient breadth and depth of coverage to encode all of the neurologic concepts derived from the 419 test cases. Using only pre-coordinated concepts, component ontologies of the UMLS, such as HPO, SNOMED CT, and OMIM, do not have adequate depth and breadth of coverage to encode the complexity of the neurological examination. Conclusion An ontology based on a subset of UMLS has sufficient breadth and depth of coverage to convert deficits from the neurological examination into machine-readable codes using pre-coordinated concepts.

Neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (Nova1) is a neuron-specific splicing factor that controls the alternative processing of a wide array of mRNAs important for synaptic activity. It is essential for the proper development of the mammalian motor system and for the survival of motoneurons. Because Nova1 gene contains putative regulatory AU-rich elements (ARE) in its highly conserved 3'-untranslated region, we investigated whether its expression is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms mediated by ARE-binding proteins. Among these, the neuronal ELAV (nELAV) factors are interesting candidates, because their RNA binding activity is necessary for neuronal differentiation and maintenance. By analysis of ribonucleoprotein complexes in vivo and in vitro we demonstrated that the Nova1 mRNA is a novel target of the nELAV proteins. We defined the nELAV binding site by functional experiments with luciferase reporter gene and Nova1 3'-untranslated region deletion sequences. Gene silencing and overexpression of the nELAV member HuD in motoneuronal NSC34 cells indicate that Nova1 mRNA stability and translation are positively and strongly controlled by the nELAV proteins. In addition, nELAV phosphorylation by a PKC-dependent pathway induces the recruitment of Nova1 mRNA to polysomes. Noteworthy, we found that nELAV proteins are also able to modulate Nova1 splicing activity on its target genes. Our data indicate nELAV proteins as the first factors affecting the expression and activity of the neuronal splicing regulator Nova1 and, consequently, as major candidates for the physiological modulation of Nova1-dependent processing of pre-mRNAs in neurons.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m706082200", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2066972125", "source": "openalex"}

To this end, the landslide inventory map, composed of 199 identified landslides, is divided into training and testing landslides with a 70:30 ratio. To create the spatial database, thirteen landslide conditioning factors are considered within the geographic information system (GIS). Notably, the spatial interaction between the landslides and mentioned conditioning factors is analyzed by means of frequency ratio (FR) theory. After the optimization process, it was shown that the DE-based model reaches the best response more quickly than other ensembles.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether representative ginsenosides from ginseng can regulate choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which are required for cholinergic neurotransmission. Our results revealed that Re and Rd induced effectively the expression of ChAT/VAChT genes in Neuro-2a cells as well as ACh elevation. Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), nerve growth factor receptor (p75), p21, and TrkA genes and proteins were also significantly expressed. Moreover, both activated extracelullar signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and Akt were inhibited by K252a, a selective Trk receptor inhibitor. These findings strongly indicate that Re and Rd play an important role in neuronal differentiation and the nerve growth factor (NGF)-TrkA signaling pathway. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that Re and Rd administered orally were transported successfully into brain tissue and increased the level of ChAT and VAChT mRNA.

The proposed method is composed of two parts: a NF controller (NFC), to establish an efficient controller strategy to improve ride comfort and road handling (RCH), and an inverse mapping to estimate the semi-active suspension current. To effectively estimate the current needed to control the semi-active damper, an inverse mapping based on neural network, modified back-propagation (MBP) is presented. The inverse mapping is incorporated into the FC to enhance RCH. Given the relative velocity between the mass and the base and also the absolute acceleration of the mass, the FC computes the optimum damping coefficient. The fuzzy logic rules are extracted based on expert knowledge encapsulated in skyhook and groundhook. A quarter-car model was adopted for the purpose of simulating and experimenting with the proposed NFC. To verify the performance of the FC, two sets of results are reported. First, an experimental analysis was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FC in comparison with the benchmark skyhook and Rakheja–Sankar controllers. Furthermore, a random input was considered to examine the robustness of the NFC in comparison with the other adopted controllers.

The lateral undulatory gait of a snake robot is stabilized in a virtual holonomic constraint manifold through a partial feedback linearizing control law. Based on a dynamic compensator and Line-of-Sight guidance law, the path-following problem is transformed to a regulation problem of a nonlinear system with uncertainties. Subsequently, it is solved by an infinite horizon optimal control scheme using a single critic NN. A novel fluctuating learning algorithm is derived to approximate the associated cost function online and relax the initial stabilizing control requirement. The approximate optimal control input is derived by solving a modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The conventional persistence of excitation condition is relaxed by using experience replay technique. The proposed control scheme ensures that all states of the snake robot are uniformly ultimate bounded which is analyzed by using the Lyapunov approach, and the tracking error asymptotically converges to a residual set. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2017.2768820", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2768918138", "source": "openalex"}

In combination with a geographic information system (GIS), ANFIS was used for land subsidence susceptibility mapping (LSSM) in the Marand plain, northwest Iran. This area is prone to droughts and low groundwater levels and subsequent land subsidence damages. Therefore, a land subsidence inventory database was created from an extensive field survey. Areas of land subsidence or areas showing initial signs of subsidence were used for training, while one-third of inventory database were reserved for testing and validation. The inventory database randomly divided into three different folds of the same size. One of the folds was chosen for testing and validation. Other two folds was used for training. This process repeated for every fold in the inventory dataset. Thereafter, land subsidence related factors, such as hydrological and topographical factors, were prepared as GIS layers. Areas susceptible to land subsidence were then analyzed using the ANFIS approach, and land subsidence susceptibility maps were created, whereby six different MFs were applied. Lastly, the results derived from each MF were validated with those areas of the land subsidence database that were not used for training. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were drawn for all LSSMs, and the areas under the curves were calculated. The ROC analyses for the six LSSMs yielded very high prediction values for two out of the six methods, namely the difference of DsigMF (0.958) and GaussMF (0.951). The integration of ANFIS and GIS generally led to high LSSM prediction accuracies.

The brain, popularly viewed as a neuronal-glial complex, gets most of its energy from the oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose, and the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a key regulatory role during the oxidation of glucose. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (also called PDC kinase or PDK) is a kinase that regulates glucose metabolism by switching off PDC. Four isoforms of PDKs with tissue specific activities have been identified. The metabolisms of neurons and glial cells, especially, those of astroglial cells, are interrelated, and these cells function in an integrated fashion. The energetic coupling between neuronal and astroglial cells is essential to meet the energy requirements of the brain in an efficient way. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in the PDKs and/or neuron-astroglia metabolic interactions are associated with the development of several neurological disorders.

Fuzzy rule-based models are generally considered interpretable that are able to reflect the associations between medical conditions and associated symptoms, through the use of linguistic if-then statements. Systems built on top of fuzzy sets are of particular appealing to medical applications since they enable the tolerance of vague and imprecise concepts that are often embedded in medical entities such as symptom description and test results. They facilitate an approximate reasoning framework which mimics human reasoning and supports the linguistic delivery of medical expertise often expressed in statements such as 'weight low' or 'glucose level high' while describing symptoms. This paper proposes an approach by performing data-driven learning of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule bases for clinical decision support. The approach starts with the generation of a crisp rule base through a decision tree learning mechanism, capable of capturing simple rule structures. The crisp rule base is then transformed into a fuzzy rule base, which forms the input to the framework of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), thereby further optimising the parameters of both rule antecedents and consequents. Experimental studies on popular medical data benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed work is able to learn compact rule bases involving simple rule antecedents, with statistically better or comparable performance to those achieved by state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101986", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3101510858", "source": "openalex"}

Among other players in this neuro-osteogenic network, the neuropeptide Y (NPY) system has attracted particular attention. At the central nervous system level, NPY exerts its function in bone homeostasis through the hypothalamic Y2 receptor. Locally in the bone, NPY action is mediated by its Y1 receptor. Besides the presence of Y1, a complex network exists locally: not only there is input of the peripheral nervous system, as the bone is directly innervated by NPY-containing fibers, but there is also input from non-neuronal cells, including bone cells capable of NPY expression. The interaction of these distinct players to achieve a multilevel control system of bone homeostasis is still under debate. In this review, we will integrate the current knowledge on the impact of the NPY system in bone biology, and discuss the mechanisms through which the balance between central and the peripheral NPY action might be achieved.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07774.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1490701657", "source": "openalex"}

Four models were considered in the study of suspended sediment concentration prediction: artificial neural networks (ANNs), neuro-fuzzy model (NF), conjunction of wavelet analysis and neuro-fuzzy (WNF) model, and the conventional sediment rating curve (SRC) method. Using data from a US Geological Survey gauging station, the suspended sediment concentration predicted by the WNF model was in satisfactory agreement with the measured data. Also the proposed WNF model generated reasonable predictions for the extreme values. The cumulative suspended sediment load estimated by this model was much higher than that predicted by the other models, and is close to the observed data. However, in the current modelling, the ANN, NF and SRC models underestimated sediment load. The WNF model was successful in reproducing the hysteresis phenomenon, but the SRC method was not able to model this behaviour. In general, the results showed that the NF model performed better than the ANN and SRC models. Citation Mirbagheri, S. A., Nourani, V., Rajaee, T. & Alikhani, A.

Work sampling: a quantitative analysis of nursing activity in a neuro‐rehabilitation setting. Aim. The aim of this investigation was to establish the distribution and proportion of nursing activity represented by patient‐related care activities (direct and indirect), and other nursing activities (unit‐related and personal) within one inpatient neurological rehabilitation unit. Background. A set of tools has been developed for estimating the care/nursing hours required for direct hands‐on patient care in hospital rehabilitation settings. However, to apply this information to estimate the actual staffing requirements in relation to a given caseload, it is necessary to know the proportion of nursing workload assigned to other activities and how this may vary throughout the day. Method. A work sampling study was conducted during 2004. A snapshot of nursing activity was recorded at 5‐minute intervals from 06·00 to 23·55 spread over 2 weeks, with one session from 06·00 to 15·25 and the second from 15·30 to 23·55. Results. A total of 8883 nursing activities were observed and recorded over 126 hours and categorized as follows: 4060 (46%) direct patient care, 2218 (25%) indirect patient care, 874 (10%) unit‐related and 1731 (19%) personal time. The proportions of direct care fluctuated throughout the day, with direct care activities mainly concentrated in early mornings and to a lesser extent evenings. Conclusion. Direct patient care accounted for less than half of the nursing activity in a rehabilitation setting. Estimates of staffing requirement must also take account of the time required for indirect care and non‐patient related activity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05073.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2016107601", "source": "openalex"}

This is the result of improved understanding of these tumors at the molecular level. In particular, the presence or absence of combined 1p/19 loss in oligodendroglial tumors, epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, epidermal growth factor receptor vIII mutations in grade III tumors and glioblastoma multiforme, and MGMT promoter gene methylation in glioblastoma multiforme are now being used to tailor treatment decisions in patients. However, the application of these tests is far from straightforward, and certain standards are required before any test can be introduced in the daily management of patients. Some of these requirements concern inter- and intratest variability, including whether a test gives the same results if repeated in the same or in another laboratory or when different methodologies are used (e.g. loss of heterozygosity vs fluorescence in situ hybridization and a polymerase chain reaction-based test vs immunohistochemistry). The sensitivity and specificity of a test (or negative and positive predictive value) indicate the likelihood that the test results are positive if the disease is present and the likelihood that the disease is present if the test results are positive. Studies on these test characteristics usually require the presence of a gold standard to which new tests should be compared. Last but not least there is the question of what added value the test has; this criterion determines the clinical usefulness of the assay and why some recently introduced molecular assays need to be scrutinized.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/nen.0b013e31815c39f1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078419463", "source": "openalex"}

Little is known about applicability of twinning initiatives with high-income countries in neuro-oncology. In 2004, a monthly neuro-oncology video-teleconference program was started between King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, Jordan) and the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). More than 100 conferences were held and > 400 cases were discussed. The aim of this work was to assess the sustainability of such an initiative and the evolution of the impact over time.We divided the duration in to three eras according to the initial 2 to 3 years of work of three consecutive oncologists in charge of the neuro-oncology program at King Hussein Cancer Center. We retrospectively reviewed the written minutes and compared the preconference suggested plans with the postconference recommendations. Impact of changes on the patient care was recorded.Thirty-three sets of written minutes (covering 161 cases) in the middle era and 32 sets of written minutes (covering 122 cases) in the last era were compared with the initial experience (20 meetings, 72 cases). Running costs of these conferences has dropped from $360/h to < $40/h. Important concepts were introduced, such as multidisciplinary teamwork, second-look surgery, and early referral. Suggestions for plan changes have decreased from 44% to 30% and 24% in the respective consecutive eras. Most recommendations involved alternative intervention modalities or pathology review. Most of these recommendations were followed.Video-teleconferencing in neuro-oncology is feasible and sustainable. With time, team experience is built while the percentage and the type of treatment modifications change. Commitment and motivation helped maintain this initiative rather than availability of financial resources. Improvement in patients' care was achieved, in particular, with the implementation of a multidisciplinary team and the continuous effort to implement recommendations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1200/jgo.2016.008276", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2605942760", "source": "openalex"}

A semiactive control technique is developed for a two‐degree‐of‐freedom quarter car model of the railcar that has an installed MR damper. A fuzzy controller in real time continuously updates damping properties of the device. The controller uses feedback acceleration of the freight mass to specify a voltage signal to the MR damper. Correlations between acceleration (controller input) and voltage applied to the MR damper (controller output) are developed using Neuro Fuzzy Controller (NEFCON). To assess effectiveness of the semiactive control scheme, responses of the railcar to various haul conditions are compared with those for uncontrolled and for passive operating conditions of the MR damper. Results indicate that semiactively controlled MR dampers can reduce vibrations to acceptable levels provided that sufficient force capacity can be supplied by the damper .", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8667.2004.00339.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2088531091", "source": "openalex"}

The design process focused on the need to use the interface as the end-effector of a whole bimanual upper limb exoskeleton system, composed of two exoskeleton arms with 7 DoF each and two hand exoskeletons for all the fingers. The guideline of the design pointed to reach a tradeoff between high transparency and low weight. In addition, both the compactness and mass distribution have played an important role in the design process due to the need to perform bimanual task and interaction. The proposed device was designed adopting a tendon-cable transmission for all the three joints. A differential transmission solution has been adopted to actuate the flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation joints, which allows to achieve lower inertia and higher compactness than a serial transmission. A first prototype has been build and characterized with several experimental tests showing its suitability for both teleoperation and rehabilitative therapy.

Many studies of cytotoxicity on animal cells and algae have been performed, although few compare the toxic effects between the two models. In this sense, we investigated the oxidative stress induced by STX (0.4–3.0 nM) in two different cellular models: Neuro-2A (N2A) cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii alga by quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as indicative of lipid peroxidation (LPO). Also was evaluated the antioxidant defense of these cells systems after exposure to STX by the addition of antioxidants in N2A cells culture, and by the measure of antioxidants enzymes activity in C. reinhardtii cells. The MDA levels of N2A cells increased from 15% to 113% for 0.4 and 3.0 nM of STX, respectively, as compared to control. Superoxide-dismutase and catalase did not appear to protect the cell from STX effect while, in cells treated with vitamin E, the rates of MDA production decreased significantly, except for higher concentrations of STX. No MDA productions were observed in algal cells however some effects on antioxidant enzymes activity were observed when algae were exposed to 3.0 nM STX. Our results indicate that the concentrations of STX that may induce oxidative stress through LPO are different in animal and phytoplankton communities. A combination of algal and animal bioassays should be conducted for reliable assessment of oxidative stress induced by STX.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.04.009", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2080112438", "source": "openalex"}

In this work, we analyse the occurrence likelihood of earthquake-triggered landslide by employing the ensembles of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) with four well-known metaheuristics techniques, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), and differential evolution (DE) algorithms. Twelve landslide conditioning factors namely, elevation, slope degree, lithology, peak ground acceleration (PGA), stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to road, distance to river, distance to fault, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope aspect, and plan curvature are considered within the geographic information system (GIS) to produce the required spatial database. In this paper, frequency ratio (FR) model is used to evaluate the spatial interaction between the landslides and conditioning factors. Meantime, among a total of 458 marked earthquake-induced landslides, 366 (80%) are specified to the learning process, and the remaining 92 (20%) landslides are used to evaluate the accuracy of applied models. The landslide susceptibility maps are generated in the GIS environment. Three accuracy criteria of mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are used to develop a ranking system for comparing the integrity of the designed models. The total ranking scores (TRSs) of 15, 8, 10, and 18, respectively, obtained for PSO-ANFIS, GA-ANFIS, ACO-ANFIS, and DE-ANFIS revealed the superiority of the DE algorithm compared to other metaheuristics techniques.

However, poor biocompatibility of these devices inhibits the formation of a robust neuro-electrode interface. Several factors including mechanical mismatch between the device and tissue, inflammation at the implantation site, and possible electrical damage contribute to this response. Many researchers are investigating polymeric brain mimetic coatings as a means to improve integration with nervous tissue. Specifically, hydrogels, constructs also employed in tissue engineering, have been explored because of their structural and mechanical similarity to native tissue. However, many hydrogel materials (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)) do not support cell adhesion. In this work, we report a technique to enhance the interface between polymeric brain mimetic coatings and neural tissue using adhesion molecules. In particular, polylysine-modified PEG-based hydrogels were synthesized, characterized and shown to promote neural adhesion using a PC12 cell line. In addition, we examined adhesion behavior of a PEG-co-polymer and found that these materials adhere to electrodes for at least 4 weeks.

Seven (18%) of the 38 patients with preserved hearing of any extent became deaf within 1 year. In cases of gradual hearing loss, the average deterioration rate was approximately 8 dB per year. Abnormalities of auditory brain stem response preceded deafness in 2 patients. Caloric response, preserved before treatment in 13 patients, disappeared 4 to 13 months after treatment (median, 8 months) in 9 (69%) of them, whereas their hearing was preserved. Delayed facial palsy and persistent trigeminal neuropathy occurred in 10 (22%) and 7 (15%) of the 46 patients, respectively. Severe facial palsy tended to persist. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> The rates of neuro-otological complications of radiosurgery are almost comparable with those previously reported from other institutions. The deafness within 1 year after treatment might be attributed to a lesion in the cochlear nerve. Hearing loss did not parallel vestibular function loss. The persistent severe facial palsy contrasts with previously reported findings.

Studies considering both age and sex remain limited, despite sex dimorphism of astrocytes and microglial cells is largely recognized. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effect of a single intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult and aged mice. We assessed the expression of different inflammatory mediators, and the microglial response through binding of [18F]-VC701 tracer to translocator protein (TSPO) receptors in the male and female brain. Aged female brain showed a higher pro-inflammatory response to LPS compared to adult female and to aged male, as revealed by ex vivo binding to TSPO receptors and pro-inflammatory mediator transcript levels. The highest astroglial reaction was observed in the brain of aged females. Differently to the other groups of animals, in aged males LPS challenge did not affect transcription of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). In conclusion, our study shows that in the mouse brain the neuroinflammatory response to an acute peripheral insult is sex and age dependent.

CT2TFDNN not only provides a fast chaotic fuzzy-neuro deep learning and forecast solution, but also successfully resolves the massive data overtraining and deadlock problems, which are usually imposed by traditional recurrent neural networks using classical sigmoid-based activation functions. From the implementation perspective, CT2TFDNN is integrated with 2048 trading-day time-series financial data and top-10 major financial signals as fuzzy financial signals for the real-time prediction of 129 worldwide financial products that consists of: nine major cryptocurrencies, 84 worldwide forex, 19 major commodities, and 17 worldwide financial indices.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2019.2914642", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2942720718", "source": "openalex"}

We anticipate that such quantitative integrative analysis may even be beneficial in a future revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for CNS tumors, ultimately improving patient survival prospects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-062117-121105", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3033630333", "source": "openalex"}

This paper proposes a neuro-fuzzy GMDH model, adopting Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBF) as partial descriptions of GMDH. GRBF is reinterpreted as both a simplified fuzzy reasoning model and as a three-layered neural network. As an example of applying the algorithm, the wheel wear equation is identified, using data from experiments of abrasive cut-off. In the model, characteristics of work materials, grinding fluids, factors of wheels, wheel velocity and table feed are used as input variables, and the grinding ratio is the resulting output.

Although receiver design continues to evolve, residual multipath errors and NLOS signals remain a challenge in built-up areas. It is therefore desirable to identify direct, multipath-affected and NLOS GPS measurements in order improve ranging-based position solutions. The traditional signal strength-based methods to achieve this, however, use a single variable (for example, Signal to Noise Ratio (C/N 0 )) as the classifier. As this single variable does not completely represent the multipath and NLOS characteristics of the signals, the traditional methods are not robust in the classification of signals received. This paper uses a set of variables derived from the raw GPS measurements together with an algorithm based on an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to classify direct, multipath-affected and NLOS measurements from GPS. Results from real data show that the proposed method could achieve rates of correct classification of 100%, 91% and 84%, respectively, for LOS, Multipath and NLOS based on a static test with special conditions.

For this purpose, we used a retrograde tracer technique with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in conjunction with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry as a marker for the dopaminergic neurons. After injections of the tracer into the neuro‐intermediate lobe, a substantial number of HRP‐labeled neurons was observed in the supraoptic and paraventricular neurosecretory nuclei. Furthermore, a cluster of HRP‐positive neurons was found in the tuberal component of the periventricular nucleus where few, if any, neurosecretory magnocellular cells are identified. TH immunohistochemistry on the same sections further revealed that virtually all these HRP‐containing neurons showed TH immunoreactivity. These double‐labeled neurons were medium in size and fusiform or ovoid and appeared to belong to the A14 dopamine cell group. In addition to these medium‐sized double‐labeled neurons, a magnocellular type of double‐labeled cell body was identified just adjacent to the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and in and around the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. These double‐labeled cells appeared to be members of the A14 and A15 dopamine cell groups. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the dopaminergic projections to the cat neuro‐intermediate lobe might originate mainly in the medium‐sized cells located in the tuberal periventricular nucleus and partly in the large‐sized cells located in and around the supraoptic and paraventricular neurosecretory nuclei.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.902440207", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2072685565", "source": "openalex"}

Morphine exposure is known to induce apoptosis, down regulate cAMP response element-binding (CREB) expression and decrease in dendritic branching and spine density in cultured cells. Use of neuroprotective agent; brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which protects neurons against these effects, could be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of opiate addiction. Previous studies have shown that BDNF was not transported through the blood brain barrier (BBB) in-vivo.; and hence it is not effective in-vivo. Therefore development of a drug delivery system that can cross BBB may have significant therapeutic advantage. In the present study, we hypothesized that magnetically guided nanocarrier may provide a viable approach for targeting BDNF across the BBB. We developed a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) based carrier bound to BDNF and evaluated its efficacy and ability to transmigrate across the BBB using an in-vitro BBB model. The end point determinations of BDNF that crossed BBB were apoptosis, CREB expression and dendritic spine density measurement. We found that transmigrated BDNF was effective in suppressing the morphine induced apoptosis, inducing CREB expression and restoring the spine density.

Excitotoxicity is a direct result of abnormal regulation of glutamate concentrations in the synapse, and is a common neurotoxic mediator associated with neurodegenerative disorders. It is well accepted that methamphetamine (METH), a potent central nervous stimulant with high abuse potential, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 are implicated in the progression of neurocognitive malfunction. Both have been shown to induce common neurodegenerative effects such as astrogliosis, compromised blood brain barrier integrity, and excitotoxicity in the brain. Reduced glutamate uptake from neuronal synapses likely leads to the accumulation of glutamate in the extracellular spaces. Astrocytes express the glutamate transporters responsible for majority of the glutamate uptake from the synapse, as well as for vesicular glutamate release. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of astrocyte-mediated excitotoxicity in the context of METH and HIV-1 are undefined. Topics reviewed include dysregulation of the glutamate transporters, specifically excitatory amino acid transporter-2, metabotropic glutamate receptor(s) expression and the release of glutamate by vesicular exocytosis. We also discuss glutamate concentration dysregulation through astrocytic expression of enzymes for glutamate synthesis and metabolism. Lastly, we discuss recent evidence of various astrocyte and neuron crosstalk mechanisms implicated in glutamate regulation. Astrocytes play an essential role in the neuropathologies associated with METH/HIV-1-induced excitotoxicity.

This species was previously known only from India, Nepal, Bhutan and Burma. The index case presented with descending flaccid paralysis typical of neurotoxic envenoming by all Bungarus species, but later developed generalized rhabdomyolysis (peak serum creatine kinase concentration 29 960 units/l) with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure from which he succumbed. Among the other four patients, one died of respiratory paralysis in a peripheral hospital and three recovered after developing paralysis, requiring mechanical ventilation in one patient. One patient suffered severe generalized myalgia and odynophagia associated with a modest increase in serum creatine kinase concentration. These are the first cases of Bungarus niger envenoming to be reported from any country. Generalized rhabdomyolysis has not been previously recognized as a feature of envenoming by any terrestrial Asian elapid snake, but a review of the literature suggests that venoms of some populations of Bungarus candidus and Bungarus multicinctus in Thailand and Vietnam may also have this effect in human victims. To investigate this unexpected property of Bungarus niger venom, venom from the snake responsible for one of the human cases of neuro-myotoxic envenoming was injected into one hind limb of rats and saline into the other under buprenorphine analgesia. All animals developed paralysis of the venom-injected limb within two hours. Twenty-four hours later, the soleus muscles were compared histopathologically and cytochemically. Results indicated a predominantly pre-synaptic action (β-bungarotoxins) of Bungarus niger venom at neuromuscular junctions, causing loss of synaptophysin and the degeneration of the terminal components of the motor innervation of rat skeletal muscle. There was oedema and necrosis of extrafusal muscle fibres in envenomed rat soleus muscles confirming the myotoxic effect of Bungarus niger venom, attributable to phospholipases A2. This study has demonstrated that Bungarus niger is widely distributed in Bangladesh and confirms the risk of fatal neuro-myotoxic envenoming, especially as no specific antivenom is currently manufactured. The unexpected finding of rhabdomyolysis should prompt further investigation of the venom components responsible. The practical implications of having to treat patients with rhabdomyolysis and consequent acute renal failure, in addition to the more familiar respiratory failure associated with krait bite envenoming, should not be underestimated in a country that is poorly equipped to deal with such emergencies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq265", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2147097125", "source": "openalex"}

PC-12 cells were used to examine the growth enhancement of SP-GNP in vitro by MTT assays and flow cytometry (FCM). The therapeutic effects of SP-GNP on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced hemiparkinsonian rats were assessed by quantifying rotational behavior and the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), phosphorylated c-Jun protein (p-c-Jun) and Caspase-3 (Cas-3) expressed in substantia nigra (SN) region of hemiparkinsonian rats. Results PC-12 cells under SP-GNP treatment showed better cell viability and lower degree of apoptosis than those under SP solution treatment. Hemiparkinsonian rats under intranasal SP-GNP administration demonstrated better behavioral improvement, higher level of TH in SN along with much lower extent of p-c-Jun and Cas-3 than those under intranasal SP solution administration and intravenous SP-GNP administration.

The fuzzy model employs strain, strain-rate, and temperature as input variables, and provides stress as single output. Gaussian membership functions (MFs) are assigned to each input variables. A total of 12 if—then rules are used to map these MFs to output characteristic. The model obtained from ANFIS training is validated by using an experimental data set that is not used during training. The developed model is capable of simulating behavior of superelastic SMAs at various temperatures and at various loading rates while it remains simple enough to realize numerical simulations. These features of the model make it attractive for numerical studies on vibration control of structures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1045389x10369720", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998976210", "source": "openalex"}

The results were compared with those obtained in 50 healthy volunteers. Data gathered consisted of somatosensory evoked potentials from the posterior tibial nerve (tibial evoked potential) and from the dorsal penile nerve (pudendal evoked potential). Also, 2 sacral reflex latencies were measured (bulbocavernosus reflex and urethro-anal reflex). A total of 58 patients (47%) had at least 1 abnormal neuro-urophysiological measurement. Neuro-urophysiological abnormalities were found more frequently in older patients. The tibial evoked potential was abnormal in 30 patients (24%), pudendal evoked potential in 21 (17%), bulbocavernosus reflex in 26 (21%) and urethro-anal reflex in 32 (26%). It was concluded that somatosensory disturbances constitute an important part of neuro-urophysiological abnormalities. Our results suggest a relationship between erectile dysfunction and subclinical, age-related (penile) sensory disorders. Our study corroborates the importance of penile sensibility for erectile (patho) physiology as suggested by others and supports the concept of sensory deficit impotence as an important cause of erectile dysfunction. © 1991 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByYANG C, BOWEN J, KRAFT G, UCHIO E and KROMM B (2018) CORTICAL EVOKED POTENTIALS OF THE DORSAL NERVE OF THE CLITORIS AND FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSISJournal of Urology, VOL. 164, NO. 6, (2010-2013), Online publication date: 1-Dec-2000.AMARENCO G and KERDRAON J (2018) PUDENDAL NERVE TERMINAL SENSITIVE LATENCY: TECHNIQUE AND NORMAL VALUESJournal of Urology, VOL. 161, NO. 1, (103-106), Online publication date: 1-Jan-1999.Fabra M, Frieling A, Porst H and Schneider E (2018) Single Potential Analysis of Corpus Cavernosum Electromyography for the Assessment of Erectile Dysfunction: Provocation, Reproducibility and Age Dependence-Findings in 36 Healthy Volunteers and 324 PatientsJournal of Urology, VOL. 158, NO. 2, (444-450), Online publication date: 1-Aug-1997.Bemelmans B, Hendrikx L, Koldewijn E, Lemmens W, Debruyne F and Meuleman E (2018) Comparison of Biothesiometry and Neurourophysiological Investigations for the Clinical Evaluation of Patients with Erectile DysfunctionJournal of Urology, VOL. 153, NO. 5, (1483-1486), Online publication date: 1-May-1995.Koldewijn E, Hommes O, Lemmens W, Debruyne F and Van Kerrebroeck P (2018) Relationship Between Lower Urinary Tract Abnormalities and Disease-Related Parameters in Multiple SclerosisJournal of Urology, VOL. 154, NO. 1, (169-173), Online publication date: 1-Jul-1995.Koldewijn E, Rosier P, Meuleman E, Koster A, Debruyne F and Van Kerrebroeck P (2018) Predictors of Success with Neuromodulation in Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction: Results of Trial Stimulation in 100 PatientsJournal of Urology, VOL. 152, NO. 6 Part 1, (2071-2075), Online publication date: 1-Dec-1994.Koldewijn E, Van Kerrebroeck P, Bemelmans B, Notermans S, Lemmens W and Debruyne F (2018) Use of Sacral Reflex Latency Measurements in the Evaluation of Neural Function of Spinal Cord Injury Patients: A Comparison of Neuro-Urophysiological Testing and Urodynamic InvestigationsJournal of Urology, VOL. 152, NO. 2 Part 1, (463-467), Online publication date: 1-Aug-1994.Bemelmans B, Meuleman E, Doesburg W, Notermans S and Debruyne F (2018) Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Men: The Neurological Factor RevisitedJournal of Urology, VOL. 151, NO. 4, (884-889), Online publication date: 1-Apr-1994.Meuleman E, Bemelmans B, van Asten W, Doesburg W, Skotnicki S and Debruyne F (2018) Assessment of Penile Blood Flow by Duplex Ultrasonography in 44 Men with Normal Erectile Potency in different Phases of ErectionJournal of Urology, VOL. 147, NO. 1, (51-56), Online publication date: 1-Jan-1992.Bemelmans B, Van Kerrebroeck P, Notermans S, Wijkstra H and Debruyne F (2018) Motor Evoked Potentials from the Bladder on Magnetic Stimulation of the Cauda Equina: A New Technique for Investigation of Autonomic Bladder InnervationJournal of Urology, VOL. 147, NO. 3 Part 1, (658-661), Online publication date: 1-Mar-1992.

The results are also compared to another artificial intelligence technique of a conventional ANN and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) training solutions. The database used with 504 training datasets (e.g., a range of 80%) and testing dataset consists of 126 items (e.g., 20% of the whole dataset). Moreover, variables of the ANN method (for example, nodes number for each hidden layer) and the algorithm of PSO-like swarm size and inertia weight are improved by utilizing a total of 28 (i.e., for the PSO-ANN) trial and error approaches. The key properties were fed as input, which were utilized via the analysis of OptumG2 finite element modelling (FEM), containing undrained cohesion stability of the baseline soil (Cu), angle of the original slope (β), and setback distance ratio (b/B) where the target is selected factor of safety. The estimated data for datasets of ANN, ANFIS, and PSO-ANN models were examined based on three determined statistical indexes. Namely, root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). After accomplishing the analysis of sensitivity, considering 72 trials and errors of the neurons number, the optimized architecture of 4 × 6 × 1 was determined to the structure of the ANN model. As an outcome, the employed methods presented excellent efficiency, but based on the ranking method, the PSO-ANN approach might have slightly better efficiency in comparison to the algorithms of ANN and ANFIS. According to statistics, for the proper structure of PSO-ANN, the indexes of R2 and RMSE values of 0.9996, and 0.0123, as well as 0.9994 and 0.0157, were calculated for the training and testing networks. Nevertheless, having the ANN model with six neurons for each hidden layer was formulized for further practical use. This study demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed neuro model of PSO-ANN in estimating the factor of safety compared to other conventional techniques.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8090391", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2971699730", "source": "openalex"}

Currently, acupuncture has been partly accepted throughout the world, but the mechanism of acupuncture is still unclear. Since the theory of the neuro-endocrine-immune network was put forward, new insights have been brought into the understanding of the mechanism of acupuncture. Studies have proven that acupuncture is a mechanical stimulus that can activate local cell functions and neuroreceptors. It also regulates the release of related biomolecules (peptide hormones, lipid hormones, neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, and other small and large biomolecules) in the microenvironment, where they can affect each other and further activate the neuroendocrine-immune network to achieve holistic regulation. Recently, growing efforts have been made in the research on the mechanism of acupuncture. Some researchers have transitioned from studying the mechanism of acupuncture as a single linear pathway to using systems approaches, including metabolomics, genomics, proteomics and biological pathway analysis.

Refocussing the Neuro-Enhancement Debate", "text": "Since the 1990's, the debate concerning the ethical, legal and societal aspects of 'neuro-enhancement' has evolved into a massive discourse, both in the public realm and in the academic arena. This ethical debate, however, tends to repeat the same sets of arguments over and over again. Normative disagreements between transhumanists and bioconservatives on invasive or radical brain stimulators, and uncertainties regarding the use and effectivity of nootropic pharmaceuticals dominate the field. Building on the results of an extensive European project on responsible research and innovation in neuro-enhancement (NERRI), we observe and encourage that the debate is now entering a new and, as we will argue, more realistic and societally relevant stage. This new stage concerns those technologies that enter the market as ostensibly harmless contrivances that consumers may use for self-care or entertainment. We use the examples and arguments of participants in NERRI debates to describe three case studies of such purportedly innocent 'toys'. Based upon this empirical material, we argue that these 'soft' enhancement gadgets are situated somewhere in the boundary zone between the internal and the external, between the intimate and the intrusive, between the familiar and the unfamiliar, between the friendly and the scary and, in Foucauldian terms, between technologies of the self and technologies of control. Therefore, we describe their physiognomy with the help of a term borrowed from Jacques Lacan, namely as \"extimate\" technologies.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-016-9283-6", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2548229222", "source": "openalex"}

Studies in bilaterian models have notably highlighted their pivotal role in controlling progression along cell lineages, various Sox family members being involved at one side or the other of the critical balance between self-renewing stem cells/proliferating progenitors, and cells undergoing differentiation. Results We have investigated the expression of 10 Sox genes in the cnidarian Clytia hemisphaerica . Our phylogenetic analyses allocated most of these Clytia genes to previously-identified Sox groups: SoxB ( CheSox2, CheSox3, CheSox10, CheSox13, CheSox14 ), SoxC ( CheSox12 ), SoxE ( CheSox1, CheSox5 ) and SoxF ( CheSox11 ), one gene ( CheSox15 ) remaining unclassified. In the planula larva and in the medusa, the SoxF orthologue was expressed throughout the endoderm. The other genes were expressed either in stem cells/undifferentiated progenitors, or in differentiating (-ed) cells with a neuro-sensory identity (nematocytes or neurons). In addition, most of them were expressed in the female germline, with their maternal transcripts either localised to the animal region of the egg, or homogeneously distributed. Conclusions Comparison with other cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians suggest ancient evolutionary conservation of some aspects of gene expression/function at the Sox family level: (i) many Sox genes are expressed in stem cells and/or undifferentiated progenitors; (ii) other genes, or the same under different contexts, are associated with neuro-sensory cell differentiation; (iii) Sox genes are commonly expressed in the germline; (iv) SoxF group genes are associated with endodermal derivatives. Strikingly, total lack of correlation between a given Sox orthology group and expression/function in stem cells/progenitors vs . in differentiating cells implies that Sox genes can easily switch from one side to the other of the balance between these fundamental cellular states in the course of evolution.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/2041-9139-2-12", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2134094763", "source": "openalex"}

Recently, 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose/positron emission tomography with computed tomography scanning has emerged as a useful modality in diagnosing occult tumors responsible for paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy has been recently associated with the anti-CV2/CRMP-5 antibody. The use of serologic analysis of recombinantly expressed clones (SEREX) has led to the identification of new antigens associated with melanoma-associated retinopathy, such as visual arrestin, rhodopsin, titin, and mitofilin.

We selected an international panel of 19 expert clinicians–researchers in intensive care unit (ICU) with expertise in critical care ultrasonography (US), plus a non-voting methodologist. The panel was divided into five subgroups (brain, lung, heart, abdomen and vascular ultrasound) which identified the domains and generated a list of questions to be addressed by the panel. A Delphi process based on an iterative approach was used to obtain the final consensus statements. Statements were classified as a strong recommendation (84% of agreement), weak recommendation (74% of agreement), and no recommendation (less than 74%), in favor or against. This consensus produced a total of 74 statements (7 for brain, 20 for lung, 20 for heart, 20 for abdomen, 7 for vascular Ultrasound). We obtained strong agreement in favor for 49 statements (66.2%), 8 weak in favor (10.8%), 3 weak against (4.1%), and no consensus in 14 cases (19.9%).

The relationship between performance profiles, clinical characteristics, service utilization, and treatment adherence was also investigated. Method Consecutively recruited outpatients with a broad diagnosis of AN (restricting subtype AN‐R: n = 44, binge‐purge subtype AN‐BP: n = 33 or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified‐AN subtype EDNOS‐AN: n = 23) completed a comprehensive set of neurocognitive (set‐shifting, central coherence) and social‐cognitive measures (Emotional Theory of Mind). Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and a discriminant function analysis. Results Three separate, meaningful clusters emerged. Cluster 1 ( n = 45) showed overall average to high average neuro‐ and social‐ cognitive performance, Cluster 2 ( n = 38) showed mixed performance characterized by distinct strengths and weaknesses, and Cluster 3 ( n = 17) showed poor overall performance (Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) like cluster). The three clusters did not differ in terms of eating disorder symptoms, comorbid features or service utilization and treatment adherence. A discriminant function analysis confirmed that the clusters were best characterized by performance in perseveration and set‐shifting measures. Discussion The findings suggest that considerable neuro‐ and social‐cognitive heterogeneity exists in patients with AN, with a subset showing ASD‐like features. The value of this method of profiling in predicting longer term patient outcomes and in guiding development of etiologically targeted treatments remains to be seen. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Both patients displayed biochemical alterations in renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, as well as in urinary cAMP excretion, similar to those encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism, although plasma levels of parathyroid hormone were within the normal range. Tumor protein extracts stimulated cAMP production, which was inhibited by the PTH‐antagonist (8,18 Nle, 34 Tyr)bPTH‐(3‐34)amide, in the PTH‐responsive osteoblastic cell line UMR‐106. Northern blot analysis of tumor extracts revealed the presence of PTHrP mRNA transcripts, while PTH mRNA was undetectable. In contrast, neither PTHrP mRNA(s) nor cAMP‐stimulating activity was detectable in other neuroendocrine tumors not accompanied by hypercaicemia.

Accurate estimation of the reliability of a CBSS is difficult because it depends on two factors: component reliability and glue code reliability. Moreover, reliability is a real-world phenomenon with many associated real-time problems. Soft computing techniques can help to solve problems whose solutions are uncertain or unpredictable. A number of soft computing approaches for estimating CBSS reliability have been proposed. These techniques learn from the past and capture existing patterns in data. The two basic elements of soft computing are neural networks and fuzzy logic. In this paper, we propose a model for estimating CBSS reliability, known as an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), that is based on these two basic elements of soft computing, and we compare its performance with that of a plain FIS (fuzzy inference system) for different data sets.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2014.04.002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2021556530", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of our study was to assess the role of different domains of cognitive functions to predict balance and fall risk in a sample of adults with various neurological conditions in a rehabilitation setting. Methods This was a prospective, cohort study conducted in a single centre in the UK. 114 participants consecutively admitted to a Neuro-Rehabilitation Unit were prospectively assessed for fall accidents. Baseline assessment included a measure of balance (Berg Balance Scale) and a battery of standard cognitive tests measuring executive function, speed of information processing, verbal and visual memory, visual perception and intellectual function. The outcomes of interest were the risk of becoming a faller, balance and fall rate. Results Two tests of executive function were significantly associated with fall risk, the Stroop Colour Word Test (IRR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.03) and the number of errors on part B of the Trail Making Test (IRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03–1.49). Composite scores of executive function, speed of information processing and visual memory domains resulted in 2 to 3 times increased likelihood of having better balance (OR 2.74 95% CI 1.08 to 6.94, OR 2.72 95% CI 1.16 to 6.36 and OR 2.44 95% CI 1.11 to 5.35 respectively). Conclusions Our results show that specific subcomponents of executive functions are able to predict fall risk, while a more global cognitive dysfunction is associated with poorer balance.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153469", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2344185727", "source": "openalex"}

While previous work has focused on defining the mechanisms of vascular injury leading to retinal neovascularization, recent studies show that neurons are also affected. This study was undertaken to determine the role of the mitochondrial arginine/ornithine regulating enzyme arginase 2 (A2) in retinal neuro-glial cell injury in the mouse model of ROP. Methods and Findings Studies were performed using wild type (WT) and A2 knockout (A2−/−) mice exposed to Oxygen Induced Retinopathy (OIR). Neuronal injury and apoptosis were assessed using immunohistochemistry, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end) labeling and Western blotting. Electroretinography (ERG) was used to assess retinal function. Neuro-glial injury in WT ROP mice was evident by TUNEL labeling, retinal thinning, decreases in number of rod bipolar cells and glial cell activation as compared with room air controls. Significant reduction in numbers of TUNEL positive cells, inhibition of retinal thinning, preservation of the rod bipolar cells and prevention of glial activation were observed in the A2−/− retinas. Retinal function was markedly impaired in the WT OIR mice as shown by decreases in amplitude of the b-wave of the ERG. This defect was significantly reduced in A2−/− mice. Levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, cleaved caspase 9, cytochrome C and the mitochondrial protein Bim were markedly increased in WT OIR retinas compared to controls, whereas the pro-survival mitrochondrial protein BCL-xl was reduced. These alterations were largely blocked in the A2−/− OIR retina. Conclusions Our data implicate A2 in neurodegeneration during ROP. Deletion of A2 significantly improves neuronal survival and function, possibly through the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability mediated apoptosis during retinal ischemia. These molecular events are associated with decreased activation of glial cells, suggesting a rescue effect on macroglia as well.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022460", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2075510198", "source": "openalex"}

However, the junction current is highly non‐linear and depends on cell voltage and temperature. Therefore, its analytical computation is complicated and the manufacturers do not supply any information about this parameter. Moreover, there is no way to measure it physically. Therefore, it is proposed to use the ANFIS algorithm as a powerful technique in order to estimate this current and reconstruct the output PV cell current using the photocurrent.

These factors, notably elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, activate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) leading to an upregulated tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway of tryptophan degradation in the periphery and in the brain. In such conditions the TRYCAT pathway becomes the predominant system for tryptophan degradation in all body compartments. In this paper we review the pathways whereby TRYCATs may play a role in neuro-inflammatory and neuroprogressive disease. Thus chronic activation of the TRYCAT pathway leads to the production of a range of neuroactive, neuroprotective and neurotoxic TRYCATs. Some TRYCATs such as quinolinic acid act as potent neurotoxins which inhibit ATP production by mitochondria, provoke increases in O&NS, disrupt neuron glial communication and blood brain barrier integrity, induce apoptosis of glial cells, directly damage neurons and function as a N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist. Other TRYCATs such as kynurenic acid function as antagonists of NMDA, - amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and kainate receptors and act to regulate levels of glutamate and dopamine. The neuroprotective functions of this TRYCAT are likely exercised via engagement with alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine and aryl hydrocarbon receptors but the neuroprotective effects stemming from elevated kynurenic acid levels come at the price of severely compromised neurocognitive function and emotional processing. Other TRYCATS also possess neurotoxic or neuroprotective properties via pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects.

Moreover, integrated multi-microgrid based clusters are forming in closed vicinities to enhance the benefits of microgrids. However, the power quality problem is one of the key issues to be solved in such systems, which is mainly caused by the rising penetration of nonlinear loads and interfacing of power electronic converters. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new control technique, named \"adaptive neuro-fuzzy control strategy\".

This proposed control strategy uses the advantages of both fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, thereby effectively controls the system. The proposed technique is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink software 2021a. For the analysis, various power quality indices such as voltage sag/swell, voltage unbalance, frequency deviations, power characteristics, total harmonic distortion, and neutral current compensation are measured. These indices of the proposed controller are compared with conventional PI and fuzzy logic-based controllers in view of various key IEEE/IEC standard tolerances.

For this purpose, we developed a systematic approach in producing automatic fuzzy rules based on fuzzy subtractive quantum clustering. This clustering technique is not only an extension of ideas inherent to scale-space and support-vector clustering but also represents an effective prototype that exhibits certain characteristics of the target system to be modeled from the fuzzy subtractive method. Furthermore, we developed linear-regression QANFN (LR-QANFN) as an incremental model to deal with localized nonlinearities of the system, so that all modeling discrepancies can be compensated. After adopting the construction of the linear regression as the first global model, we refined it through a series of local fuzzy if-then rules in order to capture the remaining localized characteristics. The experimental results revealed that the proposed QANFN and LR-QANFN yielded a better performance in comparison with radial basis function networks and the linguistic model obtained in previous literature for an automobile mile-per-gallon prediction, Boston Housing data, and a coagulant dosing process in a water purification plant.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmcb.2009.2015671", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126990626", "source": "openalex"}

This study presents an approach where a hybrid optimization technique based on genetic algorithm (GA) and a Neuro-Fuzzy system as proxy was created and used to determine the optimal well locations regarding net present value (NPV) maximization as the objective. Neuro-Fuzzy system was used as proxy to decrease the numbers of costly and time consuming-simulations. Such a system has supplanted a conventional technology in some scientific applications and engineering systems, especially in modeling nonlinear systems. Neuro-Fuzzy modeling is a flexible framework, in which different paradigms can be combined, providing, on the one hand, a transparent interface with the designer and, on the other hand, a tool for accurate nonlinear modeling. The rule-based character of Neuro-Fuzzy models allows for the analysis and interpretation of the result. Within Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA), a database of the completed simulations is made. This database is used to construct of Neuro-Fuzzy network. Then this network is used to estimate the fitness function at points that no simulations have not been done. This proxy is also able to get better during the optimization each time a new point is verified and visited points database is updated. A synthetic reservoir was tested and comparisons made among HGA, simple GA and non-proxy using approaches. Results showed that Neuro-Fuzzy system is very reliable proxy to estimate fitness function so the HGA will have a good chance to obtain the optimal place for the well in minimum possible duration.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2118/112214-ms", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2041746126", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W3039807755", "title": "Tele-Neuro-Ophthalmology During the Age of COVID-19", "text": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rapidly and dramatically transform the daily lives of patients and health care providers across the world. The number of new cases even at the time of this writing continues to grow. As individuals and as physicians, we have a responsibility to our patients and to society to \"first, do no harm.\" As such, neuro-ophthalmologists must balance their sacred oath to \"treat the sick\" against the need for social distancing to help \"flatten the disease curve.\" The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and other public health organizations have actively updated recommendations and have suggested practices and protocols that may be of interest to practicing ophthalmologists. The AAO's early guidelines recommended that ophthalmologists defer any routine or nonurgent appointments in the clinic and postpone all elective surgical cases (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table E1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Thus, we have a responsibility to appropriately triage new and returning patients to ensure the safety of providers, patients, and the general public during and following this unprecedented pandemic. Neuro-ophthalmologists, however, often diagnose vision-threatening and potentially life-threatening disease, and delay in diagnosis or treatment can be devastating. Therefore, alternatives have been proposed to balance our competing interests of individual patient and provider safety from COVID-19 against the potential risk of undiagnosed or untreated neuro-ophthalmic disease. Recent expansion of telehealth benefits for Medicare patients allows and encourages neuro-ophthalmologists to integrate telemedicine into practice (1). The North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) has supported the use of telehealth in practice, and the reader is referred to the NANOS website for updates, resources, and webinars for the instruction of telemedicine skills for neuro-ophthalmologists. Furthermore, there is no doubt that neuro-ophthalmologists are widely recognized as a scarce resource. According to a recent NANOS membership survey of US practicing physicians, there are 1.75 million people per 1.0 CFTE neuro-ophthalmologist, and only 187 total practicing CFTE in the nation (2). With an average wait time of 6 weeks, and with over 30% of survey respondents reporting over 3-month wait times, telemedicine is an intriguing alternative for patients from poorly represented regions of the country. In this article, we present possible \"best practices\" for neuro-ophthalmologists to design and implement tele-neuro-ophthalmology during and following this national and international crisis. We review the previsit, intravisit, and postvisit steps in a practical manner that we hope will be of value to practicing neuro-ophthalmologists. We include sections on how to appropriately implement telemedicine and patient selection, focusing on different types of visits, determining eligible patients, and triaging patients. In addition, we outline the software and hardware requirements for the electronic medical record (EMR), including Epic and non-Epic platforms. We also describe the nuts and bolts of how to get started, including descriptions of the multiple useful applications and software available. As with any medical encounter, privacy regulations, billing, and coding can be significant hurdles to implementation, and we discuss each in detail. We hope that this article will be of use for neuro-ophthalmologists, comprehensive ophthalmologists, and general neurologists because we deal with effects and aftereffects of this COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that this current disruptive innovation will drive the future of telemedicine in neuro-ophthalmology. IMPLEMENTATION AND PATIENT SELECTION Choosing Telehealth Modalities The terms \"telehealth\" and \"telemedicine\" are used interchangeably in this article because there is a significant interagency variation in and continual evolution of these concepts and associated technology modalities. Face-to-face telemedicine encounters between the provider and the patient are conducted through synchronous (live real-time) interaction through electronic audio and video platforms. Email or other time delayed methods (a.k.a. \"asynchronous\" or \"store and forward\") address information electronically stored and used for patient communication, information gathering or dissemination, or provider-to-provider consultation (\"E-consults\"). Specific telemedicine terminology is detailed in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table E2, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Institutional consideration for telemedicine is described in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table E3, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Indications for each of the main modalities of telehealth delivery are described here (also, see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table E4, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). When to Consider a Video Visit Video visit is optimal for those who desire a more personal connection to their provider and for external examinations. Although suboptimal compared with an in-person examination, especially for patients with suspected optic neuropathies with subjective vision changes, returning patients may still find comfort, counsel, and education from the clinician over video. In many cases, an in-person eye examination has already been performed elsewhere, and the neuro-ophthalmic virtual video visit is more of an informative review to discuss diagnostic findings, educate, and plan rather than to repeat the examination. Outside visual field testing, ocular imaging, and neuroimaging can still be presented visually to the patient in a virtual visit through screen-sharing. Video visits can also be particularly useful for visualizing an external lid, strabismus, or orbital problem (e.g., ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, or proptosis). The clinician can instruct the patient to demonstrate any neuro-ophthalmic signs over video platforms (e.g., ocular motility examination or even ice pack testing for myasthenia gravis). Synchronous video telemedicine is the best mimic of an in-person clinic visit, and it may have value in simply fostering uninterrupted time to consult one-on-one with the physician. When to Consider Phone Visits Phone visits may be used for the follow-up of a patient who has a known pathology with subjective outcome measures, such as ischemic cranial nerve palsy with accompanying diplopia, which is expected to recover over 6–12 weeks. If the diplopia is not recovered, the patient can then be brought into clinic or undergo further remote video visits to assess clinical progress. Phone visits also offer an opportunity for providers to adjust medications for patients with migraines or myasthenia gravis. In addition, a physician can use phone visits to triage visual symptoms with a normal dilated eye examination by another provider or discuss medication compliance and tolerance, neuroimaging findings, and laboratory test results. When to Consider Email or Online Portal Communication Established patients may decide to reach out through email or online (EMR) portal regarding their condition. This modality, because it is not real time, is best suited for communications that are not as time-sensitive (e.g., medication refills, test results, treatment plans, overall condition, or scheduling). Online portal communication can also aid in sharing photographs or videos (e.g., external examination findings, OCT, or visual fields) to aid in clinical evaluation. If there is a question or concern raised by the patient that may be better addressed in real time, a video or phone visit may then be undertaken. When to Consider Provider-to-Provider Consultation (\"E-consult\") Neuro-ophthalmologists are often asked by other providers to provide consultations regarding the diagnosis or management of a patient but without the expectation of a clinic appointment (the so-called curbside consultation). This may be preferable for patients located in remote areas, who already have an engaged clinician. In an e-consult, the neuro-ophthalmologist would review clinical records and imaging, and then provide a written summary of impressions and recommendations to the referring provider. This option is ideal if the neuro-ophthalmologist determines that the patient requires related testing or medical care before an appointment or does not need their in-person examination (Fig. 1).FIG. 1.: Choosing the appropriate type of telemedicine visit. *New telephone consults with patients are not typically a covered service. DFE, dilated fundus examination.Selecting Appropriate Patients for Telemedicine Services Selecting cases in neuro-ophthalmology that can be seen safely and effectively through telemedicine is a controversial discussion, but necessary given the COVID-19–related social distancing restrictions and need to maintain access to neuro-ophthalmic care. Particularly, as clinics recover from these restrictions, poor access to specialty care will be further limited, necessitating options for \"work-arounds\" to traditional clinic schedules. Some general guidelines for patient selection are summarized in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table E5, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422). Triaging Neuro-Ophthalmology Patients Throughout the Crisis In a national crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, the normal triage techniques for appropriate patients may no longer apply in some cases. Before COVID-19, a telemedicine visit might follow an initial in-person visit: the patient could complete local visual field testing, fundus photographs, OCT, and/or MRI, and then review the results with the neuro-ophthalmologist over phone or video as the case history is discussed. In this setting, the neuro-ophthalmologist could use a majority of the information normally gleaned from an in-person examination. Nevertheless, this format may not be possible during a health crisis requiring social distancing in all clinical settings (i.e., no ancillary testing). Thus, what can be seen on videos and gleaned from history is perhaps all the information one may have to make a clinical workup or treatment decision.FIG. 2.: Coding for telemedicine services.For new referrals, the neuro-ophthalmologist may be forced to rely on the review of the patient's previous medical records and ancillary testing to determine whether the patient urgently needs to be seen in-person. Before COVID-19, the solution was generally \"send them to the clinic\" for the neuro-ophthalmologist to perform the initial evaluation before coordinating care; now, some coordination of care may need to precede the face-to-face evaluation. Just as general neurologists and ophthalmologists are trained to order laboratory testing in suspected giant cell arteritis before the patient may see a neuro-ophthalmologist, there are other situations in which a neuro-ophthalmologist may be able to direct referring providers in obtaining appropriate testing before an in-person evaluation. Telemedicine services such as the interprofessional consultation or live video telemedicine evaluation may allow the neuro-ophthalmologist to obtain sufficient data to make a reasonable recommendation on management, effectively reducing the risk of virus exposure by coordinating the patient's care more efficiently. The neuro-ophthalmologist may still elect to evaluate the patient in-person if necessary. The level of urgency dictates the type of visits available to the patient (e.g., in-person examination, video telemedicine visit, phone telemedicine visit, and interprofessional consultation) and the timeframe for management. The decision as to whether to bring a patient into the clinic for evaluation should also take into account the potential for harm should the patient be exposed to and infected with COVID-19. For example, a 32-year-old healthy patient with a complaint suggesting a low likelihood of serious pathology might still be worth bringing in for evaluation to rule out such pathology, whereas an 82-year-old patient with diabetes who is at high risk of mortality from COVID-19 might be better served with an initial video visit. Many subspecialties have provided general triage guidance for their providers (3). In neuro-ophthalmology, practice patterns vary greatly; thus, triage guidelines may vary between geographic regions, institutional capabilities, and individual patient situations. Although definitions of urgency will differ from provider to provider, telemedicine can be an effective tool for urgent triage and assessment, potentially moving a patient between categories of urgency more accurately. The specific modality choice is based on whether quick access to accurate history or seeing the external examination is paramount to determine next steps in care. Combining various modalities may improve efficacy: phone for triaging patient complaints and determining urgency, then an in-person appointment for assessment, and perhaps a follow-up visit by video once the video platform has been successfully established and the patient is clinically stable. The availability of ancillary testing will determine the ability to follow a patient remotely for optic nerve pathology, such as with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which, in addition to history, requires a fundus view, a visual field, and arguably an OCT to determine clinical stability. In all these clinical situations, the physician may be able to use telemedicine tools to enhance their reach across practice settings, leading to potentially superior care, higher patient satisfaction, and, in the case of COVID-19, a safer environment for all. SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND INTERNET REQUIREMENTS Software The choice of software and hardware for tele-neuro-ophthalmology is highly practice or institution dependent. If the institution already has a telemedicine platform that is integrated into the electronic health record (EMR), then the choice is clear and simple. Many institutions, however, may be overwhelmed with onboarding high volumes of providers to their integrated telemedicine platform. Recent changes in the policies and procedures of the Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) have led to waiving of penalties for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violations against health care providers, assuming that they serve patients in good faith. This change allows telemedicine providers to communicate using everyday communication technologies and has permitted for the use of third-party platform applications during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency (4). There are many third-party platform applications available; however, we are highlighting one representative technology in this monograph (doxy.me) (5). Doxy.me is free, is HIPAA compliant, and includes a business associate agreement (BAA) that is easy to use for both provider and patient. Other free platforms, however, include Zoom, Cisco Webex, Skype, and Apple FaceTime, but depending on the version that is selected, clinicians should be aware of issues regarding cost, security, and patient privacy. For example, the free version of Zoom automatically ends the call at 40 minutes if there are more than 3 participants on the call. For full service, one would need to purchase Zoom Pro or Zoom for Healthcare. Clinicians should also consider choosing a platform that is HIPAA compliant (e.g., FaceTime and Skype are not compliant) to avoid compliance issues and/or penalties after the pandemic emergency has ended when the exemptions may be reversed. The Texas Medical Association has also compiled a list of third-party vendors, which includes features and pricing information (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table E6, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A422) (5). For the purpose of educating residents or fellows, there is an advantage to platforms that allow more than 2 participants, such as Zoom, so that the resident may join on the visit, with the patient's permission, as part of their resident education. Understanding the setup and needs of one's practice will dictate the best type of third-party telemedicine platform. For example, if one already has an existing EHR and does not want to invest in a telemedicine platform that requires integration with that EHR, obtaining a platform that is independent for a low monthly fee may make most financial sense (e.g., doxy.me and Zoom for Healthcare). If one seeks full integration of appointment scheduling, EHR, telemedicine visits, electronic medication orders, and patient portal communication, other platforms (e.g., AmWell, NextGen, and Zipnosis) offer more comprehensive services. Hardware requirements and some general guidelines for the setup are included in Supplemental Digital Content 2 (see Data E1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A423). The authors are not endorsing any specific vendor, the accuracy, or timeliness of this compilation. TELEMEDICINE USING EPIC AND NON-EPIC PLATFORMS Connecting With the Patient: Implementation of Technology for Telehealth Neuro-Ophthalmology Visits The mechanism used for establishing a video connection with the patient to perform a virtual visit will depend on whether your institution or practice uses Epic and whether telehealth platforms have been formalized and embedded into the Epic system. Before initiation of a telemedicine visit, patient consent is required and must be documented. As a result, you should obtain and document patient consent in the chart before every telemedicine visit. Below is sample language that you can use:\"This is a telemedicine visit that was performed with the originating site at [INSERT PATIENT LOCATION] and the distant site at [INSERT PROVIDER LOCATION]. Verbal consent to participate in video visit was obtained. This visit occurred during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency. I discussed with the patient the nature of our telemedicine visits and its inherent limitations, that: I would evaluate the patient and recommend diagnostics and treatments based on my assessment. Our sessions are not being recorded and that personal health information is protected. Our team would provide follow-up care in person if/when the patient needs it.\" Virtual Visits Through Epic in a Formalized and Embedded System Differences in Epic functionality and appearance may vary across medical centers and practices; thus, what follows serves as an example of how the system appears and functions at a single institution. A prerequisite for provision of virtual visits in Epic is setting up Epic on either an iPhone or iPad. Although Epic can be set up on Android phones, in this institution's example, Android phones cannot currently be used for virtual visits. The Epic application for iPhone use is called Haiku (see Supplemental Digital Content 3, Figure E1, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A411) and for iPad use is called Canto. The process of obtaining Haiku on the iPhone or Canto on the iPad, in this example, involves first downloading an application in the App Store called \"Intelligent Hub\" that allows installation of a program called \"AirWatch.\" This allows for remote management of work-related applications and is often the mechanism by which work email is obtained on a smartphone. Therefore, it may already exist on your phone if you receive your work email on your phone. Once installed, the Haiku or Canto application must be set up in Settings to allow for notifications. For those at academic medical centers, the information technology department is typically available to assist. Once Haiku or Canto exists on your iPhone or iPad, respectively, virtual visits may occur using that device. When administrative staff schedule a patient for a virtual visit, these virtual visits are noted on the clinic schedule as a \"Video Visit\" type, and a video camera symbol can be seen on the schedule on Haiku, Canto, or the typical PC Epic schedule (see Supplemental Digital Contents 4 and 5, Figure E2A and E2B, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A412, and https://links.lww.com/WNO/A413). This visit type can occur within an existing face-to-face clinic schedule or on a day consisting of virtual visits alone. An example of such an embedded schedule is the following: a new face-to-face patient at 9 am, an established patient virtual video visit at 10 am, an established face-to-face patient at 10:30 am, etc. The video visit duration will be set on your schedule for the duration that you set for new and established visits, but as in a face-to-face visit, the duration of the visit just holds the spot on the schedule. Once the video visit is started, the video call does not automatically disconnect at any point. You will terminate the call only when the visit is completed. The prerequisite for the patient to have a virtual visit through Epic is for them to have an active online portal account. At the time of scheduling, the patient is instructed to sign on for the visit 15 minutes before the visit time, so that they are ready and waiting in the virtual \"waiting room\" when the appointment time arrives. When the patient is connected, the video icon on the Epic schedule turns green on both desktop Epic and Haiku/Canto (see Supplemental Digital Content 6, Figure E2C, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A414), and a push notification appears on the iPhone or iPad that the physician will use for the video visit (see Supplemental Digital Content 7, Figure E3A, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A425). Reminder push notifications are sent at specific intervals until the physician connects with the patient. When ready to connect with the patient for the visit, the physician may either connect to the patient directly from Haiku/Canto or log onto desktop Epic as usual on either a desktop PC or laptop and click on the patient's visit on the schedule to open the chart. If logging onto desktop PC first, a \"Handoff to Haiku/Canto\" button will be present in the upper left corner (see Supplemental Digital Content 8, Figure E3B, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A415). Pushing this button will activate the iPhone/iPad, allow for Haiku/Canto log on, and connection to the patient through the \"Join Video Call\" button in iPhone/iPad (see Supplemental Digital Content 9, Figure E3C, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A416). The video visit proceeds on the iPhone/iPad, and documentation is completed on desktop Epic. Virtual Visits Through a Third-Party App Supplemental Digital Content 10 (Data E2, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A424) includes specific tips on using these applications. Depending on the third-party platform, a consent form may not be available or integrated into the workflow. Doxy.me Go to https://doxy.me/sign-up on your phone, tablet, or computer. Complete all fields and click sign up (see Supplemental Digital Content 11, Figure E4, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A417). Under account settings, you may select the tab \"BAA\" to generate a BAA if applicable. You can also select the checkbox \"I don't need a BAA.\" The telemedicine visit with your patient through doxy.me will work irrespective of your choice regarding a BAA. You will then be logged into your dashboard, and you will be provided a room name link, doxy.me/(the room name you have selected), which will need to be provided to your patients so that they can connect with you at the time of their scheduled appointment (see Supplemental Digital Content 12, Figure E5, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A418). The patient does not need to download any software or create an account within doxy.me. Their sessions are anonymous, and none of their information is stored. They only need to enter your room link into their web browser, type their name, and select \"check in\" (see Supplemental Digital Content 13, Figure E6, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A419). Before the appointment time, you can run a Pre-call Test (see Supplemental Digital Content 14, Figure E7, https://links.lww.com/WNO/A420) whereby doxy.me will run diagnostics on your device, including video and audio quality and stability. When the patient arrives into the virtual waiting room, you will see their image in the upper left corner under the \"patient queue.\" From your mobile device or tablet, you will see a red circle in the upper left corner when a patient is waiting to see you. You can click on the red dot area and, when ready, click the patient's name to start the video. If you are on a computer, click \"start call.\" Then, select \"video call\" to begin the visit. Always allow the use of your camera and microphone. When the video begins, the patient will be on the large screen and the provider will be on the smaller screen. If you hit \"pause the video,\" you will send the patient back into the \"waiting room.\" Once your visit is complete, you can hang up the call with the red telephone icon. Applications for Home Testing A challenge that many providers identify with telemedicine and remote evaluations is the physical examination and other objective data collection. Although remote physical and ocular examinations are not as useful as those in-person, there are a number of technological outlets to simplify and optimize home testing through telemedicine. Multiple smartphone and tablet applications have been validated for remote visual acuity testing. Patients with Android Galaxy phones and someone to help, as the phone is held 2 m away, can use \"PEEK Acuity,\" a free app validated for distance testing (6,7) and use in children (8). Patients who have Apple iPhone 7 Plus or who do not have an assistant available can use \"Vision@home,\" an online test validated for both near (40 cm) and distance (2 m, assistant needed) visual acuities that is accessible free on their phone browser at www.visionathome.com.au (9). For Apple iPad tablet users, \"Eye Chart Pro\" is a free app validated for distance vision (2.5 m, assistant needed) (10) on the iPad and available but not validated on the iPhone. \"Visual Acuity XL\" has also been validated for distance vision (held at 6 m) using the iPad (11), although its accuracy is highly susceptible to glare and it costs $75. Notably, the commonly used app \"Eye Handbook,\" available for Apple iPad and Android users, has a near card test that may overestimate near VA (12). Refer to Table 1 for a review of the findings of each visual acuity application validation study.TABLE 1.: Visual acuity testing with smartphone and tablet reviewSmartphone applications exist for color vision testing, although options are more limited and are hampered by variation in tablet display manufacturing parameters (13). The most promising is contained within the \"Eye Handbook\" app, which is available free for both Apple iPhone and Android users. The app was validated against the Ishihara color vision test in 2 clinical studies (14,15), although a nonclinical study using image analysis found it likely underestimates color vision loss severity in patients with normal contrast sensitivity (CS) and does not contain as many specially designed plates as Ishihara for differentiation of R-G deficiency from total color blindness (8). Other less promising apps include \"Color Blind Test\" (16) and \"Color Vision Test\" (17). Refer to Table 2 for color validation studies. At the moment, these apps can only approximate a color perception test and detailed color testing needs to be performed in-person.TABLE 2.: Smartphone color vision testing application reviewRegarding perimetry, 2 apps \"MRF Glaucoma Lite\" and \"MRF Neuro Lite\" provide reliable Apple iPad–based threshold perimetry, and \"eyesimplify.com\" uses the same technology in a computer browser form. MRF Glaucoma Lite tests the central 30° horizontally and 20° vertically by implementing a radial testing grid and changing the location of the fixation point held approximately 33 cm away (18). Stimuli have an operating range of 0 dB–30 dB and increase in size with eccentricity from Goldmann size III to IV with a background luminance of 5 cd/m2 (15.71 asb). Unexpectedly, altering ambient lighting and viewing distance (between 25 cm and 75 cm) did not affect the threshold in a small group of testing subjects (18). All MRF measurements were highly correlated with those of the 24-2 Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) across multiple investigations (19–22), showing reliability and reproducibility over multiple visits (20–22), strong sensitivity and specificity (20), and faster testing speed than the HFA SITA-Standard (comparable with the HFA SITA-Fast) (21,22). Notably, the proportion of fixation losses is found to be higher and more variable than the HFA (22,23). The most recent MRF technology has been licensed to \"eyesimplify.com\" and released for beta testing in a home computer browser version found at the aforementioned website. This version allows testing of either the 24-2 or the 10-2 visual field and may shortly be accessible on iPad or Android. \"Visual Fields Easy,\" the predecessor to the MRF programs, is another free iPad application; it does suprathreshold screening visual fields of the central 60° horizontally and 48° vertically at a background luminance of 10 cd/m2 (31.5 asb) of the iPad with size V Goldmann equivalent stimulus at 16 dB intensity. Johnson et al found that \"Visual Fields Easy\" detected most visual defects with moderate to advanced loss as seen on SITA-standard testing but had difficulty identifying loss of less than 6 dB (19,24). Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no validated perimetry testing applications exist for patients with Android, although patients without Apple iPads have access to \"eyesimplify.com\" on a home computer browser. Tablet-based perimetry has the potential to cut detection of rapid visual loss in glaucoma from 2.5 years to 0.9 years with more frequent testing (25), bring access to necessary visual field testing to bed-bound hospital patients (26), and transform remote and home testing (23).

This relationship, however, can be highly nonlinear, due to changes in watershed land uses over time. Also, retransformation of data can result in important biases, and available databases usually do not provide the statistical properties needed to apply parametric statistics or time‐series analysis methods. The validity and advantages over customary methods of an Adaptive Neuro‐Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for estimating fluvial nutrient loads in watersheds under time‐varying human impact was tested. Fluvial nutrient loads time‐series were modeled in two watersheds of different size and human impact history. ANFIS and methods based on rating curves and ratio estimators were applied to compare results. The ANFIS approximation gave unbiased estimates of loads and showed advantages over the other methods: It allowed the implementation of a homogeneous, model‐free methodology throughout the data series, avoiding the presence of artifacts in the final load histories; it fitted the observed concentration time‐series better than the other procedures; it worked in real space without the need to logarithmically transform and retransform data; and it gave annual dispersion values, which could be interpreted as annual uncertainties. In addition, the parameters fitted during the ANFIS modeling could be ecologically interpreted, and were a valuable tool to describe features of modeled data and to understand historical changes in human impact on watersheds.

METHODS: To understand better the natural history of this disorder, 28 women participated in a retrospective, questionnaire-based analysis to elucidate factors associated with spontaneous recovery. RESULTS: 54% of subjects developed HA related to an eating disorder, 21% related to stress ± weight loss, and 25% without obvious contributing factors (idiopathic). HA associated with a clear precipitant had a better prognosis than idiopathic HA (71 versus 29% recovery; P < 0.05). Reversal of the inciting factor appeared necessary but not sufficient for recovery (83% recovery if factor reversed). Normal menarche occurred in 61% of subjects, oligomenorrhoea in 32%, and primary amenorrhoea in 7%. Oligomenorrhoea and normal menarche showed a trend toward better prognosis than primary amenorrhoea (NS). Compared with controls, 46% of HA patients had decreased frequency of LH pulses, 7% decreased amplitude, 18% decreases in both frequency and amplitude, 18% absent pulses, and 11% normal-appearing pulses. Pulse pattern at baseline did not predict recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The aetiology of HA at the time of presentation predicts subsequent recovery of menstrual function. In stress, weight loss, or eating disorder-related HA, rates of recovery exceeded 80% when precipitating factors were reversed. Idiopathic HA may represent a different disorder as recovery rates were <30%.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/16.10.2198", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2115903795", "source": "openalex"}

We have taken advantage of two previously developed zebrafish models of neuro-hyperactivity: a chemically induced pentylenetetrazole model and a genetic model caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GABA receptor subunit alpha 1 (GABRA1-/-). Both CBD and THC have a significant effect on the behavioral changes induced by both models. Importantly, we have also shown that when applied together at different ratios of THC to CBD (1:1, 1:5, and 1:10), there was a synergistic effect at a ratio of 1:1. This was particularly important for the genetically induced neuro-hyperactivity as it brought the concentrations of THC and CBD required to oppose the induced behavioral changes to levels that had much less of an effect on baseline larval behavior. The results of this study help to validate the ability of THC and CBD to oppose neuro-hyperactivity linked to seizure modalities. Additionally, it appears that individually, each cannabinoid may be more effective against the chemically induced model than against the GABRA1-/- transgenic model. However, when applied together, the concentration of each compound required to oppose the GABRA1-/- light-induced activity was lowered. This is of particular interest since the use of cannabinoids as therapeutics can be dampened by their side-effect profile. Reducing the level of each cannabinoid required may help to prevent off target effects that lead to side effects. Additionally, this study provides a validation of the complimentary nature of the two zebrafish models and sets a platform for future work with cannabinoids, particularly in the context of neuro-hyperactivity disorders such as epilepsy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.00226", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2924238980", "source": "openalex"}

This systematic review aims to synthesize the reported ICI-associated IRAEs relevant to neuro-ophthalmologists to help in the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Methods: A systematic review of the literature indexed by MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases was searched from inception to May 2020. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Primary studies on ICIs and neuro-ophthalmic complications were included. Outcomes included number of cases and incidence of neuro-ophthalmic IRAEs. Results: Neuro-ophthalmic complications of ICIs occurred in 0.46% of patients undergoing ICI and may affect the afferent and efferent visual systems. Afferent complications include optic neuritis (12.8%), neuroretinitis (0.9%), and giant cell arteritis (3.7%). Efferent complications include myasthenia gravis (MG) (45.0%), thyroid-like eye disease (11.9%), orbital myositis (13.8%), general myositis with ptosis (7.3%), internuclear ophthalmoplegia (0.9%), opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (0.9%), and oculomotor nerve palsy (0.9%). Pembrolizumab was the most common causative agent for neuro-ophthalmic complications (32.1%). Mortality was highest for MG (19.8%). Most patients (79.8%) experienced improvement or complete resolution of neuro-ophthalmic symptoms due to cessation of ICI and immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids. Conclusion: While incidence of neuro-ophthalmic IRAEs is low, clinicians involved in the care of cancer patients must be aware of their presentation to facilitate prompt recognition and management.

No drug exists for AD, but its progression can be delayed if the disorder is identified at its initial stage. Therefore, an early analysis of AD is of fundamental importance for patient care and efficient treatment. Neuroimaging techniques aim to assist the physician in the diagnosis of brain disorders by using images. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a kind of neuroimaging technique employed to create 3D images of the brain. Due to many PET images, researchers attempted to develop computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to differentiate normal control from AD. Most of the earlier methods used image processing techniques for preprocessing and attributes extraction and then developed a model or classifier to classify the brain images. As a result, the retrieved features had a significant impact on the recognition rate of previous techniques. A novel and enhanced CAD system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is formulated to address this issue, capable of discriminating normal control from Alzheimer's disease patients. The proposed approach is evaluated using the 18FDG-PET images of 855 patients, including 635 normal control and 220 Alzheimer's disease patients from the ADNI database.

The high ability group, on the other hand showed significantly larger articulation space in all three conditions. In addition, articulation space also correlated positively with imitation ability (Pearson's r = 0.7, p < 0.01).

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is able to depict with unprecedented accuracy metabolic biomarkers, which are relevant for molecular subtyping. Ultra-high-field imaging enhances anatomical detail and enables to explore new horizon in tumor imaging. Summary The noninvasive MRI-based assessment of tumor malignancy and molecular status may offer the opportunity to predict prognosis and to select patients who may be candidates for individualized targeted therapies, providing more sensitive tools for their follow-up.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0000000000000328", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2522616166", "source": "openalex"}
{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2067421411", "title": "The Role of ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters in Neuro-Inflammation: Relevance for Bioactive Lipids", "text": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are highly expressed by brain endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These efflux pumps play an important role in maintaining brain homeostasis as they actively hinder the entry of unwanted blood-derived compounds into the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, their high activity at the BBB has been a major hurdle for the treatment of several brain diseases, as they prevent numerous drugs to reach their site of action within the brain. Importantly, recent data indicate that endogenous substrates for ABC transporters may include inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive lipids, suggesting a potential role for ABC transporters in immunological responses, and more specifically in inflammatory brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we will give a comprehensive overview of recent findings that illustrate this novel role for ABC transporters in neuro-inflammatory processes. Moreover, we will provide first insights into underlying mechanisms and focus on the importance for bioactive lipids, in particular platelet-activating factor, herein. A thorough understanding of these events may form the basis for the development for selective treatment modalities to dampen the neuro-inflammatory attack in MS and thereby reducing tissue damage.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2012.00074", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2067421411", "source": "openalex"}

We performed a phase 2 trial of combined bevacizumab and fotemustine for patients with glioblastoma at first relapse after radiotherapy and temozolomide. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), response rate based on RANO criteria and toxicity. Fifty-four patients with recurrent GBM were enrolled. The authors observed a 6-month PFS rate of 42.6 % (95 % CI 29.3–55.2) and a median PFS of 5.2 months (95 % CI 3.8–6.6). The median OS was 9.1 months (95 % CI 7.3–10.3). Twenty-eight patients (52 %) had a radiographic response, and a significant neurological improvement with steroid reduction was observed in 25/42 symptomatic patients (60 %). MGMT promoter methylation was significantly associated with improved PFS in univariate analysis. Most unifocal tumors at baseline had a focal enhancing progression (76 %), while the diffuse non-enhancing progression accounted for 9.5 %. Response or survival were not associated with any pattern of progression. Survival after failure of treatment was short. Twelve out of 54 patients (22 %) discontinued fotemustine for grade 3/4 myelotoxicity, while 4/54 (7.4 %) discontinued bevacizumab.

As such, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) has become an important outcome variable. The purpose of this study was to identify socio‐economic, behavioural, (neuro)psychological and clinical determinants of HRQoL among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Methods This study was conducted between 1 January and 31 December 2012 at the AIDS Reference Centre of Ghent University Hospital, a tertiary care referral centre in Belgium. Validated self‐report questionnaires were administered to collect socio‐demographic data, to assess HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study‐HIV), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory‐II) and adherence to HAART (Short Medication Adherence Questionnaire) and to screen for neurocognitive dysfunction. Results A total of 237 people participated, among whom 187 (78.9%) were male. Mean age was 45.8±10.7 years and 144 (63.7%, 144/226) participants were homosexual. Median physical and mental health score (PHS, MHS) were 55.6 (IQR 48.2–60.6) and 52.0 (IQR 44.2–57.9), respectively. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that incapacity to work, depressive symptoms, neurocognitive complaints (NCCs), dissatisfaction with the patient–physician relationship and non‐adherence were all negatively associated with HRQoL. Conclusions Socio‐economic (work status), behavioural (adherence) and (neuro)psychological (depressive symptoms, NCCs) determinants independently impact HRQoL among this cohort of PLHIV.

However, the treponemes isolated from patients with yaws, endemic syphilis, and venereal syphilis are genetically identical subspecies of Treponema pallidum. The controversy surrounding distinctions between syphilis and yaws is presented in its historical context, and reports of congenital, visceral, and CNS complications of yaws are reviewed. Isolation of treponemes from aqueous humor, as well as CSF abnormalities in 24.9% of 902 patients with yaws, indicate the existence of CNS involvement. The high prevalence of tropical myeloneuropathies of unknown origin discovered in areas of previous treponemal endemicity, particularly in Jamaica and Colombia, may represent late complications of yaws. Careful analysis of the collected evidence indicates that potential sequelae of yaws include congenital, visceral, and tertiary CNS lesions identical to those of venereal syphilis.

The mechanisms that organize and control paternal behavior remain poorly understood. Using Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice, two species at opposite ends of the paternal spectrum, we identified that distinct electrical oscillation patterns in neuroendocrine dopamine neurons link to a chain of low dopamine release, high circulating prolactin, prolactin receptor-dependent activation of medial preoptic area galanin neurons, and paternal care behavior in male mice. In rats, the same parameters exhibit inverse profiles. Optogenetic manipulation of these rhythms in mice dramatically shifted serum prolactin and paternal behavior, whereas injecting prolactin into non-paternal rat sires triggered expression of parental care.

SP (10 −13 ‐10 −10 M) induced a phasic contraction of longitudinal muscle strips, but did not change the muscle tone of circular muscle strips, in concentrations up to 10 −8 M. SP (10 10 ‐10‐ 8 M) evoked three different membrane responses in longitudinal muscle cells: (i) bursts of spike discharges with no significant change in the membrane potential and input membrane resistance; (ii) bursts of spike discharges with a small but clear depolarization of the membrane and increase in the input membrane resistance; (iii) slow waves with no change in the membrane potential. In the circular muscle cells, low concentrations of SP (&lt; 10 −8 M) did not affect the membrane potential or the spikes, but SP (10 −7 M) increased the spike discharges with no significant change in the membrane potential. SP (10 −10 M) reduced the threshold depolarization required for the generation of action potentials with no change in membrane potential of the longitudinal muscle cells. Pretreatment with atropine (5 × 10 −6 M), tetrodotoxin (TTX 10 −6 M) or baclofen (4.7 × 10 −6 M) had no effect on the excitatory actions of SP on the smooth muscle cells of longitudinal and circular muscle strips. Excitatory actions of SP on the membrane potential or spike activities of longitudinal muscle cells were preserved in NaCl but not in Ca‐deficient solution. SP (10 −10 ‐10 −9 M) enhanced the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials (e.j.ps) evoked by electrical field stimulation in longitudinal muscle cells with no change in the membrane potential and input resistance. SP (10 −10 ‐10 −9 M), however, did not change the amplitude of inhibitory junction potentials (i.j.ps) recorded from the circular muscle cells. These results indicate that SP in relatively low concentrations acts on both smooth muscle cells and on excitatory neuro‐effector transmission in the longitudinal muscle; the main site of the action of SP is probably the muscle membrane.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1982.tb09218.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1976818503", "source": "openalex"}

Despite current advances in MRI, non‐invasive diagnosis of paediatric brain tumours has yet to find its way into routine clinical practice. Radiomics , the high‐throughput extraction and analysis of quantitative image features (e.g. texture), offers potential solutions for tumour characterization and decision support. In the search for diagnostic oncological markers, the primary aim of this work was to study the application of MRI texture analysis (TA) for the classification of paediatric brain tumours. A multicentre study was carried out, within a supervised classification framework, on clinical MR images, and a support vector machine (SVM) was trained with 3D textural attributes obtained from conventional MRI. To determine the cross‐centre transferability of TA, an assessment of how SVM performs on unseen datasets was carried out through rigorous pairwise testing. The study also investigated the nature of features that are most likely to train classifiers that can generalize well with the data. Finally, the issue of class imbalance, which arises due to some tumour types being more common than others, was explored. For each of the tests carried out through pairwise testing, the optimal area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged between 76% and 86%, suggesting that the model was able to capture transferable tumour information. Feature selection results suggest that similar aspects of tumour texture are enhanced by MR images obtained at different hospitals. Our results also suggest that the availability of equally represented classes has enabled SVM to better characterize the data points. The findings of the study presented here support the use of 3D TA on conventional MR images to aid diagnostic classification of paediatric brain tumours.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.3781", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2767121451", "source": "openalex"}

Subjects were randomized into a \"control\" group attending a traditional classroom and a \"trial\" group of equal numbers participating in an online synchronous internet streaming classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. Main outcome measures: Pre and post multiple choice examinations Methods: All candidates took a pretest examination of the subject material. 2-9 hour and 1-8 hour sessions over 3 consecutive days were given live in the classroom and synchronously in the online classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. Subjects randomized to the online classroom attended the lectures in a location of their choice and viewed the sessions live on the Internet. A posttest examination was given to all candidates after completion of the course. Two sample unpaired t tests with equal variances were calculated for all pretests and posttests for all groups including gender differences. Results: All 274 subjects demonstrated statistically significant learning by comparison of their pre and posttest scores.

Regarding these three aspects, there are major differences across the spectrum of primary brain tumors depending on specific histology. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the biological basis of the prognostic marker 'age' in neuro-oncology. Recent findings Contemporary population-based studies confirm the strong prognostic impact of age in many brain tumors. Elderly patients continue to be treated less aggressively than younger patients with the same tumors. However, biological factors may contribute to the negative prognostic impact of age. For instance, among gliomas, mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes, which are prognostically favorable, are much more common in younger patients. Moreover, complete responses defined by neuroimaging were much less durable in elderly as opposed to younger patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma in the German Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Study Group trial.

The role of the immune system in altered sensation following nerve injury is well documented. However, its role in the development of affective-motivational disturbances remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to characterise changes in the immune response at peripheral and spinal sites in a rat model of neuropathic pain and disability.Sixty-two rats underwent sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) and were characterised as either Pain and disability, Pain and transient disability or Pain alone on the basis of sensory threshold testing and changes in post-CCI dominance behaviour in resident-intruder interactions. Nerve ultrastructure was assessed and the number of T lymphocytes and macrophages were quantified at the site of injury on day six post-CCI. ATF3 expression was quantified in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using a multiplex assay, eight cytokines were quantified in the sciatic nerve, DRG and spinal cord.All CCI rats displayed equal levels of mechanical allodynia, structural nerve damage, and reorganisation. All CCI rats had significant infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes to both the injury site and the DRG. Pain and disability rats had significantly greater numbers of T lymphocytes. CCI increased IL-6 and MCP-1 in the sciatic nerve. Examination of disability subgroups revealed increases in IL-6 and MCP-1 were restricted to Pain and disability rats. Conversely, CCI led to a decrease in IL-17, which was restricted to Pain and transient disability and Pain alone rats. CCI significantly increased IL-6 and MCP-1 in the DRG, with IL-6 restricted to Pain and disability rats. CCI rats had increased IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 in the spinal cord. Amongst subgroups, only Pain and disability rats had increased IL-1β.This study has defined individual differences in the immune response at peripheral and spinal sites following CCI in rats. These changes correlated with the degree of disability. Our data suggest that individual immune signatures play a significant role in the different behavioural trajectories following nerve injury, and in some cases may lead to persistent affective-motivational disturbances.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0318-4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1492728201", "source": "openalex"}

Although neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits are core features of schizophrenia, evidence of a relationship between cognitive impairments and violence within this patient population has been mixed. We prospectively examined whether neurocognition and social cognition predicted inpatient violence amongst patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (n = 89; 10 violent) over a 12 month period. Neurocognition and social cognition were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Using multivariate analysis neurocognition and social cognition variables could account for 34 % of the variance in violent incidents after controlling for age and gender. Scores on a social cognitive reasoning task (MSCEIT) were significantly lower for the violent compared to nonviolent group and produced the largest effect size. Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between neurocognition and violence was completely mediated by each of the following variables independently: social cognition (MSCEIT), symptoms (PANSS Total Score), social functioning (SOFAS) and violence proneness (HCR-20 Total Score). There was no evidence of a serial pathway between neurocognition and multiple mediators and violence, and only social cognition and violence proneness operated in parallel as significant mediators accounting for 46 % of the variance in violent incidents. There was also no evidence that neurocogniton mediated the relationship between any of these variables and violence. Of all the predictors examined, neurocognition was the only variable whose effects on violence consistently showed evidence of mediation. Neurocognition operates as a distal risk factor mediated through more proximal factors. Social cognition in contrast has a direct effect on violence independent of neurocognition, violence proneness and symptom severity. The neurocognitive impairment experienced by patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may create the foundation for the emergence of a range of risk factors for violence including deficits in social reasoning, symptoms, social functioning, and HCR-20 risk items, which in turn are causally related to violence.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-015-0548-0", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1567760270", "source": "openalex"}

In the neuropsychology literature, prism adaptation behaviour is typically explained by reference to a traditional cognitive psychology framework that distinguishes putative functions, such as 'strategic control' versus 'spatial realignment'. This theoretical framework lacks conceptual clarity, quantitative precision and explanatory power. Here, we advocate for an alternative computational framework that offers several advantages: 1) an algorithmic explanatory account of the computations and operations that drive behaviour; 2) expressed in quantitative mathematical terms; 3) embedded within a principled theoretical framework (Bayesian decision theory, state-space modelling); 4) that offers a means to generate and test quantitative behavioural predictions. This computational framework offers a route towards mechanistic neurocognitive explanations of prism adaptation behaviour. Thus it constitutes a conceptual advance compared to the traditional theoretical framework. In this paper, we illustrate how Bayesian decision theory and state-space models offer principled explanations for a range of behavioural phenomena in the field of prism adaptation (e.g. visual capture, magnitude of visual versus proprioceptive realignment, spontaneous recovery and dynamics of adaptation memory). We argue that this explanatory framework can advance understanding of the functional and neural mechanisms that implement prism adaptation behaviour, by enabling quantitative tests of hypotheses that go beyond merely descriptive mapping claims that 'brain area X is (somehow) involved in psychological process Y'.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.12.021", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2754468217", "source": "openalex"}

The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 10), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups.

Patients with posterior cortical atrophy are characterized by increasing higher visual and visuo-spatial impairments. In particular, a key symptom of posterior cortical atrophy is simultanagnosia i.e. the inability to perceive multiple visual objects at the same time. Two neuro-cognitive mechanisms have been suggested to underlie simultanagnosia, either reduced visual short-term memory capacity or decreased visual processing speed possibly resulting from white matter impairments over and above damage to cortical brain areas. To test these distinct hypotheses, we investigated a group of 12 patients suffering from posterior cortical atrophy with homogenous lesion sides in parieto-occipital cortices and varying severity of grey and white matter loss. More specifically, we (i) tested whether impaired short-term memory capacity or processing speed underlie symptoms of simultanagnosia; (ii) assessed the link to grey and white matter damage; and (iii) integrated those findings into a neuro-cognitive model of simultanagnosia in patients with posterior cortical atrophy. To this end, simultaneous perception of multiple visual objects was tested in patients with posterior cortical atrophy mostly with positive Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and healthy age-matched controls. Critical outcome measures were identification of overlapping relative to non-overlapping figures and visuo-spatial performance in tests sensitive to simultanagnosia. Using whole report of briefly presented letter arrays based on the mathematically formulated 'Theory of Visual Attention', we furthermore quantified parameters of visual short-term memory capacity and visual processing speed. Grey and white matter atrophy was assessed by voxel-based morphometry analyses of structural magnetic resonance data. All patients showed severe deficits of simultaneous perception. Compared to controls, we observed a specific slowing of visual processing speed, while visual short-term memory capacity was preserved. In a regression analysis, processing speed was identified as the only significant predictor of simultaneous perception deficits that explained a high degree of variance (70–82%) across simultanagnosia tasks. More severe slowing was also indicative for more severe impairments in reading and scene comprehension. Voxel-based morphometry yielded extensive reductions of grey and white matter in parieto-occipital and thalamic brain areas. Importantly, the degree of individual atrophy of white matter in left superior parietal lobe, but not of any grey matter region, was associated with processing speed. Based on these findings, we propose that atrophy of white matter commonly observed in posterior cortical atrophy leads to slowing of visual processing speed, which underlies the overt clinical symptoms of simultanagnosia. Deficits of simultaneous perception (simultanagnosia) are common in posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), but the precise underlying mechanism is unclear. By testing patients with PCA owing to Alzheimer's disease, Neitzel et al. show that simultanagnosia reflects an impairment of visual processing speed caused by white matter atrophy within the left superior parietal lobe.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/aww235", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2529480623", "source": "openalex"}

The training step of these methods generally requires huge datasets to build a model of the degradation signal, and estimate the limit under which the degradation signal should stay. Applicability and accuracy of these methods are thereby closely related to the amount of available data, and even sometimes requires the user to make assumptions on the dynamics of health states evolution. Following that, the aim of this paper is to propose a method for prognostics and remaining useful life estimation that starts from scratch, without any prior knowledge. Assuming that remaining useful life can be seen as the time between the current time and the instant where the degradation is above an acceptable limit, the proposition is based on a classification of prediction strategy (CPS) that relies on two factors. First, it relies on the use of an evolving real-time neuro-fuzzy system that forecasts observations in time. Secondly, it relies on the use of an evidential Markovian classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory that enables classifying observations into the possible functioning modes. This approach has the advantage to cope with a lack of data using an evolving system, and theory of belief functions. Also, one of the main assets is the possibility to train the prognostic system without setting any threshold. The whole proposition is illustrated and assessed by using the CMAPPS turbofan dataset. RUL estimates are shown to be very close to actual values, and the approach appears to accurately estimate the failure instants, even with few learning data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tr.2014.2315912", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2058817067", "source": "openalex"}

The visual pathway is prone to derangements in patients with craniosynostosis, particularly in syndromic cases, and there is a risk for permanent vision loss when ocular disease complications are not identified and properly treated early in life. Extensive advancements have been made in our understanding of the etiologies underlying vision loss in craniosynostosis over the last 20 years. Children with craniosynostosis are susceptible to interruptions in visual input arising from strabismus, refractive errors, and corneal damage; any of these aberrations can result in understimulation of the visual cortex during childhood neurodevelopment and permanent amblyopia. Elevated intracranial pressure resulting from abnormal cranial shape or volume can lead to papilledema and, ultimately, optic atrophy and vision loss. A pediatric ophthalmologist is a crucial component of the multidisciplinary care team that should be involved in the care of craniosynostosis patients and consistent ophthalmologic follow-up can help minimize the risk to vision posed by such entities as papilledema and amblyopia. This article aims to review the current understanding of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in craniosynostosis and explore diagnostic and management considerations for the ophthalmologist taking care of these patients.

In the proposed WNF model, the discrete wavelet analysis was linked to a NF approach. To achieve this aim, the observed time series of river flow discharge ( Q ) and S were decomposed to sub time series at different scales by discrete wavelet transform. Afterwards, the effective sub time series were added together to obtain a useful Q and S time series for prediction. Eventually, the obtained total time series were imposed as inputs to the NF method for daily S prediction. The results illustrated that the predicted values by the proposed WNF model were in good agreement with the observed S values and gave better results than other models. Furthermore, the WNF model satisfactorily estimated the cumulative suspended sediment load and produced relatively reasonable predictions for extreme values of S , while NF, MLR, and SRC models provided unacceptable predictions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/clen.200900191", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2042951562", "source": "openalex"}

Noise annoyance caused by wind turbines has become an emerging problem in recent years, due to the rapid increase in number of wind turbines, triggered by sustainable energy goals set forward at the national and international level. Up to now, not all aspects of the generation, propagation and perception of wind turbine noise are well understood. For a modern large wind turbine, aerodynamic noise from the blades is generally considered to be the dominant noise source, provided that mechanical noise is adequately eliminated. The sources of aerodynamic noise can be divided into tonal noise, inflow turbulence noise, and airfoil self-noise. Many analytical and experimental acoustical studies performed the wind turbines. Since the wind turbine noise level analyzing by numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) could be very challenging and time consuming, soft computing techniques are preferred.

A structured review", "text": "Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) assert that combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language, it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better understanding of progress in the field.

In conventional methods, the emulator neural network is used to evaluate the sensitivity of structural response to the control signal. To use the emulator, it should be trained to predict the dynamic response of the structure. Much of the time is usually spent on training of the emulator. In the proposed algorithm, however, it takes only one sampling time to obtain the sensitivity. Therefore, training time for the emulator is eliminated. As a result, only one neural network is used for the neuro‐control system. In the numerical example, the three‐storey building structure with linear and non‐linear stiffness is controlled by the trained neural network. The actuator dynamics and control time delay are considered in the simulation. Numerical examples show that the proposed control algorithm is valid in structural control.

Artificial neural networks employed for image classification problems do not guarantee high accuracy besides being computationally heavy. The necessity for a large training set to achieve high accuracy is another drawback of ANN. On the other hand, fuzzy logic technique which promises better accuracy depends heavily on expert knowledge, which may not always available. Even though it requires less convergence time, it rely on trial and error method in selecting either the fuzzy membership functions or the fuzzy rules. These problems are overcome by the hybrid model namely, neuro- fuzzy model. This system removes the stringent requirements since it enjoys the benefits of both ANN and the fuzzy logic systems. In this paper, the application of Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) for MR brain tumor classification has been demonstrated. Abnormal brain tumor images from four classes namely metastase, meningioma, glioma and astrocytoma are used in this work. A comprehensive feature set and fuzzy rules are selected to classify an abnormal image to the corresponding tumor type. Experimental results illustrate promising results in terms of classification accuracy and convergence rate. A comparative analysis is performed with the representatives of ANN and fuzzy systems to show the superior nature of ANFIS systems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.24466/ijbschs.16.1_95", "url": "https://openalex.org/W47704406", "source": "openalex"}

The purpose of this review is to analyze the data surrounding the impact of fever across a range of neurologic injuries to better understand the optimal timing and duration of fever control. Recent findings Meta-analyses have demonstrated that fever at onset and in the acute setting after ischemic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest have a negative impact on morbidity and mortality. There are data to support that the impact of fever is sustained for longer durations after subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. However, there are currently no prospective randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of fever control in these patient populations.

Several techniques based on passive and active detection schemes have been proposed previously. Although passive schemes have a large nondetection zone (NDZ), concerns have been raised about active methods because of their degrading effect on power quality. Reliably detecting this condition is regarded by many as an ongoing challenge because existing methods are not entirely satisfactory. This article proposes a new integrated histogram analysis method using a neuro‐fuzzy approach for islanding detection in grid‐connected wind turbines. The main objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the NDZ to as close as possible to zero and to maintain the output power quality unchanged. In addition, this technique can also overcome the problem of setting detection thresholds which is inherent in existing techniques. The method proposed in this study has a small NDZ and is capable of detecting islanding accurately within the minimum standard time. Moreover, for those regions which require better visualization, the proposed approach can serve as an efficient aid for better detecting grid‐power disconnection. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It aims at extracting maximum power from the wind by tracking the maximum power peak regardless of wind speed. The proposed MPPT controller implements an ANFIS approach with a backpropagation algorithm. The rotor speed acts as an input to the controller and torque reference as the controller’s output, which further inputs the rotor side converter’s speed control loop to control the rotor’s actual speed by adjusting the duty ratio for the rotor side converter. The grid partition method generates input membership functions by uniformly partitioning the input variable ranges and creating a single-output Sugeno fuzzy system. The neural network trained the fuzzy input membership according to the inputs and alter the initial membership functions. The simulation results have been validated on a 2 MW wind turbine using the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The controller’s performance is tested under various wind speed circumstances and compared with the performance of a conventional proportional–integral MPPT controller. The simulation study shows that WECS can operate at its optimum power for the proposed controller’s wide range of input wind speed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/en14196275", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3202227089", "source": "openalex"}

The cellular uptake of AEA has been characterized in detail, whereas less is known about the properties of the PEA uptake, in particular in neuronal cells. In the present study, the pharmacological and functional properties of PEA and AEA uptake have been investigated in mouse Neuro‐2a neuroblastoma and, for comparison, in rat RBL‐2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells. Saturable uptake of PEA and AEA into both cell lines were demonstrated with apparent K M values of 28 μ M (PEA) and 10 μ M (AEA) in Neuro‐2a cells, and 30 μ M (PEA) and 9.3 μ M (AEA) in RBL‐2H3 cells. Both PEA and AEA uptake showed temperature‐dependence but only the AEA uptake was sensitive to treatment with Pronase and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The AEA uptake was inhibited by AM404, 2‐arachidonoylglycerol (2‐AG), R1‐ and S1‐methanandamide, arachidonic acid and olvanil with similar potencies for the two cell types. PEA, up to a concentration of 100 μ M , did not affect AEA uptake in either cell line. AEA, 2‐AG, arachidonic acid, R1‐methanandamide, Δ 9 ‐THC, and cannabidiol inhibited PEA transport in both cell lines. The non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug indomethacin inhibited the AEA uptake but had very weak effects on the uptake of PEA. From these data, it can be concluded that PEA is transported in to cells both by passive diffusion and by a facilitated transport that is pharmacologically distinguishable from AEA uptake.

EMG signals from 9 leg muscles and pedal forces were measured bilaterally during recumbent pedaling in 16 post-acute stroke patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Patients were asked to walk over a GaitRite mat and standard gait parameters were computed. Four muscle synergies were extracted through nonnegative matrix factorization in healthy subjects and patients unaffected legs. Two to four synergies were identified in the affected sides and the number of synergies significantly correlated with the Motricity Index (Spearman's coefficient = 0.521). The reduced coordination complexity resulted in a reduced biomechanical performance, with the two-module sub-group showing the lowest work production and mechanical effectiveness in the affected side. These patients also exhibited locomotor impairments (reduced gait speed, asymmetrical stance time, prolonged double support time). Significant correlations were found between cycling-based metrics and gait parameters, suggesting that neuro-mechanical quantities of pedaling can inform on walking dysfunctions.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2509953035", "title": "The Neuro-Mechanical Processes That Underlie Goal-Directed Medio-Lateral APA during Gait Initiation", "text": "Gait initiation involves passing from bipedal to unipedal stance. It requires a rapid movement of the center of foot pressure (CoP) towards the future swing foot and of the center of mass (CoM) in the direction of the stance foot prior to the incoming step. This anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) allows disengaging the swing leg from the ground and establishing favorable conditions for stepping. This study aimed to describe the neuro-mechanical process that underlies the goal-directed medio-lateral APA. We hypothesized that controlled knee flexion of the stance leg contributes to the initial medio-lateral (ML) displacement of the CoP and to the calibration of the first step. Nine subjects initiated gait starting from three different initial stance widths of 15 cm (Small), 30 cm (Medium), and 45 cm (Large). Optoelectronic, force platform and EMG measurements were performed. During APA, soleus activity diminished bilaterally, while tibialis anterior activity increased, more so in the stance leg than in the swing leg, and to a larger extent with increasing initial stance width. Knee flexion of the stance leg was observed during APA and correlated with the ML CoP displacement towards the swing leg. ML CoP and CoM displacements during APA increased with increasing stance width. The activity of stance-leg tibialis anterior was correlated with the degree of knee flexion. Swing-leg tensor fasciae latae was also active during APA. Across subjects, when stance-leg tibialis activity was low, tensor fasciae latae activity was large and vice versa. The modulation of the ML CoP position during APA allowed the gravity-driven torque to place the CoM just lateral to the stance foot during step execution. Accordingly, the gravity-driven torque, the ML CoM velocity during step execution, and the step width at foot contact were lower in the Small and greater in the Large condition. Consequently, the position of the stepping foot at foot contact remained close to the sagittal plane in all three conditions. Conclusively, coordinated activation of hip abductors and ankle dorsiflexors during APA displaces the CoP towards the swing leg, and sets the contact position for the swing foot.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00445", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2509953035", "source": "openalex"}

Many of the neuropeptides involved in regulation of energy homeostasis interact with key areas of the HPA axis. The majority of orexigenic peptides have been shown to activate the HPA axis, while some anorexic peptides negatively modulate HPA axis activation and others also stimulate it.The effects of orexigenic peptides on the HPA axis are incompatible with the phenomenon of blunted HPA axis activity in states of low energy available, while the fact that some anorexigenic peptides activate the HPA axis might point to a permissive role.

Astrocytes are natural neuroprotectors and it is likely that brain resilience can be enhanced by mobilizing their protective potential. Among G‐protein coupled receptors expressed by astrocytes, two highly related receptors, GPR37L1 and GPR37, are of particular interest. Previous studies suggested that these receptors are activated by a peptide Saposin C and its neuroactive fragments (prosaptide TX14(A)), which were demonstrated to be neuroprotective in various animal models by several groups. However, pairing of Saposin C or prosaptides with GPR37L1/GPR37 has been challenged and presently GPR37L1/GPR37 have regained their orphan status. Here, we demonstrate that in their natural habitat, astrocytes, these receptors mediate a range of effects of TX14(A), including protection from oxidative stress. The Saposin C/GPR37L1/GPR37 pathway is also involved in the neuroprotective effect of astrocytes on neurons subjected to oxidative stress. The action of TX14(A) is at least partially mediated by Gi‐proteins and the cAMP‐PKA axis. On the other hand, when recombinant GPR37L1 or GPR37 are expressed in HEK293 cells, they are not functional and do not respond to TX14(A), which explains unsuccessful attempts to confirm the ligand‐receptor pairing. Therefore, this study identifies GPR37L1/GPR37 as the receptors for TX14(A), and, by extension of Saposin C, and paves the way for the development of neuroprotective therapeutics acting via these receptors.

In this approach, powerful approximation and reasoning capabilities of neuro‐fuzzy models are combined with the de‐coupling capabilities of optimal observers to perform reliable fault detection and isolation. The neuro‐fuzzy model presented here is a special form of Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model used to represent the system by a fuzzy fusion of local linear sub‐models. The necessary condition for the application of this FDI scheme is that this special form of the TS model can represent the nonlinear system, which is true for many practical systems. It is shown that if all the local models are stable and the corresponding local observers converge to the local models it can be expected that the global model is stable and the corresponding global observer will converge to the nonlinear input–output system. An application of FDI for an electro‐pneumatic valve actuator in a sugar factory is presented. Key issues of finding a suitable structure for detecting and isolating nine realistic actuator faults are described.

In the second part of the study, NF models were implemented to forecast sea levels averaged over 12- and 24-h time periods, three time steps ahead. The NF forecasts were compared with those of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the same data set. The results show that the NF approach performed better than the ANN in half-daily 12-, 24-, and 36-h sea level predictions. The traditional linear regression and autoregressive models were also tested for comparison, and they demonstrated their inferiority to the results of other techniques.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)ww.1943-5460.0000097", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975201621", "source": "openalex"}

His neurologic examination revealed an altered level of consciousness and unilateral corticospinal signs. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed areas with increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia and cerebral peduncles in T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images.

The mean survival was 13.5 ± 1.9 days after injection (range, 10 to 19 days) in 10 litters. The tumor was invariably fatal and possessed many of the histological characteristics of human glioblastoma (i.e., capillary proliferation, pseudopallisading, frequent mitotic figures, and multinucleated giant cells).

DNA methylation-based central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification is being recognized as having the potential to aid in cases of difficult histopathological diagnoses. Here, we present our institutional clinical experience in integrating a DNA-methylation-based classifier into clinical practice and report its impact on CNS tumor patient diagnosis and treatment. Methods Prospective case review was undertaken at CNS tumor board discussions over a 3-year period and 55 tumors with a diagnosis that was not certain to two senior neuropathologists were recommended for methylation profiling based on diagnostic needs. Tumor classification, calibrated scores, and copy number variant (CNV) plots were obtained for all 55 cases. These results were integrated with histopathological findings to reach a final diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed each patient's clinical course to determine final neuro-pathology diagnoses and the impact of methylation profiling on their clinical management, with a focus on changes that were made to treatment decisions. Results Following methylation profiling, 46 of the 55 (84%) challenging cases received a clinically relevant diagnostic alteration, with two-thirds having a change in the histopathological diagnosis and the other one-third obtaining clinically important molecular diagnostic or subtyping alterations. WHO grading changed by 27% with two-thirds receiving a higher grade. Patient care was directly changed in 15% of all cases with major changes in clinical decision-making being made for these patients to avoid unnecessary or insufficient treatment.

At birth or during neonatal ontogenesis, cytokines produce permanent alterations of HPA axis function and the stress response.

Pituitary corticotroph POMC gene expression is regulated by CRH as well as several gp130 cytokines acting as neuro-immuno-endocrine modulators.

A deep network was trained to process the precontrast and low-dose sequences to predict \"virtual\" surrogate images for contrast-enhanced T1. Once trained, the deep learning method was evaluated on the test sample. The discrepancies between the predicted virtual images and the standard-dose MRIs were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using both automated voxel-wise metrics and a reader study, where 2 radiologists graded image qualities and marked all visible enhancing lesions.The automated analysis of the test brain MRIs computed a structural similarity index of 87.1% ± 4.8% between the predicted virtual sequences and the reference contrast-enhanced T1 MRIs, a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31.6 ± 2.0 dB, and an area under the curve of 96.4% ± 3.1%. At Youden's operating point, the voxel-wise sensitivity (SE) and specificity were 96.4% and 94.8%, respectively. The reader study found that virtual images were preferred to standard-dose MRI in terms of image quality (P = 0.008). A total of 91 reference lesions were identified in the 38 test T1 sequences enhanced with full dose of contrast agent. On average across readers, the brain lesion SE of the virtual images was 83% for lesions larger than 10 mm (n = 42), and the associated false detection rate was 0.08 lesion/patient. The corresponding positive predictive value of detected lesions was 92%, and the F1 score was 88%. Lesion detection performance, however, dropped when smaller lesions were included: average SE was 67% for lesions larger than 5 mm (n = 74), and 56% with all lesions included regardless of their size. The false detection rate remained below 0.50 lesion/patient in all cases, and the positive predictive value remained above 73%. The composite F1 score was 63% at worst.The proposed deep learning method for virtual contrast-enhanced T1 brain MRI prediction showed very high quantitative performance when evaluated with standard voxel-wise metrics. The reader study demonstrated that, for lesions larger than 10 mm, good detection performance could be maintained despite a 4-fold division in contrast agent usage, unveiling a promising avenue for reducing the gadolinium exposure of returning patients. Small lesions proved, however, difficult to handle for the deep network, showing that full-dose injections remain essential for accurate first-line diagnosis in neuro-oncology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000811", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4226553083", "source": "openalex"}

Recent studies revealed that human tooth germs (hTG) contain MSCs which can be easily isolated, expanded and cryo-preserved. In this report, we isolated human tooth germ stem cells (hTGSCs) with MSC characteristics from third molar tooth germs, cryo-preserved them at -80°C for 6 months, and evaluated for their surface antigens, expression of pluri-potency associated genes, differentiation capacity, karyotype, and proliferation rate. These characteristics were compared to their non-frozen counterparts. In addition, neuro-protective effects of cryo-preserved cells on neuro-blastoma SH-SY5Y cells were also assessed after exposure to stress conditions induced by hydrogen-peroxide (oxidative stress) and paclitaxel (microtubule stabilizing mitotic inhibitor). After long term cryo-preservation hTGSCs expressed surface antigens CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166, but not CD34, CD45 or CD133, which was typical for non-frozen hTGSCs. Cryo-preserved hTGSCs were able to differentiate into osteo-, adipo- and neuro-genic cells. They also showed normal karyotype after high number of population doublings and unchanged proliferation rate. On the other hand, cryo-preserved cells demonstrated a tendency for lower level of pluri-potency associated gene expression (nanog, oct4, sox2, klf4, c-myc) than non-frozen hTGSCs. hTGSCs conditioned media increased survival of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to oxidative stress or paclitaxel. These findings confirm that hTGSCs preserve their major characteristics and exert neuro-protection after long-term cryopreservation, suggesting that hTGSCs, harvested from young individuals and stored for possible use later as they grow old, might be employed in cellular therapy of age-related degenerative disorders.

Besides, the sophisticated technique of mutual information (MI) is employed to select the most relevant input features with least possible redundancies for the forecast model.

However, it is now widely accepted that these systems interact through the psycho-neuro-endocrino-immune network. The nervous system affects the endocrine and immune systems by releasing neurotransmitters through the hypothalamus in the hypothalamic-pituitary portal circulation. The endocrine system affects the nervous and immune systems by secreting hormones and the immune system feeds back to the nervous and endocrine systems via cytokines. Forest therapy reduces sympathetic nervous activity, increases parasympathetic nervous activity, and regulates the balance of autonomic nerves. As a result, forest therapy decreases blood pressure and heart rate and has a relaxing effect. Forest therapy affects psychological responses via the brain and nervous system thereby decreasing the scores for anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion, and increasing the score for vigor in the POMS test. Forest therapy acts on the endocrine system to reduce stress hormone levels such as urinary adrenaline, urinary noradrenaline, salivary cortisol, and blood cortisol levels and shows a relaxing effect. Forest therapy also acts directly and indirectly on the immune system to promote NK activity by increasing the number of NK cells and intracellular levels of anticancer proteins such as perforin, granulysin and granzymes.

Recent evidence indicates that CCL-11 plays a role in brain disorders as well. This paper reviews the associations between CCL-11 and aging, neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory and neuropsychiatric disorders.Electronic databases were searched for original articles examining CCL-11 in neuropsychiatric disorders.CCL-11 is rapidly transported from the blood to the brain through the blood-brain barrier. Age-related increases in CCL-11 are associated with cognitive impairments in executive functions and episodic and semantic memory, and therefore, this chemokine has been described as an \"Endogenous Cognition Deteriorating Chemokine\" (ECDC) or \"Accelerated Brain-Aging Chemokine\" (ABAC). In schizophrenia, increased CCL-11 is not only associated with impairments in cognitive functions, but also with key symptoms including formal thought disorders. Some patients with mood disorders and premenstrual syndrome show increased plasma CCL-11 levels. In diseases of old age, CCL-11 is associated with lowered neurogenesis and neurodegenerative processes, and as a consequence, increased CCL-11 increases risk towards Alzheimer's disease. Polymorphisms in the CCL-11 gene are associated with stroke. Increased CCL-11 also plays a role in neuroinflammatory disease including multiple sclerosis. In animal models, neutralization of CCL-11 may protect against nigrostriatal neurodegeneration.

Most patients have complete recovery with adequate support. Post-operative, binocular diplopia may occur secondary to anisometropia or previously unrecognized misalignment. Periocular injection may cause paresis or fibrosis of extraocular muscles. Anterior or posterior ischemic optic neuropathy can occur in the first 6 weeks after cataract surgery with or without periocular injection. The risk to the other eye is high with subsequent contralateral cataract extraction. Post-operative vision loss associated with direct traumatic needle injury is recognized immediately. Therefore, an orbital MRI may be warranted for a patient with an optic neuropathy in the first 24 hours after cataract surgery using periocular anesthesia.

Ultrastructurally the N. E. B. were composed of a kind of granulated cell which had concentrations of specific cored vesicles in the basal cytoplasm.

Among these membrane appositions, some membrane thickenings were observed in which cored vesicles were closely associated in the granulated cell cytoplasm.

Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to decode the attended speaker from the brain activity, e.g., recorded by electroencephalography sensors. While numerous of these auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms appeared in the literature, their performance is generally evaluated in a non-uniform manner. Furthermore, AAD algorithms typically introduce a trade-off between the AAD accuracy and the time needed to make an AAD decision, which hampers an objective benchmarking as it remains unclear which point in each algorithm's trade-off space is the optimal one in a context of neuro-steered gain control. To this end, we present an interpretable performance metric to evaluate AAD algorithms, based on an adaptive gain control system, steered by AAD decisions. Such a system can be modeled as a Markov chain, from which the minimal expected switch duration (MESD) can be calculated and interpreted as the expected time required to switch the operation of the hearing aid after an attention switch of the user, thereby resolving the trade-off between AAD accuracy and decision time. Furthermore, we show that the MESD calculation provides an automatic and theoretically founded procedure to optimize the number of gain levels and decision time in an AAD-based adaptive gain control system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2019.2952724", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2989445832", "source": "openalex"}

Catherine Malabou (bio) Neuroliterature: this word is not a name for a new discipline, which—like neurolinguistics, neuropsychoanalysis, or neurophilosophy—would tend to explain the way in which our mental acts are rooted in biological neural processes. Even if we have to pay these new sciences the most acute attention to the extent that they are currently re-sketching the inner and outer boundaries of the Humanities, my purpose here is different and wishes to escape all forms of reductionism. Current neurobiology will be present in my discourse, but not as a possible new foundation for literature. Speaking from the continental philosophical point of view, I am interested in the way neurological research helps both radicalizing and challenging certain major motives of what took place in the second half of the twentieth century under the names of “deconstruction of subjectivity” in Derrida on the one hand, of “archeology of knowledge” in Foucault on the other. These two movements—let us call them movements for want of a better name—as different and sometimes opposed as they might have been, have shared what I will call a common faith in literature. I will limit myself here to exploring the Foucaultian structure or economy of this faith, which might be formulated as a faith in the outside. According to Foucault, literature promises the opening of an outside: outside of philosophy, outside of representation, outside of “discourse,” and, of course and above all, outside science, which has always been identified with power, regulation, normalization, and discipline. This “outside” will actually be my topic, and I will focus on Foucault’s reading of Blanchot in his short but fundamental book entitled The Thought From Outside. In this book, Foucault declares: the event that gave rise to what we called ‘literature’ is […] a passage to the ‘outside’: language escapes the mode of being of discourse—in other words the dynasty of representation—and literary speech develops from itself, forming a network in which each point is distinct, distant from even its closest neighbors, and has a position in relation to every other point in a space that simultaneously holds and separates them all. (12) What does this have to do with the question of a possible “neuro-literature”? [End Page 78] Neuroliterature here helps me name a crack or a flaw, not to mention a contradiction, in the very notion of literature understood as the thought from outside. What literature was supposed to resist most, namely scientific discourse, paradoxically appears today as revealing the truth of literature, as opening for literature the outside that it was supposed to offer, and that it actually failed to open. If I absolutely agree with Foucault that there is no genuine thought without a passage to the outside, we have to come to the conclusion that literature is not an outside for anybody any longer, and that Blanchot’s fictions do not constitute the neutral space, or shelter, that would protect us from the mastery of transcendental subjectivity and of discourse. I will radicalize this conclusion and state that neurobiology appears to be this absolute outside of literature that gives the outside in literature its effective meaning. Neurobiology achieves the neutralization of subjectivity. In other words, the deconstruction of subjectivity that is at work in neurobiology today is the material and effective accomplishment of neutrality, the material and effective opening of the “neutral space” (Foucault 12) which was supposed to be the space of literature (“l’espace littéraire”). The revelation that the outside escapes literature, that the literary outside is outside of itself, is not a contingent fact, something which happens only today; it is inscribed within the very concept, or structure, of literature as Foucault, Blanchot, Derrida and others have understood and defined it. In his second chapter, “The Experience of the Outside,” Foucault characterizes the birth of modern literature as a historical event that brings to light a new essence of language, a language precisely deprived of any subjectivity: The breakthrough to a language from which the subject is excluded, the bringing to light of a perhaps irremediable incompatibility between the appearing of language in its being and consciousness of the self...", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1353/sub.2016.0024", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4301134468", "source": "openalex"}

Scope: This is a 600-page soft cover training manual that covers every important topic in neuro-ophthalmology. There are no references. As the authors declare in the preface, it is intended as an introduction to neuro-ophthalmology for medical students and physicians in training in ophthalmology, neurology, and neurosurgery. The material is organized in a fashion that has become standard for books of this nature. Techniques of examination come first, followed by chapters on persistent and transient visual loss, retinal and optic nerve diseases, retrogeniculate disorders, pupils, diplopia, eyelid, orbital, and cavernous sinus diseases, ocular oscillations, headache and facial pain, and nonorganic manifestations. The text is amplified with flowcharts, boxes that succinctly highlight \"take-home\" points (called \"pearls\"), decision trees, lists of differential diagnoses, and hundreds of illustrations, including anatomic drawings from Thieme atlases, external ocular photographs, fundus photographs, CT scans, magnetic resonance scans, and cerebral angiograms. Strengths: The text is tightly and cogently written. The illustrations are first-rate. The explanations are simple enough so that a newcomer can quickly catch on, yet ample enough for an experienced reader to capture a deeper understanding of how these things work and how to teach them. Weaknesses: There aren't any. One could object that there are no references to back up the material, but training manuals do not need them. Besides, the authors adhere to accepted wisdom in the field without making controversial points. I wonder if the soft binding will hold up with repeated use, which this book will certainly get. Recommended Audience: This book will work best as a training manual, as the authors suggest. But it would also suit practitioners of all clinical neurologic specialties who are looking for an elegant rendition of the subject matter supported by beautiful illustrations. Critical Appraisal: This is the best soft cover training manual in neuro-ophthalmology that I have read. Its excellence is no surprise, for the authors are renowned for their clinical wizardry. The amalgamation of so much good information with such good pictures under one cover is a triumph. Novices will learn pleasurably from the succinct text and apt illustrations.

These effects include the magnitude of the catecholamine response and the duration and extent of the cortisol response. In addition, a number of other biological systems are involved, including mesolimbic brain structures and various neurotransmitters. An understanding of the many genetic and environmental interactions contributing to stress-related responses will provide a diagnostic and treatment map, which will illuminate the vulnerability and resilience of individuals to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).We propose that successful treatment of PTSD will involve preliminary genetic testing for specific polymorphisms. Early detection is especially important, because early treatment can improve outcome. When genetic testing reveals deficiencies, vulnerable individuals can be recommended for treatment with \"body friendly\" pharmacologic substances and/or nutrients.

Nevertheless, the clinical observation that disease stabilization may be clinically relevant in this disease setting led clinical investigators to pursue this agent further. In addition, the absence of better alternatives, its excellent tolerability and favorable toxicity profile have facilitated its use and investigation in a disease setting where quality of life has been a particular concern [4]. The contribution of temozolomide to the development of neuro-oncology has been far beyond its direct anti-tumor activity. The availability of a drug with (modest) single-agent activity was an important factor in stimulating research. Patients who previously had no active treatment options and who were often quickly transferred to a palliative care unit would now be seen by disease specialists. Specialized oncological care includes not only the administration of chemotherapy and regular follow-up, but also optimization of supportive measures, and revisiting the indication for steroid and antiseizure medication.

Existing segmentation methods apply simple criteria to detect human objects, leading to the restriction of the usage or a high segmentation error.

A fuzzy self-clustering technique is used to divide the base frame of a video stream into a set of segments which are then categorized as foreground or background based on a combination of multiple criteria. Then, human objects in the base frame and the remaining frames of the video stream are precisely located by a fuzzy neural network constructed with the fuzzy rules previously obtained and is trained by a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based hybrid learning algorithm.

Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is thus of great potential utility. The impact of electrographic seizures on outcome however is not entirely established and it is also unclear what type of electroencephalography paroxysms require treatment and when and how exactly to treat them. Evidence from randomized studies is lacking and will not be available in the near future. Given robust animal and human evidence showing the potential negative impact of seizures on secondary cerebral damage and outcome, treatment of seizures appears reasonable, particularly if related to status epilepticus. On the contrary, over-aggressive antiepileptic therapy entails risks. The management of seizures should therefore be guided individually, based on the underlying cause, the severity of illness and patient comorbidities.We provide a pragmatic approach for the management of electrographic seizures in neuro-ICU patients. International consensus guidelines on continuous electroencephalography monitoring and seizure therapy are needed and would represent the rationale for a future multicenter randomized trial.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0b013e3283374b5b", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2039216284", "source": "openalex"}

Visual outcome was defined in using specific criteria. Final visual outcome of patients was compared with clinical and neuro-ophthalmologic para- meters to determine any correlation. The most common presenting clinical symptoms were headache (85%) and Transient visual obscurations (TVOs) (52.5%). In univariate analysis severity of visual loss, Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) pressures and abnormal Visual evoked potential (VEP) were associated with worse visual outcome or need of aggressive management. When adjusted for severity of visual loss no independent clinical/neuroophthalmic predictor could be established. High CSF opening pressure, worsening vision/papilledema, greater Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness and abnormal VEPs may be some of the alarming signs for physicians, but none of these parameters can be used as an independent predictor for visual outcome in isolation. Visual loss at presentation is probably the most important predictor of the final visual outcome in these patients.

It has a great influence on driving safety and fuel consumption. One of the challenges in this regard is the modeling perspective to treat with uncertainty in judgments about driving behaviors. Really, assessing a single maneuver with a rigid threshold leads to a weak judgment for driving evaluation. To fill this gap, a novel neuro-fuzzy system is proposed to classify the driving behaviors based on their similarities to fuzzy patterns when all of the various maneuvers are stated with some fuzzy numbers. These patterns are also fuzzy numbers and they are extracted from statistical analysis on the smartphone sensors data. Our driving evaluation system consists of three processes. Firstly, it detects the type of all of the maneuvers through the driving period, by using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. Secondly, it extracts a new feature based on the acceleration and assigns three fuzzy numbers to driver's lane change, turn and U-turn maneuvers. Thirdly, it determines the similarity between these three fuzzy numbers and the fuzzy patterns to evaluate the safe and the aggressive driving scores. To validate this model, Driver's Angry Score (DAS) questionnaires are used. Results show that the fusion of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors of smartphones is enough for the proposed driving evaluation system. Accuracy of this system is 87% without using GPS and GIS data and this system is independent of smartphones and vehicles types.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15472450.2018.1506338", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2911168458", "source": "openalex"}

The energy dissipation caused by the steps reduces the size of the energy dissipator, generally provided at the toe of the spillway. The hydraulics of stepped spillways is investigated by carrying out laboratory experiments, building models to explain the data, and testing the robustness of the models developed here using a neuro-fuzzy approach. The experiments consist of twenty different stepped spillways tested in a horizontal laboratory flume, a wide range of discharge values, three weir slopes of 15°, 25°, and 45° and different step numbers from 3 to 50 on the ogee surface. The main objective of this paper was to investigate the applicability and accuracy of the neuro-fuzzy approach in estimating the proper values of energy dissipation of skimming flow regime over stepped spillways because of the imprecise, insufficient, ambiguous and uncertain data available. A neuro-fuzzy approach was developed to relate the input and output (energy dissipation) variables. Multiple regression equations based on dimensional analysis theory were developed for computing energy dissipation over stepped spillways. The determination coefficients for the suggested neuro-fuzzy model in training and testing process are 0.974 and 0.966, respectively.

The two MR systems were built by the same manufacturer and were equipped with essentially identical hardware and software. Individual patient studies were performed consecutively in adjacent MR suites, and pulse sequence parameters were replicated exactly at the two field strengths. One exception to this rule was that the second echo of the long TR sequence in the head was acquired with a narrow receiver bandwidth on the 0.5 T system. The resulting axial double echo long repetition time (TR) and sagittal short TR head images and sagittal short and double echo long TR spine images were graded by two blinded observers (senior staff neuroradiologists) on two levels. First, the images were graded for image quality, i.e., conspicuousness of artifacts and clarity in depiction of normal and pathologic anatomy. Second, diagnostic accuracy of MR was assessed relative to the clinical-pathologic diagnosis in each case. The image quality of the 1.5 T system was rated superior in both the head and spine for most specific items assessed. This observer preference for 1.5 T images did not, however, translate into greater diagnostic accuracy for the 1.5 T system in the head. Although the 1.5 T system did have a slight advantage in diagnostic accuracy in the spine, a significant difference was not found.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/00004728-199007000-00002", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1969698318", "source": "openalex"}

For patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease (ALS), the impairment is caused by the loss of motor neurons. While for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD), it is related to the basal ganglia dysfunction. Previously studies have demonstrated the usage of gait analysis in characterizing the ND patients for the purpose of disease management. However, most studies focus on extracting characteristic features that can differentiate ND gait from normal gait. Few studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modelling the nonlinear gait dynamics in characterizing the ND gait. Therefore, in this study, a novel approach based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is presented for identification of the gait of patients with ND disease. The proposed ANFIS model combines neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. Gait dynamics such as stride intervals, stance intervals, and double support intervals were used as the input variables to the model. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was utilized to learn the parameters of the ANFIS model. The performance of the system was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The competitive classification results on a dataset of 13 ALS patients, 15 PD patients, 20 HD patients, and 16 healthy control subjects indicated the effectiveness of our approach in representing the gait characteristics of ND patients.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/9831252", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2893621561", "source": "openalex"}

We hypothesized that delirium screening would be feasible in patients with acute brain injury and we aimed to validate and compare the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist against clinical International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria as reference. METHODS: Nurses assessed delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist in adult patients with acute brain injury admitted to the Neurointensive care unit (Neuro-ICU), Copenhagen University Hospital, if their Richmond agitation-sedation scale score was -2 or above. As the reference, a team of psychiatrist assessed patients using the International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria. RESULTS: We enrolled 74 patients, of whom 25 (34%) were deemed unable to assess by the psychiatrists, leaving 49 (66%) for final analysis. Sensitivity and specificity for the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU was 59% (95% CI: 41-75) and 56% (95% CI: 32-78), respectively, and 85% (95% CI: 70-94) and 75% (95% CI: 51-92), respectively, for the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist.

Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce Aβ deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent emergence of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initially considered a respiratory illness, demonstrated a broader virulence spectrum with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inflict a plethora of neuropathological manifestations in the brain – the Neuro-COVID-19.

Presently, no medication has been registered as a neuroprotector. Neuroprotection with intranasal Neuro-EPO (EPO, erythropoietin) has emerged as a multifunctional therapy that plays a significant role in neural survival and functional recovery in an animal model of stroke. On the other hand, there is limited access to the brain through the blood brain barrier (BBB) for intravenously applied EPO, and the high EPO dosages needed to obtain a protective effect increase the danger of elevated hematocrit levels and practically exclude chronic or subchronic treatment with EPO. A promising approach has been recently developed with a nonerythropoietic variant of EPO, Neuro-EPO, with low sialic acid content, a very short plasma half-life, and without erythropoietic activity, probably similar to endogenous brain EPO. The objective of this work was to determine the neuroprotective effect of intranasal Neuro-EPO in comparison with the human recombinant EPO injected intraperitoneally in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, employing the common carotid artery occlusion model in gerbils. Neuro-EPO has demonstrated a better neuroprotective effect, evidenced through increased viability, improvements of the neurological state and cognitive functions, as well as protection of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, temporal cortex, and the thalamus.

In the present review, we summarize the evidence indicating the cholinergic dysfunction in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients and in the brains of the MS animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The correlation between the increased activity of the cholinergic hydrolyzing enzymes acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, the reduced levels of acetylcholine and the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines production were recently described in immune cells of MS patients. Moreover, the genetic polymorphisms for both hydrolyzing enzymes and the possible correlation with the altered levels of their enzymatic activity have been also reported.

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W2917357041", "title": "Gender bias in (neuro)science: Facts, consequences, and solutions", "text": "Women neuroscientists (please note that we refer to all who identify as such) are still underrepresented in various aspects of academic life. The efforts of the community to mitigate this issue are growing but can elicit adverse reactions (Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). In this opinion paper, we discuss the different approaches that have been taken at institutional, organizational, and individual levels to counter gender bias and aim at addressing unfavorable comments. We base our reasoning on empirical data and on the feedback received after the release of the Women in Neuroscience Repository (WiNRepo, see Supporting information Table S1.a), an initiative we created to increase the visibility of women in neuroscience. While this feedback originated mainly from oral conversations and was not rigorously quantified, we believe the frequency of the comments justify their discussion, as performed in (Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). The aim of this piece (supported by a list of signatories, see Supporting information Table S2) was therefore to 'debunk the myths' related to gender bias and to affirmative actions in academia, as well as to propose concrete measures that can been implemented to counter such bias. \"All this is not necessary\" While proportions of students in STEM at the undergraduate level are roughly similar between men and women, the gap between male and female representation increases with seniority of the position (Schiermeier, 2018; Shen, Webster, Shoda, & Fine, 2018). In addition, women are paid less given the same degree and field of work as men (Barbezat & Hughes, 2005; Ministry for Women, 2018). For example, in 2017, the gender pay gap at University College London was 17.5%, close to the national average of 18% (University College London, 2017); this gap being partly driven by a lower proportion of women in senior roles (only 37% women in the higher quartile pay grade). This evidence illustrates that there are fewer women at senior positions in academia and that they are typically paid less than their male peers (Joëls & Mason, 2014). Multiple and complex contributing factors interplay to drive this gender discrepancy at senior levels (Shen et al., 2018). Among those, the rate of career switching is higher for female postdoctoral researchers who are planning to (or already) have children than for men in similar circumstances (Goulden, Frasch, & Mason, 2009). Women might also encounter a number of additional obstacles, preventing them from reaching more senior positions (Bain & Cummings, 2000). These include: a lower acceptance rate for papers with a female last author (Murray et al., 2018), lower recognition of their contribution (Feldon, Peugh, Maher, Roksa, & Tofel-Grehl, 2017; Macaluso, Larivière, Sugimoto, & Sugimoto, 2016), lower acceptance rate for funding (Kaatz et al., 2016; Pohlhaus, Jiang, Wagner, Schaffer, & Pinn, 2011; Sheltzer, 2018), lower rate of invitation to conferences or workshops (Nittrouer et al., 2018; Supporting information Table S1.b), and lower chances of being hired for tenure-track positions at the same competence level (Steinpreis, Anders, & Ritzke, 1999). Part of these obstacles may be further sustained by the underrepresentation of women in the peer-review process (Murray et al., 2018) and on 'deciding bodies', as there is a tendency for homophily, i.e., a same-gender bias, for both men and women (Helmer, Schottdorf, Neef, & Battaglia, 2017). In neuroscience, this combination of factors leads to female underrepresentation in various aspects of academic life (illustrated in Figure 1 and Supporting information Data S1). Women author significantly less papers as first (p = 3.9590e-04) or last contributor (p < e-20) than men. They are awarded significantly fewer prizes (including 'young investigator' awards, p = 1.0539e-05) and appear significantly less as speakers in departmental seminar series (p = 3.9355e-17) and conferences (invited or contributed talks, p = 5.7349e-80). These data illustrate the gap in female representation between early and late career stages when comparing proportions of female first (mean: 49.11%) and last (mean: 31.32%) authors. While we are not disentangling the causes of this underrepresentation, it is interesting to note that since 2014 the rate of female trainees (students and postdocs) attending the Society for Neuroscience meeting oscillated between 49% and 50%, displaying a balanced pool of young candidates. Over the same period, only 30%–32% of faculty attendees were women, with no clear upwards trend. Please see Supporting information Data S1 for details on data collection and analysis. \"As long as the job is done…\" Underrepresention of a group may also have implications at the community level, as people tend to study people like them, to the detriment of other genders, classes, and races that are part of our society. This becomes apparent in the medical field: for example, women's health is understudied as women were less represented in (or even excluded from) clinical trials (Vlassoff, 2007). In addition, the results of many neuroimaging studies come from target populations of highly educated White people (LeWinn, Sheridan, Keyes, Hamilton, & McLaughlin, 2017). Assessing and preventing bias is important not only for the affected groups but also for the population as a whole: studying female and male groups separately instead of mixed in (un)equal proportions would highlight specific traits in each gender (Holdcroft, 2007). Ensuring adequate representation of diverse groups and studying the effects of gender (among other variables) on the phenomenon of interest can thus improve treatments and prevention techniques for all. As a result of existing human biases, artificial intelligence is biased as well. When trained on a large corpus of text, a machine learning model will associate man with doctor and woman with nurse, or man with engineer and woman with homemaker (Bolukbasi, Chang, Zou, Saligrama, & Kalai, 2016). A new field of research is now dedicated to try to correct for this bias (Supporting information Table S1.c). As machine learning for health data is becoming increasingly popular, we need to ensure that the same type of bias (e.g., due to biased experimental designs) will not influence the model's outcome as this would limit the use of such technology in 'real' clinical settings. Therefore, not only should we aim at resolving the bias issue but we also need to remember past biases to avoid their incorporation into future technologies. Addressing gender bias would thus be beneficial for science and academia. Solutions have been proposed to tackle different aspects of gender bias at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels. Some of them are summarized in Table 1 and discussed below. We focus on actions that have been or can easily be implemented by the neuroscience community, while acknowledging that these are only partial solutions to the global and complex issue of gender bias. Universities, funding agencies, and scientific journals have an important role to play (Asplund & Welle, 2018). For instance, institutes and universities can organize bias training sessions for male and female scientists to raise awareness (Asplund & Welle, 2018). They can also favor work-life balanced environments (Supporting information Table S1.d) and take childbearing into account when awarding fellowships or hiring (e.g., through \"stop-the-clock\" policies, Supporting information Table S1.e) as women typically have a larger responsibility in pregnancy and breastfeeding, but also in caretaking due to biological, prejudicial, and often socially driven childcare demands (Calisi, 2018). Scientific journals can implement double-blind reviewing to mitigate any potential gender bias during peer review (Bernard, 2018; Budden et al., 2008). All institutions can also collect and share data on various aspects of their functioning (e.g., student enrollment, reviewing panels, etc.) to establish new policies to drive gender balance. One popular strategy in this respect is to introduce gender quotas. These are regulations that require a certain proportion of women in a given position (e.g., percentage of new hires over a certain period of time, invited speakers at conferences, winners of an award). Quotas can be binding (i.e., with consequences in case of noncompliance) or voluntary (also referred to as targets), implicit or explicit. They were introduced in various domains of the general society (e.g., in politics (Besley, Folke, Persson, & Rickne, 2017)) to counterbalance male dominance. As in all processes that aim at correcting a bias, a larger counter-effect needs to be imposed to obtain equilibrium. In this sense, quotas have also been referred to as 'positive discrimination' or 'affirmative action' and are seen as a temporary process to obtain gender balance after a 'transition period'. In academia, quotas can be implemented in a variety of ways (Wallon, Bendiscioli, & Garrnkel, 2015; Supporting information Table S1.f). For example, a cascading model can be encouraged for new hires, where the quotas reflect the proportions of female candidates at the level below the open position (e.g., proportions of postdoctoral researchers define quotas for lectureships). Fellowship schemes can require tandem nominations, where each institution must suggest two candidates for a fellowship, one being a woman (Supporting information Table S1.g). Quotas have elicited many reactions, which we discuss below. This type of comment reveals a deeper concern: will these measures lead to the opposite situation, where women are favored independently of their skill levels? This concern may also be associated with a fear of increased competition. As mentioned above, women face more obstacles as compared to their male counterparts, which tends to result in less competitive resumes. In addition, women might underestimate their scientific competence (Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger, & Kruger, 2003) and therefore their resumes may misrepresent their qualification/experience when compared to a man's. Furthermore, skill judgment is subjective: studies have shown that with identical resumes, men will be assessed as more qualified and hirable than women (Moss-Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, & Handelsman, 2012; Steinpreis et al., 1999; Wennerås & Wold, 1997). These findings suggest that favoring a woman over a man with 'equal competence' might mean to hire the best candidate. The fear about increased competition is understandable: with more women scientists being visible, there are more suitable candidates for the same job. However, a case study on Swedish politics has shown that qualified men were not displaced (Besley et al., 2017). Hence, quotas and the increased presence of women on the job market should not worry men that are a good fit for the job in question. Furthermore, the introduction of quotas led to an increase in the overall level of competence (Besley et al., 2017), suggesting that quotas can be beneficial for the project/institution as a whole. This point was specifically made by women scientists: quotas tend to hurt their self-confidence, as the value of their work may be questioned, and the reason for their success be attributed to their gender (also mentioned in Moghaddam and Gur (2016)). Unfortunately, we do not have the answer to this question. However, given the evidence discussed above, it is unlikely that an unqualified woman would be given an opportunity. We would also like to stress that, whatever caused the opportunity, women in positions of power can act as role models, which would eventually attract more women and lead to a more diverse field. Quotas are a popular measure in place to increase diversity in institutions. They are now also present at the organizational level, especially at conferences. Diversity of speakers is becoming a criterion in the selection of keynote lectures, symposia, workshops, or educational courses at conferences. Typically, no well-defined numbers or proportions of female speakers are enforced, but proposals with an appropriate representation of minorities are favored (see e.g., Society for Neuroscience call for symposia, Organization for Human Brain Mapping educational courses). Organizers are however not always able to submit proposals that are diverse in gender. The reasons cited are multiple: As mentioned before, there are indeed fewer women at senior positions than men. Many would however still be suitable candidates as invited speakers, program committee members, etc. despite their low visibility. To help with this issue, multiple initiatives have been created, mostly as lists or repositories of women in science. In brain science, more than 1,500 women from all countries and levels of seniority are registered on the following lists: Anne's list (Supporting information Table S1.h), Women in Brain stimulation (Supporting information Table S1.i), 500 women scientists (Supporting information Table S1.j), or our WiNRepo (Supporting information Table S1.a). We believe these resources can be helpful when searching for suitable female candidates but acknowledge that using repositories requires more effort (finding candidates, checking their references and publications) than sending an invitation to someone already known in the field. To mitigate this issue, some initiatives (e.g., WiNRepo) now include a 'recommendation system', where all scientists can leave a comment after having attended a talk by a female neuroscientist member of the repository. As female scientists are less visible, it is likely that the same people are repeatedly solicited and thus will decline some of the invitations (Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). Nonetheless, women were shown not to decline more talk invitations than men (Nittrouer et al., 2018). We recommend inviting women that are outside the small circle of repeatedly solicited scientists to avoid this potential situation (e.g., using repositories). Mentioning the specific scientific contribution that elicited the invitation could potentially help avoid the question \"Why was I invited?\". More generally, highlighting the suitability of the scientific, professional, or educational background of the researcher for the symposium or educational event could help clarify the legitimacy and relevance of the speaker's inclusion for attendees and invited researchers. Quotas should be considered not only when inviting keynote speakers to an event: nominations for the organizing committee should be gender-balanced, as well as for the reviewer pool, and for awarding prizes. The decision-making structures need to include (at least) a female representation that reflects the current base rate in the field for these measures to have a lasting impact. We however acknowledge that this might lead to an extra work burden for the senior female scientists who will be requested to sit on multiple panels and committees (Vernos, 2013). While we hope that the imperfect solution of quotas is temporary, when successfully implemented (preferentially in combination with other affirmative actions), they can lead to a more diverse representation (Irish Research Council, 2018; Moghaddam & Gur, 2016). Attendance of women in scientific international events is crucial for networking, visibility, and dissemination, key steps that underlie the development of a research career. However, the critical period encountered in the \"junior\" career stage frequently coincides with the period of early childcare for young parents and of pregnancy and breastfeeding for women. The difficulties for parents, in particular women, to attend conferences have been highlighted several times. Calisi and a Working Group of Mothers in Sciences (2018) have discussed these difficulties and already made concrete suggestions referred to as \"CARE\" for (a) Childcare, (b) Accommodate families, (c) Resources, (d) Establish social networks. Offering childcare at conferences is the first and probably the most important recommendation for conference organizations. We however acknowledge that the cost of childcare facilities can make it unaffordable for many small conferences. Independently of childcare facilities, all conferences should accommodate families, for example, by promoting children's attendance at conference dinners. Additional facilities should be organized for breastfeeding women, such as dedicated rooms and fridges for expressed milk. The Society for Neuroscience conference can be pointed out as an example of fruitful endeavor in that regard (Grens, 2017). Finally, while all those facilities require small or larger financial/material investment, conferences can organize social networks platforms for parents to self-help as a community. Such platforms have the additional benefit of becoming a networking opportunity for scientists with young children. In addition to these four measures, we would recommend avoiding organizing events during critical school periods (e.g., beginning of the academic year) as much as possible. Overall, we have presented several complementary initiatives as solutions at the institutional and organizational levels. Nevertheless, society cannot evolve at the institutional level without parallel evolution of individuals' mindset and effort. A collective is made of individuals, who each have the ability to raise awareness on gender bias and foster diversity in their organization. All scientists can contribute to a more diverse field. In practice, most of us are implicitly subject to biases (Asplund & Welle, 2018; Raymond, 2013). A first and key step is to be aware of our (see Supporting information Table S1.k for a free online test) and others' biases and act accordingly. Women can register on repositories to improve their visibility and should consider accepting opportunities that might have been triggered by a diversity search. While this might feel uncomfortable, such opportunities are great career advancements and the occasion to act as role model for the future generations. In addition, all scientists can speak up when observing gender-biased events or behaviors. For instance, when invited to an event, one can check the diversity in the organization and target audience of the event. Both men and women have declined to speak at certain gender-biased events (see these pledges, Supporting information Table S1.l). In this case, we believe the answer should be constructive, with a list of suggested female candidates. We also found that using interrogation could communicate the issue without being accusing (e.g., \"I cannot locate the name of the women speaking at this event. Are you still awaiting responses?\"). To ease the selection of speakers for events or other opportunities, one can also consider submitting recommendations for female scientists directly to organizations or on repositories, as the WiNRepo. Beyond conference organization, diversity should also be promoted for other scientific activities, such as when looking for collaborators for projects or in grant writing. When declining invitations (e.g., talks or peer-reviewing articles), we suggest recommending male and female alternative candidates equally often. Some organizations or individuals have also launched specific initiatives to target gender bias in their field. A successful example is the Women in Machine Learning Workshop (Supporting information Table S1.m) that evolved from a side event at a renowned machine learning conference to an organization with chapters in many parts of the world. It is however easy with events targeting gender bias to encounter an opposite problem: male underrepresentation. While potentially beneficial for women (especially in terms of networking), women-only events are not optimally designed to address the issue of implicit gender bias. Indeed, discussing gender bias with only the affected community cannot solve the problem (Parmar, 2013). Such events also tend to exclude male attendees, whereas there are still many more men in positions of power. Ignoring the difference these men could make if they were promoting diversity in their field is hindering changes in this direction. Thus, both men and women could foster progress by attending such events. We have outlined evidence showing the existence of a gender bias in (neuro)science and proposed some possible solutions at different levels. Whether action is taken at the institutional, organizational, or individual level, we would like to emphasize that addressing gender bias should always be approached in a non-blaming manner, unless in the case of clear misconduct or conscious discrimination. Non-constructive or blaming statements, whether true or not, only hurt the discussion. We, the present generation of neuroscientists, men and women alike, have the responsibility to provide a field of equal opportunities for the upcoming generations. Finally, we would like to conclude on a positive note: although there is still a long way to go to change the male dominant culture (Holman, Stuart-Fox, & Hauser, 2018), there is a rise in awareness of the problem and the situation is slowly improving (Joëls & Mason, 2014; Figure 2). We firmly believe that pursuing the current efforts while bringing men and women together will be the key toward a fairer and more creative research community.

However, the information available currently regarding neurotoxic effects exerted by OTA is scanty. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of OTA and the possible mechanisms of toxicity as well as the role of cytotoxic oxidative stress on neuronal (Neuro-2a) cell line was evaluated in vitro. Results of the MTT and LDH assay showed that, OTA induced dose-dependent cell death in Neuro-2a cells and EC50 value was determined as 500 nM. OTA induced high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated levels of malondialdehyde, also loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in a dose depended manner. Effects of OTA on ROS induced chromosomal DNA damage was assessed by Comet assay and plasmid DNA damage assay in which increase in DNA damage was observed in Neuro-2a cells by increasing the OTA concentration. Further western blotting analysis of OTA treated Neuro-2a cells indicated elevated expression levels of c-Jun, JNK3 and cleaved caspase-3 leading to apoptotic cell death. Other hand realtime-Q-PCR analysis clearly indicates the suppressed expression of neuronal biomarker genes including AChE, BDNF, TH and NOS2. Further N-acetylcysteine (NAC) pretreatment to Neuro-2a cells followed by OTA treatment clearly evidenced that, the significant reversal of toxic effects exerted by OTA on Neuro-2a cells. In the present study, results illustrate that ROS a principle event in oxidative stress was elevated by OTA toxicity in Neuro-2a cells. However, further in vivo, animal studies are in need to conclude the present study reports and the use of NAC as a remedy for OTA induced neuronal stress.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01142", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2519917115", "source": "openalex"}

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the primary modality for CNS disease management due to its high contrast resolution, reasonable spatial resolution, and relatively low cost and risk. However, defining tumor response to radiation treatment and chemotherapy by contrast-enhanced MRI is often difficult due to various factors that can influence contrast agent distribution and perfusion, such as edema, necrosis, vascular alterations, and inflammation, leading to pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse assessments. Amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) is emerging as the method of resolving such equivocal lesion interpretations. Amino acid radiotracers can more specifically differentiate true tumor boundaries from equivocal lesions based on their specific and active uptake by the highly metabolic cellular component of CNS tumors. These therapy-induced metabolic changes detected by amino acid PET facilitate early treatment response assessments. Integrating amino acid PET in the management of CNS malignancies to complement MRI will significantly improve early therapy response assessment, treatment planning, and clinical trial design.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering5040104", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2903094562", "source": "openalex"}

In line with the hypothesis that the primordial germ cell is the cell-of-origin, histopathological examinations for this pathology involve a diverse range of components mirroring the embryogenic developmental dimensions. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the mainstays of treatment, with surgery having a limited role for diagnosis and debulking of residual tissue after treatment. While better management has been achieved over recent decades by modifying radiation coverage and selecting appropriate chemotherapy, standardization of treatment remains challenging, partly due to the low volume of cases encountered in each institution. As the incidence is higher in East Asia, including Japan, the Japan Society for Neuro-Oncology established a multidisciplinary task force to create an evidence-based guideline for CNS GCTs. This guideline provides recommendations for multiple dimensions of clinical management for CNS GCTs, with particular focus on diagnostic measures including serum markers, treatment algorithms including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and under-investigated but important areas such as treatment for recurrent cases, long-term follow-up protocols, and long-term sequelae. This guideline serves the purpose of helping healthcare professionals keep up to date with current knowledge and standards of management for patients with this rare disease in daily clinical practice, as well as driving future translational and clinical research by recognizing unmet needs concerning this tumor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noab242", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3206584226", "source": "openalex"}

What makes this methodology unique is its capability to provide engineers with a near optimum design of a frac job despite very little (almost none) reservoir data availability. Lack of engineering data for hydraulic fracture design and evaluation had made use of 2D or 3D hydraulic fracture simulators impractical. As a result, prior designs of hydraulic frac jobs had been reduced to guess works and in some cases dependent on engineers with many years of experience on this particular field, who had developed an intuition about this formation and its possible response to different treatments. This was the main cause of several frac job failures every year. On the other hand, in case of relocation of engineers with experience on this particular field the risk of even more frac job failures was imminent. The unique design optimization method presented here is a logical continuation of the study that was covered in two previous papers1,2. To thoroughly understand this methodology, reading of these two references are highly recommended. This method will accept available data on each well, which includes basic well information and production history, and provides engineer with a detail optimum hydraulic fracture design unique to that well, along with the expected post-frac deliverability.

When Neuro-2A cells were treated with ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), apoptosis was detected as growth inhibition, DNA fragmentation with a ladder pattern in agarose gel electrophoresis, and nuclear decomposition. However, in case of the treatment with ethylene glycol bis- (beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), which has a higher chelating specificity for Ca2+ than EDTA, DNA fragmentation was not detected. Moreover, the apoptosis induced by EDTA was inhibited by exogenous Zn2+.

As part of its mission to widen understanding of scoliosis etiology, the International Federated Body on Scoliosis Etiology (IBSE) introduced the electronic focus group (EFG) as a means of increasing debate on knowledge of important topics. This has been designated as an on-line Delphi discussion. The Statement for this debate was written by Dr WCW Chu and colleagues who examine the spinal cord to vertebral growth interaction during adolescence in scoliosis. Using the multi-planar reconstruction technique of magnetic resonance imaging they investigated the relative length of spinal cord to vertebral column including ratios in 28 girls with AIS (mainly thoracic or double major curves) and 14 age-matched normal girls. Also evaluated were cerebellar tonsillar position, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and clinical neurological examination. In severe AIS compared with normal controls, the vertebral column is significantly longer without detectable spinal cord lengthening. They speculate that anterior spinal column overgrowth relative to a normal length spinal cord exerts a stretching tethering force between the two ends, cranially and caudally leading to the initiation and progression of thoracic AIS. They support and develop the Roth-Porter concept of uncoupled neuro-osseous growth in the pathogenesis of AIS which now they prefer to term ' asynchronous neuro-osseous growth' . Morphological evidence about the curve apex suggests that the spinal cord is also affected, and a 'double pathology' is suggested. AIS is viewed as a disorder with a wide spectrum and a common neuroanatomical abnormality namely, a spinal cord of normal length but short relative to an abnormally lengthened anterior vertebral column. Neuroanatomical changes and/or abnormal neural function may be expressed only in severe cases. This asynchronous neuro-osseous growth concept is regarded as one component of a larger concept. The other component relates to the brain and cranium of AIS subjects because abnormalities have been found in brain (infratentorial and supratentorial) and skull (vault and base). The possible relevance of systemic melatonin-signaling pathway dysfunction, platelet calmodulin levels and putative vertebral vascular biology to the asynchronous neuro-osseous growth concept is discussed. A biomechanical model to test the spinal component of the concept is in hand. There is no published research on the biomechanical properties of the spinal cord for scoliosis specimens. Such research on normal spinal cords includes movements (kinematics), stress-strain responses to uniaxial loading, and anterior forces created by the stretched cord in forward flexion that may alter sagittal spinal shape during adolescent growth. The asynchronous neuro-osseous growth concept for the spine evokes controversy. Dr Chu and colleagues respond to five other concepts of pathogenesis for AIS and suggest that relative anterior spinal overgrowth and biomechanical growth modulation may also contribute to AIS pathogenesis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-7161-3-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2141327475", "source": "openalex"}

The new design technique enhances fuzzy controllers with self-learning capability for achieving prescribed control objectives in a near optimal manner. The controller has flexibility for accepting more sensory information, with the main goal to improve the generator unit transients, by adjusting the exciter input, the wicket gate and runner blade positions. The developed ANFIS controller whose control signals are adjusted by using incomplete on-line measurements, can offer better damping effects to generator oscillations over a wide range of operating conditions, than conventional controllers. Digital simulations of hydropower plant equipped with low-head Kaplan turbine are performed and the comparisons of conventional excitation-governor control, state-feedback optimal control and ANFIS based output feedback control are presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and the robustness of the acquired neuro-fuzzy controller, the controller has been implemented on a complex high-order nonlinear hydrogenerator model.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/60.638941", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2168302499", "source": "openalex"}

An appropriate stabilising controller is assumed available for a nominal system model. This nominal controller may not be able to guarantee stability/satisfactory performance in the presence of unmodelled dynamics (neglected algebraic terms in the mathematical model) and/or parameter uncertainties present in the system model. In order to ensure stable behaviour, an online control adaptation procedure is proposed. The controller design is carried out in two steps: (i) synthesis of a set of neural networks which capture matched unmodelled (neglected) dynamics or model uncertainties because of parametric variations and (ii) synthesis of a controller that drives the state of the actual plant to that of a desired nominal model. The neural network weight update rule is derived using Lyapunov theory, which guarantees both stability of the error dynamics (in a practical stability sense) and boundedness of the weights of the neural networks. The proposed adaptation procedure is independent of the technique used to design the nominal controller, and hence can be used in conjunction with any known control design technique. Numerical results for two challenging illustrative problems are presented, which demonstrate these features and clearly bring out the potential of the proposed approach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta:20060364", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2019126616", "source": "openalex"}

As one of the influential indicative parameters, electrical conductivity (EC) has a crucial role in calculating the proportion of mineralization. In this study, the integration of an adaptive hybrid of differential evolution and particle swarm optimization (A-DEPSO) with adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is adopted for EC prediction. The A-DEPSO method uses unique mutation and crossover processes to correspondingly boost global and local search mechanisms. It also uses a refreshing operator to prevent the solution from being caught inside the local optimal solutions. This study uses A-DEPSO optimizer for ANFIS training phase to eliminate defects and predict accurately the EC water quality parameter every month at the Maroon River in the southwest of Iran. Accordingly, the recorded dataset originated from the Tange-Takab station from 1980 to 2016 was operated to develop the ANFIS-A-DEPSO model. Besides, the wavelet analysis was jointed to the proposed algorithm in which the original time series of EC was disintegrated into the sub-time series through two mother wavelets to boost the prediction certainty. In the following, the comparison between statistical metrics of the standalone ANFIS, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), wavelet-LSSVM (WLSSVM), wavelet-MARS (W-MARS), wavelet-ANFIS (W-ANFIS) and wavelet-GRNN (W-GRNN) models was implemented. As a result, it was apparent that not only was the W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO model able to rise remarkably the EC prediction certainty, but W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO (R = 0.988, RMSE = 53.841, and PI = 0.485) also had the edge over other models with Dmey mother in terms of EC prediction. Moreover, the W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO can improve the RMSE compared to the standalone ANFIS-DEPSO model, accounting for 80%. Hence, this model can create a closer approximation of EC value through W-ANFIS-A-DEPSO model, which is likely to act as a promising procedure to simulate the prediction of EC data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08875-w", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4221127682", "source": "openalex"}

However, the role of our taste system, and in particular its associated taste receptors, is not limited to driving food preferences leading to ingestion or rejection before other organs take over responsibility for nutrient digestion, absorption and metabolic regulation. Taste sensory elements do much more. On the one hand, extra‐oral taste receptors from the brain to the gut continue to sense nutrients and noxious substances after ingestion and, on the other hand, the nutritional state feeds back on the taste system. This intricate regulatory network is orchestrated by endocrine factors that are secreted in response to taste receptor signalling and, in turn regulate the taste receptor cells themselves. The present review summarises current knowledge on the endocrine regulation of the taste perceptual system and the release of hunger/satiety regulating factors by gastrointestinal taste receptors. Furthermore, the regulation of blood glucose levels via the activation of pancreatic sweet taste receptors and subsequent insulin secretion, as well as the influence of bitter compounds on thyroid hormone release, is addressed.

Apart from modulating a variety of normal physiological processes, both the RAS and KKS are up-regulated following tissue injury where they influence vascular function, inflammation, cell growth and differentiation and angiogenesis. The RAS exerts its effects by the generation of a family of bioactive angiotensin peptides in which angiotensin II (ANG II) and the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) and angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptors are most well characterised. In the KKS, bradykinin (BK) and kallidin and their carboxypeptidase metabolites, des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg10-kallidin, are the effector peptides exerting their actions via BK type 1 (BK-B1) and BK type 2 (BK-B2) receptors. Emerging evidence suggests that an ocular RAS is activated in diabetic retinopathy and may contribute to progressive alterations to retinal cells such as pericytes, endothelial cells, neurons and glia. Less well studied is the retinal KKS, however recent studies indicate effects on retinal electrophysiology and angiogenesis. The pathogenetic actions of the RAS and KKS in many tissues and possibly the diabetic retina are mediated by specific growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). This review will examine the roles of the RAS and KKS in both retinal vascular and neuro-glial dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy, and the potential of blockade of these systems for the prevention and treatment of this serious diabetic complication.

As a key component of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is promising and has shown great potential in many complex tasks; however, its lack of safety guarantees limits its real-world applicability. Hence, further advancing reinforcement learning, especially from the safety perspective, is of great importance for autonomous driving. As revealed by cognitive neuroscientists, the amygdala of the brain can elicit defensive responses against threats or hazards, which is crucial for survival in and adaptation to risky environments. Drawing inspiration from this scientific discovery, we present a fear-neuro-inspired reinforcement learning framework to realize safe autonomous driving through modeling the amygdala functionality. This new technique facilitates an agent to learn defensive behaviors and achieve safe decision making with fewer safety violations. Through experimental tests, we show that the proposed approach enables the autonomous driving agent to attain state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline agents and perform comparably to 30 certified human drivers, across various safety-critical scenarios.

Tumor changes in response to an intervention complement molecular and genomic translational diagnosis as well as quantitative information.

In this study, we developed a deep hemispherical, microchannel-networked, concave array system and applied it to generate three-dimensional nerve-like neural bundles. The deep hemicylindrical channel network was easily fabricated by exploiting the meniscus induced by the surface tension of a liquid poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) prepolymer. Neurospheroids spontaneously aggregated in each deep concave microwell and were networked to neighboring spheroids through the deep hemicylindrical channel. Notably, two types of satellite spheroids also formed in deep hemispherical microchannels through self-aggregation and acted as an anchoring point to enhance formation of nerve-like networks with neighboring spheroids.

We defined the findings of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual field testing, pupillary light reflex, contrast sensitivity, full-field and multifocal electroretinography, and optical coherence tomography.Twenty patients (71%) were finally diagnosed as visual snow syndrome. Their additional visual symptoms included illusionary palinopsia (61%), enhanced entoptic phenomenon (65%), disturbance of night vision (44%), and photophobia (65%). A history of migraine was identified in ten patients (50%). The mean BCVA was less than 0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, and electrophysiology showed normal retinal function in all patients. Contrast sensitivity was decreased in two of the seven patients tested. Medical treatment was applied to five patients which all turned out to be ineffective. Among the eight patients who were excluded, one was diagnosed with rod-cone dystrophy and another with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.Neuro-ophthalmologic findings are mostly normal in patients with visual snow syndrome.

Thus, biomaterials with antibacterial and neurovascular regeneration properties are highly desirable. Here, a newly designed biohybrid biodegradable hydrogel (GelMA) containing copper ion-modified germanium-phosphorus (GeP) nanosheets, which act as neuro-vascular regeneration and antibacterial agents, is designed. The copper ion modification process serves to improve the stability of the GeP nanosheets and offers a platform for the sustained release of bioactive ions. Study findings show that GelMA/GeP@Cu has effective antibacterial properties. The integrated hydrogel can significantly boost the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, facilitate angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and up-regulate neural differentiation-related proteins in neural stem cells in vitro. In vivo, in the rat calvarial bone defect mode, the GelMA/GeP@Cu hydrogel is found to enhance angiogenesis and neurogenesis, eventually contributing to bone regeneration.

In this paper, a new evolving and self-organizing controller, namely generic-controller (G-controller), is proposed. The G-controller works in a fully online mode with minor expert domain knowledge. It is developed by incorporating the sliding mode control (SMC) theory with an advanced incremental learning machine, namely generic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of fuzzy rule, and therefore, no offline training is required. To cope with the changing dynamic characteristics of the plant, the controller can add or prune the rules on demand. Control law and adaptation laws for the consequent parameters are derived from the SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability of the G-controller is guaranteed by using the Lyapunov function. The uniform asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the implication of an auxiliary robustifying control term. In addition, the implementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller to handle the nonaxis parallel data from the plant and consequently, enhances the robustness against uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally, the controller's performance has been evaluated by observing the tracking performance in controlling simulated plants of unmanned aerial vehicle, namely bio-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle and hexacopter for a variety of trajectories.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tfuzz.2019.2917808", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2962680637", "source": "openalex"}

However, little toxicological information is available regarding their safety. Therefore, the aim of this study was to screen selected ethno-pharmacologically important mushrooms for stimulatory effects on neurite outgrowth and to test for any cytotoxicity. Methods The stimulatory effect of mushrooms on neurite outgrowth was assessed in differentiating mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells. Neurite length was measured using Image-Pro Insight processor system. Neuritogenesis activity was further validated by fluorescence immunocytochemical staining of neurofilaments. In vitro cytotoxicity was investigated by using mouse embryonic fibroblast (BALB/3T3) and N2a cells for any embryo- and neuro-toxic effects; respectively. Results Aqueous extracts of Ganoderma lucidum , Lignosus rhinocerotis , Pleurotus giganteus and Grifola frondosa ; as well as an ethanol extract of Cordyceps militaris significantly (p &lt; 0.05) promoted the neurite outgrowth in N2a cells by 38.4 ± 4.2%, 38.1 ± 2.6%, 33.4 ± 4.6%, 33.7 ± 1.5%, and 35.8 ± 3.4%; respectively. The IC 50 values obtained from tetrazolium (MTT), neutral red uptake (NRU) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed no toxic effects following 24 h exposure of N2a and 3T3 cells to mushroom extracts.

These substances are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases and related psychopathological symptoms. When inflammation and aging affect the brain, we use the term neuro-inflammaging. In this review, we focused on the neuro-inflammatory process typical of advanced ages and the related psychopathological symptoms, with particular attention to understanding the immune-pathogenetic mechanisms involved and the potential use of immunomodulatory drugs in the control of clinical psychological signs. Inflammation and CNS were demonstrated being intimately linked in the neuro-inflammatory loop. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a, COX and PGE are only partially responsible. BBB permeability and the consequent oxidative stress resulting from tissue damage make the rest. Some authors elaborated the “theory of cytokine-induced depression”. Inflammation has a crucial role in the onset symptoms of psychopathological diseases as it is capable of altering the metabolism of biogenic monoamines involved in their pathogenesis. In recent years, NSAIDs as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of relevant psychopathological disorders associated with chronic inflammatory conditions demonstrated their efficacy. Additionally, novel molecules have been studied, such as adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept showing antidepressant and anxiolytic promising results.

One of the first neurology‐specific patient‐reported outcome measure systems created using modern test development methods, Neuro‐Qol enables brief, yet precise, assessment and the ability to conduct both PD‐specific and cross‐disease comparisons. We present results of Neuro‐QoL clinical validation using a sample of PD patients. Methods A total of 120 PD patients recruited from academic medical centers were assessed at baseline, 1 week, and 6 months. Assessments included Neuro‐QoL and general and PD‐specific validity measures. Results Participants were 62% male and 95% white (average age = 66); H &amp; Y stages were 1 (16%), 2 (61%), 3 (18%), and 4 (5%). Internal consistency and test‐retest reliability of Neuro‐QoL ranged from Cronbach's alphas = 0.81 to 0.94 with intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.66 to 0.80. Pearson's correlations between Neuro‐QoL and legacy measures were generally moderate and in expected directions. UPDRS Part 2 was moderately correlated with Neuro‐QoL Upper Extremity and Mobility, respectively ( r 's = −0.44; −0.59). Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire‐39 and Neuro‐QoL measures of similar constructs showed strong‐to‐moderate correlations ( r 's = 0.70–0.44). Neuro‐QoL measures of fatigue, mobility, positive emotion, and emotional/behavioral control showed responsiveness to self‐reported change. Conclusions Neuro‐QoL is valid for use in PD clinical research. Reliability for all but two measures is sufficient for group comparisons, with some evidence supporting responsiveness to change. Neuro‐QoL possesses characteristics, such as brevity, flexibility in administration, and suitability, for cross‐disease comparisons that may be advantageous to users in a variety of settings. © 2016 Movement Disorder Society", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.26546", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2282042364", "source": "openalex"}

Eleven patients were available for follow-up monitoring. The degree of ONP was recorded at admission, at discharge, after 3 months, and at yearly intervals thereafter. The size of the aneurysm, the duration of ONP before coiling, the degree of coiling, age, and the presence of other microvascular risk factors were correlated with the degree of nerve recovery.Complete resolution of ONP did not occur in any of the 11 cases in this series. However, residual oculomotor nerve deficits did not cause diplopia with primary gaze for 10 of 11 patients. Clinically significant ptosis did not persist for any of the patients. The pupil remained minimally affected in all cases.Although mass effect remains after endovascular packing, oculomotor nerve dysfunction improves comparably to the recovery observed after surgical clipping.

Nowadays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most used modality in radiation therapy for soft‐tissue anatomical districts, allowing for an accurate gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation. Investigating also necrotic material within the whole tumor has significant clinical value in treatment planning and cancer progression assessment. These pathological necrotic regions are generally characterized by hypoxia, which is implicated in several aspects of tumor development and growth. Therefore, particular attention must be deserved to these hypoxic areas that could lead to recurrent cancers and resistance to therapeutic damage. This article proposes a novel fully automatic method for necrosis extraction ( NeXt ), using the Fuzzy C‐Means algorithm, after the GTV segmentation. This unsupervised Machine Learning technique detects and delineates the necrotic regions also in heterogeneous cancers. The overall processing pipeline is an integrated two‐stage segmentation approach useful to support neuro‐radiosurgery. NeXt can be exploited for dose escalation, allowing for a more selective strategy to increase radiation dose in hypoxic radioresistant areas. Moreover, NeXt analyzes contrast‐enhanced T1‐weighted MR images alone and does not require multispectral MRI data, representing a clinically feasible solution. This study considers an MRI dataset composed of 32 brain metastatic cancers, wherein 20 tumors present necroses. The segmentation accuracy of NeXt was evaluated using both spatial overlap‐based and distance‐based metrics, achieving these average values: Dice similarity coefficient 95.93% ± 4.23% and mean absolute distance 0.225 ± 0.229 (pixels).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ima.22253", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2767519727", "source": "openalex"}

This was aimed at reducing the frequency deviations which occur during power generation. The Adaptive-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system (ANFIS) was used to intelligently control the selection of parameters for the effective control of power in the hydropower plant. The proposed ANFIS was trained with input–output data of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The ANFIS model is used as a hybrid learning model which includes the Least Square Estimate (LSE) and back propagation algorithm (BPA). The conventional PID, FLC, and ANFIS controllers were investigated using MATLAB. In order to determine the best controller, the controllers were experimented and compared to determine the controller with the best performance. The results show that frequency deviations occur as a result of a continuous variation of loads, which make the deviations difficult to control when a governor is not applied. Furthermore, the response of the AGC of the hydropower plant (in the single and double area) with step load changes was studied. The simulation results show that the ANFIS controller performs better compared to the PID as well as the FLC. Further results indicate that the proposed ANFIS controller helps to speed up the performance of the AGC of the hydropower plant. The ANFIS controller not only improved the performance but also made the fuzzy inference system (FIS) less dependent on the expert system.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.09.143", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3206682060", "source": "openalex"}

The meandering type MR valve, which employs the combination of multiple annular and radial flow passages, has been introduced as the new type of high performance MR valve with higher achievable pressure drop and controllable performance range than similar counterparts in its class. Since the performance of a damper is highly determined by the valve performance, the utilization of the meandering type MR valve in an MR damper could potentially improve the damper performance. The damping force characterization of the MR damper is conducted by measuring the damping force as a response to the variety of harmonic excitations. The hysteresis behavior of the damper is identified by plotting the damping force relationship to the excitation displacement and velocity. For the hysteresis modeling purpose, some parts of the data are taken as the training data source for the optimization parameters in the neuro-fuzzy model. The performance of the trained neuro-fuzzy model is assessed by validating the model output with the remaining measurement data and benchmarking the results with the output of the parametric hysteresis model. The validation results show that the neuro-fuzzy model is demonstrating good agreement with the measurement results indicated by the average relative error of only around 7%. The model also shows robustness with no tendency of growing error when the input values are changed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2017.08.012", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2750969841", "source": "openalex"}

To gain insight into the mechanism underlying M3G’s excitatory behaviors, we used fluo-3 fluorescence digital imaging techniques to assess the acute effects of M3G (5–500 μM) on the cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]CYT) in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurones. Acute (3 min) exposure of neurones to M3G evoked [Ca2+]CYT transients that were typically either (a) transient oscillatory responses characterized by a rapid increase in [Ca2+]CYT oscillation amplitude that was sustained for at least ∼30 s or (b) a sustained increase in [Ca2+]CYT that slowly recovered to baseline. Naloxone-pretreatment decreased the proportion of M3G-responsive neurones by 10%–25%, implicating a predominantly non-opioidergic mechanism. Although the naloxone-insensitive M3G-induced increases in [Ca2+]CYT were completely blocked by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate antagonist), CNQX did not block the large increase in [Ca2+]CYT evoked by NMDA (as expected), confirming that M3G indirectly activates the NMDA receptor. Additionally, tetrodotoxin (Na+ channel blocker), baclofen (γ-aminobutyric acidB agonist), MVIIC (P/Q-type calcium channel blocker), and nifedipine (L-type calcium channel blocker) all abolished M3G-induced increases in [Ca2+]CYT, suggesting that M3G may produce its neuro-excitatory effects by modulating neurotransmitter release. However, additional characterization is required. IMPLICATIONS: Large systemic doses of morphine administered to some patients for cancer pain management have been reported to produce myoclonus and allodynia. Indirect evidence implicates the major morphine metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), in these neuro-excitatory side effects. Hence, this study was designed to gain insight into the cellular mechanism responsible for M3G’s neuro-excitatory actions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1213/01.ane.0000059225.40049.99", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1973952662", "source": "openalex"}

Also, UCH-L1 has been recently emerging as a biofluid-based biomarker for various forms of acute neurotrauma and CNS injury.Expert opinion: The loss of UCH-L1 activity coupled with the gain of proteinopathy function are linked to neurodegeneration such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, certain post-translational modifications of UCH-L1 might promote the conversion of the cytosolic UCH-L1(C) to the membrane-associated UCH-L1(M) form, which seems to play a role in alpha-synucleinopathy formation. Thus, targeting the conversion of UCH-L1(C) to the UCH-L1(M) form might be the key to developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases linked to UCH-L1. In parallel, UCH-L1 is also emerging as a promising neuron-derived biomarker for traumatic brain injury, ischemic and homographic stroke, pediatric hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, spinal cord injury, epileptic seizure and cardiac arrest.

Results from this study showed that CSS resulted in a significant impairment of ileal and colonic barrier function indicated by reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in the ileum and increased FD4 flux in the ileum (by 0.8 fold) and colon (by 0.7 fold). Ileal sodium glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT-1) function, measured as glucose-induced changes in short-circuit current (Isc), was diminished (by 52%) in CSS pigs, associated with reduced body weight gain and feed efficiency.

The total costs for each diagnostic group and costs per significant finding were calculated using the global Resource-Based Relative Value Units for each examination from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Web site.Two hundred eleven imaging studies in 157 patients were evaluated. 28.9% (95% confidence interval, 22.5%-36.2%) of imaging studies had significant abnormalities relevant to the neuro-ophthalmic complaint. Imaging obtained for evaluation of progressive optic nerve dysfunction and cranial nerve palsy had statistically significant higher diagnostic yield than studies performed for other reasons. Total cost of all imaging studies performed was $107,615.72. Cost per clinically significant and relevant finding was $1,764.19.In comparison to the diagnostic yield of neuroimaging studies in other specialties, CT and MRI of the brain requested by neuro-ophthalmologists provide significant and relevant data at a reasonable cost.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0b013e31824e3753", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2046905343", "source": "openalex"}

Recent monoclonal antibody therapies such as Bevacizumab (Avastin) have been shown to be active in GBM and to prolong survival in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Therefore, patients routinely receive intravenous (i.v.) Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) every two weeks when they have recurred following standard therapy with chemoradiation. I.v Bevacizumab; however, can cause significant systemic side effects including bowel perforation and pulmonary embolism. In addition, the blood brain barrier (BBB) continues to provide an obstacle to the effective delivery of the antibody to the brain tumor bed. In order to overcome the BBB, and to limit the systemic toxicity of i.v. Bevacizumab, we have begun a Phase I clinical trial to test the safety of transient blood brain barrier disruption with intraarterial (IA) Mannitol followed by superselective intraarterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab. This case report describes the technical aspects of this procedure and its associated benefits and risks.

However, in the last few decades, studies into the idea of skin as an independent functional organ have gradually deepened our understanding of skin and its functions. In this review, we gathered evidence that presented skin as a “trinity” of neuro–endocrine–immune function. From a neuro perspective, skin communicates through nerves and receptors, releasing neurotrophins and neuropeptides; from an endocrine perspective, skin is able to receive and secrete most hormones and has the cutaneous equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; from an immune perspective, skin is protected not only by its physical barrier, but also immune cells and molecules, which can also cause inflammation. Together as an organ, skin works bidirectionally by operating peripheral neuro–endocrine–immune function and being regulated by the central nervous system, endocrine system and immune system at the same time, maintaining homeostasis. Additionally, to further explain the “trinity” of cutaneous neuro–endocrine–immune function and how it works in disease pathophysiology, a disease model of rosacea is presented.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/life12050725", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4280525199", "source": "openalex"}

Objective To report prevalence, main characteristics and outcome of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in BD. Patients and methods This is a retrospective monocentric study of 217 patients diagnosed with neuro-Behçet’s disease (NBD), of whom 29 (13.3%) patients presented with neuro-ophthalmological manifestations (55% of men and mean±SD age of 26±8 years). All patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination and were followed up in the internal medicine and the ophthalmology departments. Results Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations were the first presentation of BD in 45% of patients and developed later in the course of the disease in 55% of patients. They are divided into parenchymal (PM) and non-parenchymal (NPM)-related manifestations in, respectively, 13 patients (45%) and 16 patients (55%). PM included papillitis in seven patients (53.8%), retrobulbar optic neuritis in four patients (30.8%) and third cranial nerve palsy in two patients (15.4%). NPM included papilloedema related to cerebral venous thrombosis in all 16 patients, of whom 6 patients (37.5%) had sixth cranial nerve palsy. At initial examination, 93.1% of patients had visual alterations, including mainly decreased visual acuity visual field defects and/or diplopia. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and 79% of patients received immunosuppressive agents. After treatment, the visual outcome improved or stabilised in 66.7% of patients while it worsened in 33.3. The mean±SD logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity improved from 0.4±0.3 at diagnosis to 0.2±0.3 after therapy. 10.3% and 3.4% of patients were legally blind at diagnosis and after therapy, respectively. Conclusion Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations of BD represented 13% of NBD. They could be potentially severe and disabling.

In this study, we used genomic approaches to identify Hoxa1-bound regions during early stages of ES cell differentiation into the neuro-ectoderm. Within 2 h of retinoic acid treatment, Hoxa1 is rapidly recruited to target sites that are associated with genes involved in regulation of pluripotency, and these genes display early changes in expression. The pattern of occupancy of Hoxa1 is dynamic and changes over time. At 12 h of differentiation, many sites bound at 2 h are lost and a new cohort of bound regions appears. At both time points the genome-wide mapping reveals that there is significant co-occupancy of Nanog (Nanog homeobox) and Hoxa1 on many common target sites, and these are linked to genes in the pluripotential regulatory network. In addition to shared target genes, Hoxa1 binds to regulatory regions of Nanog , and conversely Nanog binds to a 3′ enhancer of Hoxa1 . This finding provides evidence for direct cross-regulatory feedback between Hoxa1 and Nanog through a mechanism of mutual repression. Hoxa1 also binds to regulatory regions of Sox2 (sex-determining region Y box 2), Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), and Myc , which underscores its key input into core components of the pluripotential regulatory network. We propose a model whereby direct inputs of Nanog and Hoxa1 on shared targets and mutual repression between Hoxa1 and the core pluripotency network provides a molecular mechanism that modulates the fine balance between the alternate states of pluripotency and differentiation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1610612114", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2623543676", "source": "openalex"}

The olfactory area is a central nervous system site with the highest expression of UGTs, including UGT isoforms not previously identified in the brain. Since there is evidence of the transfer of xenobiotics to the brain through the nasal pathway, circumventing the blood-brain barrier, olfactory UGTs doubtlessly share the common function of detoxification, but they are also involved in the metabolism and turnover of exogenous or endogenous compounds critical for physiological olfactory processing in these tissues.

All the treatments were carried out for a total duration of eight weeks. Chlorpyrifos treatment showed significant alterations in the cognitive behavior and motor activities of rats, which were appreciably improved upon simultaneous supplementation with quercetin. Further, CPF treatment caused a significant inhibition in the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase, but caused an increase in the levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Further, chlorpyrifos exposure significantly elevated the levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl contents as well as the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, which were interestingly found to be decreased following co-treatment with quercetin. In contrast, CPF treatment decreased the activities of glutathione reductase, transferase, as well as levels of reduced and total glutathione in both the cerebrum and cerebellum but co-administration of quercetin, increased these levels. Chlorpyrifos treatment altered the neuro-histoarchitecture, which showed improvement upon quercetin supplementation.

The total number of neuro-emergencies was significantly reduced (* p = 0.0007) across all types of disease, particularly in vascular (* p = 0.036) but also in spinal (* p = 0.007) and hydrocephalus (* p = 0.048) emergencies. Patients with spinal emergencies presented 48 h later (* p = 0.001) despite comparable symptom severity. For aSAH, the number of cases, aSAH grade, aneurysm localization, and treatment modality did not change but strikingly, elderly patients with cSDH presented less frequently, with more severe symptoms (* p = 0.046), and were less likely to reach favorable outcome (* p = 0.003) at discharge compared with previous years. Conclusions Despite pandemic-related restrictive measures and reallocation of resources, patients with neuro-emergencies should be encouraged to present regardless of the severity of symptoms because deferred presentation may result in adverse outcome. Thus, conservation of critical healthcare resources remains essential in spite of fighting COVID-19.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04437-z", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3033924327", "source": "openalex"}

To accomplish this objective, four consecutive modeling stages were conducted. In the first stage, mechanics-based knowledge relating to the cause and effect process (i.e., stress-strain) was used to design an appropriate general purpose stress-controlled ANN model. In the second stage, the designed model with appropriate input categories dictated by mechanics-based knowledge was trained and tested on 3D monotonic stress-strain experimental data of a sandy soil. In the third stage, statistical and graphical accuracy outcomes on training and testing stress-strain responses were used to arrive at the optimal neuro-mechanistic based model. In the last stage, the selected neuro-mechanistic based model is combined with appropriate mechanics-based concepts to create a hybrid neuro-mechanistic simulator (NMS). The developed NMS was found efficient in characterizing the 3D monotonic stress-strain behavior of Canadian River sand subjected to both shear and Hydrostatic Compression (HC) loading stress paths. Consequently, NMS can easily be used to simulate in real time any desired monotonic deformational behavior for given stress path and known initial stress and strain conditions.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1061/40502(284)4", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2335563328", "source": "openalex"}

Unexpected findings for each of skeletal maturation, asymmetries and overgrowth are not explained by prevailing theories of AIS pathogenesis. A speculative pathogenetic theory for girls is formulated after surveying evidence including: (1) the thoracospinal concept for right thoracic AIS in girls; (2) the new neuroskeletal biology relating the sympathetic nervous system to bone formation/resorption and bone growth; (3) white adipose tissue storing triglycerides and the adiposity hormone leptin which functions as satiety hormone and sentinel of energy balance to the hypothalamus for long-term adiposity; and (4) central leptin resistance in obesity and possibly in healthy females. The new theory states that AIS in girls results from developmental disharmony expressed in spine and trunk between autonomic and somatic nervous systems. The autonomic component of this double neuro-osseous theory for AIS pathogenesis in girls involves selectively increased sensitivity of the hypothalamus to circulating leptin (genetically-determined up-regulation possibly involving inhibitory or sensitizing intracellular molecules, such as SOC3, PTP-1B and SH2B1 respectively), with asymmetry as an adverse response (hormesis); this asymmetry is routed bilaterally via the sympathetic nervous system to the growing axial skeleton where it may initiate the scoliosis deformity (leptin-hypothalamic-sympathetic nervous system concept = LHS concept). In some younger preoperative AIS girls, the hypothalamic up-regulation to circulating leptin also involves the somatotropic (growth hormone/IGF) axis which exaggerates the sympathetically-induced asymmetric skeletal effects and contributes to curve progression, a concept with therapeutic implications. In the somatic nervous system, dysfunction of a postural mechanism involving the CNS body schema fails to control, or may induce, the spinal deformity of AIS in girls (escalator concept). Biomechanical factors affecting ribs and/or vertebrae and spinal cord during growth may localize AIS to the thoracic spine and contribute to sagittal spinal shape alterations. The developmental disharmony in spine and trunk is compounded by any osteopenia, biomechanical spinal growth modulation, disc degeneration and platelet calmodulin dysfunction. Methods for testing the theory are outlined. Implications are discussed for neuroendocrine dysfunctions, osteopontin, sympathoactivation, medical therapy, Rett and Prader-Willi syndromes, infantile idiopathic scoliosis, and human evolution. AIS pathogenesis in girls is predicated on two putative normal mechanisms involved in trunk growth, each acquired in evolution and unique to humans.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-7161-4-24", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2027382828", "source": "openalex"}

Welding is a multi-variable process, which is influenced by a lot of process uncertainties. Therefore, the optimization of welding process parameters is considerably complex. Advancement in computational methods, evolutionary algorithms, and multiobjective optimization methods create ever-more effective solutions to this problem. This work concerns the selection of optimal parameters setting of pulsed metal inert gas welding (PMIGW) process for any desired output parameters setting. Six process parameters, namely pulse voltage, background voltage, pulse frequency, pulse duty factor, wire feed rate and table feed rate were used as input variables, and the strength of the welded plate, weld bead geometry, transverse shrinkage, angular distortion and deposition efficiency were considered as the output variables. Artificial neural network (ANN) models were used for mapping input and output parameters. Neuro genetic algorithm (Neuro-GA) technique was used to determine the optimal PMIGW process parameters. Experimental result shows that the designed parameter setting of PMIGW process, which was obtained from Neuro-GA optimization, indeed produced the desired weld-quality.

The development of accurate predictive models with significant input parameters and inconsistent datasets is still a challenge. Therefore, further research is needed to improve the performance of the predictive models. This study presents a methodology for dataset pre-processing and input optimization for reducing the modeling complexity. The objective of this study was achieved by employing a two-sided detection approach for outlier removal and an exhaustive search method for selecting essential modeling inputs. Thereafter, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was applied for modeling electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the upper Indus River. A larger dataset of a 30-year historical period, measured monthly, was utilized in the modeling process. The prediction capacity of the developed models was estimated by statistical assessment indicators. Moreover, the 10-fold cross-validation method was carried out to address the modeling overfitting issue. The results of the input optimization indicate that Ca2+, Na+, and Cl− are the most relevant inputs to be used for EC. Meanwhile, Mg2+, HCO3−, and SO42− were selected to model TDS levels. The optimum ANFIS models for the EC and TDS data showed R values of 0.91 and 0.92, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) results of 30.6 µS/cm and 16.7 ppm, respectively. The optimum ANFIS structure comprises a hybrid training algorithm with 27 fuzzy rules of triangular fuzzy membership functions for EC and a Gaussian curve for TDS modeling, respectively. Evidently, the outcome of the present study reveals that the ANFIS modeling, aided with data pre-processing and input optimization, is a suitable technique for simulating the quality of surface water. It could be an effective approach in minimizing modeling complexity and elaborating proper management and mitigation measures.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/su13084576", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3153312837", "source": "openalex"}

The model can produce knowledge in an on-line (single-pass) and evolving learning context in a particular form of neuro-fuzzy rules representing the dependencies among input features through IF-THEN type relations. The rules antecedents are thereby realized through uni-nullneurons, which are constructed from n-uninorms, leading to the possibility to express both, AND- and OR-connections (and a mixture of these) among the single antecedent parts of a rule (and thus achieving an advanced interpretability aspect of the rules). The neurons' evolution is done through an extended version of an autonomous data partition method (ADPA). On-line interpretation of the timely evolution of rules is addressed by (i) a concept for tracking the degree of changes of the rules over data stream samples, which may indicate experts/operators how much dynamics is in the process and may be used as a structural active learning component to request operator's feedback in the case of significant changes and (ii) a concept for updating feature weights incrementally. These weights express the (possibly changing) impact degrees of features on the classification problem: features with low weights can be seen as unimportant and masked out when showing rules to an expert (→ rule length reduction). The rules' consequents are represented by certainty vectors and are recursively updated by an indicator-based recursive weighted least squares (I-RWLS) approach (one RWLS estimator per class) where the weights are given through the neuron activation levels in order to gain stable local learning. The model proposed in this paper was successfully compared to related hybrid and evolving approaches in the literature for classifying binary and multi-class patterns. The results obtained by the proposed model show an outperformance of the related works in terms of higher accuracy trend lines over time, while offering a high degree of interpretability through coherent neuro-fuzzy rules to solve the classification problems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.04.065", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3157587074", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, we evaluated the predictive capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in estimating soil shear strength from measured particle size distribution (clay and fine sand), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), soil organic matter (SOM), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results showed that the ANN model was more feasible in predicting the soil shear strength than the ANFIS model. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean estimation error (MEE), and correlation coefficient (R) between the measured soil shear strength and the estimated values using the ANN model were 0.05, 0.01, and 0.86, respectively. In ANFIS analysis, the RMSE was 0.08 and a lower correlation coefficient of 0.60 was obtained in comparison with the ANN model.

However, the role of neuro‐mediators remains to be elucidated. Objective To evaluate nerve growth factor (NGF) and vaso‐active intestinal peptide (VIP) in predicting paediatric AD and assess their correlation with intrinsic and extrinsic types of AD. Methods We performed a nested case–control study in the prospective Taiwan birth panel cohort study. Cord and maternal plasma and questionnaires were gathered at birth. During follow‐up, we identified 40 available AD cases, which were matched to 80 unaffected controls chosen from this cohort. The concentrations of IgE, NGF, and VIP in cord and maternal plasma of these subjects were performed by ELISA. Receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to see how well each biomarker could predict AD. Results The NGF levels were significantly higher in AD patients than controls (mean±SD: 65.47±44.45 vs. 49.21±12.18 pg/mL for cord plasma and 89.68±41.04 vs. 66.96±23.05 pg/mL for maternal plasma) ( P &lt;0.05). VIP levels were also higher but not statistically significant. Plasma NGF may be a better biomarker than IgE in detecting paediatric AD (area under the ROC curve=0.65 vs. 0.61 for cord plasma and 0.69 vs. 0.61 for maternal plasma). Maternal NGF levels were significantly higher in patients with both intrinsic (96.18±48.15 pg/mL) and extrinsic (86.18±37.23 pg/mL) types of AD compared with controls (66.96±23.05 pg/mL) ( P &lt;0.05).

The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of a neuro-fuzzy model based on Takagi and Sugeno's theory in estimating the maximum depths, pattern and time evolution of scour hole downstream of a stilling basin of U.S.B.R. type I. The investigation was conducted under various discharges, tail-water depths (low, balanced and high), different bed materials and model sizes. The characteristics of the equilibrium state of the scour phenomenon as well as the time to reach the maximum scour depth were considered. The results showed a significant conformity between estimated and experimental data which recommends an acceptable outcome using a neuro-fuzzy model to forecast the properties of scour hole downstream of stilling basins.

Although research has been fueled by the potential therapeutic target microglia offer against neurodegenerative inflammation, their part in tuberculosis infection of the CNS has not been fully evaluated nor elucidated. Yet, as both the preferential targets of M. tuberculosis and the immune-effector cells of the CNS, microglia are likely to be key determinants of disease severity and clinical outcomes. Following pathogen recognition, bacilli are internalized and capable of replicating within microglia. Cellular activation ensues, utilizing signaling molecules that may be neurotoxic. Central to initiating, orchestrating and modulating the tuberculous immune response is microglial secretion of cytokines and chemokines. However, the neurological environment is unique in that inflammatory signals, which appear to be damaging in the periphery, could be beneficial by governing neuronal survival, regeneration and differentiation. Furthermore, microglia are important in the recruitment of peripheral immune cells and central to defining the pro-inflammatory milieu of which neurotoxicity may result from many of the participating local or recruited cell types. Microglia are capable of both presenting antigen to infiltrating CD4+ T-lymphocytes and inducing their differentiation - a possible correlate of protection against M. tuberculosis infection. Clarifying the nature of the immune effector molecules secreted by microglia, and the means by which other CNS-specific cell types govern microglial activation or modulate their responses is critical if improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are to be attained. Therefore, this review evaluates the diverse roles microglia play in the neuro-immunity to M. tuberculosis infection of the CNS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2015.00182", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1530715470", "source": "openalex"}

The pathophysiology of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is still poorly understood. It is suggested that there is no dominant and independent mechanism of CSU; however, there are different immunological and non-immunological abnormalities that act simultaneously or/and follow each other resulting in clinical symptoms. The latest hypothesis points out that mast cells (MCs) to be activated via autoantibodies in autoallergic or autoimmune mechanism mediators released from degranulated MCs are responsible for the vasoactive and neurospecific effect in CSU. According to many clinical observations, it is suggested that psychological stress can be both a triggering factor in the onset of CSU and a modulating one in the course of the disease and therapy effectiveness. Of importance, the mechanistic background of the psychological stress response in the skin has not yet been fully elucidated. However, of note, a variety of inflammatory mediators, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters facilitate this phenomenon. This review presents recent findings on the neuro–immuno–psychological aspects of CSU, highlighting an emerging role of neuro–immune interactions. It also points out the usefulness of psychological tools employment for the baseline diagnosis of perceived stress level and the presence of its symptoms. Furthermore, it proposes the implementation of non-invasive interventions to reduce psychological stress and anxiety.

The manifestations include headache, ocular pain, visual impairment, diplopia, and cranial nerve palsies secondary to Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or encephalitis, and nystagmus. Conclusion: Neurological and neuro-ophthalmological syndromes, symptoms, and signs should not be neglected and a complete ophthalmological examination of these patients should be performed to fully describe ocular manifestations related to HCoVs. We believe that major ocular and neuro-ophthalmological manifestations reports lack due to safety issues concerning detailed ophthalmological examination; on the other hand, in a large number of cases, the presence of life-threatening coronavirus disease hinders ocular examination and ophthalmologist's visit to the intensive care unit.

The most well-recognized non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies that cause cupping include compressive optic neuropathies, arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathies, hereditary optic neuropathies, and optic neuritis. Cupping is thought to consist of two main components: prelaminar and laminar thinning. The former is a shallow form of cupping and related to loss of retinal ganglion cells, whereas the latter involves damage to the lamina cribrosa and peripapillary scleral connective tissue. Differentiating glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous optic nerve cupping remains challenging even for experienced observers. Classically, the optic nerve in non-glaucomatous causes has pallor of the neuroretinal rim, but the optic nerve should not be examined in isolation. The patient's medical history, history of presenting illness, visual function (visual acuity, color vision and visual field testing) and ocular examination also need to be considered. Ancillary testing such as optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer may also be helpful in localizing the disease. In this review, we review the non-glaucomatous causes of cupping and provide an approach to evaluating a patient that presents with an enlarged cup-to-disc ratio.

We then focus on the influence of topological properties on the functional performance of highly modular, bio-physically inspired neuro-memristive nanowire networks (NWNs). We perform two benchmark reservoir computing tasks (memory capacity and nonlinear transformation) on simulated networks and show that while random networks outperform NWNs on independent tasks, NWNs with highly segregated modules achieve the best performance on simultaneous tasks. Conversely, networks that share too many resources, such as networks with random structure, perform poorly in multitasking.

Here we report the cases of two adult siblings who experienced focal epilepsy at 18 years old as a first disease manifestation, without other symptom during several years. Upon diagnosis, both patients received metabolic treatment comprising B9, B12 and betaine which has stopped the occurrence of seizures, allowing discontinuation of anti-epileptic drugs.

Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) served as the transduction mechanism. This biosensor consisted of three electrodes: working, counter, and reference electrodes fabricated on a PET sheet. Both working and counter electrodes were thin gold film, 10 nm in thickness. Laser ablation technique was used to define the size and structure of the biosensor. The biosensor was produced using cost-effective roll-to-roll process. Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were employed to covalently immobilize the anti-T-Tau (T-Tau antibody) on the gold working electrode. A carbodiimide conjugation approach using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) cross-linked anti-T-Tau to the carboxylic groups on one end of the MPA. A T-Tau protein ladder with six isoforms was used in this study. The anti-T-Tau concentration used was 500,000 pg/mL. The T-Tau protein concentration ranged from 1000 pg/mL to 100,000 pg/mL. DPV measurements showed excellent responses, with a good calibration curve. Thus, a practical tool for simple detection of T-Tau protein, a biomarker of neuro-degenerative disorders, has been successfully developed.

Moreover, iPSCs can be differentiated and organized into 3D organoids, providing a tool which mimics the complexity of the brain’s architecture. Furthermore, recent developments in 3D bioprinting allowed the study of physiological cell-to-cell interactions, given by a combination of several biomaterials, scaffolds, and cells. This technology combines bio-plotter and biomaterials in which several types of cells, such as iPSCs or differentiated neurons, can be encapsulated in order to develop an innovative cellular model. IPSCs and 3D cell cultures technologies represent the first step towards the obtainment of a more reliable model, such as organoids, to facilitate neurodegenerative diseases’ investigation. The combination of iPSCs, 3D organoids and bioprinting will also allow the development of new therapeutic approaches.

Main issues in developing a fully automated stock market prediction system are: feature extraction from the stock market data, feature selection for highest prediction accuracy, the dimensionality reduction of the selected feature set and the accuracy and robustness of the prediction system. In this paper, an automated decision tree-adaptive neuro-fuzzy hybrid automated stock market trend prediction system is proposed. The proposed system uses technical analysis (traditionally used by stock traders) for feature extraction and decision tree for feature selection. Selected features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction and the reduced dataset is then applied to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy system for the next-day stock market trend prediction. The proposed system is tested on four major international stock markets. The results show that the proposed hybrid system produces much higher accuracy when compared to stand-alone decision tree based system and ANFIS based system without feature selection and dimensionality reduction.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/artcom.2010.75", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086384288", "source": "openalex"}

Evidence Acquisition: Retrospective PubMed search and review of published case reports, case series, observational studies, book chapters, and review articles examining the neuro-ophthalmic features of intracranial malignancies including primary glial neoplasms (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme), primary and secondary lymphoma, intracranial metastases, carcinomatous/lymphomatous meningitis, and intracranial germ cell tumors. The search strategy used to perform the retrospective review included the aforementioned tumor type (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) and the following terms and Boolean operators: AND (“visual loss” OR “papilledema” OR “diplopia” OR “ophthalmoplegia” or “neuro-ophthalmology” OR “proptosis”). Results: The rate of growth and the location of an intracranial tumor are essential factors in determining the neuro-ophthalmic presentation of certain intracranial malignancies. Primary malignant brain glial neoplasms commonly present with visual afferent complaints (e.g., unilateral or bilateral visual acuity or visual field defects, bitemporal or homonymous hemianopsia), pupil abnormalities (relative afferent pupillary defect), and optic atrophy or papilledema. Primary intraocular lymphoma (with or without central nervous system lymphoma) typically presents as a painless bilateral vitritis. Secondary intracranial malignancies have variable afferent and efferent visual pathway presentations. Carcinomatous/lymphomatous meningitis is associated with diplopia (e.g., multiple ocular motor cranial neuropathies with or without vision loss from papilledema or compressive/infiltrative optic neuropathy). Intracranial germ cell tumors can present with a chiasmal syndrome or dorsal midbrain syndrome. Conclusion: Intracranial malignancies can present with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms or signs depending on topographical localization. Specific neuro-ophthalmic presentations are associated with different malignant intracranial tumors. Clinicians should be aware of the common malignant intracranial tumors and their associated clinical presentations in neuro-ophthalmology.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000950", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3015577128", "source": "openalex"}

In this study, the mechanism of the Ang II-stimulated cGMP increase was investigated in comparison with bradykinin- and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-stimulated cGMP increases in differentiated Neuro-2A cells. Ang II increased cGMP in differentiated Neuro-2A cells rapidly, with a maximal effect in 30 sec and a return to basal levels in 60 sec. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or pretreatment with a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester] attenuated Ang II-stimulated cGMP accumulation. Both the time course and Ca2+ dependency of the effect of Ang II were similar to those of the effect of bradykinin, which activates soluble guanylyl cyclase, but distinct from those of the effect of ANF, which activates particulate guanylyl cyclase. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, attenuated the effects of Ang II and bradykinin but not that of ANF. LaCl3, a nonspecific Ca2+ blocker, prevented Ang II-stimulated cGMP accumulation. L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, nifedipine and diltiazem, or an N-type Ca2+ channel blocker, omega-conotoxin, failed to inhibit the effect of Ang II. Ang II had no effect on formation of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate or cAMP content, whereas bradykinin stimulated 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate formation in differentiated Neuro-2A cells. Further, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and NG-nitro-L-arginine attenuated Ang II- and bradykinin-stimulated elevation of cGMP content but not that stimulated by ANF. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 also stimulated cGMP formation and the effect was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. These results indicate that the newly found Ang II receptor mediates cGMP formation through activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase and that the activation is mediated by nitric oxide, which is increased by Ca2+ influx via an ion channel distinct from the L-type and N-type Ca2+ channels.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0026-895x(25)13440-8", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2399842582", "source": "openalex"}

MethodsTwenty-one Congolese konzo patients underwent neuro-ophthalmological investigations including visual acuity testing, assessment of light pupillary reflexes, evaluation of ocular motility and deviation, direct ophthalmoscopy, and visual field perimetry. Objective refraction including retinoscopy and keratometry, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy were also done. ResultsFive patients had visual impairment, and 14 had temporal pallor of the optic disc. Fourteen presented visual field defects, the most frequent being concentric constriction and peripheral defects. Overall, 11 subjects had symptoms qualifying for the diagnosis of optic neuropathy. Two had spontaneous pendular nystagmus in primary position of gaze. Visual field defects and pallor of the optic discs were found in mild, moderate and severe forms of konzo. No correlation was found between the severity of the motor disability of konzo and the extent of visual field loss.

We included controlled studies in intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders (such as advanced or delayed sleep) and in neuropsychiatric disorders with assumed high prevalence of circadian dysregulation (such as affective and psychotic disorders). Articles were identified through database searching: 40 studies reporting 49 relevant intervention comparisons met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed improvements in sleep continuity (ES = -0.23, p = 0.000), self-reported sleep disturbance (ES = -0.32, p = 0.014), and advancement of delayed sleep timing (ES = -0.34, p = 0.010). Although the small number of studies limited meta-regression, evening light avoidance was associated with greater increase in total sleep time. Effects of light on sleep and circadian outcomes have received limited attention in studies in psychiatric disorders, but results were promising in these groups.

This study examined the influence of different types of breaks on cognitive performance and related cortical activity in office-based employees. Breaks were filled with exercise, resting or a usual break and a control condition where employees continued working without any break. Cognitive performance was assessed using the d2-R test and two commercially available cognitive tasks. Brain cortical activity was recorded using electroencephalography before and after breaks. Individual's mood was analysed using a profile of mood state. Results indicate a positive effect of a 3-min boxing intervention on cognitive performance, mirrored by a decrease in prefrontal cortex activity. Although perceived psychological state was increased after the usual break, this is reflected in neither cortical activity nor cognitive performance. With respect to the fact that also bike activity resulted an increase in prefrontal alpha-2 activity, a positive effect of exercise on neuro-cognitive performance can be stated. Health and economic benefits may result from brief physical activity breaks and help to maintain workplace performance and job satisfaction.

For the first time, we found the disruption of neurotransmitters 5-HT, impaired neurogenesis and activation of astrocytes coupled with concomitant neuro-inflammation were the potential pathogenesis of endotoxemia induced acute neuro-inflammation in sepsis survivors. In addition, dioscin a natural steroidal saponin isolated from Chinese medicinal herbs, enhanced the serotonergic system and produced anti-depressant effect by enhancing 5-HT levels in hippocampus. What is more, this finding was verified by metabolic analyses of hippocampus, indicating 5-HT related metabolic pathway was involved in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia induced acute neuro-inflammation. Moreover, neuro-inflammation and neurogenesis within hippocampus were indexed using quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of GFAP DCX and Ki67, as well as real-time RT-PCR analysis of some gene expression levels in hippocampus. Our in vivo and in vitro studies show dioscin protects hippocampus from endotoxemia induced cascade neuro-inflammation through neurotransmitter 5-HT and HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling pathway, which accounts for the dioscin therapeutic effect in behavioral tests.

The aim of this review paper is to give an overview of the current state-of-art usage of DL in MRI for neuro-oncology.We reviewed the Pubmed database by applying a specific search strategy including the combination of MRI, DL, neuro-oncology and its corresponding search terminologies, by focussing on Medical Subject Headings (Mesh) or title/abstract appearance. The original research papers were classified based on its application, into three categories: technological innovation, diagnosis and follow-up.Forty-one publications were eligible for review, all were published after the year 2016. The majority (N = 22) was assigned to technological innovation, twelve had a focus on diagnosis and seven were related to patient follow-up. Applications ranged from improving the acquisition, synthetic CT generation, auto-segmentation, tumor classification, outcome prediction and response assessment. The majority of publications made use of standard (T1w, cT1w, T2w and FLAIR imaging), with only a few exceptions using more advanced MRI technologies. The majority of studies used a variation on convolution neural network (CNN) architectures.Deep learning in MRI for neuro-oncology is a novel field of research; it has potential in a broad range of applications. Remaining challenges include the accessibility of large imaging datasets, the applicability across institutes/vendors and the validation and implementation of these technologies in clinical practise.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.03.003", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3140653050", "source": "openalex"}

It acts at the level of the biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, to modulate their activity, thereby influencing circadian rhythms, and also sleep processes. The clinical application of melatonin in the treatment of human mental disorders is still in its infancy. Until now, melatonin only has been used in psychiatry because of its hypnotic, resynchronizing and antioxidant actions. In this review, we hypothesized that melatonin might play an important role as an adjuvant therapy, in mental disturbances, due to other properties including its anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anxiolytic, drug detoxification properties, protective actions against osteoporosis, etc. Complex interactions occur between the brain and the immune system and currently is accepted that psychological and psychiatric illness can compromise immune and hormonal functions. Altered psychological states often influence the susceptibility of an individual to illness or modify the course of the illness and its prognosis. The present review discusses on the advantages of the co-treatment with melatonin and recent patents in three major psychiatric disorders: depression, bipolar syndrome and schizophrenia. The findings suggest new vistas in both the pathophysiology and the pharmacology of mental disorders.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2174/157488909787002564", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2135564221", "source": "openalex"}

Understandably, doubts about the safety of such methods are increasing among future parents. The purpose of this review is to analyse the real impact of ART, such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), on the health of the unborn baby; in particular, this work is focussed on the problems related to the neuro-psycho-motor area. Twenty-four studies were reviewed and outcomes investigated were: risk of the onset of neurodevelopmental diseases, worsening of school cognitive performance and risk of developing infantile cerebral palsy (CP) or neurological sequelae. For the first two outcomes, we did not find a correlation with ART; nevertheless, the results of the included studies about risk of CP are discordant and influenced by various confounding factors, such as pre-term birth and multiple pregnancies.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) are the main answer for achieving pregnancy in infertile couples. However, a wide number of studies have tried to focus on possible different outcomes in terms of maternal and foetal/new-born health. Regarding this scenario, a peculiar importance is given to diseases affecting the neuro-psycho-motor area of the new-born. Since this group of detrimental pathologies could heavily affect the new-born's quality of life and require costly social facilities, different studies have tried to focus on possible outcomes after ART.What do the results of this study add? This manuscript provides a review of the literature regarding ART procedures and neuro-psycho-motor implication. A review is strongly required due to the importance of collecting evidence from studies with different methodologies.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This manuscript provides evidence about the need for wider and more congruent studies regarding neurodevelopment disorders in new-borns after ART procedures. Data are prone to suggest a slight correlation, but several confounding factors can heavily hamper the possibility to draw a firm conclusion about the topic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2022.2109953", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4291145029", "source": "openalex"}

One interaction involves the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), which regulate the prohormone submandibular rat 1 (SMR1) produced by the submandibular gland (SMG). A peptide derived from SMR1, feG, has anti‐inflammatory activity, and modification to D ‐isomer feG enhances bioactivity. We tested feG as a therapeutic agent for airways inflammation, using rats sensitized by OVA or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis ( Nb ). Treatment with feG but not fdG down‐regulated OVA‐challenge‐induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)‐derived macrophages, eosinophils and PMN (neutrophils) by 44%, 69% and 67%, respectively, at 24 h. We found that feG also reduced ICAM‐1 on BAL‐derived macrophages and eosinophils by 27% and 65%, and L‐selectin on PMN by 55% following OVA challenge. Furthermore, feG but not fdG reduced the OVA‐induced TNF increase in BAL fluid. We showed that feG also down‐regulated both hyper‐responsiveness to methacholine (by 27%) and microgranulomata formation in the lung parenchyma. In Nb ‐challenged rats, feG treatment inhibited ex vivo allergen‐induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle by up to 73%. In conclusion, feG, which is a mimetic of a peptide derived from a rat salivary gland prohormone, has anti‐inflammatory properties in allergic airways inflammation in Brown‐Norway rats. The role of the SCG‐SMG neuro‐endocrine pathway in allergic asthma and other inflammatory diseases requires additional study.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.200425461", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2071304209", "source": "openalex"}

From all TCSs lymphocyte-derived DNA was analyzed for the functional A-->G polymorphism at bp 304 in GSTP1, and deletions in GST-M1 and GST-T1. Evaluation of associations between GST polymorphisms and self-reported toxicities included adjustment for prior treatment.All six evaluated toxicities were significantly associated with the cumulative dose of cisplatin and/or bleomycin. Compared to TCSs with either GSTP1-AG or GSTP1-AA, the 37 TCSs with the genotype GSTP1-GG, were significantly less bothered by paresthesias in fingers and toes (p = 0.039, OR 0.46 [0.22-0.96] and p = 0.023, OR 0.42 [0.20-0.88], respectively), and tinnitus (p = 0.008, OR 0.33 [0.14-0.74]). Furthermore, absence of functional GSTM1 protected against hearing impairment (p = 0.025, OR 1.81 [1.08-3.03]).In TCSs long-term self-reported chemotherapy-induced toxicities are associated with functional polymorphisms in GSTP1 and GSTM1. Hypothetically, absence of GST-M1 leaves more glutathione as substrate for the co-expressed GST-P1.

A 3D neuro-anatomical atlas has been generated from the MRI data set of a normal, healthy volunteer to assist in the interpretation of nuclear medicine scans of the brain. Region growing and edge-detection techniques were used to semi-automatically segment the data set into the major tissue types within the brain. The atlas was then labelled interactively by marking points on each 2D slice. Anatomical structures useful in the interpretation of SPECT images were labelled. Additional, more detailed information corresponding to these structures is provided via an interactive index which allows access to images, diagrams and explanations. Registration of patient SPECT studies with the atlas is accomplished by using the position of the skull vertex and four external fiducial markers attached to the skin surface. The 3D coordinates determined from these points are used to calculate the transformation required to rotate, scale and translate the SPECT data, in 3D, to match the atlas. Corresponding 2D slices from the two 3D data sets are then displayed side-by-side on a computer screen. A cursor linking the two images allows the delineation of regions of interest (ROIs) in the SPECT scan based on anatomical structures identified from the atlas. Conversely regions of abnormal isotope distribution in the SPECT image can be localized by reference to corresponding structures in the atlas.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/14639239109012124", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2017534576", "source": "openalex"}

The ANFIS predistorter (PD) employs the advantage of real-time modeling of the PA's responses in determining the PD's functions. The amplitude and phase corrections for the PD are represented in an easy-to-understand fuzzy if-then rule, while the parameters involved in the fuzzy representation are trained using neural networks algorithms, namely gradient-descent and least squares estimate (LSE). Experimental results show that a 26.3-dB improvement in linearity for a two-tone signal is obtained, while a distorted WCDMA signal is suppressed by at least 12 dB. The adaptability of the ANFIS PD to instantaneous variation in PA responses through time is also demonstrated, and results show that the ANFIS PD is capable of adapting to simulated environmental changes, which is a topic often omitted by researchers in this area. Further testing demonstrated that the tuning parameters involved in the training could be reduced by more than half for a fairly nonlinear PA without significantly degrading the suppression capability.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2005.861171", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2142810306", "source": "openalex"}

In myasthenic patients spontaneously recurring negative discharges were more difficult to locate in the end-plate zone than in normal subjects, suggesting that the number or density of functioning end plates may be reduced. The threshold dose of intra-arterial ACh that increased electrical activity was higher than in normal subjects; the duration of the increased electrical activity was briefer, and was followed by more depression of negative discharges than in normal subjects and by a greater increase in the threshold dose of ACh. These results indicate that the end-plate zone of myasthenic patients is less responsive than that of normal subjects to the excitatory action of ACh, and may be more readily desensitized by ACh. In both myasthenic patients and normal subjects the intra-arterial injection of ACh produced a prompt transient decrease in evoked potentials, attributable to depolarization of the end plates, followed by recovery (and in myasthenic patients by repair), and then by a more prolonged late decrease in evoked potentials, attributable to desensitization of the end plates to transmitter. This prompt depressant effect of ACh on evoked potentials was less in myasthenic patients than in normal subjects, and the late depressant effect of ACh was greater. In myasthenic patients the late block produced by ACh had the characteristics of an antidepolarizing (competitive) type of block, including inhibition of the depolarizing action of ACh and reversibility by ACh or neostigmine, while in normal subjects the characteristics were those of a depolarizing (noncompetitive) type of block, including little or no inhibition of the depolarizing action of ACh and lack of reversal by ACh or neostigmine. The differences between the late depressant action of ACh in myasthenic patients and normal subjects resembled differences in the effect of other depolarizing compounds, such as choline, succinylcholine, and decamethonium, and are best explained by differences in behavior of the postsynaptic receptor. The disease appears to be due to the presence of abnormal forms of receptor or to abnormal responses of receptor to the transmitter. The predominance of one or other form of receptor may determine the clinical state of the myasthenic patient and his response to anticholinesterase medication.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb47683.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2070769710", "source": "openalex"}

Young male Wistar rats were subjected to intra-nigral administration of MPTP for the induction of Parkinson's disease. Glutamate modulators like ceftriaxone (CFX), Memantine (MEM) and Dihydrokainate (DHK) were administered to MPTP-lesioned rats. Different behavioral alterations were assessed in between the study period. Animals were sacrificed immediately after behavioral session, and different biochemical parameters were measured. Intranigral administration of MPTP showed significant impairment of motor behavior and marked increase in inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress parameters in rats. In addition, MPTP also produced significant decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in striatum of rats. However, chronic administration of ceftriaxone (200mg/kg) has shown significant improvement in motor behavioral deficits and oxidative damage. In addition, Ceftriaxone also attenuated the marked increase of NFκB, TNF-α and IL-1β in MPTP treated rats thus, conferring its neuro-inflammatory property. Further, Ceftriaxone significantly restored the decreased activity of BDNF in striatum of MPTP treated rats. Moreover, pre-treatment of memantine (20mg/kg) with sub-therapeutic dose of ceftriaxone (100mg/kg) potentiated the protective effect of ceftriaxone. Furthermore, intra-nigral injection of DHK (200 nmol) with lower dose of ceftriaxone (100mg/kg) reversed the protective effect of ceftriaxone in MPTP treated rats.

The view of adolescence as a silent-transition phase then prevailed and diverged from the psychoanalytic perspective. This article reviews infant and adolescent development using an interdisciplinary, neuro-psychoanalytic model in which psychoanalytic, neurobiological, and developmental perspectives converge and complement each other. Recent empirical research focuses attention on adolescence as a phase in which a far-reaching neurobiological and psychological reorganization takes place. According to the ontogenetic principle of psychoanalysis, the development and organization of the basic psychic functions occur in the first five years of life, while a reorganization takes place in adolescence. Neurobiological research confirms that the basic growth and maturation of the brain occurs in the first five years of life, and that a substantial reorganization in brain development transpires in adolescence. Research also verifies the clinical psychoanalytic concept that neurobiological and psychological maturation in adolescence remain unfinished till approximately age 23. The long-term and late biopsychosocial maturation in adolescence implies that adequate monitoring by parents and school remains necessary. The view that adolescents need to separate, and discover their individuality and independence alone, is unsupported by recent findings. The adolescent must acquire his independence, personal identity, and self-agency (\"scaffolding\") step by step. It is important that the adolescent knows that his parents are in the background monitoring and intervening as necessary; that he is not entirely alone, adrift and at risk for potential fragmentation. The long-term plasticity of the brain in adolescence implies greater vulnerability for the development of psychopathology, but offers opportunity for psychotherapeutic interventions to have greater impact.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1521/jaap.2010.38.3.503", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2152264192", "source": "openalex"}

The first points of contact either at the disaster scenes or emergency department exposed the frontline workers and medical physicians to the risk of infections. Therefore, there is a persuasive demand for the integration and exploitation of heterogeneous biomedical information to improve clinical practice, medical research and point of care. In this paper, a primary triage model was designed using two different methods: an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN).When the patient is presented at the triage counter, the system will capture their vital signs and chief complains beside physiology stat and general appearance of the patient. This data will be managed and analyzed in the data server and the patient’s emergency status will be reported immediately. The proposed method will help to reduce the queue time at the triage counter and the emergency physician’s burden especially duringdisease outbreak and serious disaster. The models have been built with 2223 data set extracted from the Emergency Department of the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre to predict the primary triage category. Multilayer feed forward with one hidden layer having 12 neurons has been used for the ANN architecture. Fuzzy subtractive clustering has been used to find the fuzzy rules for the ANFIS model. The results showed that the RMSE, %RME and the accuracy which evaluated by measuring specificity and sensitivity for binary classificationof the training data were 0.14, 5.7 and 99 respectively for the ANN model and 0.85, 32.00 and 96.00 respectively for the ANFIS model. As for unseen data the root mean square error, percentage the root mean square error and the accuracy for ANN is 0.18, 7.16 and 96.7 respectively, 1.30, 49.84 and 94 respectively for ANFIS model. The ANN model was performed better for both training and unseen data than ANFIS model in term of generalization.

During the conceptual project phase, it is difficult to conduct an accurate cost estimate due to the great amount of uncertain cost items. This study proposes a new model for estimating semiconductor hookup construction project costs. The developed model, called FALCON‐COST, integrates the component ratios method, fuzzy adaptive learning control network (FALCON), fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), and three‐point cost estimation method to systematically deal with a cost‐estimating environment involving limited and uncertain data. In addition, the proposed model improves the current FALCON by devising a new algorithm to conduct building block selection and random gene deletion so that fmGA operations can be implemented in FALCON. The results of 54 case studies demonstrate that the proposed model has estimation accuracy of 83.82%, meaning it is approximately 22.74%, 23.08%, and 21.95% more accurate than the conventional average cost method, component ratios method, and modified FALCON‐COST method, respectively.

We and others have previously shown that Sema4A and H‐ferritin interact through the T‐cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (Tim‐2) receptor in mice. H‐ferritin has been identified as the iron delivery protein for oligodendrocytes, whereas Sema4A causes a direct cytotoxic effect. However, the expression of Tim‐2 has not been detected in humans. Here, we demonstrate that, similar to rodents, human oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis when exposed to Sema4A and take up H‐ferritin for meeting iron requirements and that these functions are mediated via the Tim‐1 receptor. Moreover, we also demonstrate the ability of H‐ferritin to block Sema4A‐mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we show in a series of pilot studies that Sema4A is detectable in the CSF of multiple sclerosis patients and HIV‐seropositive persons and can induce oligodendrocyte cell death.

Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is known to possess various beneficial properties including; antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-diabetic, anti-ulcerogenic effects. However, there is a lack of pertinent information on its importance in acute alcohol-induced hepato- and neuro-toxicity. The present study evaluated the potential protective effects of watermelon juice on ethanol-induced oxidative stress in the liver and brain of male Wistar rats. Rats were pre-treated with the watermelon juice at a dose of 4 ml/kg body weight for a period of fifteen days prior to a single dose of ethanol (50%; 12 ml/kg body weight). Ethanol treatment reduced body weight gain and significantly altered antioxidant status in the liver and brain. This is evidenced by the significant elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration; depletion in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and an increased catalase (CAT) activity in the brain and liver. There was no significant difference in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in the liver and brain. Oral administration of watermelon juice for fifteen (15) days prior to ethanol intoxication, significantly reduced the concentration of MDA in the liver and brain of rats. In addition, water melon pre-treatment increased the concentration of GSH and normalized catalase activity in both tissues in comparison to the ethanol control group. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenol, alkaloids, saponins, tannins and steroids in watermelon juice.

The most common causes are Bell's palsy, Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and trauma, including surgical trauma. Incidence varies between 17 and 35 cases per 100,000. Initial evaluation should include accurate clinical history, followed by a comprehensive investigation of the head and neck, including ophthalmological, otological, oral and neurological examination, to exclude secondary causes. Routine laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging is not indicated in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, but should be performed in patients with risk factors, atypical cases or in any case without resolution within 4 months. Many factors are involved in determining the appropriate treatment of these patients: the underlying cause, expected duration of nerve dysfunction, anatomical manifestations, severity of symptoms and objective clinical findings. Systemic steroids should be offered to patients with new-onset Bell's palsy to increase the chance of facial nerve recovery and reduce synkinesis. Ophthalmologists play a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary team involved in the evaluation and rehabilitation of these patients. In the acute phase, the main priority should be to ensure adequate corneal protection. Treatment depends on the degree of nerve lesion and on the risk of the corneal damage based on the amount of lagophthalmos, the quality of Bell's phenomenon, the presence or absence of corneal sensitivity and the degree of lid retraction. The main therapy is intensive lubrication. Other treatments include: taping the eyelid overnight, botulinum toxin injection, tarsorrhaphy, eyelid weight implants, scleral contact lenses and palpebral spring. Once the cornea is protected, longer term planning for eyelid and facial rehabilitation may take place. Spontaneous complete recovery of Bell's palsy occurs in up to 70% of cases.

The MVO-ANFIS, EO-ANFIS, SA-ANFIS and HGSO-ANFIS models were then developed and evaluated based on this dataset for predicting roof displacements in roadways of underground mines. The results indicated that the proposed intelligent techniques could accurately predict the roof displacements in roadways of underground mines with an accuracy in the range of 83%–92%. Remarkably, the SA-ANFIS model yielded the most dominant accuracy (i.e. 92%). Based on the accurate predictions from the proposed techniques, the reinforced solutions can be timely suggested to ensure the stability of roadways during exploiting coal, especially in the underground coal mines exploited by the longwall mining.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2021.07.005", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3201203558", "source": "openalex"}

The stress wave was detected using a pair of accelerometers and an acoustic emission (AE) sensor, and the effect of heat treatment (HT) on the physical and mechanical properties of wood as well as wave velocity and AE signal is discussed. The AE signal was processed in the time and time-frequency domains using wavelet analysis and different features were extracted for network training. The auto-associative NN is used as a dimensional reduction method to decrease the dimension of the extracted AE features and enhance the ANFIS performance. It was shown that while the stress wave velocity using the accelerometer did not result in an accurate model, the network performance significantly increased when trained with the AE features. The AE signal exhibited a significant correlation with wood treatment and porosity. The best ANFIS performance corresponded to predicting the wood swelling coefficient, equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and water absorption (WA), respectively. However, the AE signal did not seem suitable for predicting the wood density and hardness. The performance of ANFIS was compared with the “group method of data handling” (GMDH) NN. Both the ANFIS and GMDH networks showed higher accuracy than the multivariate linear regression (MVLR) model.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1515/hf-2018-0289", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2938532024", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of bilirubin, lumirubin (LR, its major photo-oxidative product), and BOX A and B (its monopyrrolic oxidative products) on the central nervous system (CNS) using in vitro and ex vivo experimental models. The effects of bilirubin photoproducts on cell viability and expression of selected genes were tested in human fibroblasts, three human CNS cell lines (neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, microglial HMC3, and glioblastoma U-87 cell lines), and organotypic rat hippocampal slices. Neither bilirubin nor its photo-oxidative products affected cell viability in any of our models. In contrast, LR in biologically-relevant concentrations (25 μM) significantly increased gene expression of several pro-inflammatory genes as well as production of TNF-α in organotypic rat hippocampal slices.

Analysis of the reading process provides important information about perceptual preconditions and cortical adaptive strategies, which are also of significance for rehabilitation. Methods: Reading performance was examined using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), which allows the simultaneous assessment of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in relation to the stimuli and the eye movements. Visual fields were measured using Tuebingen perimetry and a self-developed SLO perimetry, attentional fields using the Test of Sustained Attention. Results: Patients with absolute central scotomas are only able to read if they learn to use an eccentric PRL. With a ring scotoma, reading ability depends on the size of the intact central island and the fixation behavior.With hemianopia, it is crucial whether there is macular splitting or sparing. Without sparing, reading performance depends on adaptive strategies such as predictive saccades or eccentric fixation.The latter causes a shift of the field border towards the hemianopic side in conventional perimetry. Locations of high attentional capability during central fixation (early stage of maculopathy) correspond to the later eccentric PRL during follow-up. Conclusions: Reading performance depends on the size of the perceptual area and the resolution of the PRL used for reading. Compensating strategies are crucial for regaining reading ability. Eccentric fixation causes a shift of the sensory and oculomotor reference, indicating high cortical plasticity. There is evidence that the location of a future PRL is influenced by sustained attention – a mechanism that could be utilized for specific training.

In these patients, GVF is often the preferred visual field technique, but performance of this test requires a skilled technician, and this option may not be readily available. The recent development of the SITA family of perimetry has allowed for shorter automated perimetry testing time in normal subjects and in glaucoma patients. However, its usefulness for detecting visual field defects in patients with poor vision or neurological disease has not been evaluated. <h3>Design and Methods</h3> We prospectively studied 64 consecutive, neuro-ophthalmologically impaired patients with neurologic disability of 3 or more on the Modified Rankin Scale, or with visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in at least one eye. Goldmann manual kinetic perimetry and SITA Fast results were compared for each eye, with special attention to reliability, test duration, and detection and quantification of neuro-ophthalmic visual field defects. We categorized the results into 1 of 9 groups based on similarities and reliabilities. Patient test preference was also assessed. <h3>Results</h3> Patients were separated into 2 groups, those with severe neurologic deficits (n = 50 eyes) and those with severe vision loss but mild neurologic dysfunction or none at all (n = 50 eyes). Overall, GVF and SITA Fast were equally reliable in 77% of eyes. Goldmann manual kinetic perimetry and SITA Fast showed similar visual field results in 75% of all eyes (70% of eyes of patients with severe neurologic deficits and 80% of eyes with poor vision). The mean ± SD duration per eye was 7.97 ± 3.2 minutes for GVF and 5.43 ± 1.41 minutes for SITA Fast (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Ninety-one percent of patients preferred GVF to SITA Fast. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We found the SITA Fast strategy of automated perimetry to be useful in the detection, and accurate in the quantification of central visual field defects associated with neuro-ophthalmic disorders. Our results suggest that for the general ophthalmologist or neurologist, visual field testing with SITA Fast perimetry might even be preferable to GVF, especially if performed by a marginally trained technician, even in patients with severely decreased vision or who are neurologically disabled.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.120.9.1162", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063765367", "source": "openalex"}

However, the on-chip implementation of a large-scale neural network is still challenging owing to its low scalability. Herein, we propose the concept of a photonic neural field and implement it experimentally on a silicon chip to realize highly scalable neuro-inspired computing. In contrast to existing photonic neural networks, the photonic neural field is a spatially continuous field that nonlinearly responds to optical inputs, and its high spatial degrees of freedom allow for large-scale and high-density neural processing on a millimeter-scale chip. In this study, we use the on-chip photonic neural field as a reservoir of information and demonstrate a high-speed chaotic time-series prediction with low errors using a training approach similar to reservoir computing. We show that the photonic neural field is potentially capable of executing more than one peta multiply–accumulate operations per second for a single input wavelength on a footprint as small as a few square millimeters. The operation of the neural field is energy efficient due to a passive scattering process, for which the required power comes only from the optical input. We also show that in addition to processing, the photonic neural field can be used for rapidly sensing the temporal variation of an optical phase, facilitated by its high sensitivity to optical inputs.

Effective development of software is based on accurate effort estimation. Although many techniques and algorithmic models have been developed and implemented by practitioners, accurate software development effort prediction is still a challenging endeavor in the field of software engineering, especially in handling unce rtain a nd imprecise inputs and collinear characteristics. In order to address these issues, previous researchers developed and evaluated a novel soft computing framework. The aims of our research are to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed neuro-fuzzy model with Sy stem Evaluation and Estimation of Resource Software Estimation Model (SEER- SEM) in software estimation practices and to apply the proposed architecture that combines the neuro-fuzzy technique with different algorithmic models. In this paper, an approach combining the neuro-fuzzy technique and the SEER -SEM effort estimation algorithm is described. This proposed model possesses positive characteristics such as l earning ability, decreased sensitivity, effective generalization, and knowledge integration for introducing the neuro-fuzzy technique. Moreover, continuous rating values and linguistic values can be inputs of the proposed model for avoiding the large estimation deviation among similar projects. The performance of the proposed model is accessed by designing and conducting evaluation with published projects and industrial data. The evaluation results indicate that estimation with our proposed neuro-fuzzy model containing SEER-S EM is improved in comparison with the estimation results that only use SEER- SEM algorithm. At the same time, the results of this research also demonstrate that the general neuro-fuzzy framework can function with various algorithmic models for improving the performance of software effort estimation.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2963212551", "source": "openalex"}

Therefore, it is very important to estimate and forecast the consumption of oil. This helps the governments to take the right decisions and avoid the wrong decisions that lead to negative outcomes. For that reason, there are several methods that have been applied to forecast the oil consumption, such as the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model. It is one of the most popular data mining methods used to perform the forecast. However, the ANFIS model may not be accurate (biased) in all data, since its parameters require to be determined and updated and this may lead to stuck in the local point and not convergence to the optimal value. To this end, this paper presents an alternative oil consumption forecasting method by improving the ANFIS using the sine–cosine algorithm (SCA). In the proposed method called SCA-ANFIS, the parameters of the ANFIS are optimized using the SCA. In order to assess the performance of the proposed SCA-ANFIS method, a real dataset of petroleum products' consumption of three countries, namely, Canada, Germany, and Japan, is used. This dataset is collected on the period between 2007 and 2017, which contains 120 records per month for each country.

Such interconnections rose up to a level that involves synaptic plasticity, both concerning its molecular mechanisms and the clinical outcomes related to its behavioral abnormalities. Within this context, synaptic plasticity, apart from being modulated by classic CNS molecules, is strongly affected by the immune system, and vice versa. This is not surprising, given the common molecular pathways that operate at the cross-road between the CNS and immune system. When searching for a common pathway bridging neuro-immune and synaptic dysregulations, the two major cell-clearing cell clearing systems, namely the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, take center stage. In fact, just like is happening for the turnover of key proteins involved in neurotransmitter release, antigen processing within both peripheral and CNS-resident antigen presenting cells is carried out by UPS and autophagy. Recent evidence unravelling the functional cross-talk between the cell-clearing pathways challenged the traditional concept of autophagy and UPS as independent systems. In fact, autophagy and UPS are simultaneously affected in a variety of CNS disorders where synaptic and inflammatory/immune alterations concur. In this review, we discuss the role of autophagy and UPS in bridging synaptic plasticity with neuro-immunity, while posing a special emphasis on their interactions, which may be key to defining the role of immunity in synaptic plasticity in health and disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20092197", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2943475625", "source": "openalex"}

To achieve effective results with ANFIS, selecting the optimization method in training is very important. Heuristics and metaheuristics algorithms attempt to find the best solution out of all possible solutions to an optimization problem. ANFIS training can be based on nonderivative algorithms.

The molecular mechanisms that control microglial activation and its effects on neuropathic pain remain incompletely understood. We deleted the gene encoding the plasma membrane receptor, LDL Receptor‐related Protein‐1 (LRP1), conditionally in microglia using two distinct promoter‐ Cre recombinase systems in mice. LRP1 deletion in microglia blocked development of tactile allodynia, a neuropathic pain‐related behavior, after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PNL). LRP1 deletion also substantially attenuated microglial activation and pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression in the SDH following PNL. Because LRP1 shedding from microglial plasma membranes generates a highly pro‐inflammatory soluble product, we demonstrated that factors which activate spinal cord microglia, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and colony‐stimulating factor‐1, promote LRP1 shedding. Proteinases known to mediate LRP1 shedding, including ADAM10 and ADAM17, were expressed at increased levels in the SDH after PNL. Furthermore, LRP1‐deficient microglia in cell culture expressed significantly decreased levels of interleukin‐1β and interleukin‐6 when treated with LPS. We conclude that in the SDH, microglial LRP1 plays an important role in establishing and/or amplifying local neuro‐inflammation and neuropathic pain following PNS injury. The responsible mechanism most likely involves proteolytic release of LRP1 from the plasma membrane to generate a soluble product that functions similarly to pro‐inflammatory cytokines in mediating crosstalk between cells in the SDH and in regulating neuropathic pain.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.23599", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2912433752", "source": "openalex"}

RLDM offer a novel approach to assess and potentially diagnose psychiatric patients, and there is growing enthusiasm on RLDM and Computational Psychiatry among clinical researchers. Such a framework can also provide insights into the brain substrates of particular RLDM processes as exemplified by model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG). However, many researchers often find the approach too technical and have difficulty adopting it for their research. Thus, there remains a critical need to develop a user-friendly tool for the wide dissemination of computational psychiatric methods. We introduce an R package called hBayesDM ( h ierarchical Bayes ian modeling of D ecision- M aking tasks), which offers computational modeling on an array of RLDM tasks and social exchange games. The hBayesDM package offers state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian modeling, where both individual and group parameters (i.e., posterior distributions) are estimated simultaneously in a mutually constraining fashion. At the same time, it is extremely user-friendly: users can perform computational modeling, output visualization, and Bayesian model comparisons–each with a single line of coding. Users can also extract trial-by-trial latent variables (e.g., prediction errors) required for model-based fMRI/EEG. With the hBayesDM package, we anticipate that anyone with minimal knowledge of programming can take advantage of cutting-edge computational modeling approaches and investigate the underlying processes of and interactions between multiple decision-making (e.g., goal-directed, habitual, and Pavlovian) systems. In this way, it is our expectation that the hBayesDM package will contribute to the dissemination of advanced modeling approaches and enable a wide range of researchers to easily perform computational psychiatric research within their populations.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/064287", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2485636778", "source": "openalex"}

The proposed Neuro-Fuzzy approach uses class belongingness fuzzification of input patterns to handle uncertainty issues. However, the complexity of the model increases due to this fuzzy expansion of input patterns. On the other hand, all the expanded fuzzified patterns may not always be significant for model identification. To address this issue, post-feature reduction has been employed on fuzzified patterns to filter out the irrelevant, redundant and noisy features. Unlike pre-feature reduction, this allows all the features to be participated in the fuzzification process and then identify irrelevant features from the fuzzified patterns. Further, this approach allows exploring potential fuzzified features from the strong as well as weak feature set.

We avoided including review papers which did not provide any new information; however, two reviews on the pathophysiology of SANS were included for completeness. No limitations on date of publication were used. All included entries were then summarized for their contribution to knowledge about SANS.Four main themes among the publications emerged: papers defining the clinical entity of SANS, its pathophysiology, technology used to study SANS, and publications on possible prevention of SANS. The key clinical features of SANS include optic nerve head elevation, hyperopic shifts, globe flattening, choroidal folds, and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume in optic nerve sheaths. Two main hypotheses are proposed for the pathophysiology of SANS. The first being elevated intracranial pressure and the second compartmentalization of CSF to the globe.

To date, the only proven treatment for snake envenomation is antivenom therapy. Cross-neutralization of heterologous venoms by antivenom raised against venoms of closely related species has been reported. The present study examined the cross neutralizing potential of a newly developed polyvalent antivenom, termed Neuro Polyvalent Snake Antivenom (NPAV). NPAV was produced by immunization against 4 Thai elapid venoms. Principal Findings In vitro neutralization study using mice showed that NPAV was able to neutralize effectively the lethality of venoms of most common Asiatic cobras (Naja spp.), Ophiophagus hannah and kraits (Bungarus spp.) from Southeast Asia, but only moderately to weakly effective against venoms of Naja from India subcontinent and Africa. Studies with several venoms showed that the in vivo neutralization potency of the NPAV was comparable to the in vitro neutralization potency. NPAV could also fully protect against N. sputatrix venom-induced cardio-respiratory depressant and neuromuscular blocking effects in anesthetized rats, demonstrating that the NPAV could neutralize most of the major lethal toxins in the Naja venom. Conclusions/Significance The newly developed polyvalent antivenom NPAV may find potential application in the treatment of elapid bites in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, a neighboring nation of Thailand. Nevertheless, the applicability of NPAV in the treatment of cobra and krait envenomations in Southeast Asian victims needs to be confirmed by clinical trials.

The smart material that we used to develop a novel type of linear actuator is Terfenol-D. The peristaltic motion in the actuator is generated by inducing a traveling magnetic field inside the Terfenol-D element. The sensorless control of the actuator is based on an observation illustrating a direct relationship between the active element's position and the coils’ inductances. To detect the inductance change, the coil's current response to a pulse voltage input is monitored. Then, a fundamental relationship between the coils’ current-response pulsewidths and the active element's position is developed using a combination of a Sugeno fuzzy model and neural networks. Eventually, the closed-loop sensorless control of the magnetostrictive actuator was successfully performed. The neuro-fuzzy-based sensorless control demonstrated the position-estimation capability with a <formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\pm$ </tex></formula> 0.5-mm maximum error.

The characteristics of the camera including the modulation transfer function (MTF), the noise equivalent quanta, the detective quantum efficiency, observer studies, and the effect of geometric magnification were evaluated. The MTF was found to have nonzero (1.7%) value at the Nyquist frequency of 10 cycles/mm, while the DQE(0) had a value of All values were measured using head equivalent attenuating material in the beam at 80 kVp. Human observer studies performed using the 2 Alternative Forced Choice method revealed that iodinated vessels with inner diameter of 100 μm and 2 cm in length can be seen with a confidence level greater than 75%. The observer studies included a comparison with ideal observer performance calculations based on the integral signal to noise ratio in the image. Probabilities of visualization of various objects of interest in a neuro‐intervention, such as stents, were assessed.

Development of neuroimaging led neurosurgeons to achieve tumorectomy according to the oncological limits provided by preoperative or intraoperative structural and metabolic imaging. However, this principle is not coherent, neither with the infiltrative nature of DLGGs nor with the limited resolution of current neuroimaging. Indeed, despite technical advances, MRI still underestimates the actual spatial extent of gliomas, since tumoral cells are present several millimeters to centimeters beyond the area of signal abnormalities. Furthermore, cortical and subcortical structures may be still crucial for brain functions despite their invasion by this diffuse tumoral disease. Finally, the lack of reliability of functional MRI has also been demonstrated. Therefore, to talk about \"maximal safe resection\" based upon neuroimaging is a non-sense, because oncological MRI does not show the tumor and functional MRI does not show critical neural pathways. This review proposes an original concept in neuro-oncological surgery, i.e. to resect DLGG to the boundaries of brain functions, thanks to intraoperative electrical mapping performed in awake patients. This paradigmatic shift from image-guided resection to functional mapping-guided resection, based upon an accurate study of brain connectomics and neuroplasticity in each patient throughout tumor removal has permitted to solve the classical dilemma, by increasing both survival and quality of life in DLGG patients. With this in mind, brain surgeons should also be neuroscientists.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2405205604", "source": "openalex"}

In dermatology, pruritus is the most frequent symptom both in its acute and chronic form (over 6 weeks in duration). Treatment of chronic pruritus often remains challenging. Affected patients who suffer from moderate to severe pruritus have a significantly reduced quality of life. The underlying physiology of pruritus is very complex, involving a diverse network of components in the skin including resident cells such as keratinocytes and sensory neurons as well as transiently infiltrating cells such as certain immune cells. Previous research has established that there is a significant crosstalk among the stratum corneum, nerve fibers and various immune cells, such as keratinocytes, T cells, basophils, eosinophils and mast cells. In this regard, interactions between receptors on cutaneous and spinal neurons or on different immune cells play an important role in the processing of signals which are important for the transmission of pruritus. In this review, we discuss the role of various receptors involved in pruritus and inflammation, such as TRPV1 and TRPA1, IL-31RA and OSMR, TSLPR, PAR-2, NK1R, H1R and H4R, MRGPRs as well as TrkA, with a focus on interaction between nerve fibers and different immune cells. Emerging evidence shows that neuro-immune interactions play a pivotal role in mediating pruritus-associated inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or chronic spontaneous urticaria. Targeting these bidirectional neuro-immune interactions and the involved pruritus-specific receptors is likely to contribute to novel insights into the underlying pathogenesis and targeted treatment options of pruritus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.627985", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3132154974", "source": "openalex"}

Sir Charles Bell (1774–1842) was a Scottish anatomist, physiologist, neurologist, artist and surgeon, who enjoyed a distinguished career in teaching and clinical practice in London between 1804 and 1836. In 1814, he was appointed to the surgical staff of the Middlesex Hospital. In 1824, he was elected Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and shortly afterwards was elected Professor of Physiology at the University of London. In 1831, he was knighted on the accession of William IV. In 1836, he was elected to the Chair of Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, and remained there until his death in 1842, at 68 years of age. During his career, Bell was a prolific medical author, a brilliant medical researcher and a skilled artist. In 1811, he discovered the distinct functions of the motor and sensory nerves, findings that were initially published in a pamphlet entitled ‘Ideas of a New Anatomy of the Brain’. In 1821, Bell described the long thoracic nerve, which supplies the serratus anterior muscle, and which now bears his name. In the same paper he showed that lesions of the seventh cranial nerve produce facial paralysis (now termed Bell's palsy). He also demonstrated that the fifth cranial nerve is of sensory importance to the face and controls the muscles of mastication, whereas the seventh cranial nerve principally controls the muscles of facial expression. Bell published research on a number of ophthalmological subjects. This paper reviews some of these latter achievements.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.00972.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1991251953", "source": "openalex"}

SCM is a complex process and most often characterized by uncertainty. Many values are stochastic and cannot be precisely determined and described by classical mathematical methods. Therefore, in solving real and complex problems individual methods of artificial intelligence are increasingly used, or their combination in the form of hybrid methods. This paper has proposed the decision support system for determining economic order quantity and order implementation based on Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems - ANFIS. A combination of two concepts of artificial intelligence in the form of hybrid neuro-fuzzy method has been applied into the decision support system in order to exploit the individual advantages of both methods. This method can deal with complexity and uncertainty in SCM better than classical methods because they it stems from experts' opinions. The proposed decision support system showed good results for determining the amount of economic order and it is presented as a successful tool for planning in SCM.

However, the performance of the thermally driven adsorption systems is lower than that of other heat driven heating/cooling systems. Low coefficients of performance are one of the main disadvantages of adsorption coolers. It is the result of a poor heat transfer coefficient between the bed and the immersed heating surfaces of a built-in heat exchanger system. The purpose of this work is to study the effect of thermal conductance values of sorption elements and evaporator as well as other design parameters on the performance of a re-heat two-stage adsorption chiller. One of the main energy efficiency factors in cooling production, i. e. cooling capacity for wide-range of both design and operating parameters is analyzed in the paper. Moreover, the work introduces artificial intelligence approach for the optimization study of the adsorption cooler. The ANFIS was employed in the work. The increase in both the bed and evaporator conductance provides better performance of the considered innovative adsorption chiller. The highest obtained value of cooling capacity is 21.7 kW and it can be achieved for the following design and operational parameters of the considered re-heat two-stage adsorption chiller: Msorb = 40 kg, t = 1300 s, T = 80?C, Csorb/Cmet = 50, hAsorb = 4000 W/K, hAevap = 4000 W/K.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2298/tsci19s4053k", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2973450580", "source": "openalex"}

Overexpression of HO-1, however, has dual effects under oxidative stress, and the release of ferric iron from heme under these conditions may result in detrimental rather than cytoprotective effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of simvastatin-induced HO-1 on Neuro 2A cells in response to glucose deprivation. We demonstrated that simvastatin induced a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of HO-1 protein expression in Neuro 2A cells. The induction of HO-1 after simvastatin treatment was mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), which was expressed by Western blots of nuclear fractions and retarded complex formation in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction. In addition, simvastatin activated the extracellular signal–regulated kinase and p38, but not the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and Akt. Glucose deprivation in the cells pretreated with simvastatin induced more HO-1 expression, and the transcript could be decreased by small interfering RNA for Nrf2. This upregulation of HO-1 was significantly associated with increased apoptosis, manifested as expression at the protein level of 17-kDa cleaved caspase-3 and increased percentage of apoptotic cells shown by flow cytometry. The increased cleaved caspase-3 expression and percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced by the HO inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin. Addition of the iron chelator desferrioxamine also resulted in blockade of the aggravated apoptosis, which implies that iron production from HO-1 activity may play an important role in the increased apoptosis in response to glucose deprivation in neuronal cells pretreated with simvastatin.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfm258", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2112256304", "source": "openalex"}

In the cyclic triaxial testings, shear modulus and damping ratio of the sand–waste tires mixtures at various ratios have been measured for a strain range of .0001% up to .04%. Test results show that the shear modulus and damping ratio of the mixtures are strongly influenced by the waste tire inclusions. It is seen that the greater the proportion of waste tire crumbs or tire buffings on the sand, the greater is the damping ratio and the less is the shear modulus, regardless of confining pressure. The input variables in the developed NN and NF models are the (1) waste tires contents which are 0, 10, 20 and 30, (2) waste tires types which are tire crumbs and tire buffings, (3) confining pressures which are 40, 100 and 200 kPa and (4) strain level and the outputs are (1) damping ratio and (ii) shear modulus. The performance of proposed NN models (R 2 = .99 for shear modulus, and R 2 = .98 for damping ratio) is observed to be more accurate than the NF models (R 2 = .96 for shear modulus, and R 2 = 0.97 for damping ratio).

To date, little work has focused on the central nervous system response to a non-penetrating blast injury. We have evaluated the effect of a single 80-psi blast-overpressure wave in a rat model. Histological and immunochemical studies showed an early inflammatory response, tissue damage and the initiation of apoptosis. With regard to inflammation, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes infiltrated brain parenchyma within 1 h post-blast. Glial-fibrillary protein, cyclo-oxygenase-2ir, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor were present by 1 h and remained detectable at three weeks post-injury. High mobility group box-1 protein was detectable at three weeks. With regard to tissue damage, S100β and 4-hydroxynonenal were present at 1 h and remained detectable at three weeks. Amyloid precursor protein was detectable at three weeks. As for apoptosis, Cleaved Caspase-3 was detectable at three weeks. Morris water maze assessment of cognitive function showed that blast injured animals required significantly more time to reach the platform on day 1 of training and traveled a greater distance to get to the platform on days 1 and 2. Blast-injured animals showed a significant increase in swimming speed (p<0.001), increased total distance traveled (p<0.001) and increased number of entries into the previous quadrant that had contained the escape platform (p<0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense regions in the somatosensory area within 1 h. T2 relaxation times and apparent diffusion coefficients show increasing trends in both somatosensory and cortical regions. These data indicate an early and lasting response of brain tissue to non-penetrating blast over-pressure injury. This early inflammatory response is indicative of a mild traumatic brain injury.

The method is based on a new neuro-fuzzy dynamical system (neuro-FDS) definition, which uses the concept of adaptive fuzzy systems (AFSs) operating in conjunction with high-order neural network functions (FHONNFs). Since the plant is considered unknown, we first propose its approximation by a special form of an FDS and then the fuzzy rules are approximated by appropriate HONNFs. Thus, the identification scheme leads up to a recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN), which however takes into account the fuzzy output partitions of the initial FDS. The proposed scheme does not require a priori experts' information on the number and type of input variable membership functions making it less vulnerable to initial design assumptions. Once the system is identified around an operation point, it is regulated to zero adaptively. Weight updating laws for the involved HONNFs are provided, which guarantee that both the identification error and the system states reach zero exponentially fast, while keeping all signals in the closed loop bounded. The existence of the control signal is always assured by introducing a novel method of parameter hopping, which is incorporated in the weight updating law. Simulations illustrate the potency of the method and comparisons with conventional approaches on benchmarking systems are given. Also, the applicability of the method is tested on a direct current (dc) motor system where it is shown that by following the proposed procedure one can obtain asymptotic regulation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnn.2008.2010772", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2111179107", "source": "openalex"}

However, in-depth studies aimed to elucidate the precise in the aged microenvironment and the dichotomous role of Tregs have just begun and many aspects remain unclear. This is due, not only to a mutual dependency and reciprocal causation of alterations and diseases between the nervous and T cell immune systems, but also to an inconsistent aging of the two systems, which dynamically changes with CNS injury/recovery and/or aging process. Cellular immune system aging, particularly immunosenescence and T cell aging initiated by thymic involution - sources of chronic inflammation in the elderly (termed inflammaging), potentially induces an acceleration of brain aging and memory loss. In turn, aging of the brain via neuro-endocrine-immune network drives total body systemic aging, including that of the immune system. Therefore, immunotherapeutics including vaccination and \"protective autoimmunity\" provide promising means to rejuvenate neuro-inflammatory disorders and repair CNS acute injury and chronic neuro-degeneration.

However, once the power signals under investigation are corrupted by noises, the performance of the wavelet transform (WT) on detecting and recognizing PQ events would be greatly degraded. At the mean time, adopting the WTCs directly has the drawbacks of taking a longer time and much memory for the recognition system. To solve the problem of noises riding on power signals and to effectively reduce the number of features representing power transient signals, a noise-suppression scheme of noise-riding signals and an energy spectrum of the WTCs in different scales calculated by the Parseval's theorem are presented in this paper. The neuro-fuzzy classification system is then used for fuzzy rule construction and signal recognition. The success rates of recognizing PQ events from noise-riding signals have proven to be feasible in power system applications.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tpwrd.2009.2016789", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2138439887", "source": "openalex"}

However, despite the importance of neuropathological outcomes, for humans in particular, the pathogenesis, including mode of neuro‐invasion, remains unresolved for most congenital virus infections. Using a natural model of congenital infection with an RNA virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus in pregnant cattle, we sought to delineate the timing and mode of virus neuro‐invasion of and spread within the brain of foetuses following experimental respiratory tract infection of the dams at day 75 of pregnancy, a time of maximal risk of tissue pathology without foetal death. Virus antigen was first detected in the foetal brains 14 days postinfection of dams and was initially restricted to amoeboid microglial cells in the periventricular germinal layer. The appearance of these cells was preceded by or concurrent with vasculopathy in the same region. While the affected microvessels were negative for virus antigen, they expressed high levels of the type I interferon‐stimulated protein ISG15 and eventually disappeared in parallel with the appearance of microcavitary lesions. Subsequently, the virus spread to neurons and other glial cells. Our findings suggest that the virus enters the CNS via infected microglial precursors, the amoeboid microglial cells, in a ‘Trojan horse’ mode of invasion and that the microcavitary lesions are associated with loss of periventricular microvasculature, perhaps as a consequence of high, unrestricted induction of interferon‐regulated proteins.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2613.2011.00795.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2126672685", "source": "openalex"}

Purpose: Ophthalmic features of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) include juvenile cataract, retinal hamartomas and tumours of the cranial nerves. We hypothesize that these tumours lead to strabismological and neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms, including palsies of cranial nerves III, IV and VI, nystagmus and gaze palsies. Methods: We carried out a retrospective review of 73 patients with known genotype. They underwent ophthalmic, neuro‐ophthalmological and strabismological examination. Statistical analysis was performed by calculating odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. Results: Mean best corrected visual acuity was 0.85. Strabismus was found in 38 of 73 patients (52%). A deviation based on a cranial nerve palsy was found in 16 patients (22%) and three had supranuclear palsies. Eleven of 73 patients had a nystagmus, mostly caused by peripheral–vestibular disturbance. Binocular single vision was normal in 41 (58%), subnormal in six (8%) and not present in 24 (34%) patients. The average refractive error was − 0.57 D. Myopia of ≥ 0.5 D was present in 47 (33%) eyes and hyperopia of ≥ 2.0 D was measured in 11 (8%) eyes. In the subgroup analysis of NF2 mutation types, the relative risk for cranial nerve palsies and negative stereopsis was statistically significantly increased for the nonsense mutation group. The mosaicism group had a statistically significant decreased relative risk for concomitant squint, as did patients with unfound mutations for strabismus and poor stereopsis. Conclusions: The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine a larger collection of NF2 patients for strabismological and neuro‐ophthalmological lesions. Compared with the normal population, our sample showed a higher amount of strabismus, refractive errors and an increased incidence of vestibular nystagmus.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01088.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1998809241", "source": "openalex"}

The communication graph is assumed to be directed, and the agents are considered heterogeneous. The leader's dynamics are also assumed non-linear, and the state derivative of the leader is unknown to its immediate followers. The well-known command filtered backstepping approach, presented for single-agent systems in the literature, is extended to the synchronisation of MASs with non-strict-feedback non-linear dynamics. This obviates the requirement of computing the th-order derivatives of the local neighbourhood synchronisation error at the step of the design. The number of adaptive tuning laws and consequently the complexity of the neuro-adaptive design is reduced by estimating only a positive scalar related to unknown non-linear dynamics of each agent. An auxiliary system is then introduced into the control design to compensate for the discrepancy between designed and saturated control signals. The proposed distributed control protocol guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop system are cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the consensus error for all agents converge to a small neighbourhood of the origin. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0875", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2795653728", "source": "openalex"}

This study explores the potential of hybrid Wavelet Co-Active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (WCANFIS) models for simulating the transformation of rainfall-runoff process in the Baihe catchment located in China. The study investigates the selection of suitable settings for wavelet-based neuro-fuzzy rainfall-runoff models. These settings include the choice of a suitable wavelet function and the number of decomposition levels to be employed. For the development of wavelet neuro-fuzzy rainfall-runoff models, the input rainfall data is transformed by using the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). Ten different wavelet functions including the simple mother wavelet Haar; db2, db4, and db8 wavelet functions from the most popular wavelet family Daubechies; the Sym2, Sym4, Sym8 wavelets with sharp peaks; Coif2, Coif4 wavelets; and the discrete meyer (dmey) wavelet functions are used in this study. The study also investigates 10 input vectors in order to compare the two approaches of input vector selection to be used in conjunction with the WCANFIS models. The five input vectors are selected using the most common approach in which selection of the input vector comprising of the sequential time series data. Using this approach, the first input vector contains only lag-one day time series data and then modifying the input vector by successively adding one more lag time series into input vector and this continues up to a specific lag time (lag-5 day in the present study). The remaining five input vector combinations are selected on the basis of cross-correlation analysis. The performance of the developed WCANFIS models are compared with the simple Co-active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) models developed without WT and a total of 101 models are investigated in this study. The study reveals that the WCANFIS models performed better with the parsimonious input vector containing lagged time rainfall series having poor correlation with the observe runoff. The developed hybrid WCANFIS models performed best with the db8 mother wavelet function at the maximum possible decomposition level.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)cp.1943-5487.0000457", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2083827821", "source": "openalex"}

Recent findings regarding the underlying tumour biology may open up new avenues of clinical trial design, particularly identifying possible targets for biological modifiers. Over the last 12-18 months a significant number of institutional and national studies have been reported which are likely to impact on the design of future clinical trials. Recent findings In low-grade gliomas, stereotactically guided conformal radiotherapy should lead to a significant reduction in radiation-associated late toxicity, while in selected groups of high-grade gliomas the use of adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival. Completeness of resection and use of adjuvant focal radiotherapy remains the most important prognostic factor for outcome in patients with ependymomas, although in infants the use of post-surgical chemotherapy alone may allow the postponing of radiotherapy in selected cases. In primitive neuroectodermal tumours prognostic biological markers have been identified that are undergoing prospective evaluation. For patients with localized medulloblastomas a new standard treatment is emerging that uses reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy followed by platinum-based chemotherapy, while in supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours future treatment will be aimed at improving local control. Summary Given the rarity of paediatric primary central nervous system malignancies, further progress can only be achieved in the context of national or multinational prospective clinical trials incorporating biological studies, and participation in these should be strongly encouraged.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.wco.0000044762.39452.e3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2063081863", "source": "openalex"}

The nervous, endocrine and immune system might act as an integrated unit to mantain body defense against this pathological process and reciprocal influences have been evidenced among hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, pineal gland and immune system. In this study we evaluated differences among healthy subjects and subjects suffering from lung cancer in the 24-hour secretory profile of melatonin, cortisol, TRH, TSH, FT4, GH, IGF-1 and IL-2 and circadian variations of lymphocyte subpopulations. In ten healthy male volunteers (age range 45-66) and ten male patients with untreated non small cell lung cancer (age range 46-65) we measured melatonin, cortisol, TRH, TSH, FT4, GH, IGF-1 and IL-2 serum levels and percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations on blood samples collected every four hours for 24 hours. One-way ANOVA between the timepoints for each variable and each group was performed to look for a time-effect, the presence of circadian rhythmicity was evaluated, MESOR, amplitude and acrophase values, mean diurnal levels and mean nocturnal levels were compared. A clear circadian rhythm was validated in the control group for hormone serum level and for lymphocyte subsets variation. Melatonin, TRH, TSH, GH, CD3, CD4, HLA-DR, CD20 and CD25 expressing cells presented circadian rhythmicity with acrophase during the night. Cortisol, CD8, CD8bright, CD8dim, CD16, TcRδ1 and δTcS1 presented circadian rhythmicity with acrophase in the morning/at noon. FT4, IGF-1 and IL-2 variation did not show circadian rhythmicity. In lung cancer patients cortisol, TRH, TSH and GH serum level and all the lymphocyte subsubsets variation (except for CD4) showed loss of circadian rhythmicity. MESOR of cortisol, TRH, GH, IL-2 and CD16 was increased, whereas MESOR of TSH, IGF-1, CD8, CD8bright, TcRδ1 and δTcS1 was decreased in cancer patients.

The majority of these approaches have focused on the promotion of neural progenitor cells and neurogenesis. However, it is now increasingly recognized that glial responses are critical for recovery in the entire neurovascular unit. In this study, we investigated the cellular effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) containing hydrogels on primary astrocyte cultures. Both EGF alone and EGF-hydrogel equally promoted astrocyte proliferation, but EGF-hydrogels further enhanced astrocyte activation, as evidenced by a significantly elevated Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene expression. Thereafter, conditioned media from astrocytes activated by EGF-hydrogel protected neurons against injury and promoted synaptic plasticity after oxygen–glucose deprivation. Taken together, these findings suggest that EGF-hydrogels can shift astrocytes into neuro-supportive phenotypes. Consistent with this idea, quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) demonstrated that EGF-hydrogels shifted astrocytes in part by downregulating potentially negative A1-like genes (Fbln5 and Rt1-S3) and upregulating potentially beneficial A2-like genes (Clcf1, Tgm1, and Ptgs2). Further studies are warranted to explore the idea of using biomaterials to modify astrocyte behavior and thus indirectly augment neuroprotection and neuroplasticity in the context of stem cell and growth factor therapies for the CNS.

Since neuro-psychiatric impairment has been reported in humans and mice exposed prenatally to a variety of maternal autoantibodies including anti-Ro/La, this study was initiated to evaluate the potential neurotoxic effects of these specific autoantibodies and the overall frequency of autoimmune diseases, general health, and somatic growth of children with neonatal lupus and their unaffected siblings. In addition to the general health questionnaires maintained on family members enrolled in the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus (RRNL), specific questionnaires related to neuro-psychiatric development were sent to all mothers whose children (both affected and unaffected) were older than 5 years of age. Controls consisted of healthy friends. Of 121 anti-Ro exposed children meeting the inclusion criteria, information was returned on 104 (33 cardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus, 20 rash, and 51 unaffected siblings) and 22 of the friend controls. The mean age of all of the children was 14.5 years (range 5—39). In total, 42 (40%) of the 104 anti-Ro exposed children were reported to have a neuro-psychiatric disorder, compared with 6 (27%) of the friend controls (p = 0.34). For 8 (24%) of the congenital heart block (CHB) children (6 boys, 2 girls) the mothers reported attention problems. Four, all boys, were on stimulants. Of the rash children, 4 (20%) (2 boys, 2 girls) had attention problems with one boy on Ritalin. Of the unaffected siblings, 9 (18%) (8 boys and 1 girl) had attention problems with 3 boys on stimulants. One (5%) of the control children (a girl) had attention problems, not requiring therapy. There was no statistical difference in attention problems between the groups (p = 0.120). Behavioral problems were present in all groups with no statistical differences noted. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, developmental delays, learning, hearing, and speech problems were not significantly different between groups. In the CHB children, one boy has nephrotic syndrome and one girl has psoriasis. In the rash children, one girl has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In the unaffected group there are five children with autoimmune diseases, two with inflammatory bowel diseases (one boy and one girl), one boy has a spondyloarthropathy, one girl has alopecia areata and one young woman has Antiphospholipid syndrome. In the control group one boy has Henoch Schonlein purpura. There were four cases of hypothyroidism, possibly secondary to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, three in boys with CHB and one in a girl with rash. None of the unaffected siblings or controls had hypothyroidism. Parental reporting of neuro-psychiatric abnormalities was high in anti-Ro exposed children regardless of the neonatal lupus manifestation. However, medication use was limited and although the frequency of this reporting was greater than friend controls, it did not reach significance.

The stream flow time series is decomposed into multi-frequency time series by discrete wavelet transform using the Haar, Coiflet and Daubechies mother wavelets. The wavelet coefficients are then imposed as input data to the neuro-fuzzy model. Models are developed based on Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference system with the grid partitioning approach for initializing the fuzzy rule-based structure. Mean-square error and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient are chosen as the performance criteria. The results of the application show that the right selection of the inputs with high autocorrelation function improves the accuracy of forecasting. Comparing the performance of the hybrid WNF models with those of the original ANFIS models indicates that the hybrid WNF models produce significantly better results especially in longer-term forecasting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.163", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2737943535", "source": "openalex"}

{"id": "https://openalex.org/W13808466", "title": "Genetics in Neuro-Oncology", "text": "This review provides a framework for the neurosurgeon in understanding the increasingly important role of genetics in the study of nervous system tumors. The three tumors discussed (retinoblastoma, meningioma, and neurofibroma) are neither the most common nor the most clinically devastating tumors faced by neurosurgeons. Rather, the studies on these tumors are presented because of the important lessons each provides. Studies of retinoblastoma demonstrate the ability of a gene which is recessive at the cellular level to require a second mutation for tumorigenesis and therein to appear as a dominantly inherited disorder at the level of the organism. This \"multi-hit\" theory could easily be applied to other nervous system tumors which have both sporadic solitary tumors and familial multiple tumors. In this group we should include acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, paragangliomas (glomus and carotid body tumors), and the pituitary tumors (and others) associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. The limits of this review do not allow a separate discussion of the neurosurgical aspect of these lesions; for this, the reader is referred elsewhere (18, 19). Meningiomas are discussed because it appears that two separate lines of inquiry may eventually be related at a cellular level. These directions of study are the demonstration that a common karyotypic abnormality (monosomy 22) is associated with a female preponderance of meningiomas and the demonstration of sex hormone binding in meningiomas. Future studies should be aimed at showing an in vitro biologic response of these tumors to exogenously added hormones or to their blocking agents. Moreover, one would hope that this response would correlate with a specific chromosomal abnormality. It is possible that some portion of the DNA which has been deleted or altered in these tumors plays an essential role in the regulation of the sex steroid regulatory system. If this segment of the genome could be identified and studied in the meningioma, the findings could be important not only in the treatment of patients with this tumor but also in the treatment of tumors of other hormonally modulated tissues such as breast and uterus. Finally, neurofibromatosis was chosen as the most common of the phakomatoses and as one which can offer significant insights into many areas of neuro-oncology. The NF gene occurs in at least two forms (VRNF, BANF), and it can be associated with virtually all of the tumors known to neurosurgeons--gliomas, neurofibromas, schwannomas, and meningiomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neurosurgery/31.cn_suppl_1.417", "url": "https://openalex.org/W13808466", "source": "openalex"}

Such as the transportation sector faces many obstacles following the implementation and integration of different vehicular and environmental aspects worldwide. Traffic congestion is among the major issues in this regard which demands serious attention due to the rapid growth in the number of vehicles on the road. To address this overwhelming problem, in this article, a cloud-based intelligent road traffic congestion prediction model is proposed that is empowered with a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy approach. The aim of the study is to reduce the delay in the queues, the vehicles experience at different road junctions across the city. The proposed model also intended to help the automated traffic control systems by minimizing the congestion particularly in a smart city environment where observational data is obtained from various implanted Internet of Things (IoT) sensors across the road. After due preprocessing over the cloud server, the proposed approach makes use of this data by incorporating the neuro-fuzzy engine. Consequently, it possesses a high level of accuracy by means of intelligent decision making with minimum error rate. Simulation results reveal the accuracy of the proposed model as 98.72% during the validation phase in contrast to the highest accuracies achieved by state-of-the-art techniques in the literature such as 90.6%, 95.84%, 97.56% and 98.03%, respectively.

Electric mobility emerges as a viable and effective solution, offering cost-efficient means of transportation. However, the rise in fuel expenses, climate change, and unregulated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) have necessitated a transformative shift in the operation of smart grids. The exponential rise in EV charging requirements has the potential to adversely affect power grids, resulting in peak demand, grid overload, energy hub emissions, and possible infrastructure overburden. This study presents a predictive cost model that utilizes a hybrid search and rescue (SAR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) denoted as SAR-ANFIS approach. The model is designed to effectively model complex dynamic energy emission dispatch scenarios that are integrated with transient charging loads. These scenarios include peak, off-peak, electric power research institute (EPRI), and stochastic scenarios. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the cost of charging scenarios while also providing policymakers with a tool to create financial budgets for forthcoming electric vehicle loads. This is achieved through the use of a fuzzy model that has the ability to predict costs. The ANFIS exhibits robust predictive capabilities owing to its aptitude for acquiring and representing intricate non-linear associations between input and output variables. The incorporation of ANFIS into a SAR algorithm results in improved predictive capacity through the optimization of the learning process, enhancement of model accuracy, and facilitation of efficient parameter tuning. The integration of ANFIS and SAR algorithms enhances predictive accuracy and robustness by leveraging the former's adaptive and learning capabilities and the latter's global search and optimization capabilities. The model takes into account various charging strategies and dispatch constraints within an energy hub. The attainment of the 24-hour pricing scheme is achieved by solving a minimum-cost optimization problem, which serves as the initial training data for the development of the proposed model using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy approach. The proposed approach effectively coordinates the various charging behaviours of electric vehicles, including those identified by the EPRI, as well as stochastic, peak, and off-peak charging, at the system level. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including the facilitation of coordination among various charging scenarios for EVs and the creation of a cost prediction model that can assist policymakers in devising budgetary plans for future EV loads. One of the benefits of this technology is its capacity for autonomy, which enables vehicle owners to charge their electric vehicles in a cost-effective manner, regardless of the specific scenario they find themselves in. Furthermore, the suggested plan has the potential to mitigate the release of greenhouse gases from the power generation sector, thereby facilitating the establishment of a viable charging network that is environmentally sustainable. The present study examines the efficacy of the SAR-ANFIS approach and model on a standardized test system across a range of load profiles.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3303963", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4385731979", "source": "openalex"}

Data were collected prospectively or retrospectively in the European Academy of Neurology NEuro‐covid ReGistrY ((ENERGY). The outcome at discharge was measured using the modified Rankin Scale and defined as ‘stable/improved’ if the modified Rankin Scale score was equal to or lower than the pre‐morbid score, ‘worse’ if the score was higher than the pre‐morbid score. Status at 6 months was also recorded. Demographic and clinical variables were assessed as predictors of outcome at discharge and 6 months. Results From July 2020 to March 2021, 971 patients from 19 countries were included. 810 (83.4%) were hospitalized. 432 (53.3%) were discharged with worse functional status. Older age, stupor/coma, stroke and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were predictors of worse outcome at discharge. 132 (16.3%) died in hospital. Older age, cancer, cardiovascular complications, refractory shock, stupor/coma and ICU admission were associated with death. 262 were followed for 6 months.

With the approval of the Japanese Ophthalmology Society, a scientific session on neuro-ophthalmology took place in 1964 at the annual congress of Japan Clinical Ophthalmology. This session took place every year until 1973, when it was reorganized into the Society for the Study of Neuro-ophthalmology and 2-day annual meeting was begun under the leadership of Dr Satoshi Ishikawa (Fig. 1). In 1980, the organization was renamed the Japanese Neuro-ophthalmology Society (JNOS). A formal membership system in JNOS was created in 1984, and the official journal, the Japanese Journal of Neuro-ophthalmology (Shinkei Ganka), has been published quarterly since then. In 1985, in Hakone, Japan, JNOS hosted the sixth meeting of the International Neuro-ophthalmology Society (INOS), the 14th International Pupil Colloquium, and an international workshop on extraocular muscle proprioception. These meetings attracted more than 1,000 participants from 24 countries.FIG. 1: Professor Satoshi Ishikawa.The International Scholarship (now Tsutsui-Fujino Fund) was instituted in 1992 to provide travel expenses for Asian neuro-ophthalmologists and offer them a chance to attend the annual JNOS meeting. Since then, 20 recipients from 10 Asian countries have attended the meeting. The 1st Congress of the Asian Neuro-ophthalmology Society (ASNOS) was presided over by Dr Akio Tagbuchi, and it was held in Tokyo jointly with the 40th annual meeting of JNOS in October 2002. In 2006, about 400 neuro-ophthalmologists gathered in Tokyo for the 16th INOS meeting, 3rd ASNOS meeting, and 44th JNOS meeting. Notably, a program entitled “Walsh in Asia,” modeled after the annual Frank B. Walsh Symposium, was held for the first time. It is now a part of every ASNOS meeting. Currently, there are 964 members of JNOS, including 722 ophthalmologists, 59 neurologists, 57 orthoptists, 8 otolaryngologists, and 34 basic science researchers.

First, a VGPI speed controller is designed to replace the classical PI controller in a conventional direct torque controlled induction motor drive. Its simulated performances are then compared to those of a classical PI controller. Then, a direct torque neuro fuzzy control (DTNFC) for a voltage source PWM inverter fed induction motor drive is presented. This control scheme uses the stator flux amplitude and the electromagnetic torque errors through an adaptive NF inference system (ANFIS) to generate a voltage space vector (reference voltage) which is used by a space vector modulator to generate the inverter switching states. In this paper a modified ANFIS structure is proposed. This structure generates the desired reference voltage by acting on both the amplitude and the angle of its components. Simulation of the DTNFCinduction motor drive using VGPI for speed control shows promising results. The motor reaches the reference speed rapidly and without overshoot, load disturbances are rapidly rejected and variations of some of the motor parameters are fairly well dealt with.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2159518031", "source": "openalex"}

Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities.

For example, cocktails of cytotoxic agents, which were carefully designed based on mechanisms of action, dose, and scheduling considerations, have led to dramatic improvements in survival including cures for childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and several other complex cancers. Outcome for glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant CNS cancer, has been more modest, but nonetheless our current standard of care derives from confirmation that combination therapy surpasses single modality therapy. Immunotherapy has recently come of age for medical oncology with exciting therapeutic benefits achieved by several types of agents including vaccines, adoptive T cells, and immune checkpoint inhibitors against several types of cancers. Nonetheless, most benefits are relatively short, while others are durable but are limited to a minority of treated patients. Critical factors limiting efficacy of immunotherapeutics include insufficient immunogenicity and/or inadequate ability to overcome immunosuppressive factors exploited by tumors. The paradigm of rationally designed combinatorial regimens, originally established by cytotoxic therapy for oncology, may also prove relevant for immunotherapy. Realization of the true therapeutic potential of immunotherapy for medical oncology and neuro-oncology patients may require development of combinatorial regimens that optimize immunogenicity and target tumor adaptive immunosuppressive factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nov178", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2275185819", "source": "openalex"}

It is, therefore, expected that a model that can accept the distribution of a random variable, while this may involve some more computational complexity, would likely produce better results than the model using the average value. Artificial neural network (ANN) is a standard technique for solving complex stochastic problems. In this research, ANN and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been implemented for modeling and optimizing product distribution in a multi-echelon transshipment system. Two inputs parameters, product demand and unit cost of shipment, are considered nondeterministic in this problem. The solutions of ANFIS and ANN were compared to that of the classical transshipment model. The optimal total cost of distribution using the classical model within the period of investigation was 6,332,304.00. In the search for a better solution, an ANN model was trained, tested, and validated. This approach reduced the cost to 4,170,500.00. ANFIS approach reduced the cost to 4,053,661. This implies that 34% of the current operational cost was saved using the ANN model, while 36% was saved using the ANFIS model. This suggests that the result obtained from the ANFIS model also seems marginally better than that of the ANN. Also, the ANFIS model is capable of adjusting the values of input and output variables and parameters to obtain a more robust solution.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1847979018768421", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2802765905", "source": "openalex"}

Using extracellular microelectrode recording from frog neuro-muscular preparation the mechanisms of exogenous and endogenous CO action on evoked quantal acetyl-choline (Ach) release were studied. It was shown that CO application increases Ach-release in dose-dependent manner without changes in pre-synaptic Na+ and K+ currents. The effect of exogenous CO on Ach-release was decreased by prior application of guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ and prevented by application of a cyclic guanylate monophospate (cGMP) analog 8Br-cGMP. Pre-treatment of the preparation with adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL-12330A has completely abolished the effect of CO, whereas elevation of intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophospate (cAMP) mimicked and eliminated CO action. Application of cGMP-activated phosphodiestherase-2 inhibitor EHNA did not prevent CO action, whereas inhibition of cGMP-inhibited phosphodiestherase-3 by quazinone has partially blocked the effect of CO. Utilizing immuno-histochemical methods COproducing enzyme heme-oxygenase-2 (HO-2) was shown to be expressed in skeletal muscle fibers, mostly in subsarcolemmal region, karyolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Zn-protoporphirin-IX, the selective HO-2 blocker, has depressed Ach-release, suggesting the tonic activating effect of endogenous CO on pre-synaptic function. These results suggest that facilitatory effect of CO on Ach-release is mediated by elevation of intracellular cAMP level due to activation of adenylate cyclase and decrease of cAMP breakdown. As such, endogenous skeletal muscle-derived CO mediates tonic retrograde up-regulation of neuro-transmitter release at the frog neuro-muscular junction.

Herein, we utilized lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory Parkinson’s disease (PD) cell model to determine whether microglia and astrocytes are necessary targets for IL-10 neuroprotection. Primary ventral mesencephalic (VM) cultures with different composition of neurons, microglia and astrocytes were prepared. The cells were exposed to IL-10 (15, 50 or 150 ng/mL) 1 h prior to LPS (50 ng/mL) treatment. LPS induced dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neuronal loss in VM cultures, VM neuron-enriched cultures, and neuron-microglia co-cultures, but not in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. IL-10 reduced LPS-induced neuronal loss particularly in single VM neuron cultures. Pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2) were upregulated in both neuron-microglia and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures by LPS. In contrast, neurotrophic factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 or glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor) were downregulated in neuron-microglia co-cultures, but upregulated in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures by LPS. IL-10 reduced both the increase in production of the pro-inflammatory mediators and the decrease in production of the neurotrophic factors induced by LPS. These results suggest that astrocytes can balance LPS neurotoxicity by releasing more neurotrophic factors and that IL-10 exerts neuroprotective property by an extensive action including direct on neurons and indirect via inhibiting microglial activation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17010025", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2198776700", "source": "openalex"}

Both the VectorVision and the VectorVision2 neuro-navigation systems (BrainLab AG, Munich, Germany) were used. The reliability and accuracy of the neuro-navigation system, postoperative complications and the clinical usefulness of image-guidance were analyzed. The navigation system worked properly in all 51 neurosurgical cases. Exact planning of the approach and determination of the ideal trajectory were possible in all cases. The mean registration error of the system, given as a computer-calculated value, was 2.1 mm (0.4-3.1 mm). Postoperative clinical evaluations and imaging were performed on every patient in order to confirm the success of the surgical procedure. All patients recovered well and without any postoperative complications.

Using the specific GSK-3β inhibitor SB415286, we demonstrate that GSK-3β inhibition decreases the viability of Neuro-2A cells, as determined by cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival. Moreover, we show that GSK-3β inhibition induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, as determined by Annexin V staining and confirmed with DAPI staining.

First, based on the empirical eigenfunctions computed with Karhunen–Loève decomposition, singular perturbation theory is used to derive a reduced-order model of an ordinary differential equation that represents the dominant dynamics of the SDP. Second, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) approach is used for the suboptimal control design, and the thought of policy iteration (PI) is introduced for online learning of the solution of the HJB equation, and its convergence is established. Third, a neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the cost function in the PI procedure, and a NN weight tuning algorithm based on the gradient descent method is proposed. We prove that the developed online adaptive suboptimal neuro-controller can ensure that the original closed-loop PDE system is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded.

With repeated irregular stimulation sequences skin resistance responses from the same skin site varied only slightly between trials. Differences between response curves from two skin sites in the same subject or from different subjects were also small but significantly greater (P &lt; 0.01) than differences between responses to repeated stimulation in the same site.

When a change in the vehicle’s hydrodynamics occurs, the 2nd-SMC may no longer be able to compensate for the variations since its feedback gains are tuned for a different condition; thus, in order to preserve the desired performance, it is necessary to re-tune the feedback gains, which a cumbersome and time consuming task. To solve this, a viable choice is to implement a BP-NN control scheme along with the 2nd-SMC that adds or removes energy from the system according to the current condition it is in, in order to keep, or even improve, its performance. The effectiveness of the proposed compound controller was supported by experiments carried out on a mini-ROV.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s19132943", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2956048005", "source": "openalex"}

Advances in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the optic nerve head (ONH) has proven to be a cost effective, noninvasive, outpatient procedure that may help. At its core are tools that quantify the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL). The SD-OCT also provides a set of tools that may be qualitatively interpreted in the same way that we read an MRI. They include the transverse axial, en face, and circular tomogram. Our goal is to describe a practical office-based set of tools using SD-OCT in the diagnosis and monitoring of papilledema, optic disc edema, and pseudopapilledema. Evidence Acquisition: Searches on PubMed were performed using combinations of the following key words: OCT, papilledema, pseudopapilledema, optic disc drusen, retinal folds (RF), and choroidal folds (CF). Results: The principal elements of SD-OCT analysis of the ONH are the RNFL and GC-IPL thickness; however, these metrics have limitations when swelling is severe. Qualitative interpretation of the transverse axial SD-OCT aids in assessing peripapillary shape that may help distinguish papilledema from pseudopapilledema, evaluate atypical optic neuropathies, diagnose shunt failures, and identify outer RF and CF. There is a consensus that the SD-OCT is the most sensitive way of identifying buried optic disc drusen. En face SD-OCT is especially effective at detecting peripapillary wrinkles and outer retinal creases, both of which are common and distinctive signs of optic disc edema that rule out pseudopapilledema. Mechanically stressing the ONH in the adducted eye position, in patients with papilledema, may expose folds and peripapillary deformations that may not be evident in primary position. We also discuss how to optimize the acquisition and registration of SD-OCT images. Conclusions: The SD-OCT is not a substitute for a complete history and a careful examination. It is, however, a convenient ancillary test that aids in the diagnosis and management of papilledema, optic disc edema, and pseudopapilledema. It is particularly helpful in monitoring changes over the course of time and distinguishing low-grade papilledema from buried drusen. The application of the SD-OCT toolbox depends on optimizing the acquisition of images, understanding its limitations, recognizing common artifacts, and accurately interpreting images in the context of both history and clinical findings.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000001078", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3084034036", "source": "openalex"}

Determining the polarization state of light is required by many applications, spanning from remote sensing and material analysis to biology and microscopy. To achieve this goal, conventional methods necessitate cascading of multiple optical components and consequential measurements to estimate the Stokes parameters, rendering the entire optical system bulky, complex, and sensitive. Here a brand-new strategy is introduced for direct polarization readout based on dual-channel neuro-metasurfaces. Neuro-metasurfaces can independently manipulate two orthogonal linearly-polarized waves that can synthesize arbitrary polarization waves with a linear combination. By judiciously designing the output focus points, a unique polarization atlas is created that allows one-to-one correspondence from intensity ratio to polarization state. To implement this, polarization-sensitive metasurfaces are designed and the spatial layout is optimized using a diffractive neural network. The feasibility of this strategy is validated by numerical simulation and microwave experiments. These results pave a new avenue in realizing integrated and multifunctional detectors and demonstrate the potential of neuro-metasurfaces as an add-on for discomposing and composing spatial basis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202204699", "url": "https://openalex.org/W4311524807", "source": "openalex"}

Firstly, the PDS builds data clusters in joint input–output data space with appropriate constraints. The role of these constraints is to create reasonable data distribution in clusters. The ENFS then uses these clusters to perform the following tasks. Firstly, the fuzzy sets expressing characteristics of data clusters are established. The structure of the fuzzy sets is adjusted to be suitable for features of the data set. Secondly, an appropriate structure of neuro-fuzzy (NF) expressed by an optimal number of labeled data clusters and the fuzzy-set groups is determined.

In its typical application, known as off-line automatic design, the neural networks controlling the robots are optimized in simulation. It is understood that the so-called reality gap, the unavoidable differences between simulation and reality, typically causes neural network to be less effective on real robots than what is predicted by simulation. In this paper, we present an empirical study on the extent to which the reality gap impacts the most popular and advanced neuro-evolutionary methods for the off-line design of robot swarms. The results show that the neural networks produced by the methods under analysis performed well in simulation, but not in real-robot experiments. Further, the ranking that could be observed in simulation between the methods eventually disappeared. We find compelling evidence that real-robot experiments are needed to reliably assess the performance of neuro-evolutionary methods and that the robustness to the reality gap is the main issue to be addressed to advance the application of neuro-evolution to robot swarms.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24642-3", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3178918501", "source": "openalex"}

Results The mean total quantities of polyphenols and DAGs were 1.1 and 1.9 times lower in VOOs stored at 25 °C than in the initial samples, and the mean total quantities of polyphenols and DAGs were 1.3 and 2.26 times lower in VOOs stored at 37 °C than in the initial samples, respectively. In a single sample, α ‐tocopherol was reduced by between 0.52 and 0.91 times during storage, regardless of the storage temperature. The mean specific UV extinction coefficients (K 268 ) for VOO stored at 25 and 37 °C were reported as 0.15 (ranging between 0.06–0.39) and 0.13 (ranging between 0.06–0.35), respectively. The ANFIS model created a multi‐dimensional correlation function, which used compositional variables and environmental conditions to assess the quality of VOO. The ANFIS model, with a generalized bell‐shaped membership function and a hybrid learning algorithm (R 2 = 0.98; MSE = 0.0001), provided more precise predictions than other algorithms. Conclusion Minor constituents were found to be the most important factors influencing the preservation status and freshness of VOO during storage. Relative changes (increases and reductions) in DAGs were good indicators of oil oxidative stability.

Coordination between multiple on-ramps is ensured by the integration of a common input into all ramp controllers upstream of a bottleneck and a periodical update of the fuzzy control system in every 15 min. by a hybrid learning procedure. The objective of the online tuning process of the fuzzy parameters is to minimize the total time spent in the system.

Characteristics of initial brain MRI were studied in patients with different courses of neuro‐Behçet's disease. Results Initial MRI s of 58 patients (31 women) with a mean ± SD age of 38.9 ± 9.7 years were reviewed. Forty‐nine (84%) patients had parenchymal and nine (16%) had non‐parenchymal neuro‐Behçet's disease. Of those patients with parenchymal neuro‐Behçet's disease, 15 (31%) had monophasic, 13 (27%) polyphasic and 10 (20%) progressive courses; 11 (22%) had only headache attributed to Behçet's disease. The most common sites of involvement in patients with parenchymal neuro‐Behçet's disease were periventricular and superficial cerebral white matter, midbrain and pons, respectively. Of those with parenchymal involvement, 12 (24%) had extension of lesions, seven (14%) had contrast enhancement, 12 (24%) had black holes and five (10%) had brainstem atrophy.

The training algorithm is very efficient in the sense that it can bring the performance index of the network, such as the sum squared error (SSE), down to the desired error goal much faster than that the classical backpropagation algorithm (BPA). The proposed training algorithm is based on a slight modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm (LMA) which takes into account the modified error index extension of sum squared error as the new performance index of the network. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm uses the Jacobian matrix in order to approximate the Hessian matrix and that is the most important and difficult step in implementing this LMA. Therefore, a simple technique has been described to compute first the transpose of Jacobian matrix by comparing two equations and thereafter by further transposing the former one the actual Jacobian matrix is computed that is found to be robust against the modified error index extension. Furthermore, care has been taken to suppress or control the oscillation magnitude during the training of neuro-fuzzy network.

Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2).

An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based post-processing technique was used to match the power outputs of the regional climate model (RCM) with those obtained from reference data. The near-surface wind data obtained from an RCM were used to investigate climate change impacts on the wind power resources in the Caspian Sea. After converting near-surface wind speed to turbine hub-height speed and computation of wind power density, the results were investigated to reveal mean annual power, seasonal and monthly variability for 20 year historical (1981–2000) and future (2081–2100) periods. The results revealed that climate change does not notably affect the wind climate over the study area. However, a small decrease was projected in the future simulation, revealing a slight decrease in mean annual wind power in the future compared to historical simulations. Moreover, the results demonstrated strong variation in wind power in terms of temporal and spatial distribution, with winter and summer having the highest values. The results indicate that the middle and northern parts of the Caspian Sea have the highest values of wind power.

In that context, profiling DNA methylation, which is a stable and cell type-specific regulatory epigenetic mark of genome activity, offers a unique opportunity to characterize the molecular mechanisms underpinning brain pathology in situ. We examined DNA methylation patterns of neuronal nuclei isolated from post-mortem brain tissue to infer processes that occur in neurons of MS patients. We isolated subcortical neuronal nuclei from post-mortem white matter tissue of MS patients and non-neurological controls using flow cytometry. We examined bulk DNA methylation changes (total n = 29) and further disentangled true DNA methylation (5mC) from neuron-specific DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) (n = 17), using Illumina Infinium 450K arrays. We performed neuronal sub-type deconvolution using glutamate and GABA methylation profiles to further reduce neuronal sample heterogeneity. In total, we identified 2811 and 1534 significant (genome-wide adjusted P value < 0.05) differentially methylated and hydroxymethylated positions between MS patients and controls. We found striking hypo-5mC and hyper-5hmC changes occurring mainly within gene bodies, which correlated with reduced transcriptional activity, assessed using published RNAseq data from bulk brain tissue of MS patients and controls. Pathway analyses of the two cohorts implicated dysregulation of genes involved in axonal guidance and synaptic plasticity, with meta-analysis confirming CREB signalling as the most highly enriched pathway underlying these processes. We functionally investigated DNA methylation changes of CREB signalling-related genes by immunohistofluoresence of phosphorylated CREB in neurons from brain sections of a subcohort of MS patients and controls (n = 15). Notably, DNA methylation changes associated with a reduction of CREB activity in white matter neurons of MS patients compared to controls.

During the preliminary phase of geotechnical projects, rock TS can be determined through laboratory works, i.e., Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) test. However, this approach is often restricted by laborious and costly procedures. Hence, this study attempts to estimate the BTS values of rock by employing three non-destructive rock index tests. BTS predictive models were developed using 127 granitic rock samples. Since the simple regression analysis did not yield a meaningful result, the development of models that integrate multiple input parameters were considered to improve the prediction accuracy. The effects of non-destructive rock index tests were examined through the use of multiple linear regression (MLR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approaches. Different strategies and scenarios were implemented during modelling of MLR and ANFIS approaches, where the focus was to consider the most important parameters of these techniques. As a result, and according to background and behaviour of the ANFIS (or neuro-fuzzy) model, the predicted values obtained by this intelligent methodology are closer to the actual BTS compared to MLR which works based on linear statistical rules. For instance, in terms of system error and a-20 index, values of (0.84 and 1.20) and (0.96 and 0.80) were obtained for evaluation parts of ANFIS and MLR techniques, which revealed that the ANFIS model outperforms the MLR in forecasting BTS values. In addition, the same results were obtained through ranking systems by the authors. The neuro-fuzzy developed in this study is a strong technique in terms of prediction capacity and it can be used in the other rock-based projects for solving relevant problems.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910541", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3200639901", "source": "openalex"}

Maximum speed is a complex motor ability, which manifests itself in real sports situations and is an important factor in various sports disciplines. Efficiency of maximum running is defined with frequency and the length of stride. Both variables are mutually dependant; they also depend on the processes of central regulation of motor stereotype. From the biomechanical point of view, a running stride as a basic structural unit depends on eccentric-concentric muscular cycle of take-off action. Utilisation of elastic strength in muscular-tendon complex and pre-activation of the gastrocnemius muscle is highly important in this element. Maximum running is very limited hereditary motor ability with characteristic of reduced possibility for controlling movement. Cerebellum, co-activation of muscles in kinetic chain and the frequency of activation of motor units play important roles in controlling the activation of agonists and antagonists. The prime goal of training is to create an optimal model of motor stereotype in the zone of maximum speed.

Our goal was to examine variation in brain structure in FXS with topological data analysis (TDA), and to assess how such variation is associated with measures of IQ and autism‐related behaviors. To this end, we analyzed imaging and behavioral data from young boys ( n = 52; aged 1.57–4.15 years) diagnosed with FXS. Application of topological methods to structural MRI data revealed two large subgroups within the study population. Comparison of these subgroups showed significant between‐subgroup neuroanatomical differences similar to those previously reported to distinguish children with FXS from typically developing controls (e.g., enlarged caudate). In addition to neuroanatomy, the groups showed significant differences in IQ and autism severity scores. These results suggest that despite arising from a single gene mutation, FXS may encompass two biologically, and clinically separable phenotypes. In addition, these findings underscore the potential of TDA as a powerful tool in the search for biological phenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Although several models are currently available for path loss predictions, the adoption of these models requires a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. In this paper, a new path loss prediction model is developed based on an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for multi-transmitter radio propagation scenarios and applicable to the Very High Frequency (VHF) bands. Field measurements are performed along three driving routes used for testing within the urban environment in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, to obtain the strength values of radio signals received from three different transmitters. The transmitters propagate radio wave signals at 89.3 MHz, 103.5 MHz, and 203.25 MHz, respectively. A simple five-layer optimized ANFIS network structure is trained based on the back-propagation gradient descent algorithm so that given values of input variables (distance and frequency) are correctly mapped to corresponding path loss values. The adoption of the Pi membership function ensures better stability and faster convergence at minimum epoch. The developed ANFIS-based path loss model produced a low prediction error with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Standard Deviation Error (SDE), and correlation coefficient (R) values of 4.45 dB, 4.47 dB, and 0.92 respectively. When the ANFIS-based model was deployed for path loss predictions in a different but similar propagation scenario, it demonstrated a good generalization ability with RMSE, SDE, and R values of 4.46 dB, 4.49 dB, and 0.91, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed ANFIS-based path loss model offers desirable advantages in terms of simplicity, high prediction accuracy, and good generalization ability, all of them critical features for radio coverage estimation and interference feasibility studies during multi-transmitter radio network planning in the VHF bands.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2018.05.013", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2805244227", "source": "openalex"}

In the present work, we evaluated inflammatory and pro-oxidant soluble signature in non-syndromic ASD and age-matched typically developing (TD) control children. Methods We analyzed leukocyte gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and inflammation/oxidative-stress related molecules in 21 ASD and 20 TD children. Moreover, in another—comparable—group of non-syndromic ASD (N = 22) and TD (N = 21) children, we analyzed for the first time the protein expression of the four members of the antioxidant enzyme family of peroxiredoxins (Prx) in both erythrocyte membranes and in plasma. Results The gene expression of IL6 and of HSP70i, a stress protein, was increased in ASD children. Moreover, gene expression of many inflammatory cytokines and inflammation/oxidative stress-related proteins correlated with clinical features, and appeared to be linked by a complex network of inter-correlations involving the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor signaling pathway. In addition, when the study of inter-correlations within the expression pattern of these molecules was extended to include the healthy subjects, the intrinsic physiological relationships of the inflammatory/oxidative stress network emerged. Plasma levels of Prx2 and Prx5 were remarkably increased in ASD compared to healthy controls, while no significant differences were found in red cell Prx levels. Conclusions Previous findings reported elevated inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of ASD children, without clearly pointing to the presence of neuro-inflammation. On the other hand, the finding of microglia activation in autoptic specimens was clearly suggesting the presence of neuro-inflammation in ASD. Given the role of peroxiredoxins in the protection of brain cells against oxidative stress, the whole of our results, using peripheral data collected in living patients, support the involvement of neuro-inflammation in ASD, and generate a rational for neuro-inflammation as a possible therapeutic target and for plasma Prx5 as a novel indicator of ASD severity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-019-2076-z", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2978274833", "source": "openalex"}

The model learns to predict subsequent sensory inputs, generating both their means and their uncertainty levels in terms of variance (or inverse precision) by utilizing its multiple timescale property. This model was employed in robotics learning experiments in which one robot controlled by the S-MTRNN was required to interact with another robot under the condition of uncertainty about the other's behavior. The experimental results show that self-organized and sensory reflex behavior-based on probabilistic prediction-emerges when learning proceeds without a precise specification of initial conditions. In contrast, intentional proactive behavior with deterministic predictions emerges when precise initial conditions are available. The results also showed that, in situations where unanticipated behavior of the other robot was perceived, the behavioral context was revised adequately by adaptation of the internal neural dynamics to respond to sensory inputs during sensory reflex behavior generation. On the other hand, during intentional proactive behavior generation, an error regression scheme by which the internal neural activity was modified in the direction of minimizing prediction errors was needed for adequately revising the behavioral context. These results indicate that two different ways of treating uncertainty about perceptual events in learning, namely, probabilistic modeling and deterministic modeling, contribute to the development of different dynamic neuronal structures governing the two types of behavior generation schemes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2015.2492140", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2345211079", "source": "openalex"}

Bovine brain ganglioside mixture and the four major components (GM1, GDla, GDlb, GTlb) applied individually were all effective. By contrast, GM3 and GMl‐alcohol, a neutral derivative of GM1, provided little or no protection. Dichlorobenzamil an inhibitor of the Na + −Ca 2+ exchanger, tended to block the neurite stabilizing effect of gangliosides, suggesting that the mechanism might involve potentiation of this antiporter.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.490310205", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1983227243", "source": "openalex"}

The aversion to harm others can be either rooted in the outcomes of an action (utilitarianism) or reactions to the action itself (deontology). We speculated that the human moral judgments rely on the integration of neural computations of harm and visceral reactions. The present research examined whether utilitarian or deontological aspects of moral judgment are associated with cardiac vagal tone, a physiological proxy for neuro-visceral integration. We investigated the relationship between cardiac vagal tone and moral judgment by using a mix of moral dilemmas, mathematical modeling and psychophysiological measures. An index of bipolar deontology-utilitarianism was correlated with resting heart rate variability (HRV)—an index of cardiac vagal tone—such that more utilitarian judgments were associated with lower HRV. Follow-up analyses using process dissociation, which independently quantifies utilitarian and deontological moral inclinations, provided further evidence that utilitarian (but not deontological) judgments were associated with lower HRV. Our results suggest that the functional integration of neural and visceral systems during moral judgments can restrict outcome-based, utilitarian moral preferences.

These experiments also contribute to our understanding of neurological dysfunction, pathophysiological processes and potential mechanisms of therapy. Objectives: Systematic assessment of published evidence on urodynamics, advantages and limitations of different urodynamic measurements in mice, and consideration of potential implications for the clinical field. Methods: A search using specific search-terms for urodynamic studies and mice was conducted on PubMed (from inception to 1 July 2016). Results: We identified 55 studies examining or describing mouse neuro-urodynamics. We summarise reported features of mouse urodynamic function deriving from frequency-volume chart (FVC) measurements, voiding spot assays, filling cystometry and pressure-flow studies. Similarly, an influence of the diurnal cycle on voiding is observed in mice and should be considered when interpreting rodent urodynamic studies, especially FVC measurements and voiding spot assays. Anaesthesia, restraint conditions or filling rate influence mouse neuro-urodynamics. Mouse cystometric studies have observed intravesical pressure oscillations that accompany urine flow, attributed to high frequency opening and closing of the urethra. This characterisation is not seen in other species, except rats. In contrast to human clinical urodynamics, the terminology of these examinations has not been standardized although many rodent urodynamic studies have been described. Conclusion: Mice have many anatomical and physiological similarities to humans and they are generally cost effective, and allow investigation of the effects of ageing because of their short lifespan. There are some differences between mouse and human urodynamics. These must be considered when interpreting lower urinary tract function in mice, and translational value of murine disease models.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00049", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2586189773", "source": "openalex"}

Vemurafenib is an oral, selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of BRAF V600E kinase. The goal of this multi-center study conducted through the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in children &lt; 18 years with recurrent or progressive BRAF V600E mutant brain tumors. Results: Nineteen eligible patients were enrolled. Eleven patients had received three or more prior therapies. Data reported are from the start of treatment for the first patient (April 30 2014) through August 31 2019. The RP2D was defined as 550 mg/m 2 twice daily after DLT criteria adjustment for rash. Related grade &#x2265; 3 adverse events included secondary keratoacanthoma ( n = 1); rash ( n =16); and fever ( n = 5). Subjects received a median of 23 cycles (range 3&#x2013;63). Four patients remain on treatment. Centrally reviewed best radiographic responses included 1 complete response, 5 partial responses, and 13 stable disease. The steady-state area under the curve (AUC 0-&#x221E; median) was 604 mg*h/L (range 329&#x2013;1052). Methods: Vemurafenib was given starting at 550 mg/m 2 , twice daily which corresponds to the adult RP2D. Adverse events were graded using the NIH Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Central imaging review was performed. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed. Conclusions: Vemurafenib has promising anti-tumor activity in recurrent BRAF V600E-positive brain tumors with manageable toxicity.

This is because they can be updated on the fly in a single-pass sample-wise manner and are able to perform autonomous changes of the models on structural level in order to react onto process drifts. A wide variety of evolving (neuro-) fuzzy systems approaches have been proposed in order to handle data stream mining and modeling processes by dynamically updating the rule structure and antecedents. The current denominator in the update of the consequent (output weight) parameters is the usage of the recursive (fuzzily weighted) least squares estimator (R(FW) LS), as being applied in almost all E(N) FS approaches. In this paper, we propose and examine alternative variants for consequent parameter updates, namely multi-innovation RFWLS, recursive correntropy and especially recursive weighted total least squares (RWTLS). Multi-innovation RFWLS guarantees more stability in the update whenever structural changes (i.e. changes in the antecedents) in the E(N) FS are performed. This is because rule membership degrees are actualized on (a portion of) past samples and properly integrated in each update step. Recursive correntropy addresses the problematic of outliers by down-weighing the influence of higher errors in the parameter updates. Recursive weighted total least squares also takes into account a possible noise level in the input variables (and not solely in the target variable as done in RFWLS). The approaches are compared with standard RFWLS i.) on three data stream regression problems from practical applications, which are affected by noise levels and where one embeds a known drift, and ii.) on a time-series based forecasting problem. The results based on accumulated prediction error trends over time indicate that RFWLS can be largely outperformed by the proposed alternative variants, and this with even lower sensitivity on various data noise levels. So, the proposed variants could be worth of being further considered as promising and serious alternatives.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2020.09.026", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3087870029", "source": "openalex"}

The potential role of VIP in the regulation of human adrenal steroidogenesis was now investigated in human adrenal cells in primary culture. The primary cultures contained both, cortical and chromaffin cells which were found to be in close cellular contact as revealed by immunocytochemistry. VIP enhanced cortisol secretion from adrenal cells in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 10-7 M. VTP stimulated the release of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, androstenedione, and aldosterone significantly. The addition of propranolol, a ß-adrenergic antagonist, to the incubation medium attenuated VIP-induced corticosteroid secretion.

Patients with Parkinson's disease have an increased risk for cardiovascular complications and can have multiple comorbidities, including cognitive impairment, depression, and psychosis, which can deteriorate during isolation.4Helmich RC Bloem BR The impact of COVID-19 on Parkinson's disease: hidden sorrows and emerging opportunities.J Parkinsons Dis. 2020; 10: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar Also, many patients with cognitive impairment might not be able to follow infection prevention and control recommendations, thereby putting themselves and their caregivers at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, very little is known about potential interaction between various medications for chronic neurological diseases and drug treatment for COVID-19. Because the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system are largely unknown, estimating the neurological morbidity that might occur from the acute phase of the pandemic is difficult. Also, whether patients might have long-term neurological or cognitive sequelae, or whether pre-existing neurological disease might deteriorate (eg, patients with mild cognitive impairment might have little cognitive reserve and develop dementia early) is unknown. Effects of coronavirus in children seem less severe and often the virus is present but children are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic children might still harbour the virus, with so far unknown effects on their health status later in life, including brain development. Additionally, once a vaccine becomes available, careful monitoring across age groups and disease spectra will be required to identify adverse effects and any deterioration of signs and symptoms in patients with neurological diseases. Overall, understanding is needed of whether susceptible groups exist who are at increased risk of deterioration after SARS-CoV-2 infection, how to detect them by use of biomarkers, and whether treatment needs to be specifically targeted in case of neurological signs and symptoms. Systems for clinical surveillance, epidemiological and clinical research, and post-mortem studies will be needed to achieve this aim. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates close collaboration on a global scale, with a special emphasis on inclusion of colleagues and partner institutions from low-income and middle-income countries.

Full-Text PDF The neurological impact of COVID-19Since WHO declared COVID-19 as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" on January 30, 2020, neurologists' lives have changed in many ways. Now—almost 4 months later—the impact of COVID-19 on neurological services and patients is profound. COVID-19 and mandatory social distancing have forced neurology practices worldwide to dramatically reshape their delivery of care. Simultaneously, non-urgent surgical procedures and medical appointments have been cancelled to increase bed capacity and care for patients with the infection, while many neurologists have had to leave their clinics to help other physicians on the frontlines.

The parameters of a standard power system stabilizer are tuned using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems to achieve a certain damping ratio and settling time at all load points within a wide region of operation. The overall transfer function of the system is derived in terms of the power system stabilizer parameters. A genetic algorithm is used to minimize a multi-objective optimization function that forces the damping ratio and settling time of the system to desired values. The optimization process is separately conducted at selected operating points to yield power system stabilizer parameters that change with load variations. Results of genetic algorithm optimization are used to form a training dataset of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems agent, which could give the power system stabilizer parameters at any load within the specified region of operation. Results of power system stabilizer testing show that the desired performance indices could be fulfilled from light load to over load under both lagging and leading power factor conditions. System performance shows a remarkable improvement of dynamic stability by obtaining a well-damped time response.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15325000802388740", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1987556413", "source": "openalex"}

Segmentation has wide application in medical field. The main objective of image segmentation is to partition an image into mutually exclusive and exhausted regions such that each region of interest is spatially contiguous and the pixels within the region are homogeneous with respect to a predefined criterion. Widely used homogeneity criteria include values of intensity, texture, color, range, surface normal and surface curvatures. During the past, many researchers in the field of medical imaging and soft computing have made significant survey in the field of image segmentation. This paper aims to develop an improved method of segmentation using FuzzyNeuro logic to detect various tissues like white matter, gray matter; cerebral spinal fluid and tumor for a given magnetic resonance image data set. Generally magnetic resonance images always contain a significant amount of noise caused by operator performance, equipment, and the environment, which can lead to serious inaccuracies. So segmentation of such medical images is a challenging problem in the field of image analysis. Several diagnostics are based on proper segmentation of the digitized image. Segmentation of medical images is needed for applications involving estimation of the boundary of an object, classification of tissue abnormalities, shape analysis, contour detection. In particular Fuzzy-Neuro logic segmentation algorithm is used to provide satisfactory results compared to K-means, Fuzzy C-Means, Neural Network and Fuzzy logic.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/iccrd.2010.155", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2163798028", "source": "openalex"}

The objective of this paper is to investigate the ability of a NN called the 'Neuro–Vehicle' to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a two–axle vehicle. The input to the vehicle system is the forward speed and the steering angle, and the output responses are the yaw rate, the lateral acceleration, and the lateral load transfer ratios. To enhance the NN performance, current and past status of the Neuro–Vehicle are fed back to the network. A back–propagation learning rule with adaptive learning and momentum was used to teach the NN. The training data were produced using a simplified non–linear vehicle model with a quasistatic load transfer assumption. These data pertain to three manoeuvres each carried out at five different speeds. The performance of the Neuro–Vehicle shows that neural networks are fast and relatively accurate in predicting the nonlinear behaviour of a vehicle. Since the approach is fairly new and in its early stage, some problems associated with this study will be discussed and attempts to solve them will appear in future work. The work described in this paper is the first stage of a long–term project aimed at developing an Intelligent Rollover and Stability Enhancement Warning System.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1504/ijvd.1996.061978", "url": "https://openalex.org/W321338291", "source": "openalex"}

This is the first paper, which tests the performance of EEGNet on data obtained from 10 hemiparetic stroke patients while performing left and right motor imagery tasks. Results obtained on implementing EEGNet have been promising and it has comparably good performance as from expensive feature engineering-based approaches for both within-subject and cross-subject classification.

This study sought to unravel stress-induced variations in expression of human microRNAs sampled in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and further assess their relationship with neuronal and psychological indices. We obtained blood samples from 49 healthy male participants before and three hours after performing a social stress task, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis was conducted for the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a key area of stress regulation. Out of hundreds of microRNAs, a specific increase was identified in microRNA-29c (miR-29c) expression, corresponding with both the experience of sustained stress via self-reports, and alterations in vmPFC functional connectivity. Explicitly, miR-29c expression levels corresponded with both increased connectivity of the vmPFC with the anterior insula (aIns), and decreased connectivity of the vmPFC with the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Our findings further revealed that miR-29c mediates an indirect path linking enhanced vmPFC-aIns connectivity during stress with subsequent experiences of sustained stress. The correlative patterns of miR-29c expression and vmPFC FC, along with the mediating effects on subjective stress sustainment and the presumed localization of miR-29c in astrocytes, together point to an intriguing assumption; miR-29c may serve as a biomarker in the blood for stress-induced functional neural alterations reflecting regulatory processes.

All patients had ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 25% and 35%; per protocol, they were stratified according to concomitant use of ACE inhibitors. After baseline measurements at rest, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-MIBI, plasma neuro-hormones (norepinephrine, renin, arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide) and echocardiography, the patients were randomized to nisoldipine (core coat tablet, 20 mg once daily; n = 16) or placebo (n = 16). Measurements were repeated after 8 weeks. SPECT data were analysed qualitatively (visual comparison by blinded observer) and quantitatively to derive an index of hypoperfusion representing the percentage of the left ventricular mass with Tc-MIBI activity below normal. At baseline, all patients had left ventricular areas with reduced Tc-MIBI uptake and 29 patients also had increases in plasma neuro-hormones. With nisoldipine, the extent of hypoperfusion (quantitative analysis) was reduced in 8/14 patients vs only 2/14 patients with placebo (P = 0.046, 2-tailed test). The benefit of nisoldipine was similar in patients with or without ACE inhibitor therapy and was also confirmed by the visual analysis of the data. Further, none of the neuro-hormones examined was significantly modified by nisoldipine. Thus, chronically underperfused areas are present at rest in patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, and nisoldipine significantly improved Tc-MIBI uptake in these areas without evidence of detrimental changes in plasma neuro-hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a060616", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1949367389", "source": "openalex"}

The larger training data sets are a big boon to these systems as the performance gets better and better with the increase in data sets. The higher training data set although drastically increases the training time. Also it is possible that the artificial neural network does not train at all with the large data sets. This paper proposes a novel concept of dealing with these scenarios. The paper proposes the use of a hierarchical model where the training data set is first clustered into clusters. Each cluster has its own neural network. When an unknown input is given to the system, the system first finds out the cluster to which the input belongs. Then the input is processed by the individual neural network of that system.

Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5- and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design.IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into nerve cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-, cholesterol-, and pH-dependent manner that requires Rab5 and Rab7.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01083-17", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2760426634", "source": "openalex"}

Unsignalized intersections are controlled with the help of stop or yield sign in developing countries, but in India, signs do not work and thus they are treated as uncontrolled intersections by the road users. The processing of vehicles at unsignized intersection is complex and very interactive, whereby each driver makes individual decisions about when, where, and how to complete the required maneuver. Such intersections cannot be analyzed based on the findings of the unsignalized intersections in other countries (HCM 2000, for example). This paper systematically analyzes the behavior of right turning two-wheelers at uncontrolled intersections. Data on gap acceptance behavior is obtained with Video. The various parameters that are collected include vehicle arrival rate, gap accepted/rejected, time to cross the intersection, driver's gender and approximate age, type of conflicting vehicle, and occupancy of two-wheelers. The critical lag and gap by Raff method for two-wheelers is found to be 2.51 and 2.47 seconds respectively. This value is smaller than the critical gaps reported in other studies. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS) has been developed that estimates the possibility of accepting a given lag/gap based on various drivers and traffic attributes. Eight different combinations of attributes are considered. For model calibration, 80% of the extracted data is used and remaining is used for model validation. The percent correct prediction by all models for validation data is found to be significant.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.08.101", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2068871332", "source": "openalex"}

The aim of this research is to reproduce intended movements performed by humans taking into account as many features as possible from the biological point of view. This paper fills the gap between current spike silicon sensors and robotic actuators by applying a spike processing strategy to the data flows in real time. The architecture is divided into layers: the retina, visual information processing, the trajectory generator layer which uses a neuroinspired algorithm (SVITE) that can be replicated into as many times as DoF the robot has; and finally the actuation layer to supply the spikes to the robot (using PFM). All the layers do their tasks in a spike-processing mode, and they communicate each other through the neuro-inspired AER protocol. The open-loop controller is implemented on FPGA using AER interfaces developed by RTC Lab. Experimental results reveal the viability of this spike-based controller. Two main advantages are: low hardware resources (2% of a Xilinx Spartan 6) and power requirements (3.4 W) to control a robot with a high number of DoF (up to 100 for a Xilinx Spartan 6). It also evidences the suitable use of AER as a communication protocol between processing and actuation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s131115805", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2001070797", "source": "openalex"}

The standard Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation requires several meteorological inputs for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo) that are not usually available in most of the stations. This paper investigates the potential of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy computing technique (ANFIS) for daily reference evapotranspiration modeling under arid conditions from limited weather data. The gamma test technique is applied to find the best input combination and number of sufficient data points for the model calibration. The training and testing data sets are chosen on the basis of the K-fold method of cross-validation to obtain the optimal classifier. The estimates of ANFIS models are compared with calibrated FAO-56 reduced-set PM ETo approaches and some calibrated empirical ETo equations such as Hargreaves, Priestley-Tailor, Makkink, and Blaney-Criddle equations. The FAO-56 full-set PM is adopted as the reference ETo equation, and it is applied to calibrate other ETo equations and ANFIS models. The comparison results indicate that when similar meteorological inputs are used, the ANFIS models performed better than all the methods pursued. This fact strongly suggests using ANFIS technique as an accurate ETo estimator method even in the absence of complete weather data. The minimum required data to construct a good ANFIS model under arid conditions are the minimum and maximum air temperatures and wind speed data.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)ir.1943-4774.0000343", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2144758276", "source": "openalex"}

The NEURO-TTR patient population was diverse in age, disease severity, TTR mutation, and organ involvement. Twenty-seven different TTR mutations were present, with Val30Met being the most common (52%). One third of patients reported early onset disease (before age 50) and the average duration of neuropathy symptoms was 5.3 years. Symptoms affected multiple organs and systems, with nearly 70% of patients exhibiting broad involvement of weakness, sensory loss, and autonomic disturbance. Over 60% of patients had cardiomyopathy, with highest prevalence in the United States (72%) and lowest in South America/Australasia (33%).

In the current study, we investigated the neuro-protective effects of aloperine against cytotoxicity in mouse Neuro2a (N2a) cells transfected with Swedish amyloid precursor protein (Swe-APP) mutant and presenilin 1 exon 9 deletion mutant (N2a/Swe.D9). We found that aloperine ameliorated oxidative stress patterns in N2a/Swe.D9 cells by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, aloperine treatment led to elevated generation of ATP and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in N2a/Swe.D9 cells.

Artificial intelligence models have shown promise in improving construction scheduling accuracy by incorporating historical data, site-specific conditions, and other variables that traditional scheduling methods may not consider. In this research study, application of soft-computing techniques to evaluate construction schedule and control of project activities in order to achieve optimal performance in execution of building projects were carried out. Artificial neural network and neuro-fuzzy models were developed using data extracted from a residential two-storey reinforced concrete framed-structure construction schedule and project execution documents. The evaluation of project performance indicators in earned value analysis from 0 to 100% progress at 5% increment with a total of seventeen tasks were carried out using Microsoft Project software and data obtained from the computation were utilized for model development. Using input-output and curve-fitting (nftool) function in MATLAB, a 6-10-1 two-layer feed-forward network with tansig activation-function (AF) for the hidden neurons and linear AF output neurons was generated with Levenberg-Marquardt (Trainlm) training algorithm.

Key Results Patients with DS presented decreased spontaneous rhythmic contractions ( SRC ) that were significantly enhanced after incubation with L‐ NNA (1 mM) and TTX (1 μ M), and unaffected by the P2Y 1 antagonist MRS 2500 (1 μ M). Stimulation on enteric motor neurons caused an increased duration of the latency of OFF ‐contractions in DS group ( p &lt; 0.001), antagonized by L‐ NNA and slightly affected by MRS 2500 (1 μ M). No differences in the IC 50 between controls and DS patients were observed on inhibition of SRC for the NO ‐donor sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) and the preferential P2Y agonist ADP β S.

However, their pathogenesis remains unclear. The current study examined the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods CSF cytokines were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CSF was obtained from 17 patients with acute NB, 19 patients with chronic progressive NB and 20 patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases, including cerebrovascular disease, cervical spondylosis and degenerative diseases. Results CSF total cell counts and polymorph nuclear leukocyte counts were significantly lower in the patients with chronic progressive NB than in those with acute NB. The CSF levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were markedly elevated in the NB patients compared with those measured in the control patients. There were no significant differences in the CSF levels of IL-6 and IL-8 between the patients with acute NB and those with chronic progressive NB. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the CSF levels of IL-1β and TNF-α among the control, acute NB and chronic progressive NB patients. Consistently, the CSF levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly decreased following successful treatment in both acute NB and chronic progressive NB patients, whereas the CSF levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were not changed significantly. Of note, the CSF levels of IL-6 were significantly correlated with the CSF levels of IL-8 in the patients with acute NB (r =0.7647, p =0.0003) but not in the patients with chronic progressive NB (r =0.1343, p =0.5835).

The operator plans the scan volumes (off-centre, angulation, field-of-view) with respect to patient anatomy in 'scout' images. Often multiple plans are required within a single examination, distracting attention from the patient waiting in the scanner. A novel and robust method is described for automated planning of neurological MRI scans, capable of handling strong shape deviations from healthy anatomy. The expert knowledge required to position scan geometries is learned from previous example plans, allowing site-specific styles to be readily taken into account. The proposed method first fits an anatomical model to the scout data, and then new scan geometries are positioned with respect to extracted landmarks. The accuracy of landmark extraction was measured to be comparable to the inter-observer variability, and automated plans are shown to be highly consistent with those created by expert operators using clinical data. The results of the presented evaluation demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach, which has the potential to significantly improve clinical workflow.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1117/12.652160", "url": "https://openalex.org/W1975532695", "source": "openalex"}

The differentiation of Neuro-2a cells by GM3Ab was accompanied by increased levels of intracellular serotonin and amino acid neurotransmitters viz. aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, glycine and taurine. Further study indicated that the increase in the serotonin level was not due to a higher rate of serotonin synthesis but rather to a higher rate of active transport of serotonin from the medium. Studies on the cell surface gangliosides revealed that unlike the proliferating cells, the GM3Ab-mediated differentiated cells contained higher gangliosides in addition to GM3 and GM2 gangliosides. Analysis of total cellular proteins indicated the appearance of a 25 kDa protein, pI 5.4, in the GM3Ab-treated cells—a small amount of this protein was observed in dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP)-treated cells, however, the protein was totally absent in the 5-bromo-2′-de-oxyuridine (BrdU)-treated cells. Investigation of the mode of action of GM3Ab indicated that the cellular differentiation was due to increased cAMP accumulation resulting from an increase in the adenylate cyclase activity. Further studies with different agents affecting protein kinase C (PKC) activity and direct assay of PKC ruled out the possibility that GM3Ab mediated its effect via PKC. This GM3Ab-induced differentiation could be inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H8, but could not be inhibited by sphingosine, an inhibitor of PKC. Pertussis toxin could mimic the effect of GM3Ab, suggesting that GM3Ab caused the elevation in the adenylate cyclase activity by reducing the Gi-protein inhibition of the adenylate cyclase. The data suggests that GM3Ab, after interaction with cell surface GM3, elevated intracellular cAMP level by withdrawing the inhibitory effect of some undefined factor(s) present in culture medium which normally keeps adenylate cyclase activity low through activation of Gi-protein.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-8993(10)80007-1", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2033241131", "source": "openalex"}

Healthy volunteers (10 males, 11 females, mean age of 27.6 ± 5.8 yrs) were tested during each of 6 testing sessions. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) of the right quadriceps femoris (RQF) recorded by a computerized dynamometer. Electrical stimulation delivered through two surface electrodes and stimulation amplitude increased until the subject indicated to stop. After a 1 min rest the amplitude increased again to the same phase charge level, and the electrically induced contraction (EIC) was recorded by the dynamometer. Measurements of stimulation amplitude were repeated in each of 10 stimulation bouts per session. Measurements of EIC were repeated in session six. Statistical analyses included Multivariate ANOVAs, and Newman-Kuel's post-hoc tests (p < 0.01). Mean values of phase charge increased from session 1 to 6 for all subjects. Males tolerated significantly higher phase charge. The mean %MVIC torque generated by female subjects was initially only 11.2 ± 21.6% but reached 42.9 ± 25.4% at the end of the 6th session. Males' %MVIC torque values were significantly higher reaching 49.0 ± 41.6% and 73.5 ± 18.7% in the first and last trials respectively. Using the criterion that electrically induced contractions must be at least 25% of MVIC to be considered clinically useful, 36% of females were below this threshold at the end of the last session. In contrast, all males exceeded the 25% MVIC threshold at the end of the study. Most healthy subjects can be conditioned to electrical stimulation of the quadriceps, but depending on the criteria of therapeutic value and gender, some males and even more females may not reach the desired stimulation goal in 6 sessions. Females may require more conditioning sessions to reach contraction levels of therapeutic benefits. The reason(s) for the confounding factor of gender remains unknown. Key PointsNeuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can strengthen skeletal musclesTolerance to NMES improves within 6 sessionsConditioning is a key to eliciting stronger contraction and to increasing the number of subjects that can benefit from NMESHealthy males can tolerate higher stimulusintensity and higher electrically induced quadriceps femoris contraction.", "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2124875670", "source": "openalex"}

In our approach, we used a Spatio-Temporal LSTM to generate the weights of the fuzzy-logic model, and then demonstrate through experiments that indexing of the action intensity is possible. We analyzed the integrated model by applying it to videos of human actions with different action intensities and were able to achieve an accuracy of 89.16% on our intensity indexing generated dataset.

These agents work by enhancing autologous antitumor immune responses. Immune-related ophthalmologic complications have been reported in association with checkpoint inhibitor use but remain incompletely characterized. This study seeks to investigate and further characterize the neuro-ophthalmic and ocular complications of immune checkpoint blockade treatment.A survey was distributed through the secure electronic data collection tool REDCap to neuro-ophthalmology specialists in the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society listserv. The study received human subjects approval through the University of California at Los Angeles Institutional Review Board. The survey identified patients sent for neuro-ophthalmic consultation while receiving one or more of a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or cemiplimab); PD-L1 inhibitor (atezolizumab, avelumab, or durvalumab); or the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab. Thirty-one patients from 14 institutions were identified. Patient demographics, neuro-ophthalmic diagnosis, diagnostic testing, severity, treatment, clinical response, checkpoint inhibitor drug used, and cancer diagnosis was obtained.The checkpoint inhibitors used in these patients included pembrolizumab (12/31), nivolumab (6/31), combined ipilimumab with nivolumab (7/31, one of whom also received pembrolizumab during their course of treatment), durvalumab (3/31), ipilimumab (2/31), and cemiplimab (1/31).

Based on rationale which emphasizes the importance of the quality of movement coordination in the motor relearning process, a robot controller was developed with the aim of reproducing the individual corrections imposed by a physical therapist on a hemiparetic patient during pointing movements. The approach exploits a description of the joint synergies using principal component analysis (PCA) on joint velocities. This mathematical tool is used both to characterize the patient's movements, with or without the assistance of a physical therapist, and to program the exoskeleton during active-assisted exercises. An original feature of this controller is that the hand trajectory is not imposed on the patient: only the coordination law is modified. Experiments with hemiparetic patients using this new active-assisted mode were conducted. Obtained results demonstrate that the desired inter-joint coordination was successfully enforced, without significantly modifying the trajectory of the end point.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2012.2190522", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2055272609", "source": "openalex"}

However, these techniques have high costs associated with both installation and maintenance. One possible solution to complement these techniques is the application of low-cost air quality sensors (LAQSs), which have the potential to give higher spatial and temporal data of gas pollutants with high precision and accuracy. In this paper, we present DiracSense, a custom-made LAQS that monitors the gas pollutants ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The aim of this study is to investigate its performance based on laboratory calibration and field experiments. Several model calibrations were developed to improve the accuracy and performance of the LAQS. Laboratory calibrations were carried out to determine the zero offset and sensitivities of each sensor. The results showed that the sensor performed with a highly linear correlation with the reference instrument with a response-time range from 0.5 to 1.7 min. The performance of several calibration models including a calibrated simple equation and supervised learning algorithms (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system or ANFIS and the multilayer feed-forward perceptron or MLP) were compared. The field calibration focused on O3 measurements due to the lack of a reference instrument for CO and NO2. Combinations of inputs were evaluated during the development of the supervised learning algorithm. The validation results demonstrated that the ANFIS model with four inputs (WE OX, AE OX, T, and NO2) had the lowest error in terms of statistical performance and the highest correlation coefficients with respect to the reference instrument (0.8 &lt; r &lt; 0.95). These results suggest that the ANFIS model is promising as a calibration tool since it has the capability to improve the accuracy and performance of the low-cost electrochemical sensor.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s18124380", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2903937822", "source": "openalex"}

Conventional models generally used for evaporation prediction have a number of drawbacks as they are based on several assumptions. A novel approach called the co-active neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) is proposed in this study for the modeling of evaporation from meteorological variables. CANFIS provides a center-weighted set rather than global weight sets for predictor–predictand relationship mapping and thus it can provide a higher prediction accuracy. In the present study, adjustments are made in the back-propagation algorithm of CANFIS for automatic updating of membership rules and further enhancement of its prediction accuracy. The predictive ability of the CANFIS model is validated with three well-established artificial intelligence (AI) models. Different statistical metrics are computed to investigate the prediction efficacy. The results reveal higher accuracy of the CANFIS model in predicting evaporation compared to the other AI models. CANFIS is found to be capable of modeling evaporation from mean temperature and relative humidity only, with a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.93, which is much higher than that of the other models. Furthermore, CANFIS improves the prediction accuracy by 9.2–55.4% compared to the other AI models.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/19942060.2019.1647879", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2967948338", "source": "openalex"}

Disturbances of the fetal brain development have implications for diseases in later postnatal life. In that context, the fetal functional brain age can be altered. Universal principles of developmental biology applied to patterns of autonomic control may allow a functional age assessment. The work aims at the development of a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) based on heart rate patterns. We analysed n = 113 recordings in quiet sleep, n = 286 in active sleep, and n = 29 in active awakeness from normals. We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4–40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet sleep (n = 113, 63 females) and active sleep (n = 286, 145 females) state by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. According to universal system developmental principles, we included indices that address increasing fluctuation range, increasing complexity, and pattern formation (skewness, power spectral ratio VLF/LF, pNN5). The resulting models constituted fABAS. fABAS explained 66/63% (coefficient of determination R2 of training and validation set) of the variance by age in quiet, while 51/50% in active sleep. By means of a logistic regression model using fluctuation range and fetal age, quiet and active sleep were automatically reclassified (94.3/93.1% correct classifications). We did not find relevant gender differences. We conclude that functional brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from autonomic control patterns. fABAS reflect normal complex functional brain maturation. The presented normative data are supplemented by an explorative study of 19 fetuses compromised by intrauterine growth restriction. We observed a shift in the state distribution towards active awakeness. The lower WGA dependent fABAS values found in active sleep may reflect alterations in the universal developmental indices, namely fluctuation amplitude, complexity, and pattern formation that constitute fABAS.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074431", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2078692756", "source": "openalex"}

The inappropriate immune response further triggers the cascade of inflammatory changes resulting in precipitation of symptoms and hampers quality of life (QOL). The underlying psycho-somatic component of the disease requires a holistic approach to its treatment dimension rather than the use of pharmacotherapy. The applicability of mind-body interventions has become essential in today's fast-paced life. Yoga, a mind-body technique, alters the mind's capacity to facilitate systemic functioning at multiple organ system levels. Hence, we conducted this study to evaluate the impact of 8 weeks of a yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) on psycho-neuro-immune markers, gene expression patterns, and QOL in RA patients on routine medical therapy. A total of 66 patients were randomized into two groups: yoga group or non-yoga group and were assessed for a panel of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17A, TNF-α, and TGF-β), mind-body communicative markers (BDNF, DHEAS, β-endorphin, and sirtuin) and transcript levels of various genes (IL-6, TNF-α, NFKB1, TGF-β, and CTLA4).

Yoga group observed significant improvements in the levels of markers, which influenced the psycho-neuro-immune axis (p < 0.001) with an estimated effect size from small to medium range. In the yoga group, there was a significant reduction in DAS28-ESR (p < 0.001) and improvement seen in the physical health, psychological, social relationships domains (p < 0.001) of QOL, except environmental (p > 0.05). The yoga group showed downregulation of IL-6, TNF-α, and CTLA4 and upregulation of TGF-β. These results suggest that a decrease in disease activity after yoga practice is associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokines, the elevation of mind-body communicative markers, and normalization of various transcript levels, which improved QOL. Thus the adoption of YBLI improves clinical outcome in RA, and decreases systemic inflammation by its beneficial effects on psycho-neuro-immune axis and normalization of dysregulated transcripts. Thus YBLI may be used for RA patients as an adjunctive therapy.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02259", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3081591844", "source": "openalex"}

An extensive body of research on CSMA has long been made not only in the context of practical protocols, but also in a distributed way of optimal MAC scheduling. However, the current state-of-the-art CSMA (or its extensions) still suffers from poor performance, especially in multi-hop scenarios, and often requires patch-based solutions rather than a universal solution. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which adopts an experience-driven approach and train CSMA-based wireless MAC by using deep reinforcement learning. We name our protocol, Neuro-DCF. Two key challenges are: (i) a stable training method for distributed execution and (ii) a unified training method for embracing various interference patterns and configurations. For (i), we adopt a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, and for (ii) we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) based training structure. We provide extensive simulation results which demonstrate that our protocol, Neuro-DCF, significantly outperforms 802.11 DCF and O-DCF, a recent theory-based MAC protocol, especially in terms of improving delay performance while preserving optimal utility. We believe our multi-agent reinforcement learning based approach would get broad interest from other learning-based network controllers in different layers that require distributed operation.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3466772.3467043", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3176840102", "source": "openalex"}

Altoida’s Digital Neuro Signature (DNS), a longitudinal cognitive test consisting of two active digital biomarker metrics, alleviates these limitations. By comparison to conventional neuropsychological assessments, DNS results in faster evaluations (10 min vs 45–120 min), and generates higher test-retest in intraindividual assessment, as well as higher accuracy at detecting abnormal cognition. This study comparatively evaluates the performance of Altoida’s DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments in intraindividual assessments of cognition and function by means of two semi-naturalistic observational experiments with 525 participants in laboratory and clinical settings. The results show that DNS is consistently more sensitive than conventional neuropsychological assessments at capturing longitudinal individual-level change, both with respect to intraindividual variability and dispersion (intraindividual variability across multiple tests), across three participant groups: healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. Dispersion differences between DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments were more pronounced with more advanced disease stages, and DNS-intraindividual variability was able to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. These findings are instrumental for patient monitoring and management, remote clinical trial assessment, and timely interventions, and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of Alzheimer’s disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00470-z", "url": "https://openalex.org/W3176980366", "source": "openalex"}

Reversing a negative translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG) by modulating cerebral blood flow, decreasing intracranial pressure, or increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) has been proposed as potential intervention for spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS).To examine whether exercise (resistance, moderate-intensity aerobic, and high-intensity aerobic) or artificially increasing IOP is associated with modulated cerebro-ocular hemodynamic and pressure changes during head-down tilt (HDT), an analogue of spaceflight, in healthy adults.A single-center investigation was conducted at Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, in 20 healthy men.On 3 separate days, participants rested supine, were tilted to -15° HDT, and then completed 1 of 3 experimental exercise conditions (moderate-intensity aerobic, resistance, or high-intensity interval aerobic). A subset of 10 participants wore swimming goggles on all days.Applanation rebound tonometry was used to noninvasively assess IOP, and compression sonography was used to assess internal jugular venous pressure (IJVP). Estimated TLPG was calculated as the difference between IOP and IJVP. Cerebral inflow and outflow were measured in extracranial arteries using color-coded duplex ultrasonography.Twenty men participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 36 [9] years). Compared with supine IOP (mean [SD], 19.3 [3.7] mm Hg), IJVP (mean [SD], 21.4 [6.0] mm Hg), and estimated TLPG (mean [SD], -2.1 [7.0] mm Hg), -15° HDT was associated with increased IOP (mean difference, 2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3 mm Hg; P < .001) and IJVP (mean difference, 10.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, 8.9-12.2 mm Hg; P < .001) and with decreased TLPG (mean difference, -8.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.1 to -6.3 mm Hg; P < .001). Exercise (regardless of modality) at -15° HDT was associated with decreased IOP (mean difference, -1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.6 to -0.6 mm Hg; P = .002) and TLPG (mean difference, -3.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.2 to -0.7 mm Hg; P = .01) compared with rest. Both IOP (mean difference, 2.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.7-5.1 mm Hg; P = .01) and TLPG (mean difference, 5.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8-9.4 mm Hg; P = .02) were higher in participants who wore swimming goggles compared with those not wearing goggles.In this study, exercise was associated with decreased IOP and estimated translaminar pressure gradient in a spaceflight analogue of HDT. The addition of swimming goggles was associated with increased IOP and TLPG in HDT. Further evaluation in spaceflight may be warranted to determine whether modestly increasing IOP is an effective SANS countermeasure.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.0459", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2936856400", "source": "openalex"}

Radio‐iodinated [ 131 I]MIBG is therefore increasingly used for diagnosis and therapy of these disorders. To study the cause of thrombocytopenia associated with [ 131 l]MIBG therapy, we investigated the uptake of MIBG in human platelets in comparison with that of serotonin. Specific imipramine‐sensitive uptake of [ 131 I]MIBG was much slower than of [ 3 H]serotonin, but after prolonged incubation high and serotonin‐equivalent uptake levels were observed. Accumulation of MIBG saturated at 10‐ to 100‐fold higher concentration than serotonin, and the affinity for uptake and intracellular storage in platelets was much higher for serotonin than for MIBG. Conversely, serotonin was not detectably concentrated by neuro‐adrenergic Uptake‐I in SK‐N‐SH neuroblastoma and PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells. Fluvoxamine inhibited the uptake of norepinephrine and MIBG in PC 12 cells, similarly to that of serotonin in platelets. However, the drug was 100‐fold more effective in inhibiting platelet transport of MIBG than of serotonin. The results indicate that MIBG uptake in platelets is not mediated by a neuro‐adrenergic Uptake‐I, but probably proceeds via the serotonin transport system. MIBG concentration by platelets was at least as efficient as in neuro‐adrenergic tumour cells and has therefore (radio)biological potential for injuring these cells or precursor megakaryocytes. Platelet uptake of MIBG could be selectively blocked by fluvoxamine in concentrations which minimally affected its accumulation in neuro‐adrenergic target cells.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910540221", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2086142445", "source": "openalex"}

When the gland was perfused with red cellsiuspended in normal cat plasma or in kininogen‐free solutions, the vasodilator and secretory responses raused by stimulation of the chordo‐lingual nerve were mimicked by close arterial injections of acetylcholine. Atropine injected intravenously in doses of 0.5–1 mg/kg did not affect the chorda‐induced vasodilatation while salivary secretion was blocked. Increasing doses of atropine caused a successive reduction in the chorda‐mediated vasodilatation. Close arterial injections of isoprenaline caused vasodilatation, but no secretion of saliva. Propranolol in doses of 10–200 μg infused into the gland, abolished the effect of injected isoprenaline, but caused a small reduction of the chorda‐mediated vasodilatation. The combined action of propranolol and atropine depressed the long‐lasting vasodilator phase of chorda stimulation while the initial decrease in perfusion pressure was not affected. The findings suggest that the chordo‐lingual fibres to this gland all are cholinergic and that the nerve‐effector transmissions vary in their atropine sensitivity. The neuroglandular synapse responsible for secretion of watery saliva is easily blocked by atropine. The neuro‐vascular transmission and the neuro‐glandular connection responsible for release of kallikrein, are both relatively atropine‐resistant.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.1970.tb04720.x", "url": "https://openalex.org/W2007228027", "source": "openalex"}
