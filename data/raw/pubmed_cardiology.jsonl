It is clear that there are varying degrees of cardiogenic shock but there is no robust classification scheme to categorize this disease state. A multidisciplinary group of experts convened by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions was assembled to derive a proposed classification schema for cardiogenic shock. Representatives from cardiology (interventional, advanced heart failure, noninvasive), emergency medicine, critical care, and cardiac nursing all collaborated to develop the proposed schema. A system describing stages of cardiogenic shock from A to E was developed. Stage A is \"at risk\" for cardiogenic shock, stage B is \"beginning\" shock, stage C is \"classic\" cardiogenic shock, stage D is \"deteriorating\", and E is \"extremis\". The difference between stages B and C is the presence of hypoperfusion which is present in stages C and higher. Stage D implies that the initial set of interventions chosen have not restored stability and adequate perfusion despite at least 30 minutes of observation and stage E is the patient in extremis, highly unstable, often with cardiovascular collapse. This proposed classification system is simple, clinically applicable across the care spectrum from pre-hospital providers to intensive care staff but will require future validation studies to assess its utility and potential prognostic implications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104355/"}

However, at least in the Western world, middle-aged male patients with acute myocardial infarction are no more the rule. Due to a higher life expectancy and major medical advances, physicians are to treat older and frailer individuals, usually with multiple comorbidities. In this context, myocardial ischaemia and infarction frequently result from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand-i.e., type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI), according to the current universal definition-rather than coronary atherothrombosis. Moreover, the increasing use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has led to a heightened detection of T2MI-often causing relatively little myocardial injury-, which seems to have doubled its numbers in recent years. Nevertheless, owing to its multifaceted pathophysiology and clinical presentation, T2MI is still underdiagnosed. Perhaps more importantly, T2MI is also victim of undertreatment, as drugs that constitute the cornerstone of therapy in most cardiovascular diseases are much more unlikely to be prescribed in T2MI than in coronary atherothrombosis. In this paper, we review the recent literature on the classification, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of T2MI, trying to summarise the state-of-the-art knowledge about this increasingly important pathologic condition. Finally, based on the current scientific evidence, we also propose an algorithm that may be easily utilised in clinical practice, in order to improve T2MI diagnosis and risk stratification.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157215/"}

Primary angioplasty is the reperfusion method recommended by the guidelines, but requires multiple conditions that are not reached at all times. Early pharmacological reperfusion of the culprit coronary artery and early coronary angiography (pharmacoinvasive strategy) can be the solution to the logistical problem that primary angioplasty rises. Several studies have demonstrated pharmacoinvasive strategy as effective and safe as primary angioplasty ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which is postulated as the choice to follow in communities where access to PPCI is limited. The Mexico City Government together with the National Institute of Cardiology have developed a pharmaco-invasive reperfusion treatment program to ensure effective and timely reperfusion in STEMI. The model comprises a network of care at all three levels of health, including a system for early pharmacological reperfusion in primary care centers, a digital telemedicine system, an inter-hospital transport network to ensure primary angioplasty or early percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis and a training program with certification of the health care personal.

Abnormal changes to the proteome, the complete cellular protein complement, are responsible for the various disease phenotypes. The proteome is dynamic, however, and is constantly changing due to a combination of factors, including temporal and functional regulation of gene expression, differrential mRNA splicing and subsequent protein post-translational modifications. This dynamic response is compounded during the development of acute responses of the heart (such as myocardial preconditioning, stunning and infarction), just as it is during the development and onset of chronic heart disease (eg, heart failure). Proteomic analyses enable the identification and characterization of these disease-induced protein changes using a multitude of experimental techniques. This review provides an overview of proteomic technology with emphasis on the unique problems associated with the analysis of the heart, summarizes the latest proteomic studies, assesses what information analogous genomic studies can provide for the design and execution of proteomics, and finally discusses the implications of proteomics for the identification and development of diagnostics and therapeutic targets specifically for heart disease. The future holds great promise for the availability of a panel of cardiac serum biomarkers able to delineate different stages of each heart disease, thus allowing the design of clinical interventions potentially using stage-specific therapeutics. All of this is feasible only with detailed information about the unique and selective protein modifications that occur during the development of heart disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11804269/"}

Review of routine case-based events. Increases in cardiac troponin (cTn) concentrations are common after elective PCI in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). Peri-procedural PCI-related MI (type 4a MI) in CCS patients should be diagnosed in cases of major peri-procedural acute myocardial injury indicated by an increase in cTn concentrations of >5-times the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) together with evidence of new peri-procedural myocardial ischaemia as demonstrated by electrocardiography (ECG), imaging, or flow-limiting peri-procedural complications in coronary angiography. Measurement of cTn baseline concentrations before elective PCI is useful. In patients presenting with acute MI undergoing PCI, peri-procedural increases in cTn concentrations are usually due to their index presentation and not PCI-related, apart from obvious major peri-procedural complications, such as persistent occlusion of a large side branch or no-reflow after stent implantation. The distinction between type 4a MI, PCI-related acute myocardial injury, and chronic myocardial injury can be challenging in individuals undergoing PCI.

This paper seeks to review the evolution of CR and its well-established benefits, as well as reasons behind the poor referral and utilization. CR is a secondary prevention program for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that was first initiated in the 1970s as a hospital-based exercise program after an acute MI, but then evolved into a comprehensive multi-disciplinary program for patients with a wider range of cardiovascular diseases. CR mortality and morbidity benefits have endured over decades, even as interventional and pharmacological cardiovascular therapeutics have improved and as patients have become relatively more stable. Despite being an evidence-based clinical standard, referral and participation in CR are disconcertingly low. In efforts to combat poor referral rates, and improve care in the contemporary care environment, the approach to CR is evolving. Innovations include broadening CR beyond the hospital setting into remote- and hybrid-based formats, while still incorporating exercise training, risk factor reduction, and education, as well as behavioral and psychosocial support. Nonetheless, there still remain many challenges to overcome in order to increase participation of all ages, financials, races, and sexes.

Animal experiments often use reductionist approaches and are mostly performed in young and healthy animals which lack the risk factors, comorbidities, and comedications which are characteristics of patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction or undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Conceptually, it is still unclear by how much the time window for successful reperfusion is extended by preconditioning, and how long the duration of ischemia can be so that adjunct cardioprotection by postconditioning at reperfusion still protects. Experimental studies addressing long-term effects of adjunct cardioprotection beyond infarct size reduction, that is, on repair, remodeling, and mortality, are lacking. Technically, reproducibility and robustness of experimental studies are often limited. Grave faults in design and conduct of clinical trials have also substantially contributed to the failure of translation of cardioprotection to clinical practice. Cardiovascular surgery with ischemic cardioplegic arrest is only a surrogate of acute myocardial infarction and confounded by the choice of anesthesia, hypothermia, cardioplegia, and traumatic myocardial injury. Trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction have been performed on agents/interventions with no or inconsistent previous animal data and in patients who had either some reperfusion already at admission or were reperfused too late to expect any myocardial salvage. Of greatest concern is the lack of adequate phase II dosing and timing studies when rushing from promising proof-of-concept trials with surrogate end points such as infarct size to larger clinical outcome trials.

This paper aims to offer a concise overview of these significant advances and to put them into clinical context. Trials presented at the major international cardiology meetings during 2018 were reviewed including The American College of Cardiology, EuroPCR, The European Society of Cardiology, PCR London Valves, Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, and the American Heart Association. In addition to this a literature search identified several other publications eligible for inclusion based on their relevance to clinical cardiology, their potential impact on clinical practice and on future guidelines. A total of 78 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining novel stent designs (Biofreedom™, COMBO), use of drug-coated balloons in patients with high bleeding risk, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation myocardial infarction, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (alirocumab) and approaches of hypertension management. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril-valsartan during acute hospital admission and the management of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Electrophysiology data included trials examining atrial fibrillation ablation, wearable cardiac defibrillators (LifeVest) and His-bundle pacing. This article presents key clinical trials completed during 2018 and should be valuable to both cardiology clinicians and researchers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31065993/"}

Methods and reporting follow the guidelines of the PRISMA Statement and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020190541). Among the 220 screened citations, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria after full-text review. Among these 9 studies, there were 11 different cohorts. Patients were recruited from three different continents (31 countries). The number of QIs assessed ranged from 6 to 20, with 5 studies (56%) reporting data for at least 75% of the 20 QIs. There were room for improvement in terms of data availability (i.e. domain 6 measuring patient's satisfaction), feasibility (i.e. difficulties to find all data for composite QIs in domain 7), and attainment (i.e. high levels of compliance with the percentage of reperfused ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients, but low levels for a timely reperfusion). Our systematic review has shown that it is possible to measure most QIs in existing registries, and that there is room for improvement in terms of data availability, feasibility, and levels of attainment to QIs. Our findings may influence the design of future registries to capture this information and help in QIs definition updates.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34151368/"}

Nevertheless, the mortality remains substantial, ranging between 40 and 50% after 30 days. The present review summarizes the current evidence regarding revascularization strategies, vascular access site and concomitant antiplatelet and antithrombotic treatment in infarct-related cardiogenic shock. On the basis of the SHOCK trial, early revascularization is the most relevant procedure to improve the outcome of patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock. The majority of these patients present with multivessel coronary disease. The randomized CULPRIT-SHOCK trial showed that in the emergency setting, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be confined to the culprit lesion. Regarding vascular access site, no data derived from randomized controlled trials in cardiogenic shock are available. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is nowadays rarely performed in cardiogenic shock with rates less than 5% but is still a treatment option if coronary anatomy is not amenable to PCI. Regarding antiplatelet treatment, a randomized trial testing the intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor cangrelor versus an oral P2Y12 inhibitor in infarct-related cardiogenic shock is currently being performed. Early revascularization is the cornerstone of treatment of infarct-related cardiogenic shock and should be confined to the culprit lesion in the emergency setting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32452846/"}

Greater levels of TNF may not be linked to an increased risk of recurrent coronary events in the stable phase after myocardial ischemia (MI). Coronary atheroma is connected to endothelial and smooth muscle cells, as well as macrophages that emit the multifunctional cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Transplanted tumours become more vulnerable when TNF-<i>α</i> was first recognized to have a function in hemorrhagic necrosis. TNF-<i>α</i> has been demonstrated to induce heart failure, pulmonary edoema, and cardiomyopathy in people with advanced heart failure when it is elevated in the bloodstream. It has been postulated that prolonged overexpression of TNF-<i>α</i> after ischemia may contribute to poor cardiac outcomes by increasing TNF-<i>α</i> when the myocardium undergoes both temporary ischemia and reperfusion. A rise in TNF levels has been seen after a myocardial infarction, but it is unclear if these higher levels, found months after the initial event, are associated with an increased risk of subsequent heart attacks. We looked at TNF levels in the blood of 270 patients with coronary heart disease in the Chinese Hypertension League's Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) experiment to see if this notion held true. Recurrent coronary syndrome and coronary mortality were monitored prospectively in the participants. The min max imbalance normalization can be used to assess a patient's baseline characteristics, including hormone and cholesterol test results. Type 2 stimulant connection to aggregate the TNF-signaling qualities and fuzzy techniques was applied. There may now be enough preliminary evidence from the crucial bundle neural network analysis to identify the risk of coronary heart disease associated with TNF pregeneration studies.

The people behind these numbers spur this call for action. Prevention after myocardial infarction is crucial to reduce risk and suffering. Evidence-based interventions include optimal medical treatment with anti-platelets and statins, achievement of blood pressure, lipid and blood glucose targets, and appropriate lifestyle changes. The European Society of Cardiology and its constituent bodies are determined to embrace this challenge by developing a consensus document in which the existing gaps for secondary prevention strategies are reviewed.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology STEMI guideline was developed to provide advice regarding the optimal acute management of STEMI patients irrespective of where they are initially identified: in the field, at a non-percutaneous coronary intervention-capable centre or at a percutaneous coronary intervention-capable centre. We had also planned to evaluate and incorporate sex and gender considerations in the development of our recommendations. Unfortunately, inadequate enrollment of women in randomized trials, lack of publication of main outcomes stratified according to sex, and lack of inclusion of gender as a study variable in the available literature limited the feasibility of such an approach. The Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to develop specific evidence-based recommendations for the early identification of STEMI patients, practical aspects of patient transport, regional reperfusion decision-making, adjunctive prehospital interventions (oxygen, opioids, antiplatelet therapy), and procedural aspects of mechanical reperfusion (access site, thrombectomy, antithrombotic therapy, extent of revascularization). Emphasis is placed on integrating these recommendations as part of an organized regional network of STEMI care and the development of appropriate reperfusion and transportation pathways for any given region.

In this article, we will objectively review the evolution of the ischemia paradigm, the trial evidence comparing revascularization to medical therapy in SIHD, and what contemporary practice should be in 2022. Randomized trials, including COURAGE and, most recently, the ISCHEMIA trial, have shown no reduction in \"hard outcomes\" like death and myocardial infarction (MI) in SIHD compared to medical therapy. The trial excluded high-risk patients with left main disease, low ejection fraction (EF) < 35%, and severe unacceptable angina. Irrespective of the severity of ischemia and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), revascularization did not offer any prognostic advantage over medical therapy. On the other hand, there was a durable improvement in symptoms. While there are many caveats to the ISCHEMIA trial, the overall strengths of the trial outweigh these limitations. The findings of ISCHEMIA are consistent with previous trials. It is time for the cardiology community to pivot towards medical therapy as the initial step for most patients with SIHD.

In this setting, stem cell therapy has emerged as an exciting regenerative modality with a promise to arrest or even reverse the pathological myocardial remodeling. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies have thereafter reported use of various types of stem cells delivered through varying routes. While most of these studies reported positive results, some appropriate concerns were raised in others.

Their use has been mandated in all the new major mortality trials to test the efficacy of beta-blockers in heart failure. Morbidity and mortality remain high in those with heart failure even with the benefits proven for both these groups of agents. In spite of the evidence for benefit of ACE inhibitors they are persistently used in lower doses in clinical practice than tested in the large-scale trials. This was so prevalent as to allow the conduct of a substantial study, the ATLAS trial, to compare high and low dose ACE inhibition. Its equivocal findings have allowed different interpretations. Clinical experience would suggest that starting with a low dose is appropriate but the dose should be titrated then without undue delay to the levels used in the trials wherever possible. The evidence for benefit with these drugs had been obtained largely in patients with impaired systolic function. However the AIRE study selected patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction rather than with impaired systolic function. A substantial and long-term benefit was found from ACE inhibition. A cohort of patients had ventricular function assessed and as anticipated almost one half had preserved systolic function. Whilst the absolute benefit in lives saved was greater in the higher risk/low ejection fraction group, the relative risk reduction was not significantly different between those with preserved or impaired systolic function. The publication of the HOPE trial, although not a study of patients with heart failure, has clarified the situation considerably for those taking day to day care of patients. The HOPE study selected patients on the basis of high cardiovascular risk excluding those with known impaired systolic function. Although not an entry requirement for the study, ejection fraction was measured in a substantial majority and was above 40% indicating preservation of systolic function. The ACE inhibitor ramipril markedly reduced the combined end-point of cardiovascular death, stroke and myocardial infarction. Importantly there was a highly significant 20% risk reduction in the rate of myocardial infarction, a prospectively defined end-point, over the average four and a half year follow-up. Taken together with the retrospectively derived evidence from the heart failure trials there is now compelling evidence that the ACE inhibitors prevent myocardial infarction. The majority of patients with clinical heart failure have underlying ischaemic heart disease. Prevention of myocardial infarction and control of blood pressure are two key factors in the management of these patients irrespective of systolic ventricular function. The ACE inhibitors like the beta-blockers therefore have a pivotal role in their management. A challenge to current clinical trials is to determine whether these properties are shared to the same degree by the angiotensin antagonists or if even further gains in benefit can come from their combination. The neutral findings of the ELITE II study comparing the angiotensin antagonist, losartan, with the ACE inhibitor, captopril, have heightened interest in the on-going trials addressing these issues.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11192359/"}

Up to 15% of ambulatory patients with HF are affected and present with a loss of different tissue types including muscle mass. Whilst cardiac cachexia has long been a neglected clinical entity, current HF guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) include a section on weight management in patients with HF at risk of cardiac cachexia. This article highlights some recent studies of metabolic and functional alterations of the muscle in HF that were presented at the annual meeting of the ESC in August 2012 in Munich, Germany. The studies presented were focused on dysfunction of respiratory and limb skeletal musculature as well as metabolic features of myocardium in HF. Strategies improving muscle function and peak oxygen consumption in HF such as (inspiratory) muscle training and treatment of central sleep apnea by adaptive servoventilation are described. The latter shows promising results regarding HF symptoms and exercise capacity but still has to prove survival benefits in larger trials. A rat model highlights the value of microRNAs to regulate exercise-induced skeletal muscle angiogenesis. Another study provides evidence for changes in substrate utilisation depending on the functional status of mitochondria in the failing heart and points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mediator of metabolic remodelling. Though treatments remain to be established, these findings may pave the way for effective therapeutic approaches to altered muscle function and cardiac cachexia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23121913/"}

Since a considerable number of patients with chest pain, however, have a non cardiac etiology of their pain, properly triaging these patients represents a diagnostic challenge for physicians in the emergency department. As the available diagnostic procedures have limited accuracy, many different diagnostic strategies have been evaluated. Among these, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) at rest or in combination with stress procedures has been investigated in many trials. MPI has been proven to be useful, especially in a patient population with a low to intermediate probability of an ischemic event. Perfusion scintigraphy has a high sensitivity in the detection of myocardial infarction and reveals an excellent negative predictive value, allowing a safe discharge strategy of patients with a negative scan result. Moreover, it enables risk stratification and provides incremental and independent prognostic information regarding short to long term future cardiac adverse events. Several cost effectiveness studies have shown that perfusion imaging leads to lower overall direct costs, mainly by a reduction of unnecessary hospital admissions and diagnostic angiograms, without worsening of the clinical outcome of these patients. As a possible study endpoint, myocardial perfusion imaging in the acute setting enables the quantification of salvaged myocardium and therefore the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Besides perfusion agents, several infarct avid radiopharmaceuticals have been developed, which in part show promising results. However, larger randomized trials evaluating these tracers in clinical settings are needed to warrant routine clinical application.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15724136/"}

Any delay in reperfusion therapy is associated with poor outcomes. This study was done to know the major reasons for delayed presentation to thrombolytic therapy. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad from March 2019 till June 2020. A total of 120 diagnosed STEMI patients late for thrombolysis therapy and admitted in the CCU were included in this study. Non-probability convenience sampling technique was used. Data was analysed using SPSS version 16.0. The mean age of the patients was 61.6±1.07 years. Most of them were married (111), unemployed (85) and lived in urban areas (69). The most important reasons for delayed presentation of STEMI patients to thrombolytic therapy were due to the attribution of symptoms by patients to other conditions/diseases (57.5% CI:48.53-66.47), attempted self-treatment (50.8% CI: 41.76-59.91), misdiagnosis of symptoms (50%, CI:40.92-59.08), living in an area far away from any hospital (45%, CI:35.48-53.60) and problems of transportation (37%, CI:28.17-45.78). The early arrival of patients to health care facility in time is critical in diseases like STEMI.

Recently, a specific cutoff for 0/3h high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) change (7 ng/L) was proposed, warranting external validation. Patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department were prospectively enrolled into an international multicenter diagnostic study. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists applying the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, on the basis of complete cardiac workup, cardiac imaging, and serial hs-cTnT. Hs-cTnT concentrations were measured at presentation, after 1 hour, and after 3 hours. The objective was to externally validate the proposed cutoff, and if necessary, derive and internally as well as externally validate novel 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm in an independent multicenter cohort. Among 2076 eligible patients, application of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm triaged 1512 patients (72.8%) to either rule out or rule in NSTEMI, leaving 564 patients (27.2%) in the observe-zone (adjudicated NSTEMI prevalence, 120/564 patients, 21.3%). The suggested 0/3h-hs-cTnT-change of <7 ng/L triaged 517 patients (91.7%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 33.3% (95% CI, 25.5-42.2), missing 80 patients with NSTEMI, and ≥7 ng/L triaged 47 patients toward rule-in (8.3%), resulting in a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8-99.2). Novel derived 0/3h-criteria for the observe-zone patients ruled out NSTEMI with a 3h hs-cTnT concentration <15 ng/L and a 0/3h-hs-cTnT absolute change <4 ng/L, triaging 138 patients (25%) toward rule-out, resulting in a sensitivity of 99.2% (95% CI, 96.0-99.9), missing 1 patient with NSTEMI. A 0/3h-hs-cTnT absolute change ≥6 ng/L triaged 63 patients (11.2%) toward rule-in, resulting in a specificity of 98% (95% CI, 96.2-98.9) Thereby, the novel 0/3h-criteria reduced the number of patients in the observe zone by 36%s and the number of type 1 myocardial infarction by 50%. Findings were confirmed in both internal and external validation. A combination of a 3h-hs-cTnT concentration (<15 ng/L) and a 0/3h absolute change (<4 ng/L) is necessary to safely rule out NSTEMI in patients remaining in the observe-zone of the ESC 0/1h-hs-cTnT-algorithm.

Despite major advances in acute treatment using network approaches to allocate patients to timely reperfusion and optimal antithrombotic treatment, patients remain at high risk for thrombotic complications. Ongoing activation of the coagulation system as well as thrombin-mediated platelet activation may both play a crucial role in this context. Whether measurement of circulating biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis could be useful for risk stratification in secondary prevention is currently not fully understood. In addition, measurement of such biomarkers could be helpful to identify thrombus formation as the leading mechanism for AMI. The introduction of biomarkers of myocardial injury such as high-sensitivity cardiac troponins made rule-out of AMI even more precise. However, elevated markers of myocardial injury cannot provide proof of a type 1 AMI, let alone thrombus formation. The combined measurement of markers of myocardial injury with biomarkers reflecting ongoing thrombus formation might be helpful for the fast and correct diagnosis of an atherothrombotic type 1 AMI.

Development of a conceptual model of the pathophysiologic actions of stress in CAD will assist in the understanding of this relationship. In patients with angiographic evidence of CAD, the presence of major depressive disorder was the best single predictor of cardiac events during the 12 months following diagnosis. Significantly, 6-month cumulative mortality following diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been shown to be higher in depressed patients than in nondepressed patients. A decrease in heart rate variability may mediate the deleterious effect of depression on post-myocardial infarction prognosis. Other factors such as mental stress and altered platelet function may also predispose depressed patients to a heightened risk of cardiac events.

Out of 32 recommendations compared, 26 recommendations (81%) were classified as identical or overlapping, and six recommendations (19%) were classified as different. Most diverging recommendations were related to minor differences in class of recommendation between the two documents. This applies to recommendations for reperfusion therapy >12 hours after symptom onset, immediate transfer of all patients after fibrinolytic therapy, rescue PCI for patients with failed fibrinolysis, and intra-aortic balloon pump use in patients with cardiogenic shock. More substantial differences were observed with respect to the type of P2Y12 inhibitor and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The majority of recommendations for the management of STEMI according to ESC and ACCF/AHA guidelines were identical or overlapping. Differences were explained by gaps in available evidence, in which case expert consensus differed between European and American guidelines due to divergence in interpretation, perception, and culture of medical practice.

These noninvasive techniques have been found useful in detecting myocardial infarction independent of the electrocardiogram and determining the site and extent of the infarct as well as its effect on left ventricular function. These studies provide important prognostic data and are proving to be of value in evaluating patients with cardiogenic shock. Neither the thallium-201 myocardial perfusion image nor the gated cardiac blood pool scan can distinguish between acute and chronic myocardial damage. In clinical situations where this is important, infarct avid imaging with technetium-99m pyrophosphate allows determination of whether a given perfusion defect or wall motion abnormality is acute. Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 at rest and after exercise is also proving to be of value in evaluating patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. Initial studies suggest that the technique may be more sensitive than exercise electrocardiography and is of special value in minimizing the occurrence of false positive exercise tests for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. The combined tracers technique is also of value in the evaluation of patients undergoing coronary bypass graft surgery and those with cardiomyopathy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/136890/"}

Recent observational and clinical data support changes in the guidelines for ICD implantation to include patients with no structural heart disease and spontaneous ventricular tachycardia not amenable to other treatments; left ventricular ejection fractions of 0.30 or less at least 1 month after myocardial infarction and at least 3 months after coronary revascularization surgery (the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II); syncope of unexplained origin or a family history of unexplained sudden cardiac death in association with typical or atypical right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevations (Brugada syndrome); and syncope in the setting of advanced structural heart disease when thorough invasive and noninvasive investigations have failed to define a cause. With the completion of multiple important randomized clinical trials, the application of ICD technology continues to evolve. Indications have expanded from secondary to primary prevention. Most importantly, currently available data support the prophylactic use of ICDs in patients with coronary artery disease and poor left ventricular function.

Approximately 20-30% of strokes are related to cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, bacterial endocarditis, rheumatic and nonrheumatic valvular diseases, acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular thrombus, and cardiomyopathies associated with muscular dystrophies, among others. Strokes can also occur in the setting of cardiac interventions such as cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass procedures. Treatment to prevent recurrent stroke in any of these settings depends on the underlying etiology. Whereas anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists is proven to be superior to acetylsalicylic acid for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, the superiority of anticoagulants has not been conclusively established for stroke associated with congestive heart failure and is contraindicated in those with infective endocarditis. Ongoing trials are evaluating management strategies in patients with atrial level shunts due to patent foramen ovale.

Those which have marked the year 1999 include the introduction of new techniques of cardiovascular imaging and interventional cardiology, and the new consequences of collaboration with workers in foetal cardiology and medical and molecular genetics. The advances in imaging are the result of those of microprocessors which enable three-dimensional reconstruction of ultrasonic, radiological or magnetic resonance images. This provides intracardiac or intravascular views which are very similar to those seen by the surgeon. This is a major tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. Similarly, the introduction of programmes of tissue recognition enables fine ultrasonic analysis of the vascular wall and of endothelial function leading to the opening of a new chapter of preventive vascular medicine from the earliest age. Paediatric interventional cardiology has also progressed rapidly and the past year has been that of a consensus on the closure of a great number of atrial septal defects by new prostheses implanted and anchored in a simpler and safer manner. Prenatal diagnosis has become a crucial factor in the treatment and prognosis of congenital heart disease which is life-threatening in the first hours of life, explaining the benefit when this is applied to transposition of the great vessels or to coarctation of the aorta. Finally, advances in genetics have led to the identification of several genes of heart malformations and the correlations between interstitial microdeletions and syndromes often associated with heart disease: chromosome 22q11 and the Di George syndrome, chromosome 7q and the Williams syndrome.

With the completion of a number of trials using bone marrow (BM)-derived adult stem cells, critical examination of the overall clinical benefits, limitations and potential side effects of this revolutionary treatment will pave the way for future clinical research. At present, clinical trials have been conducted almost exclusively using BM stem cells. The primary endpoints of these trials are mainly safety and feasibility, with secondary endpoints in the efficacy of post-myocardial infarction (MI) cardiac repair. Intervention with BM-derived cells was mainly carried out by endogenously-mobilised BM cells with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and more frequently, by intracoronary infusion or direct intramyocardial injection of autologous BM cells. While these studies have been proven safe and feasible without notable side effects, mixed outcomes in terms of clinical benefits have been reported. The major clinical benefits observed are improved cardiac contractile function and suppressed left ventricular negative remodelling, including reduced infarct size and improved cardiac perfusion of infarct zone. Moderate and transient clinical benefits have been mostly observed in studies with intracoronary infusion or direct intramyocardial injection of BM cells. These effects are widely considered to be indirect effects of implanted cells in association with paracrine factors, cell fusion, passive ventricular remodelling, or the responses of endogenous cardiac stem cells. In contrast, evidence of cardiac regeneration characterised by differentiation of implanted stem cells into cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell lineages, is weak or lacking. To elucidate a clear risk-benefit of this exciting therapy, future studies on the mechanisms of cardiac cell therapy will need to focus on confirming the ideal cell types in relation to dosage and timing for post-MI cardiac repair, developing more effective cell delivery techniques, and devising innovative cell tracking modalities that could unveil the fates of implanted cells such as survival, engraftment and functionality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19907881/"}

Their manifold interrelations may be best analysed within a biopsychosocial model of disease. A systematic research was done on empirical studies published during the last 15 years and dealing with epidemiological, etiopathogenetic and therapeutic dimensions of the comorbidity of depression, anxiety and heart disease. From an epidemiological perspective recurrent depressions are associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease. Depressive disorders play a major role in triggering critical cardiac events, e.g. myocardial infarction. The prevalence rates of depressive disorders in various cardiological conditions are significantly higher than the frequencies that can be expected in healthy general population. Depression shows a negative impact on the somatic morbidity and mortality during the further course of illness. Anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders seem to be interrelated with cardiological conditions in quite a similar way, probably contributing even more negatively to critical and lethal cardiological events than depression. From an etiopathogenetic perspective some clusters of depressive symptoms seem to be linked to cardiotoxicity more closely than other, vital exhaustion, anhedonia, and hopelessness probably mediating a special risk. In any case, postmyocardial infarct depression that proves treatment-resistent indicates a negative prognosis of the prevailing cardiological condition. On a level of psychological and psychosocial constructs type-A personality, anger/hostility, type-D personality, and alexithymia have been explored regarding its proper pathogenetic role. Psychological and psychopathological variables have to be set into a context of psychosocial stressors on the one hand, and have to be simultaneously analysed with various underlying psycho- and neurobiological variables on the other. Above all, HPA- and sympathicomedullary dysfunctions, reduced heart rate variability, altered functions of thrombocytes, and increased proinflammatory processes have to be recognized as significantly contributing to the pathophysiology both of depression and of heart condition. Neurobiological aspects of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders must be interlinked with these underpinnings of depression. Differential effects on critical cardiological events must be supposed. From a therapeutic perspective several RCTs demonstrate that SSRIs may safely and efficiently treat depressive disorders in cardiological conditions, and may even improve the general somatic prognosis. Cognitive-behavioural psychotherapies have been empirically validated in treating depression and anxiety with cardiological patients. So far, however, a differential indication of psychopharmacological versus psychotherapeutic approaches has not been proved yet. Depression and anxiety disorders in patients with heart disease paradigmatically define a psychosomatic-somatopsychic challenge to any health delivery system. A psychosomatic perspective may best be practised within a Consultation-Liaison psychiatric service that cooperates continuously and closely with cardiological departments and experts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22075746/"}

Plasma MB CK is not elevated until 8 to 10 hours after onset, and the ECG is unreliable; thus, the need has arisen for a new \"diagnostic mind-set.\" The need is threefold: (1) more effective triaging in the emergency room to prevent unnecessary use of hospital beds, particularly those in the intensive care units, (2) to administer thrombolytic therapy in the early hours, and (3) earlier detection of coronary reocclusion and reinfarction. Diagnostic imaging techniques such as pyrophosphate, thallium-201 technetium sestamibi, or positron emitting agents lack the necessary early diagnostic specificity, but echocardiography has potential although its specificity is limited. Plasma CK isoforms provide diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 94%, respectively, within the initial 4 to 6 hours of onset and can be assayed within minutes. In a prospective study of 1100 patients suspected of infarction, with conventional MB CK, 22% of the patients admitted to the coronary care unit would have had infarction, whereas using the CK isoforms, 75% had infarction and about 50% were discharged home. A scenario for the future might be to initiate thrombolytic therapy outside the hospital (eg, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [r-TPA] 20 mg bolus) and upon arrival, confirm or exclude infarction by the MB CK isoform which can be performed in the emergency room in 20 minutes to determine whether thrombolytic therapy and heparin should be continued.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8313577/"}

Efforts at temporary mechanical or pharmacologic support of the heart have been largely unsuccessful so that attention is now directed toward prevention of ventricular failure and limitation of myocardial infarct size or even outright prevention of infarction itself. In particular, attention has been refocused on earlier reperfusion efforts with streptokinase. The effect of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function and early mortality was studied in subsets of patients in a randomized trial (Netherlands Interuniversity Cardiology Institute). Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hours after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Of the patients eligible for this detailed analysis, 245 were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiography was preformed in 212 of the 245 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 versus 1,179 U/liter in control subjects, p = 0.0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% versus 43% in control subjects, p = 0.0001). Twelve month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (8% versus 16% in the control group, p less than 0.01). In multivariate regression analysis infarct size limitation, improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction and 3 month mortality were predicted by sigma ST, time from onset of symptoms to admission and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most useful in patients admitted within 2 hours after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sigma ST segment of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with sigma ST less than 1.2 mV, admitted 2 to 4 hours after onset of symptoms.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3108346/"}

To examine the array of strategies available to patients and their practitioners, to employ in the face of bodily breakdown. Co-written by a philosopher and cardiologist, this article uses a detailed case study of a patient suffering a myocardial infarction leading to chronic heart failure, with examples of effective or suboptimal care. This enables a discussion of how the clinician or clinical team can best facilitate existential healing, that is, adaptive and creative resilience in the face of chronic impairment. We outline a \"chessboard of healing,\" involving the possibility-spaces for dealing constructively with bodily breakdown. This set of strategies is shown to be nonarbitrary, drawn directly from contemporary work on the phenomenology of the lived body. For example, as we both experience the body as that which 'I am', and as that which 'I have', separable from the self, patients can react to illness by moving towards their bodies in modes of listening and befriending, or away from their body, ignoring or detaching themselves from symptoms. Then too, as the body is ever changing in time, one can seek restoration to a previous state, or transformation to new patterns of bodily usage, including passage into a whole new life-narrative.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37211663/"}
{"id": "11518189", "title": "Delayed preconditioning of myocardium: current perspectives.", "text": "The protection conferred by ischemic preconditioning (PC) of myocardium occurs in a bimodal time course. The early cardioprotection wanes rapidly and is succeeded by a delayed phase of protection. This \"second window\" lasts for up to 72 hours, depending on species and end-point. A widely adopted paradigm for delayed PC is the following: 1) freely diffusible molecules or radicals, generated during the PC period, act in autocrine and/or paracrine manner as triggers of cellular adaptation; 2) they cause the activation of a protein kinase signal cascade; 3) the activated kinases phosphorylate important substrate proteins. In the case of delayed PC, it is thought that the phosphorylation of transcription factors, initiating the synthesis of late appearing effector proteins that promote cell survival during subsequent ischemia, may be a crucial event. Investigation of the proximal components of this sequence has altered our perceptions of several biological mediators, previously thought to be short acting, including adenosine, NO, free radicals and bradykinin. Signal transduction components include protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases and various mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases but their patterns of regulation are complex and as yet poorly defined. Gene expression is modified in a regulated fashion to induce new proteins that promote cell repair and to protect against subsequent ischemia-reperfusion insult. It is likely that the complex nature of the preconditioning stimulus causes the activation of a variety of transcription factors, regulating a large number of target genes. So far, attention has focussed on a small number of protein products as potential distal mediators of delayed preconditioning. These include the heat shock proteins, manganese superoxide dismutase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and cyclo-oxygenase-2.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11518189/"}

Importantly, preclinical studies demonstrate that progressive microcirculatory failure (the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon) contributes significantly to myocardial reperfusion injury. Diagnostic techniques to measure tissue perfusion have validated this concept in humans, and it is now clear that abnormal tissue perfusion occurs frequently in STEMI patients undergoing reperfusion therapy. Moreover, because tissue perfusion correlates poorly with epicardial blood flow (TIMI flow grade), clinical studies show that tissue perfusion is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in STEMI patients and is associated with infarct size, ventricular function, CHF and ventricular arrhythmias. The mechanisms responsible for abnormal tissue perfusion are multifactorial and include both mechanical obstruction and vasoconstrictor humoral factors. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside, maintains microcirculatory flow following reperfusion by activating four well-characterized extracellular receptors. Because activation of adenosine receptors attenuates the mechanical and functional mechanisms leading to the \"no reflow\" phenomenon and activates other cardioprotective pathways as well, it is not surprising that both experimental and clinical studies show striking myocardial salvage with intravenous infusions of adenosine administered in the peri-reperfusion period. For example, a post hoc analysis of the AMISTAD II trial indicates a significant reduction in 1 and 6-month mortality in STEMI patients undergoing reperfusion therapy who are treated with adenosine within 3 hours of symptoms. In conclusion, adenosine's numerous cardioprotective effects, including attenuation of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon, support its use in high risk STEMI undergoing reperfusion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18000974/"}

This article contains an overview of the most notable developments reported in recent months. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have provided one of the major advances in interventional cardiology as they have very effectively reduced the restenosis rate. Both randomized clinical trials and large observational studies have confirmed their safety, and their use has been extended to include highly complex conditions. Although thrombosis is one complication that can affect both conventional stents and DESs, the rate of late stent thrombosis is slightly, though significantly, higher with DESs. Primary angioplasty is the treatment of choice for patients with acute myocardial infarction if carried out under appropriate conditions, within a reasonable time period in a specialized center by experienced personnel. Use of thrombectomy devices can improve procedural outcomes and it appears that DES implantation is safe and effective, though more data are still needed. In patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, early treatment using an invasive approach coupled to the administration of various combinations of antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs continues to be fundamental. Although left main coronary artery lesions are generally treated surgically, advances in percutaneous techniques and the use of DESs mean that an increasing number of patients are being treated using percutaneous coronary interventions. A number of studies have shown good results in other lesions and in high-risk patients with, for example, bifurcation lesions, chronic occlusions or diabetes. Intracoronary ultrasound is the predominant intracoronary diagnostic technique and it can be used to assist in optimizing DES implantation. In addition, measurement of the fractional flow reserve is helpful in evaluating the severity of moderate lesions whereas the high-resolution images provided by optical coherence tomography are particularly informative. Multislice computed tomography enables the presence of coronary artery disease to be ruled out and the technique is also useful as a complementary tool for interventional cardiologists. Research into regenerative techniques is promising but remains experimental at present. With regard to noncoronary interventions, new data have become available that support the use of a percutaneous approach in patients with patent foramen ovale. In addition, clinical experience with percutaneous aortic valve replacement, via either the transfemoral or transapical route, is increasing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19174054/"}

The rationalizations for this position included the limited epidemiological data establishing the risk of elevated blood pressure in the age group over 65, particularly for women; and concern that lowering the blood pressure might not be desirable, from the standpoint of reduced blood flow to vital organs. There was also concern over the known greater responsiveness or sensitivity of older people to customary doses. It was also argued by some that even if the blood pressure could be safely controlled it was hardly worth it, since age itself is the most powerful predictor of mortality in the elderly. Moreover, it seemed unlikely to many that the risk of hypertension could be reduced--that is, that life expectancy could be extended; at the same time it seemed fairly certain that the quality of life would be compromised by therapy. However, since systolic blood pressure continues to be predictive of coronary heart disease mortality well into the ninth decade, and since considerable life expectancy remains for those who have survived to their senior years, it seems logical to attempt to reduce the risk and preserve life expectancy by controlling blood pressure. The question is, is the evidence that treatment helps really convincing, or are we simply extrapolating from studies carried out in younger subjects?

The Guidelines Committee of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology publishes regular updates of its recommendations, taking into consideration the most recent clinical evidence. The present update to the 2011 and 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society APT guidelines incorporates new evidence on how to optimize APT use, particularly in situations in which few to no data were previously available. The recommendations update focuses on the following primary topics: (1) the duration of dual APT (DAPT) in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome and non-acute coronary syndrome indications; (2) management of DAPT in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery; (3) management of DAPT in patients who undergo elective and semiurgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; (4) when and how to switch between different oral antiplatelet therapies; and (5) management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients who undergo PCI. For PCI patients, we specifically analyze the particular considerations in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical or bioprosthetic valves (including transcatheter aortic valve replacement), venous thromboembolic disease, and established left ventricular thrombus or possible left ventricular thrombus with reduced ejection fraction after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In addition to specific recommendations, we provide values and preferences and practical tips to aid the practicing clinician in the day to day use of these important agents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29475527/"}

Comprehensive prevention of CAD requires manipulation of genetic risk. The availability of microarrays of single-nucleotide polymorphisms enabling genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to the discovery of 33 genetic risk variants for CAD. Surprisingly, 23 risk variants mediate their risk through unknown mechanisms, with only 10 associating with hypertension or lipids. Thus, there are several mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of CAD yet to be elucidated. The first risk variant discovered by GWAS was 9p21.3, which occurs in 75% of all populations except African, with a mean increased risk of 25% per copy. Of the 33 variants for CAD, the increased risk varies from 6% to 92% with a mean increased risk of 18%, occurring on average in 47% of the population. The maximum number of risk alleles per individual would be 66. In the CARDIoGRAM (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta Analysis) study of 23 variants, the average per individual was 17, the minimum 7, and the maximum 37. The top 10th percentile has an odds ratio of 1.88 and the lowest percentile an odds ratio of 0.55. Routine genetic screening is unlikely until management is improved by genetic testing. Risk variants should provide pathophysiological insights and targets for novel therapy. While risk variants are less potent predictors of CAD, compared with biomarkers, they have the advantage of not changing in one's lifetime and are unaffected by diet, sex, age, or medication.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23040572/"}

There are no data regarding the subpopulation of patients who may benefit from such support besides patients with mechanical complications of myocardial infarction. Prospective nationwide registry data of patients with myocardial infarction and CS treated with PCI between 2003 and 2014 were analyzed. Patients were initially stratified into 2 groups according to final infarct-related artery Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade after PCI: those with successful primary PCI (TIMI flow grades 2 or 3) and those with unsuccessful primary PCI (TIMI flow grades 0 or 1). Outcomes of patients with or without IABP treatment in each group were analyzed and compared. In the unsuccessful PCI group, patients in whom IABP was applied had lower in-hospital, 30-day, and 12-month mortality. IABP support in this group of patients was an independent predictor of lower 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 0.89; p = 0.002).

Automated interpretation of ECG is widely used as decision support for less experienced physicians. Recent reports have demonstrated that artificial neural networks can be used to improve selected aspects of conventional rule-based interpretation programs. The purpose of this study was to detect acute myocardial infarction in the 12-lead ECG with artificial neural networks. A total of 1120 ECGs from patients with acute myocardial infarction and 10,452 control ECGs, recorded at an emergency department with computerized ECGs, were studied. Artificial neural networks were trained to detect acute myocardial infarction by use of measurements from the 12 ST-T segments of each ECG, together with the correct diagnosis. After this training process, the performance of the neural networks was compared with that of a widely used ECG interpretation program and the classification of an experienced cardiologist. The neural networks showed higher sensitivities and discriminant power than both the interpretation program and cardiologist. The sensitivity of the neural networks was 15.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.4 to 18.6) higher than that of the interpretation program compared at a specificity of 95.4% (P<.00001) and 10.5% (95% CI, 7.2 to 13.6) higher than the cardiologist at a specificity of 86.3% (P<.00001).

Evidence-based cardiology VII.", "text": "Over the last two decades the results of randomized clinical studies, which are powerful aids for correctly assessing therapeutical strategies, have consolidated cardiological practice. In addition, scientifically interesting hypotheses have been generated through the results of epidemiological studies. Properly conducted randomized studies without systematic errors and with statistical power adequate for demonstrating moderate and reasonable benefits in relevant clinical outcomes have provided reliable and strong results altering clinical practice, thus providing adequate treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The dissemination and use of evidence-based medicine in treating coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and in prevention will prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths annually in developed and developing countries. CVD is responsible for approximately 12 million deaths annually throughout the world, and approximately 60% of these deaths occur in developing countries. During recent years, an increase in mortality and morbidity rates due to CVD has occurred in developing countries. This increase is an indication that an epidemiological (demographic, economical, and health-related) transition is taking place in developing countries and this transition implies a global epidemic of CVD, which will require wide-ranging and globally effective strategies for prevention. The identification of conventional and emerging risk factors for CVD, as well as their management in high-risk individuals, has contributed to the decrease in the mortality rate due to CVD. Through a national collaboration, several multi-center and multinational randomized and epidemiological studies have been carried out throughout Brazil, thus contributing not only to a generalized scientific growth in different Brazilian hospitals but also to the consolidation of an increasingly evidence-based clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10513040/"}

With a mortality of 30% to 80%, ICS is the most common cause of death from acute myocardial infarction. The S3 guideline presented here characterizes the current evidence-based treatment of ICS: early revascularization, treatment of shock, and intensive care treatment of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if it arises. The success or failure of treatment for MODS determines the outcome in ICS. Experts from eight German and Austrian specialty societies analyzed approximately 3600 publications that had been retrieved by a systematic literature search. Three interdisciplinary consensus conferences were held, resulting in the issuing of 111 recommendations and algorithms for this S3 guideline. Early revascularization of the occluded vessel, usually with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is of paramount importance. The medical treatment of shock consists of dobutamine as the inotropic agent and norepinephrine as the vasopressor of choice and is guided by a combination of pressure and flow values, or by the cardiac power index. Levosimendan can be given in addition to treat catecholamine-resistant shock. For patients with ICS who are treated with PCI, the current S3 guideline differs from the European and American myocardial infarction guidelines with respect to the recommendation for intra-aortic balloon pulsation (IABP): Whereas the former guidelines give a class I recommendation for IABP, this S3 guideline states only that IABP \"can\" be used in this situation, in view of the poor state of the evidence. Only for patients being treated with systemic fibrinolysis is IABP weakly recommended (IABP \"should\" be used in such cases). With regard to the optimal intensive-care interventions for the prevention and treatment of MODS, recommendations are given concerning ventilation, nutrition, erythrocyte-concentrate transfusion, prevention of thrombosis and stress ulcers, follow-up care, and rehabilitation. The goal of this S3 guideline is to bring together the types of treatment for ICS that lie in the disciplines of cardiology and intensive-care medicine, as patients with ICS die not only of pump failure, but also (and even more frequently) of MODS. This is the first guideline that adequately emphasizes the significance of MODS as a determinant of the outcome of ICS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22675405/"}

Further, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring has improved arrhythmia diagnosis and dynamic ST-segment changes have been shown to provide important prognostic information in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Likewise, remote recording or monitoring of arrhythmias and vital signs seem to improve outcome and reduce the necessity of re-admissions or outpatient contacts in patients with heart failure or arrhythmias.

Temporal trends in the use of evidence-based pharmacological and interventional therapies; patient outcomes (death, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, stroke, myocardial infarction). Use of pharmacological medications increased over the study period (beta-blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thienopyridines with or without percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, low-molecular-weight heparin; all P<.001). Pharmacological reperfusion declined in patients with STEMI by -22 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -27 to -17), whereas primary PCI increased by 37 percentage points (95% CI, 33-41). In patients with non-STEMI, rates of PCI increased markedly by 18 percentage points (95% CI, 15-20).

The criteria for diagnosis have been carefully defined. In 62 percent of patients admitted with a tentative diagnosis of acute infarction, the initial impression was confirmed. Fifteen percent of patients admitted to the unit were classified as having possible infarction; in this group, the mortality rate was 3 percent. A classification of functional severity based on clinical evidence of heart failure or shock is presented. Morbidity and mortality in acute myocardial infarction are related to the functional severity of the illness. Although arrhythmia is common, the overriding importance of five life-threatening arrhythmias is emphasized. Mortality of patients in the coronary care unit was not improved in comparison to those treated under regular care until strong central direction of therapeutic programs, immediate treatment of arrhythmia in cardiac arrest, and delegation of some medical authority to trained nurses was accomplished. The change in concept of the purposes and practices of special coronary care from resuscitation to prevention of arrhythmia is emphasized. The mortality in myocardial infarction complicated by shock remains high. In the absence of shock, aggressive medical treatment in the coronary care unit reduced mortality from 26 to 7 percent. The implications of these data in the management of patients admitted to a hospital with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction are discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10588193/"}

Since 1958, spectacular progress has occurred. Closed chest massage and defibrillation, electronic monitoring, advances in electrophysiology and a new pharmacology have changed cardiology. The coronary care unit has evolved into a comprehensive coronary care system.

Patients with or without previous myocardial infarction admitted for coronary evaluation and not submitted to any stress testing because of clinical reasons are at a higher risk for subsequent death. For prognostication, no test has been better validated than exercise electrocardiography: it can identify patients at low and high risk for future cardiac events among those without symptoms, with typical chest pain, and with previous myocardial infarction. In patients with triple-vessel disease, the results of exercise also allow those at low and high risk to be recognized. Both exercise radionuclide angiography and 201Tl scintigraphy (the latter in larger patient populations) have also demonstrated significant prognostic value on patients with or without previous myocardial infarction. Neither one has shown superiority to the other in prognostication. So far, they have been considered the only viable alternatives to exercise electrocardiography stress testing for diagnosis and prognostication. However, their costs limit their extensive application. Preliminary data suggest that intravenous dipyridamole echocardiography can be used for both diagnosis and prognostication of coronary artery disease; moreover, the prognostic information derived from dipyridamole echocardiography testing seems independent of and additive to that provided by exercise electrocardiography. Further prospective studies on larger patient populations are needed to better define the prognostic value of dipyridamole echocardiography testing.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2022053/"}

Reasons for admission to hospital was to rule out an acute coronary syndrome, specifically, myocardial infarction. The initial ECG of each patient was evaluated for abnormalities and compared with the final diagnosis. Of the 75 patients presenting with normal ECGs (normal, upright T waves and isoelectric ST segments), 1 (1.3%) was subsequently diagnosed with a myocardial infarction by Troponin I elevation alone. Of the 55 patients presenting with abnormal ECGs but no clear evidence of ischemia [i.e., left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left anterior hemiblock (LAH)], 2 (3.6%) were diagnosed with MI. Of the 48 patients presenting with abnormal ECGs questionable for ischemia (nonspecific ST and T wave changes that were not clearly ST segment elevation or depression), 7 (14.6%) were diagnosed with an MI. Of the 72 patients who presented with abnormal ECGs showing ischemia (acute ST segment elevation and/or depression), 39 (54.2%) were shown to have evidence for MI. Patients who presented with normal ECGs (category 1) were extremely low risk for acute myocardial infarction.

Since the early 1970s, there has been evidence that the size of a myocardial infarction could be altered by various interventions. Early coronary artery reperfusion has been an intervention that consistently reduces myocardial infarct size in animal models as well as humans. Most cardiologists agree that the best way to treat acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is to reperfuse the infarct artery as soon as possible and to keep the infarct artery patent. In general, stenting is superior to angioplasty, which is superior to thrombolysis. There is no accepted adjunctive therapy to acutely limit myocardial infarct size along with reperfusion that is routinely used in clinical practice. In the Kloner experimental laboratory, some adjunctive therapies have reproducibly limited infarct size (regional hypothermia, preconditioning, cariporide, combinations of the above, remote preconditioning, certain adenosine agonists, and late sodium current blockade). In clinical trials, a host of pharmacologic adjunctive therapies have failed to either reduce infarct size or improve clinical outcome. Potential reasons for the failure of these trials are discussed. However, some adjunctive therapies have shown promise in data subanalyses or subpopulations of clinical trials (adenosine, therapeutic hypothermia, and hyperoxemic reperfusion) or in small clinical trials (atrial natriuretic peptide, ischemic postconditioning, and cyclosporine, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor). A recent clinical trial with remote conditioning induced by repetitive inflation of a brachial artery cuff begun prior to hospitalization showed promise in improving myocardial salvage and there are several reports in the cardiothoracic literature, suggesting that remote preconditioning protects hearts during surgery. Thus, in 2011, there is hope that applying some of the body's own conditioning mechanisms may provide protection against ischemic damage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21821520/"}

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology support the program. The Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model was developed by Million Hearts and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services as a strategy to assess a value-based payment approach toward reduction in 10-year predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by implementing cardiovascular preventive strategies to manage the \"ABCS\" (aspirin therapy in appropriate patients, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation). The purpose of this special report is to describe the development and intended use of the Million Hearts Longitudinal ASCVD Risk Assessment Tool. The Million Hearts Tool reinforces and builds on the \"2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk\" by allowing clinicians to estimate baseline and updated 10-year ASCVD risk estimates for primary prevention patients adhering to the appropriate ABCS over time, alone or in combination. The tool provides updated risk estimates based on evidence from high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the ABCS therapies. This novel approach to personalized estimation of benefits from risk-reducing therapies in primary prevention may help target therapies to those in whom they will provide the greatest benefit, and serves as the basis for a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services program designed to evaluate the Million Hearts Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27825770/"}

We investigated the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) algorithms to rule out or rule in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without ST-elevation in patients with DM. We prospectively enrolled 3,681 patients with suspected AMI and stratified those by the presence of DM. The ESC 0/1-h and 0/3-h algorithms were used to calculate negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV). In addition, alternative cutoffs were calculated and externally validated in 2,895 patients. In total, 563 patients (15.3%) had DM, and 137 (24.3%) of these had AMI. When the ESC 0/1-h algorithm was used, the NPV was comparable in patients with and without DM (absolute difference [AD] -1.50 [95% CI -5.95, 2.96]). In contrast, the ESC 0/3-h algorithm resulted in a significantly lower NPV in patients with DM (AD -2.27 [95% CI -4.47, -0.07]). The diagnostic performance for rule-in of AMI (PPV) was comparable in both groups: 0/1-h (AD 6.59 [95% CI -19.53, 6.35]) and 0/3-h (AD 1.03 [95% CI -7.63, 9.7]). Alternative cutoffs increased the PPV in both algorithms significantly, while improvements in NPV were only subtle. Application of the ESC 0/1-h algorithm revealed comparable safety to rule out AMI comparing patients with and without DM, while this was not observed with the ESC 0/3-h algorithm. Although alternative cutoffs might be helpful, patients with DM remain a high-risk population in whom identification of AMI is challenging and who require careful clinical evaluation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31843947/"}

VA patients who had undergone major surgery and experienced a postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina between the years 2005 and 2009 were identified from administrative databases. VA pharmacy records were used to determine whether a prescription for aspirin was filled after the postoperative MI or unstable angina. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odd ratios of filling aspirin prescriptions for the predictors of interest. Of the 321,131 men and women veterans who underwent major surgery, 7,700 experienced a postoperative MI or unstable angina. Among those 7,700, 47% filled an aspirin prescription. Only 59% of veterans with no co-pay filled an aspirin prescription. Aspirin fills were more common in younger veterans, Blacks, Hispanics, males, hypertensive veterans, mentally ill patients, those with no co-pay and those prescribed antiplatelets/anticoagulants in addition to aspirin postoperatively.

The primary end point was the composite of all in-hospital PCI complications defined by the American College of Cardiology's National Cardiovascular Data Registry: (1) catheterization laboratory events such as no-reflow and dissection/perforation, (2) general clinical events such as stroke or cardiogenic shock, (3) vascular and bleeding complications, and (4) miscellaneous complications such as peak troponin or creatinine levels. Logistic regression adjusted for differences in measured confounders between patients treated with and without presence of an ICFIT. All analyses were repeated after excluding PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Of 2,605 PCI procedures at the academic hospital between July 2007 and April 2010, an ICFIT was present for 1,638 procedures (63%). Despite having worse clinical and procedural characteristics, patients in the ICFIT group experienced similar rates of the composite end point (12.9% vs 14.5% without ICFIT, p = 0.27). Longer mean fluoroscopy times and greater number of stents were noted in the ICFIT group; however, hospital length of stay was shorter and no individual adverse events were increased in the ICFIT procedures. Presence of an ICFIT remained unrelated to the composite end point after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.20; p = 0.53), and findings were similar after excluding PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is planning a revision of the 2000 and 2003 guidance documents on clinical investigation of new medicinal products for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to achieve consistency with current knowledge in the field. This manuscript summarizes the key output from a collaborative workshop, organized by the Cardiovascular Round Table and the European Affairs Committee of the European Society of Cardiology, involving clinicians, academic researchers, trialists, European and US regulators, and pharmaceutical industry researchers. Specific questions in four key areas were selected as priorities for changes in regulatory guidance: patient selection, endpoints, methodologic issues and issues related to the research for novel agents. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) should be studied separately for therapies aimed at the specific pathophysiology of either condition, particularly for treatment of the acute phase, but can be studied together for other treatments, especially long-term therapy. Unstable angina patients should be excluded from acute phase ACS trials. In general, cardiovascular death and reinfarction are recommended for primary efficacy endpoints; other endpoints may be considered if specifically relevant for the therapy under study. New agents or interventions should be tested against a background of evidence-based therapy with expanded follow-up for safety assessment. In conclusion, new guidance documents for randomized controlled trials in ACS should consider changes regarding patient and endpoint selection and definitions, and trial designs.

However, this relationship was not observed in revascularized lesions (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.02; <i>P</i>=0.70). For lesions with FFR ≥0.76, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was not significantly different between deferred and revascularized lesions. Conversely, in lesions with FFR ≤0.75, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in revascularized lesions than in deferred lesions (for FFR 0.71-0.75, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.89; <i>P</i>=0.021; for FFR ≤0.70, adjusted hazard ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.84; <i>P</i>=0.012). This large, prospective registry showed that the FFR value was linearly associated with the risk of cardiac events in deferred lesions. In addition, revascularization for coronary artery stenosis with a low FFR (≤0.75) was associated with better outcomes than the deferral, whereas for a stenosis with a high FFR (≥0.76), medical treatment would be a reasonable and safe treatment strategy.

The median age of our NSTEMI study population was 77 years, 48% were female, and 87% were white. Overall, inhospital and 1-year mortality rates were 6.0% and 24.5%, respectively. When compared with patients treated in 2003, NSTEMI patients treated in 2006 were more likely to receive guideline-recommended inhospital medications and early invasive treatment. Inhospital mortality decreased significantly over the study period (5.5% vs 7.2% [adjusted odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.67-1.00, P = .045] for 2006 vs 2003), but there was no significant change in 1-year mortality from the index admission (24.0% vs 26.0% [adjusted hazard ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.90-1.08] for 2006 vs 2003). Between 2003 and 2006, there was a significant reduction in inhospital mortality that corresponded to an increase in the use of evidence-based NSTEMI care.

Record linkage to subsequent Hospital Episode Statistics and Registrar General's death records provided follow up information on procedures and mortality up to eighteen months after admission. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the main hypothesis controlling for confounding. The main outcome measure was 18-month survival after myocardial infarction.

Cardiology and cardiovascular surgery represent a large part of this cost, reflecting the many new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures developed over the past 2 decades. Previous cost containment attempts failed because they provided no incentive to reduce spending for advanced technologies and procedures. A method of payment based on a case mix of 467 diagnosis related groups (DRGs), average duration of hospital stay and location of hospitals has been developed for Medicare. A 4-year trial using this method in New Jersey resulted in lower hospital costs per capita than in the rest of the country. In October 1983, a 3-year phase-in for all Medicare payments by the DRG method began. The 43 DRGs assigned to cardiology and cardiovascular surgery are among the highest-weighted for large reimbursement; thus, with the great number of aging patients with cardiac diagnoses, cardiology represents a very large share of the cost of medical care today. Because the quality of care can be determined and compared directly with costs, cardiology DRGs lend themselves to careful analysis. Three components will be examined. Coronary bypass surgery is the largest single reimbursement, thus the rationale for its use should be carefully studied.

At the same time, new drugs have become available but also different diagnostic, interventional and therapeutic procedures have been developed, resulting in better patient treatment and improved outcomes. These new devices require a high degree of specialization and specific skills that not every cardiologist is always used to. Consequently, specific training programs on intensive cardiac care for cardiologists working in ICCUs are clearly warranted. The present paper describes the advanced training programs on intensive cardiac care endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology and the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO). Both projects aim at improving current knowledge and skills of intensive cardiologists on specific pharmacologic and technical procedures, extending the competence of trained cardiologists to the management of critically ill cardiac patients, and uniforming the quality of care in any ICCU.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20380336/"}

Currently, the only decision limit formally endorsed with regard to the cardiac troponins is the 99th percentile. This is a \"rule-in\" criterion, intended to ensure that only persons with the acute coronary syndrome are reviewed. The 99th percentile is an arbitrary cut point and there are many problems associated with its application, including defining a truly healthy population, the difficulty of standardisation of cardiac troponin assays, especially but not only cardiac troponin I, and the effects of age and sex on this parameter. The Emergency Department (ED) screens many more persons for possible acute coronary syndromes than actually have the condition and their needs are best met by a \"rule-out\" test that enables them to clear their busy departments of the many persons who do not actually have the condition. The needs of the ED are not optimally met using the 99th percentile. The index of individuality for the cardiac troponins is small and significant changes consistent with an acute coronary syndrome can occur without the 99th percentile being exceeded. It appears that the ED may be better served by use of delta troponin changes rather than the 99th percentile, but there are problems with this approach, particularly in persons who present late when troponin release has plateaued. In addition, there are many non-acute coronary syndrome causes for cardiac troponin release. The needs of the cardiologist and the ED physician are so different that it may be inappropriate for both groups to use the same diagnostic criteria for cardiac troponin, and it is of great importance that cardiac troponin measurement be used as only one part of the assessment of the person presenting with possible acute coronary syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25397345/"}

In this retrospective study, CMR examinations of 303 hospitalized patients referred for work-up of suspected AM in two tertiary referral centres were analysed. CMR was performed at median 7 days (interquartile range 4-20 days) after clinical presentation and included cine imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and late gadolinium enhancement. CMR images were evaluated to assign each patient to a diagnosis. By using non-CMR criteria only, the 2013 ESC-PSC were positive for suspected myocarditis in 151 patients and negative in 30. In the remaining 122 patients, there was insufficient information available for ESC-PSC assessment, mostly due to lack of coronary angiography (CAG) before the CMR examination (n = 116, 95%). There were no in-hospital deaths. CMR provided a diagnosis in 158 patients (52%), including myocarditis in 104 (34%), myocardial infarction in 44 (15%), and other pathology in 10 patients (3%). Non-urgent CAG (>24 h after presentation) was performed before the CMR examination in 85 patients, of which 20 (24%) were done in patients with subsequently confirmed AM, which could potentially have been avoided if CMR was performed first. ESC-PSC was correct in diagnosing AM before the CMR in 50 of the 151 patients (33%) and was correct in ruling out AM in all the 30 patients (100%). However, ESC-PSC provided an incorrect diagnosis of AM in 27 of the 151 patients (18%), which was corrected by CMR through the identification of new cardiac disease that could explain the clinical syndrome. Patients with insufficient ESC-PSC information had a relatively low pre-test probability of coronary artery disease. In this group, CMR confirmed the diagnosis of AM in a relatively high percentage (44%) but still revealed myocardial infarction in 8% of them. Tissue characterization by CMR provided a good diagnostic yield in this large clinical population of patients with suspected AM. CMR provided incremental diagnostic value to the ESC-PSC by ruling out the diagnosis of AM on one hand and by potentially sparing AM patients from CAG on the other.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29186442/"}

Once a tool of the cardiologist, the standard exercise test is now being performed by internists and other noncardiologists. Because this change could be facilitated by computerization similar to the computerized interpretation programs available for the resting electrocardiograph (ECG), we performed this analysis. A secondary aim was to demonstrate the effects of medication status and resting ECG abnormalities on test diagnostic characteristics because these factors affect utility of the exercise test by the generalist. A retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive patients referred at 2 university-affiliated Veteran's Affairs Medical Centers and a Hungarian Hospital for evaluation of chest pain and possible ischemic heart disease. There were 1384 consecutive male patients without a prior myocardial infarction with complete data who had exercise tests and coronary angiography between 1987 and 1997. Measurements included clinical, exercise test data, and visual interpretation of the ECG recordings as well as more than 100 computed measurements from the digitized ECG recordings and compilation of angiographic data from clinical reports. The computer measurements had similar diagnostic power compared with visual interpretation. Computerized measurements from maximal exercise or recovery were equivalent or superior to all other measurements. Prediction equations applied by computer were superior to single ECG measurements. Beta-blockers had no effect on test characteristics, whereas resting ST depression was associated with decreased specificity and increased sensitivity. Computerized exercise ST measurements are comparable to visual ST measurements by a cardiologist; computerized scores that included clinical and exercise test results exhibited the greatest diagnostic power. Applying scores with a computer allows the practicing physician to improve the diagnostic characteristics of the standard exercise test. This approach is successful even when there is resting ST depression, thus lessening the need for more expensive nuclear or imaging studies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9736150/"}

Twenty-five discordant interpretations were likely clinically significant--representing missed ischemia, infarct, and abnormal rhythm. There was no ED interpretation in three of these. The most frequently missed findings by emergency physicians were evidence of ischemia/infarct of the anterior wall and atrial fibrillation. Twenty-one of the 83 patients with discordant interpretations were lost to follow-up. Two cases had a clinically significant discrepancy that would have altered patient care.

A recent debate has been held in the scientific community about the correct interpretation of guidelines and the methods concerning the process of their implementation. Some of their limitations have been discussed as well. Many evidences collected in the guidelines are drawn by randomized clinical trials, some others by national and international surveys. The number of the surveys has rapidly increased in recent years, in both the international (ENACT, GRACE, Euro Heart Survey ACS, NRMI) and the Italian setting; some of these have been organized by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO), either as national surveys (BLITZ-1 and BLITZ-2) or as regional or local registries (AI-CARE2, VENERE, GestIMA). In these reports a gap between the evidence-based recommendations of guidelines for acute coronary syndromes and actual clinical practice was documented. The lack of compliance with guidelines appears to be prevalent across a variety of medical conditions. The reluctance of physicians to apply the guidelines regarding the performance of an early invasive strategy, or the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or thienopyridines is sometimes due to concerns that guidelines may not be valid in certain subsets of high-risk patients encountered in daily clinical practice or to inadequacy in the way care for acute coronary syndromes is delivered. Observational studies attempt to understand how clinical practice may be modified through continuous feedback. ANMCO, like other associations of cardiologists, is focusing its efforts on the improvement of the quality of care for acute coronary syndromes through educational interventions that target cardiologists involved in the care of patients, and on the improvement of the appropriate use of invasive cardiac procedures and other guideline recommendations mainly in high-risk patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16749292/"}

For many years, these patients were considered inapt to perform physical exercise and they are in the same situation at the dawn of the year 2000 as patients with myocardial infarction forty years ago. The symptoms of cardiac failure (dyspnoea of effort and muscular fatigue) are not only the consequence of pulmonary hypertension and decreased muscular perfusion. Prolonged interruption of exercise and long stays in bed or in a chair lead to anatomical and functional amyotrophy, which, in turns, incites to further inactivity. Deconditioned respiratory muscles cannot tolerate the increased load of hyperventilation. Neurohormonal changes cause vasoconstriction which reduces muscular perfusion. Physical training can significantly improve these abnormalities, though it does not seem to have a measurable effect on cardiac function; based on segmental work which enables performance of substantial efforts with a minimum of haemodynamic changes, it provides a 20 to 30% gain in capacity, mainly increasing the duration of submaximal exercise rather than maximum performance. Muscular fatigue is the symptom which is the most improved. Unfortunately the organisation, which is more difficult than in the post-infarction period, and the generalisation of the practice of long-term, well adapted physical training remains marginal although hundreds of thousands of patients could benefit; more than the inertia of the official instances concerning anything related to cardiac rehabilitation, it is the lack of interest shown by cardiologists and the absence of flexible structures within the health care organisation for elderly people which are responsible.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9864610/"}
{"id": "2958799", "title": "[Sudden death of cardiac origin].", "text": "Every minute one patient in the world suddenly dies, of heart disease in the vast majority of the cases. Most of these sudden deaths of cardiac origin are due to ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation on a background of ischaemic heart disease. It is now recognized that as much as left ventricular dysfunction these ventricular arrhythmias are of sombre prognosis. To prevent sudden death of cardiac origin, therefore, patients with severe ventricular arrhythmia and consequently at high risk must be identified. Among examinations used for this purpose, the Holter monitoring method is of considerable value as it provides qualitative and, mostly, quantitative information on the arrhythmia. Programmed stimulation--a much more invasive method--has a prognostic value which varies from one author to another. On the other hand, late potentials recording is a simple and innocuous procedure, apparently most reliable as indicator of complex ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. In spite of all these recent technical advances, the prevention of cardiac sudden death remains problematic since no epidemiological study has yet demonstrated that major reduction or even suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs can significantly reduce the coronary mortality rate.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2958799/"}

The aim of the study was the assessment of early and long-term prognosis in all the patients with CHD treated invasively in one large-volume PCI center in 2005. 1390 consecutive patients with CHD treated with PCI in 2005 were included in the analysis. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) accounted for 50% of cases, patients with stable angina (SA) amounted to 25%, and patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) constituted 25%. Mean follow-up was 738 (±237) days. The highest mortality during the hospitalization was noted within the STEMI group(SA vs. NSTE-ACS vs. STEMI; 0% vs. 0.3% vs. 4.1%, respectively; p<0.001). The highest mortality during a 2-year follow-up was also observed in the STEMI group (SA vs. NSTE-ACS vs. STEMI, 6.3% vs. 8.5% vs. 13.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Multiple regression model showed that independent risk factors for death during the follow-up were: age, glycaemia at admission, heart rate, blood pressure, ejection fraction, STEMI, ineffective PCI (R=0.3613; F(10.131)=19.672; p<0.0001 for the model). The highest relative increase of mortality after the discharge of patients with CHD undergoing PCI referred to the patients with NSTE-ACS. However, in the real life PCI practice STEMI patients have the worst hospital and long-term prognosis. Well recognized risk factors for death in patients with CHD are still of great importance in negative prognosis of patients undergoing PCI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21940265/"}

The most current diagnostic methods were relatively scarce at the time-ECG, chest X ray, phonocardiography, pulse wave tracings, coupled with vectorcardiography and ballistocardiography, but in the well equipped hospitals right ventricular catheterization was already performed. The therapeutics of the important morbid situations-like congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction and ischemia was disappointing, but closed heart surgery was already taking place. Since then, things had changed suddenly. Over the last 40 years a marked scientific and technology explosion has emerged, that had benefited cardiology science, encompassing several broad areas, namely, patient approaching, pathophysiology understanding, the emergence of new drugs and clinical use, interventional cardiology and remarkable progress in open heart surgery. Imaging techniques development and other technology lead to a simple and accurate cardiac diagnosis. 24 hours ECG and blood pressure recording, and cardiac output measurement, greatly improves our medical knowledge. Computers development, representing the most significant technology advances, has given to cardiology non-predicted advances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2206585/"}

The location of infarction was detected toward typical ECG changes. The analysis included the model of death in patients with AMI and in-hospital mortality of patients undergoing the PCI procedures. The patients in the first group were treated with the standard medication therapy, and the patients in the second group were treated with PCI. The number of hospitalized patients with AMI, in ten years, increased from 475 to 652. A total of 5339 patients with AMI were hospitalized, and included 67.5% males and 32.5% females. The first group included 2336 patients (68% males and 32% females). The second group included 2973 patients (67% males and 33% females). Male patients in average were 5 years younger than female patients. A total in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the first group (13.5 vs. 7.6%). The mortality in the first group was significantly higher in females (22.7 vs. 12%) and in males (9 vs. 5.5%) comparing with second group.

A trainee in cardiology blindly reported 51 consecutive DSEs from a database of post-infarction studies, after 2 and 4 months of systematic training. We compared his interpretation with that of an expert. Agreement between the trainee and the expert improved significantly from 2 to 4 months of training in the left anterior descending artery territory for the overall scan interpretation (from kappa = 0.58 to kappa = 0.73; p = 0.03), wall thickening assessment in individual segments (from kappa = 0.40 to kappa = 0.55; p < 0.01) and the diagnosis of viable myocardium (from kappa = 0.11 to kappa = 0.43; p = 0.01).

The participants in this 12-month prospective study were 153 consecutive patients with low-risk myocardial infarction (MI) referred to their primary care center for follow-up care. Of these patients, 113 were referred to a mixed primary and specialized care program that included physical exercise, cardiovascular risk control, an antismoking program, health education talks and psychological evaluation. The other 40 patients served as controls. We analyzed the results after 3 months and 1 year of follow-up. There were no differences between the two groups at baseline. After 1 year, improvements were seen in smoking habit (4.6% vs 15.6%; P<.05) and body mass index (26 [2] vs 29 [2]; P<.05). Dyslipidemia, glucose and blood pressure were similar in both groups after follow-up. Greater improvements in the group of patients who participated in the program were seen after 1 year in quality of life (78 [2] vs 91 [2]; P<.05), exercise capacity (10.3 [2] vs 8.4 [3]; P<<.01) and return to active employment (84.6% vs 53.3%; P<.05). After 1 year of follow-up, the cardiac rehabilitation program coordinated by cardiological and primary care services for low-risk post-MI patients improved quality of life, and increased exercise tolerance, active employment, and the number of participants who quit smoking.

There is no basic agreement among highly qualified cardiologists as to the assessment of risk signalled by the individual signs. Patients with unstable angina are not a homogeneous sample as regards the short-term prognosis of myocardial infarction where infarction risks seem to increase at a relatively even pace rather than by peaks.

We sought to present the practice guideline used at a high prevalence tertiary cardiology center and compare its safety and efficacy performance with the single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T strategy, conventional and modified HEART score. In this prospective cohort study, consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain or an angina equivalent were recruited. The primary endpoints consisted of major adverse cardiac events at index visits and 30-day follow-up. Patients were managed according to the practice guideline, and sensitivity and negative predictive values were compared. Of the total 1548 patients, the mean age was 50.4 ± 15.7 years. Ninety-nine (10.9%) patients were admitted at the index visit, and 89 patients were consequently diagnosed with acute coronary symptoms. Six (0.007%) patients experienced major adverse cardiac events within the 30-day follow-up among discharged patients. Among 911 patients with at least 1 troponin, using single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, HEART score, and modified HEART score would have further admitted 805, 450, and 609 patients, respectively. The negative predictive value for all 4 algorithms did not significantly differ (99.2% vs. 100% vs. 99.3% vs. 99.6%, respectively). The Tehran Herat Center protocol was a relatively safe protocol with high efficacy. Despite the high safety of the other diagnostic pathways, the high volume of patients needing additional evaluation could impose a high burden on the health care system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36413397/"}

Acute myocardial infarction database records were reviewed. An 11-question survey was created and sent to 45 physicians. The survey measured perceptions of public reporting, report cards, tools (order sets, pocket guides), and perceptions of their own compliance. Physician perceptions, specialty, patient variables age, gender, angiogram performance, and mortality were compared with guideline compliance (meeting >or=3 indicators). Ten hypotheses were tested. Results showed a correlation between guideline compliance and physician perception of report cards, as well as perception of their own performance. Interventional cardiologists were more compliant than noninterventional cardiologists or hospitalists/intensivists. Patient but not physician age mattered.

Today, cardiac cell-based therapy using de novo produced cardiac cells is considered as a novel approach for cardiac regenerative medicine. Recently, an alchemy-like approach, known as direct reprogramming or direct conversion, has been developed to directly convert somatic cells to cardiac cells in vitro and in vivo. This cellular alchemy is a short-cut and safe strategy for generating autologous cardiac cells, and it can be accomplished through activating cardiogenesis- or pluripotency-related factors in noncardiac cells. Importantly, pluripotency factors-based direct cardiac conversion, known as partial reprogramming, is shorter and more efficient for cardiomyocyte generation in vitro. Today, this strategy is achievable for direct conversion of mouse and human somatic cells to cardiac lineage cells (cardiomyocytes and cardiac progenitor cells), using transgene free, chemical-based approaches. Although, heart-specific partial reprogramming seems to be challenging for in vivo conversion of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiac cells, but whole organism-based in vivo partial reprogramming ameliorates cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and prolongs lifespan in mouse. Notably, cardiac cells produced using partial reprogramming strategy can be a useful platform for disease modeling, drug screening and cardiac cell-based therapy, once the safety issues are overcome. Herein, we discuss about all progresses in de novo production of cardiac cells using partial reprogramming-based direct conversion, as well as give an overview about the potential applications of this strategy in vivo and in vitro.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31081174/"}

There has been increasing pressure to limit access to specialists as a method to reduce the cost of health care. There is little known about the effect on outcome of this shift in the care of acutely ill patients. We analyzed the data from 30,715 direct hospital admissions for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania in 1993. A risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality model was developed in which 12 of 20 clinical variables were significant independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. To determine whether there were factors other than patient risk that significantly influenced in-hospital mortality, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on physician, hospital and payer variables. After adjustment for patient characteristics, a multiple logistic regression analysis identified treatment by a cardiologist (odds ratio=0.83 [confidence interval ¿CI¿=0.74 to 0.94] p < 0.003) and physicians treating a high volume of acute myocardial infarction patients (odds ratio=0.89 [CI=0.80 to 0.99] p < 0.03) as independent predictors of lower in-hospital mortality. Treatment by a cardiologist as compared to primary care physicians was also associated with a significantly lower length of stay for both medically treated patients (p < 0.01) and those undergoing revascularization (p < 0.01). Treatment by a cardiologist is associated with approximately a 17% reduction in hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction patients. In addition, patients of physicians treating a high volume of patients have approximately an 11% reduction in mortality.

Overall, there was a decrease in early CV events by 26% in patients with PIA (19.2% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.002). By multivariate analysis, PIA remained independently associated with less VAs. From this large contemporary prospective study, our work showed that PIA is very frequent in patients admitted for a first NSTEMI, and is associated with a better prognosis, including reduced infarct size and in hospital VAs.

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched to identify reviews that address the objectives of this overview. Data presentation is descriptive with tabular presentations of review- and trial-level characteristics and results. The six included Cochrane systematic reviews were of high methodological quality and included 148 randomised controlled trials in 97,486 participants. Compared to usual care alone, exercise-based CR reduces hospital admissions and improves patient health related quality of life (HRQL) in low to moderate risk heart failure and coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. At 12 months or more follow-up, there was evidence of some reduction in mortality in patients with CHD. Psychological- and education-based interventions appear to have little impact on mortality or morbidity but may improve HRQL. Home- and centre-based programmes are equally effective in improving HRQL at similar costs. Selected interventions can increase the uptake of CR programmes but evidence to support interventions that improve adherence is weak. This overview confirms that exercise-based CR is effective and safe in the management of clinically stable heart failure and post-MI and PCI patients.

To measure the number of misallocations (in the assignation of DRGs) due to the utilization of ICD9 rather than ICD9 CM. Discharge data on 125 admissions (95% confidence interval for the 4% error rate in the estimate of percentage of misallocations) in 1996 to the cardiology division of Castelfranco Veneto, were assigned to HFCA-DRG, 10th version. A pair of DRGs was assigned for every admission: one DRG was assigned coding directly in ICD9 CM and the other one was coded in ICD9 and then transcoded in ICD9 CM through the Italian coding translation. Lastly, each pair of DRGs was compared by matching. There were 7 misallocations (5.6%): 4 misallocations (3.2%) were observed in the description of recent AMI (less than 8 weeks old); 2 misallocations (1.6%) were due to the different coding of postmyocardial infarction syndrome; 1 misallocation (0.8%) was observed in shock DRG. In cardiology, the percentage of misallocation is higher than in other divisions that, in other papers, showed a percentage of misallocation that did not exceed 2.0%. In particular, by using ICD9 rather than ICD9 CM, DRGs of AMI are over-estimated and DRG of coronography are under-estimated.

Adjusted 1-year mortality did not differ significantly between patients of attending cardiologists and generalist physicians (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.35) or between patients of generalist physicians with and without a consulting cardiologist (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.16).

These organic causes are intertwined with psychological and pharmacological causes because medication prescribed for heart disease patients may also cause ED. The incidence of ED after myocardial infarction ranges from 38 to 78%. As sexual intercourse involves physical exertion, the medical history, ventricular function determined through echocardiography, and stress testing are used to classify patients into various groups where coital activity represents a greater or lesser cardiovascular risk. The energy requirements for intercourse are not high, ranging from 3.7 metabolic equivalents (METs) of energy expenditure at resting state during the preorgasmic phase to 5 METs during orgasm. The Bruce protocol for exercise stress testing is a six-stage protocol with changes in the slope and speed of the treadmill. As a general rule, a patient who completes the first two stages of the Bruce protocol has a functional capacity greater than 7 METs, which is considered sufficient for sexual intercourse. The physician or cardiologist concerned should institute first-line treatment with oral drugs according to the indications listed below. If sexual activity is not contraindicated, the treatment of choice for ED in heart disease patients is oral therapy with sildenafil, except in those cases in which its use is contraindicated.

This study investigates the relationship between in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and admission during national cardiology meeting dates. Using an administrative database, we analyzed patients with AMI admitted to acute care hospitals in Japan from 2011 to 2013. There were 3 major national cardiology meetings held each year. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to compare in-hospital mortality and treatment patterns between patients admitted on meeting dates and those admitted on identical days during the week before and after the meeting dates. We identified 6,332 eligible patients, with 1,985 patients admitted during 26 meeting days and 4,347 patients admitted during 52 non-meeting days. No significant differences between meeting and non-meeting dates were observed for in-hospital mortality (7.4% vs. 8.5%, respectively; p=0.151, unadjusted odds ratio: 0.861, 95% confidence interval: 0.704-1.054) and the proportion of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) performed on the day of admission (75.9% vs. 76.2%, respectively; p=0.824). We also found that some low-staffed hospitals did not treat AMI patients during meeting dates. Little or no \"national meeting effect\" was observed on in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, and PCI rates were similar for both meeting and non-meeting dates.

Although there has been a recent decrease in mortality from this condition in many Western countries, the incidence has remained the same, and coronary atherosclerosis continues to be the leading cause of death. Our understanding of the disease process has been steadily increasing; however, much still needs to be clarified. The clinical presentations of coronary artery disease are diverse and not clearly linked to the severity or extent of the disease. Patients with similar coronary lesions present variously with stable and unstable angina or myocardial infarction, and all too many have sudden death as the initial clinical presentation. Recently, much attention has focused on the initial events leading to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Current concepts unite formerly opposed views on the roles of intimal injury, platelets, lipids, and monoclonal smooth muscle cell proliferation in initiating atherogenesis. Progress has been made in understanding the early structural and functional alterations caused by myocardial ischemia. This understanding is leading to the development of interventions such as intracoronary thrombolysis to prevent or limit permanent myocardial injury. Measures to prevent serious complications of ischemic heart disease such as infarct rupture, aneurysm formation, and ischemic cardiomyopathy are still needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6544647/"}

The management of arterial hypertension saw beta-blockers demoted from first- to third-line treatment. Recent studies suggest that the goal of treatment may have to change to lower systolic blood pressures to prevent long-term organ damage. Today less than 15% of coronary revascularizations are surgical and more than 85% are done by interventional cardiologists inserting coronary stents. Thus, managing patients on dual antiplatelet therapy has become an important issue. With new generations of coronary stents, recommendations are changing fast. In the past, decisions concerning non-cardiac surgery after acute myocardial infarction were based on the delay between infarction and non-cardiac surgery. Today, the main concern is the patient's status in respect of dual antiplatelet therapy after primary percutaneous intervention. There have been advances in the management of heart failure but new drugs (ivabradine, sacubitril/valsartan) and cardiac resynchronization are recommended only in patients with an ejection fraction below 35% on optimal medication. Heart failure remains a major perioperative risk factor. Prospective studies have shown that troponin elevations represent myocardial injury (not necessarily myocardial infarction), are mostly silent and are associated with increased 30-day mortality. Monitoring (troponin assays) for myocardial injury in non-cardiac surgery (MINS) seems increasingly justified. The treatment of MINS needs further research.

All the hospital files of 1999 of the Federation of Cardiology of Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, of patients who died in the department or after transfer to the intensive care unit or cardiac surgery department, were analysed. Myocardial ischaemia was the leading cause of death, occurring either in the acute phase of transmural infarction or in patients with chronic cardiac failure. Deaths occurring during acute myocardial infarction were associated with late treatment and/or non-reperfusion of the culprit artery. The delay of diagnosis seemed to be secondary to late consultation or difficulty in diagnosis. This resulted in severe left ventricular dysfunction and, in a quarter of cases, mechanical complications. They led to the early death of the patients (2.9 +/- 3.5 days after admission). Campaigns of patient information and education of doctors who see these patients would seem to be the most appropriate approach to reduce the delay before hospital admission in order to reduce mortality related to myocardial infarction. Cardiac failure is a common cause of death in cardiology departments. The deaths of patients occurred after a long follow-up and several days after hospital admission (11 +/- 10 days). Optimisation of the treatment of cardiac failure, the investigation of ischaemic heart disease, the search for new therapeutic strategies of acute cardiac failure and information of patients about their disease, seem to be the principal measures to take to improve the poor prognosis of this disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11794981/"}

Individuals from the Toronto Lupus Clinic with at least 2 years of follow-up and no prior AVE were divided in three groups according to their mean blood pressure (BP) over that period (≥140/90 mm Hg, 130-139/80-89 mm Hg and <130/80 mm Hg). They were followed until the first occurrence of an AVE (fatal or non-fatal coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease) or last visit.

Compared to the non-LVFWR group the LVFWR group was characterised by an older age (70.3 ± 3.4 vs. 65.2 ± 9.9 years, p 〈 0.001) and a higher percentage of females (75.0% vs. 60.2%, p 〈 0.001). The LVFWR group was also characterised by a higher percentage of IEs in the past (61.2% vs. 40.2%, p = 0.003), a lower percentage of patients with a history of MI (14.2% vs. 33.4%, p = 0.004), a higher percentage of patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (77.5% vs. 61.5%, p = 0.03), a longer interval from the onset of symptoms to PCI (9.0 ± 5.5 vs. 4.5 ± 3.2 h, p 〈 0.001) and a lower percentage of patients with IEs in the past but without an MI (6.1% vs. 23.9%, p 〈 0.001). Our study showed that independent risk factors for LVFWR in the setting of AMI were: older age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.02-1.19), male sex (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.52) and a longer interval between the onset of symptoms and PCI (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.47). A previous history of IEs in patients without a previous history of AMI was a protective factor against the development of LVFWR in the setting of AMI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22825948/"}

In the five years since the issue of the Second Report of the Joint Cardiology Committee in 1980 the specialty has been affected principally by the increase in coronary artery surgery and the increasing importance of non-invasive techniques of diagnosis, particularly echocardiography. The burden of heart disease in Britain shows some decline recently, but this falls short of that which has occurred in other countries. The vital role of the initial assessment of patients to ensure the efficient use of limited resources falls upon physicians and paediatricians in district general hospitals. Each district general hospital should have at least one physician, practising general medicine but having a special expertise and training in cardiology. He should undertake echocardiography, stress testing, ambulatory monitoring, emergency pacing, rehabilitation, and cardiac intensive care, with the necessary facilities and staff. He will also play an important part in the follow up of patients assessed and treated at cardiac centres. Paediatricians should continue to evaluate children with heart disease and their training should include periods at cardiac centres. Cardiac centres currently undertaking invasive investigations and cardiac surgery need to expand to cope with demand. A target figure of 750-1000 coronary artery bypass operations annually is suggested. This implies three or four surgeons and six cardiologists per centre. Other staffing should be based on these figures. Smaller centres are not necessarily non-viable but should be encouraged to expand or merge. Funding should be clarified so that regional contributions to regional services are identified and not lost in district budgets. Expensive capital equipment should be regionally funded whether sited in cardiac centres of district general hospitals. (7) Supraregional centres for the cardiac problems of infants under the age of one year have been identified ans should receive supraregional funding. Their staffing and equipment should be appropriate to the exceptional demands of this work. If such a centre is sited within an existing cardiac centre the staff will be additional to those needed for the adult work. Facilities for older children should continue to be provided, as at present, at all cardiac centres. (8) Cardiac transplantation should be funded supraregionally. (9) The medical audit of cardiac work should be supported by the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). (10) Research remains a high priority, and cardiac centres should be provided with the facilities, and staff with the contracts and time, to undertake it. (11) A revision of this report is recommended within five years.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3994860/"}

Coronary MRA and some other new MR techniques are close to its wide-scale clinical application. It has been shown that cardiac MRI is a valuable tool for detection of postinfarction scars, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, septal defects, mural thrombi and valvular regurgitations. Due to intrinsic advantages of the method it is of special value when these pathological conditions cannot be fully confirmed or excluded with echocardiography. MRI is recognized as the best imaging method for quantification of myocardial thickness, myocardial mass, systolic myocardial thickening, chamber volumes, ejection fraction and other parameters of global and regional systolic and diastolic function. MRI is used in studies of cardiac remodeling in postinfarction patients. The most attractive areas for cardiovascular applications of MRI are assessment of myocardial perfusion and non-invasive coronary angiography. Substantial progress has been achieved in these directions. There are some other new developments in studies of coronary artery disease with MRI. High-resolution MR is used for imaging and quantification of atherosclerotic plaque composition in vivo. Intravascular MR devices suitable for performing imaging-guided balloon angioplasty are created. But before MRI will be widely accepted by the medical community as a important cardiovascular imaging modality several important problems have to be solved. Further technical advances are necessary for clinical implementation of all major diagnostic capabilities of cardiac MRI. The subjective obstacles for growth of clinical applications of cardiac MRI are lack of understanding of its possibilities and benefits both by clinicians and radiologists themselves. So proper training of specialists and promotion of this promising modality among the medical community are necessary.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11399372/"}

On the other hand, right ventricular infarction and precordial ST-segment depression are not predictive of poor outcome. In addition, thrombolysis reduced inhospital mortality in patients with an age above 64 years, male gender, lateral wall extension, haemodynamically-significant right ventricular infarction and complete atrioventricular block.

Data were provided by 108 hospitals (72 public and 36 private) that mainly treat adults, Covering 138,480 diagnostic procedures, 123,746 of which were coronary angiograms, slightly more than the year before, with a rate of 3008 coronary angiograms per million population. Percutaneous coronary interventions decreased slightly to 63,202 procedures with a rate of 1373 interventions per million population. Of the 94,701 stents implanted, 61% were drug-eluting stents. In the acute phase of myocardial infarction, 15,491 coronary interventions were performed, 9.4% more than in 2010, representing 24.6% of the total number of coronary interventions. The most frequent intervention for adult congenital heart disease was atrial septal defect closure (298 procedures). Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty continued to decrease (286 procedures) and percutaneous aortic valve implantations increased, but at a slower pace than in the previous year, with 770 units implanted in 2011. The greatest increase in activity has occurred in the field of myocardial infarction and percutaneous aortic valve implantation. The number of other procedures, both diagnostic and therapeutic, remained stable.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063310/"}

In only three men did the terminal attack last more than 24 hours, while in the remaining 28% of cases, although death was not witnessed these were also likely to have been sudden deaths. A recent infarct with or without an old myocardial infarct was found at autopsy in 47% of cases and an old infarct alone in 34%. In 19% of coronary deaths no recent or old infarct was detected. The surface areas of the atherosclerotic lesions were assessed in arterial specimens by pointcounting. The degree of stenosis was estimated visually. The mean extent of raised lesions and clacification and the median value of stenosis score, which expressed the degree of stensosi in the coronary arterial tree, were significantly higher in all age groups in persons who died of coronary heart disease than in those who died violently. A marked overlapping between the individuals in the two series was, however, found in both for the exent of raised lesions and the severity of stenosis score. Raised lesions in coronary patients were calcified to about the same extent as those in persons ten years older in the series of violent deaths. Coronary atherosclerosis was most severe in coronary patients who had had symptomatic heart disease and had an old myocardial infarct and least severe in those in whome sudden death was the first manifestation of coronary heart disease from violent deaths as regards the extent of the raised lesions or prevalence of occlusion. The degree of coronary stenosis in coronary patients was closely related to the total extent of advanced coronary atherosclerosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1211856/"}

Consequently the condition should largely be preventable. The application of what is already known is likely to be a far more effective way of reducing the mortality rate than all attempts at palliative treatment, but vigorous action will be necessary. Much greater sums are being expended on coronary-care units and cardiac surgery than in preventing the need for them, although there is little evidence that they have significantly lowered the over-all mortality rate. Conventional treatment is immensely expensive. Prevention could in the long run be much cheaper. Cardiologists on their own are unlikely to succeed in a program of prevention. They need the help of many others, including community nurses, nutritionists, public health workers, sociologists, and of course general practitioners, but they have responsibility for leadership and for providing background knowledge. For the detection of certain risk factors, health examinations are necessary and should be part of general practice. Also, advice is best given on an individual basis. The chief-known risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity) could be controlled. CHD occurs in adults but atherosclerosis starts many years before. Prevention should begin with appropriate infant feeding, whenever possible with breast milk, and continue into childhood, when habits are formed and attitudes to life can best be influenced. It should be possible to bring up children virtually free from risk factors. It may never be possible to prove the effectiveness of such a multifactorial program by prospective controlled intervention studies, but the evidence indicates strong probability. The stakes are too high to delay action any longer. Physicians daily give advice in areas where the evidence is much less certain. Such a program for the control of coronary artery disease is urgently needed and could become one of the most rewarding activities for the medical profession.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1246924/"}

This explains the large demand for echocardiography and Holter monitoring in these patients. The frequency of cerebral embolism of cardiac origin, the simplification of the diagnostic approach by non-invasive investigations and the precision of ultrasound techniques explains the tendency towards the indiscriminate generalisation of this attitude. However, the large number of potential patients for investigation, the limited facilities of investigation and the incertitude over the responsibility of certain cardiac abnormalities with respect to the context and age, are arguments in favour of a more selective investigative approach. The keystone of diagnosis is careful history taking and clinical examination with interpretation of the ECG and chest X-ray. Three clinical situations may then be identified: 1) A cardiac abnormality known to be highly embolic is diagnosed from the outset (e.g. mitral stenosis, valve prosthesis, endocarditis, myocardial infarction). The diagnostic work-up is no longer etiological: echocardiography may show intracardiac thrombi or a valvular vegetation, reinforcing the causal relationship, but the complementary investigations are mainly useful for evaluation the cardiac disease and for deciding on curative or preventive therapy. 2) A cardiac abnormality is diagnosed but its responsibility is doubtful due to its high prevalence and low embolic potential. This is the case of patients with mitral valve prolapse, mitral annular calcification, calcific aortic stenosis and VVI pacing.

However, missed myocardial infarctions in patients who are inadvertently sent home from the ED have significant adverse outcomes and associated legal consequences. This leads to a liberal policy to admit patients with chest pain, presenting a substantial burden in terms of cost and resources. Many centers have developed chest pain centers, using a wide range of diagnostic modalities to deal with this dilemma. We discuss the methods currently available to exclude myocardial ischemia and infarction in the ED, focusing on the use of myocardial perfusion imaging as both an adjunct and an alternative to routine testing.

Subsequently, structural changes lead to left ventricular remodeling finally resulting in the development of heart failure. In addition to an optimal reperfusion and pharmacologinal post-infarction therapy, increased neovascularization and regeneration of cardiomyocytes could reduce or even abolish the ongoing left ventricular remodeling processes within the infarct area. Experimental studies have demonstrated that transplantation of adult progenitor cells leads to increased neovascularization, reduced fibrosis and, therefore, increased left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. In contrast to current treatment strategies, progenitor cell therapy offers a new regenerative approach for myocardial tissue. Initial clinical studies have demonstrated, apart from safety and feasibility of intracoronary infusion of adult autologous progenitor cells, a significant improvement of left ventricular function, geometry and vascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving intracoronary infusion of progenitor cells. However, in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, the improvement in contractility is less pronounced. Finally, whether intracoronary infusion of adult progenitor cells can also reduce morbidity and mortality due to heart failure, remains to be investigated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16953437/"}

{"id": "1711967", "title": "When is drug therapy warranted to prevent sudden cardiac death?", "text": "Sudden arrhythmic death is an important contributor to the mortality rate in patients with cardiac disease, accounting for over 450,000 deaths per year in the USA alone. About 80% of such patients, particularly those survivors of acute myocardial infarction with low ventricular ejection fractions, have coronary artery disease. The remainder have cardiomyopathy or valvular disease and the common denominator in all these subsets of patients is the association with complex and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The most common mechanism of death is ventricular tachycardia (VT) deteriorating into ventricular fibrillation (VF); the initiating factor is a PVC (the trigger mechanism). Thus, if an effective antiarrhythmic (? antifibrillatory) regimen could be identified, these subsets of patients clearly constitute targets for mortality reduction by pharmacological suppression. The question that has arisen is whether suppression of PVCs will reduce the incidence of sudden death (the PVC hypothesis). The alternative approach is to modify the arrhythmogenic substrate in the ventricle by eliminating the source of ischaemia, extirpating the ectopic focus, dividing re-entry circuits, or pharmacologically prolonging the refractory period so that VT does not deterioate into VF (the antifibrillatory approach). Whether sudden death in postinfarct survivors could be reduced has been the subject of study. These patients are at high risk of sudden death or reinfarction, the risk being greatest in those with a low ventricular ejection fraction, continuing myocardial ischaemia and asymptomatic high density and complex PVCs. Numerous trials have been performed to determine whether beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and antiarrhythmic agents reduce the incidence of sudden death and reinfarction in survivors of myocardial infarction. beta-Blockers remain the only agents which, when given prophylactically, have been found to reduce the incidence of sudden death and reinfarction (by 18 to 45% in the first 2 years after infarction). The reduced incidence of sudden death appears to be associated with a reduction in VF, but not in PVCs. A meta-analysis of data from trials with calcium antagonists found that these drugs either had no effect or tended to increase mortality (by an average of 6%), indicating that an effect on ischaemia alone is unlikely to be the sole mechanism mediating the effect of beta-blockers. The divergent effects of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are unexplained, but may be partly due to a lack of a significant bradycardiac effect of calcium antagonists. There were no differences in effect between different calcium antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1711967/"}

Risk factors predisposing toward sudden cardiac death in the postmyocardial infarction setting and in patients with congestive heart failure include the presence of ventricular ectopy [greater than 10 premature ventricular contractions (PVC) per hour], frequent episodes of ventricular pairs and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour Holter monitoring, and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Additional risk factors for sudden cardiac death in coronary artery disease include arterial stenosis in coronary vessels supplying intact myocardium remote from the infarction site, the presence of late potentials on the signal averaged ECG, and attenuation of the normal variation in heart rate. The ability to induce sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) on electrophysiological testing is highly predictive of sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction. Conversely, the ease of suppression of the induced tachycardia with antiarrhythmic agents is correlated with the risk of subsequent lethal ventricular arrhythmia. The detrimental effect of frequent ventricular ectopy (greater than 10 PVC/h) on survival in coronary artery disease is particularly pronounced in patients with moderately well preserved left ventricular function [ejection fraction (EF) greater than 30%], thereby suggesting that these patients may be better served by antiarrhythmic therapy than those with severely depressed left ventricular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1711965/"}

The atrial stimulation programme used one and two extra stimuli delivered during sinus rhythm and atrial pacing (600 ms and 10% less than the sinus cycle length). A sustained (S) (greater than 30 s) supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (atrial flutter, fibrillation, tachycardia) was induced in 17 patients in group I (11%) and in 120 patients in group II (40.5%). In group II inducible SVTA could not be correlated with the occurrence of a SVT during acute MI, the location of MI, the value of LV ejection fraction (EF), the incidence of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or fibrillation (VF). However, inducible SVTA could be correlated with a significantly shorter effective atrial refractory period (197 +/- 23 ms vs 220 +/- 35 ms, P less than 0.001) and a shorter retrograde block cycle length (518 +/- 215 vs 585 +/- 215 ms, P less than 0.03). The patients in group II were followed-up for at least 6 months; 12 of them developed sustained episodes of supraventricular tachycardia; 11 of them had inducible SVTA (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2040323/"}

The objective of our study was to compare the discriminative abilities of the TIMI and GRACE risk scores in a broad-spectrum, unselected ACS population and to assess the relative contributions of model simplicity and model composition to any observed differences between the two scoring systems. ACS patients admitted to the University of Michigan between 1999 and 2005 were divided into UA/NSTEMI (n = 2753) and STEMI (n = 698) subpopulations. The predictive abilities of the TIMI and GRACE scores for in-hospital and 6-month mortality were assessed by calibration and discrimination. There were 137 in-hospital deaths (4%), and among the survivors, 234 (7.4%) died by 6 months post-discharge. In the UA/NSTEMI population, the GRACE risk scores demonstrated better discrimination than the TIMI UA/NSTEMI score for in-hospital (C = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.81-0.89, versus 0.54, 95% CI: 0.48-0.60; p<0.01) and 6-month (C = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.76-0.83, versus 0.56, 95% CI: 0.52-0.60; p<0.01) mortality.

An analysis of refitted multivariate models demonstrated a marked improvement in the discriminative power of the TIMI UA/NSTEMI model with the incorporation of heart failure and hemodynamic variables. Study limitations included unaccounted for confounders inherent to observational, single institution studies with moderate sample sizes. The GRACE scores provided superior discrimination as compared with the TIMI UA/NSTEMI score in predicting in-hospital and 6-month mortality in UA/NSTEMI patients, although the GRACE and TIMI STEMI scores performed equally well in STEMI patients. The observed discriminative deficit of the TIMI UA/NSTEMI score likely results from the omission of key risk factors rather than from the relative simplicity of the scoring system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19956773/"}

This pattern was highly significant in patients who were not using beta-blockers (P <0.0001) and had no history of diabetes (P <0.0001), but was otherwise absent. The circadian pattern appeared to be attenuated in patients of a younger age, female gender, or who used statins or aspirin. Peak STEMI occurrence was earlier in smokers than non-smokers.

Similar pathways of lethal cell injury can contribute to other pathologies such as left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure caused by cancer therapy. Consequently, strategies designed to protect the heart from lethal cell injury have the potential to be applicable across all three pathologies. The investigators meeting at the 10th Hatter Cardiovascular Institute workshop examined the parallels between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), ischaemic stroke, and other pathologies that cause the loss of cardiomyocytes including cancer therapeutic cardiotoxicity.

Regardless of the mechanism, clinical presentation may vary from acute decompensated heart failure to cardiogenic shock. Assessing the severity of VHD as well as the correlation between VHD severity and symptoms may be difficult in patients with AHF because of the rapid variation in loading conditions, concomitant destabilization of the associated comorbidities and the presence of combined valvular lesions. Evidence-based interventions targeting VHD in settings of AHF have yet to be identified, as patients with severe VHD are often excluded from randomized trials in AHF, so results from these trials do not generalize to those with VHD. Furthermore, there are not rigorously conducted randomized controlled trials in the setting of VHD and AHF, most of the data coming from observational studies. Thus, distinct to chronic settings, current guidelines are very elusive when patients with severe VHD present with AHF, and a clear-cut strategy could not be yet defined.

HMGB1 is passively released by necrotic tissues or actively secreted by stressed cells. Extracellular HMGB1 acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) molecule and gives rise to several redox forms that by binding to different receptors and interactors promote a variety of cellular responses, including tissue inflammation or regeneration. Inhibition of extracellular HMGB1 in experimental models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocarditis, cardiomyopathies induced by mechanical stress, diabetes, bacterial infection or chemotherapeutic drugs reduces inflammation and is protective. In contrast, administration of HMGB1 after myocardial infarction induced by permanent coronary artery ligation ameliorates cardiac performance by promoting tissue regeneration. HMGB1 decreases contractility and induces hypertrophy and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, stimulates cardiac fibroblast activities, and promotes cardiac stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, maintenance of appropriate nuclear HMGB1 levels protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by preventing DNA oxidative stress, and mice with HMGB1cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression are partially protected from cardiac damage. Finally, higher levels of circulating HMGB1 are associated to human heart diseases. Hence, during cardiac injury, HMGB1 elicits both harmful and beneficial responses that may in part depend on the generation and stability of the diverse redox forms, whose specific functions in this context remain mostly unexplored. This review summarizes recent findings on HMGB1 biology and heart dysfunctions and discusses the therapeutic potential of modulating its expression, localization, and oxidative-dependent activities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30306212/"}

Between 1 January 2015 and 31 March 2018, a total of 11 462 patients admitted with an initial diagnosis of STEMI according to the 2012 ESC STEMI guidelines were enrolled. Individual patient data were collected across 196 centres and 29 countries. Among the centres, there were 136 percutaneous coronary intervention centres and 91 with cardiac surgery on-site. The majority of centres (129/196) were part of a STEMI network. The main objective of this study was to describe the demographic, clinical, and angiographic characteristics of patients with STEMI. Other objectives include to assess management patterns and in particular the current use of reperfusion therapies and to evaluate how recommendations of most recent STEMI European guidelines regarding reperfusion therapies and adjunctive pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are adopted in clinical practice and how their application can impact on patients' outcomes. Patients will be followed for 1 year after admission. The ESC ACCA-EAPCI EORP ACS STEMI registry is an international registry of care and outcomes of patients hospitalized with STEMI.

We undertook a large international study to compare the performance of nine electrocardiographic computer programs with that of eight cardiologists in interpreting ECGs in 1220 clinically validated cases of various cardiac disorders. ECGs from the following groups were included in the sample: control patients (n = 382); patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 183), right ventricular hypertrophy (n = 55), or biventricular hypertrophy (n = 53); patients with anterior myocardial infarction (n = 170), inferior myocardial infarction (n = 273), or combined myocardial infarction (n = 73); and patients with combined infarction and hypertrophy (n = 31). The interpretations of the computer programs and the cardiologists were compared with the clinical diagnoses made independently of the ECGs, and the computer interpretations were compared with those of the cardiologists. The percentage of ECGs correctly classified by the computer programs (median, 91.3 percent) was lower than that of the cardiologists (median, 96.0 percent; P less than 0.01). The median sensitivity of the computer programs was also significantly lower than that of the cardiologists in diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (56.6 percent vs. 63.9 percent, P less than 0.02), right ventricular hypertrophy (31.8 percent vs. 46.6 percent, P less than 0.01), anterior myocardial infarction (77.1 percent vs. 84.9 percent, P less than 0.001), and inferior myocardial infarction (58.8 percent vs. 71.7 percent, P less than 0.0001). The median total accuracy level (the percentage of correct classifications) was 6.6 percent lower for the computer programs (69.7 percent) than for the cardiologists (76.3 percent; P less than 0.001).

Our principal measure of significant cardiologist treatment was whether a patient was admitted by a cardiologist. We use supplemental data to explore whether our analysis would differ substantially using alternative definitions of significant cardiologist treatment. This retrospective cohort study compared results using least squares (LS) multivariate regression with results from IV methods that accounted for additional unmeasured patient characteristics. Primary outcomes were 30-day and one-year mortality, and secondary outcomes included treatment with medications and revascularization procedures. Medical charts for the initial hospital stay of each AMI patient underwent a comprehensive abstraction, including dates of hospitalization, admitting physician, demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, severity of clinical presentation, electrocardiographic and other diagnostic test results, contraindications to therapy, and treatments before and after AMI. Patients admitted by cardiologists had fewer comorbid conditions and less severe AMIs. These patients had a 10 percent (95 percent CI: 9.5-10.8 percent) lower absolute mortality rate at one year. After multivariate adjustment with LS regression, the adjusted mortality difference was 2 percent (95 percent CI: 1.4-2.6 percent). Using IV methods to provide additional adjustment for unmeasured differences in risk, we found an even smaller, statistically insignificant association between physician specialty and one-year mortality, relative risk (RR) 0.96 (0.88-1.04). Patients admitted by a cardiologist were also significantly more likely to have a cardiologist consultation within the first day of admission and during the initial hospital stay, and also had a significantly larger share of their physician bills for inpatient treatment from cardiologists. IV analysis of treatments showed that patients treated by cardiologists were more likely to undergo revascularization procedures and to receive thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, and calcium channel-blockers, but less likely to receive beta-blockers.

The aims of this work were to 1. verify the technical feasibility of transmitting echocardiographic images, 2. determine an optimal therapeutic strategy for each patient, and 3. deliver precise information live to patients and their families. Five pediatric cardiology videoconference consultation sessions were transmitted between April 2006 and May 2007. The videoconference equipment, POLYCOM VSX 7000 (R), was used to relay information between the two centres, using six high-debit digital telephone lines, allowing a transfer rate of 384 kbits/s and an image frequency of 25 frames per second. The echocardiographic equipment at St Pierre Hospital was connected to the videoconference equipment by an S-VHS video output. The transmitted sources alternated between the echographic video output and the signal from a video camera, with continuous audio transmission. The telemedicine meeting was made up of three main elements: 1. a consultation with real-time echocardiographic acquisition and transmission, 2. a discussion between medical colleagues, and 3. a discussion with the family. Five videoconference consultation sessions were organised between April 2006 and May 2007. 22 patients were involved (median age 3 years, age range 7 days to 48 years). Heart disease was congenital in 20 patients, and acquired in 2 patients. The aim of the telemedicine consultation was to specify: 1. medical treatment in 7 patients, and 2. an indication for surgery or interventional catheterisation in 15 patients. There was no significant change in diagnosis, but in 2 patients with complex heart disease some anatomical clarifications were made. For 3 patients, the videoconference discussion was essential to get the extremely reticent families to accept the indication for surgery.

Registration procedures, event rates, and case-fatality rates in 38 populations from 21 countries in four continents.", "text": "The WHO MONICA Project is a 10-year study that monitors deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD), acute myocardial infarction, coronary care, and risk factors in men and women aged 35 to 64 years in defined communities. This analysis of methods and results of coronary event registration in 1985 through 1987 provides data on the relation between CHD morbidity and mortality. Fatal and nonfatal coronary events were monitored through population-based registers. Hospital cases were found by pursuing admissions (\"hot pursuit\") or by retrospective analysis of discharges (\"cold pursuit\"). Availability of diagnostic data on identified nonfatal myocardial infarction was good. Information on fatal events (deaths occurring within 28 days) was limited and constrained in some populations by problems with access to sources such as death certificates. Age-standardized annual event rates for the main diagnostic group in men aged 35 to 64 covered a 12-fold range from 915 per 100,000 for North Karelia, Finland, to 76 per 100,000 for Beijing, China. For women, rates covered an 8.5-fold range from 256 per 100,000 for Glasgow, UK, to 30 per 100,000 for Catalonia, Spain. Twenty-eight-day case-fatality rates ranged from 37% to 81% for men (average, 48% to 49%), and from 31% to 91% for women (average, 54%). There was no significant correlation across populations for men between coronary event and case-fatality rates (r = -.04), the percentages of coronary deaths known to have occurred within 1 hour of onset (r = .08), or the percentages of known first events (r = -.23). Event and case-fatality rates for women correlated strongly with those for men in the same populations (r = .85, r = .80). Case-fatality rates for women were not consistently higher than those for men. For women, there was a significant inverse correlation between event and case-fatality rates (r = -.33, P < .05), suggesting that nonfatal events were being missed where event rates were low. Rankings based on MONICA categories of fatal events placed some middle- and low-mortality populations, such as the French, systematically higher than they would be based on official CHD mortality rates. However, rates for nonfatal myocardial infarction correlated quite well with the official mortality rates for CHD for the same populations. For men (age 35 to 64 years), approximately 1.5 (at low event rates) to 1 (at high event rates) episode of hospitalized, nonfatal, definite myocardial infarction was registered for every death due to CHD. The problem in categorizing deaths due to CHD was the large proportion of deaths with no relevant clinical or autopsy information. Unclassifiable deaths averaged 22% across the 38 populations but represented half of all registered deaths in 2 populations and a third or more of all deaths in 15 populations. The WHO MONICA Project, although designed to study longitudinal trends within populations, provides the opportunity for relating rates of validated CHD deaths to nonfatal myocardial infarction across populations. There are major differences between populations in nonfatal as well as fatal coronary event rates. They refute suggestions that high CHD mortality rates are associated with high case-fatality rates or a relative excess of sudden deaths. The high proportion of CHD deaths for which no diagnostic information is available is a cause for concern.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8026046/"}

Ten point two per cent of the procedures were performed to treat acute myocardial infarction. Coronary stenting is the main device for coronary intervention. In 1999, coronary stents were used in 17,783 cases (23% increase compared to 1998), representing 77.3% of all coronary revascularization procedures. A total of 22,946 prostheses were implanted, 87% electively and 21.4% as a primary stenting procedure, with a low rate of complications (0.85% subacute closure, 1.95% myocardial infarction and 0.9% mortality).

We observed the effect of fluoxetine on cardiac electrophysiology in vivo in a rat model of post-MI depression and the potential mechanism. Eighty adult male Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g) were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control (control group), MI (MI group), depression (depression group), post-MI depression (model group), and post-MI depression treated with intragastric administration of 10 mg/kg fluoxetine (fluoxetine group). MI was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Depression was developed by 4-week chronic mild stress (CMS). Behavior measurement was done before and during the experiment. Electrophysiology study in vivo and Western blot analysis were carried on after 4 weeks of CMS. After 4 weeks of CMS, depression-like behaviors were observed in the MI, depression, and model groups, and chronic fluoxetine administration could significantly improve those behaviors (P<0.05 vs model group). Fluoxetine significantly increased the ventricular fibrillation threshold compared with the model group (20.20±9.32 V vs 14.67±1.85 V, P<0.05). Expression of Kv4.2 was significantly reduced by 29%±12%, 24%±6%, and 41%±15%, respectively, in the MI group, CMS group, and model group, which could be improved by fluoxetine (30%±9%). But fluoxetine showed no improvement on the MI-induced loss of Cx43. The susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias was increased in depression and post-MI depression rats, and fluoxetine may reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia in post-MI depression rats and thus improve the prognosis.

Thirty-nine percent of patients complained of chest pain (CP) or epigastric pain, 26% loss of consciousness, 10% breathlessness, and 7% palpitations. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was diagnosed in 11.68% of patients and ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1.91%. Among patients with CP, ECG showed STEMI in only 3.84% of cases, theoretically eligible for fibrinolysis or primary PCI; patients with STEMI complained of CP in 78.94% of cases.

Because some of the survival benefit associated with cardiology care may be due to baseline differences in patient characteristics, we evaluated how differences in case-mix of comorbid illness and functional limitations may explain the association between specialty care and survival. We examined the records of 109,243 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for myocardial infarction from 1994 to 1995 from the national Cooperative Cardiovascular Project to evaluate the association of physician specialty with 30-day and 1-year mortality. We assessed the extent to which this relation was mediated by differences in the use of guideline-supported therapies (aspirin, beta-blockers, reperfusion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or differences in the clinical characteristics of the patients. Patients who had board-certified cardiologists as attending physicians had the least number of comorbid conditions, whereas patients who had general practitioners or internal medicine subspecialists as attending physicians usually had the most comorbidities. Cardiologists had the greatest use of most guideline-supported therapies, and general practitioners had the lowest use. After adjustment for severity of myocardial infarction, clinical presentation, and hospital characteristics, patients treated by cardiologists were less likely to die within 1 year (relative risk [RR] = 0.92, 95%, confidence interval [CI]: 0.89 to 0. 95), and patients cared for by other general practitioners were more likely to die within 1 year (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.14), than patients cared for by general internists. After adjusting for additional measures of comorbid illness and functional limitations, the 1-year survival benefit associated with cardiology care was attenuated relative to internists (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.0), and the excess mortality associated with general practitioners decreased (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.11). After further adjustment for the use of guideline-supported therapies, both differences in 1-year survival between patients treated by cardiologists or general practitioners were not significantly different from those of patients treated by internists. Studies comparing outcomes by physician specialties that do not adjust adequately for differences in patient characteristics may attribute more benefit than is appropriate to specialists who treat patients who have fewer comorbid conditions.

These decision rules and three experienced cardiologists then estimated probability of death by 1 year for each patient in a separate test sample (n = 400). In our evaluation of the performance of the decision rules and physicians, we detected no differences, although the decision rules and physicians tended to classify the patients somewhat differently. Further multivariate analyses on the physicians' predictions showed that two of the physicians paid attention to somewhat different variables than the third physician.

There is a large spectrum of CS presentations resulting from the interaction between an acute cardiac insult and a patient's underlying cardiac and overall medical condition. Phenotyping patients with CS may have clinical impact on management because classification would support initiation of appropriate therapies. CS management should consider appropriate organization of the health care services, and therapies must be given to the appropriately selected patients, in a timely manner, whilst avoiding iatrogenic harm. Although several consensus-driven algorithms have been proposed, CS management remains challenging and substantial investments in research and development have not yielded proof of efficacy and safety for most of the therapies tested, and outcome in this condition remains poor. Future studies should consider the identification of the new pathophysiological targets, and high-quality translational research should facilitate incorporation of more targeted interventions in clinical research protocols, aimed to improve individual patient outcomes. Designing outcome clinical trials in CS remains particularly challenging in this critical and very costly scenario in cardiology, but information from these trials is imperiously needed to better inform the guidelines and clinical practice. The goal of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the definition, epidemiology, underlying causes, pathophysiology and management of CS based on important lessons from clinical trials and registries, with a focus on improving in-hospital management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32469155/"}

P2Y(12) inhibitors include ticlopidine (now rarely used), clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. In the setting of high-risk acute coronary syndromes treated with percutaneous coronary interventions, the addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist, especially abciximab, is contemplated.

A histopathological and electron-microscopic evaluation of the atrial heart muscle revealed that the advancement of the morphological changes was closely related to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Decrease in size of F waves in the electrocardiogram correlated well with the extent of right and left atrial fibrosis. Also, it was noteworthy that the atrial fibrillation in cases with dissecting aneurysm (n = 60) was an expression of the myocardial damage due to the infiltration of the bleeding into the right atrium. Intra-atrial electrogram in 48 patients with various heart diseases revealed that the electric potentials obtained from various parts of the atrium varied to a great extent and finally the patient's condition transformed to that of atrial standstill. We conclude that atrial fibrillation is an expression of some important aspect of the progression of heart disease and is not directly associated with hemodynamic overloading to the atrium.

However, in the latter part of the 20th century, highly sensitive and specific assays, such as cardiac troponins, as well as assays for markers of myocardial function, such as cardiac natriuretic peptides, rapidly changed the scenario of clinical management of patients with cardiac diseases, assigning to the laboratory a pivotal role in the overall diagnostic flow.

Although there is no statistical proof, it appears that this effect is accompanied by a slight increase in the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction. The effects of physical activity on other heart diseases are not well known. The mechanisms by which physical exercise exerts its protective effect are not yet well established. Among the proposed hypotheses are the effect on peripheral muscle of physical training, the reduction of myocardial ischemia, and modifications of the adrenergic response to effort and stress. Moreover, physical training has a favorable effect on certain risk factors for coronary heart disease (e.g., lipids profile, arterial hypertension, smoking).

Pregnancy introduces unique physiological changes that increase the risk of acute myocardial infarction, with pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction cases often associated with factors, such as advanced maternal age, chronic hypertension, and preexisting cardiovascular conditions. This review distinguishes between preexisting ischemic heart disease and pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction. It will emphasize the various etiologies of pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction, including coronary atherosclerosis and plaque rupture presenting as ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and other nonatherosclerotic causes, including spontaneous coronary artery dissection, vasospasm, and embolism. Our study discusses the practical management of ischemic heart disease in pregnancy, with a focus on preconception counseling, risk assessment, and tailored antenatal planning for women with preexisting ischemic heart disease. Moreover, this document focuses on the challenges of diagnosing cardiovascular disease, especially when presented with nonclassical risk factors and presentation. It provides insight into the appropriate diagnostic testing methods, such as electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers, and echocardiography. In addition, the review covers various treatment strategies, from medical management to more invasive procedures, including coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft. Special attention is given to medication safety during pregnancy, including anticoagulation, beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents. The complexities of delivery planning in women with ischemic heart disease are discussed, advocating for a multidisciplinary team-based approach and careful consideration of the timing and mode of delivery. Furthermore, the roles of breastfeeding and postpartum care are explored, emphasizing the long-term benefits and the suitability of various medications during lactation. Lastly, this review provides crucial insights into the management of ischemic heart disease in pregnancy, stressing the need for heightened awareness, prompt diagnosis, and tailored management to optimize maternal and fetal health outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38278176/"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between metabolic surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and severe obesity. Of 566 patients with previous MI registered in the SWEDEHEART registry (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) undergoing metabolic surgery and registered in the nationwide Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry, 509 patients (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass n=465; sleeve gastrectomy n=44) could be matched 1:1 to a control with MI from SWEDEHEART, but no subsequent metabolic surgery regarding sex, age (±3 years), year of MI (±3 years), and body mass index (±3). The 2 groups were well matched, except for a lower proportion of reduced ejection fraction after MI (7% versus 12%), previous heart failure (10% versus 19%), atrial fibrillation (6% versus 10%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4% versus 7%) in patients undergoing metabolic surgery. The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 4.6 (2.7-7.1) years. The 8-year cumulative probability of major adverse cardiovascular events was lower in patients undergoing metabolic surgery (18.7% [95% CI, 15.9-21.5%] versus 36.2% [33.2-39.3%], adjusted hazard ratio, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.32-0.61]). Patients undergoing metabolic surgery had also a lower risk of death (adjusted HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.29-0.70]; MI, 0.24 [0.14-0.41]) and new onset heart failure, but there were no significant differences regarding stroke (0.91 [0.38-2.20]) and new onset atrial fibrillation (0.56 [0.31-1.01]). In severely obese patients with previous MI, metabolic surgery is associated with a low risk for serious complications, lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, death, new MI, and new onset heart failure.

Implications for improving the process of care.", "text": "Research suggests that physicians will engage in more vigilant problem-solving under conditions of resource constraints than under conditions of resource slack. Increased vigilance related to physicians' clinical strategies enhances care by disposing physicians toward more optimal care choices. The authors examine whether pressures for clinical resource constraints encourage increased and sustained vigilance in problem-solving among cardiologists treating acute myocardial infarction. The physician problem-solving process is reconstructed from the medical records of all eligible cases of acute myocardial infarction treated by the physician sample set over a 6-year period. The sample period encompasses phases of both resource slack and resource constraints. The Herfindahl index is used to measure the relative amount of vigilant problem-solving activity exhibited in each of five major tactical areas of the physician care strategies in each year of the study. The results support the hypothesis that resource constraints initially promote a shift to increased vigilance in physician problem-solving. Only one of the five major tactical areas, however, is characterized by sustained vigilance over time. The other areas are, instead, associated with a substantial reduction in vigilant activity after the initial peak period. The results suggest that resource constraints do set the stage for improved clinical decision-making. Sustained vigilance, however, appears to apply only to those portions of the care strategy for which the physician can draw a clear link between optimizing clinical activity and reducing resource consumption. For those portions of the care strategy for which the physician cannot establish a clear link, ongoing pressures to conserve resources results in reduced vigilance and a potential reduction in quality of clinical decision-making.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8792782/"}

{"id": "24597850", "title": "Cardiac stem cells: biology and clinical applications.", "text": "Heart disease is the primary cause of death in the industrialized world. Cardiac failure is dictated by an uncompensated reduction in the number of viable and fully functional cardiomyocytes. While current pharmacological therapies alleviate the symptoms associated with cardiac deterioration, heart transplantation remains the only therapy for advanced heart failure. Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic modalities. Cell-based therapies involving cardiac stem cells (CSCs) constitute a promising emerging approach for the replenishment of the lost tissue and the restoration of cardiac contractility. CSCs reside in the adult heart and govern myocardial homeostasis and repair after injury by producing new cardiomyocytes and vascular structures. In the last decade, different classes of immature cells expressing distinct stem cell markers have been identified and characterized in terms of their growth properties, differentiation potential, and regenerative ability. Phase I clinical trials, employing autologous CSCs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, are being completed with encouraging results. Accumulating evidence concerning the role of CSCs in heart regeneration imposes a reconsideration of the mechanisms of cardiac aging and the etiology of heart failure. Deciphering the molecular pathways that prevent activation of CSCs in their environment and understanding the processes that affect CSC survival and regenerative function with cardiac pathologies, commonly accompanied by alterations in redox conditions, are of great clinical importance. Further investigations of CSC biology may be translated into highly effective and novel therapeutic strategies aiming at the enhancement of the endogenous healing capacity of the diseased heart.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24597850/"}
{"id": "758050", "title": "[Thormboembolisms and heart ruptures in myocardial infarct].", "text": "An analysis of the incidence of thromboembolism and heart ruptures with reference to different causative factors was conducted on the basis of 585 patients dying of myocardial infarction during the recent 30 years (autopsy data) and 1417 patients with myocardial infarction (298 mortality cases among them) hospitalized during the recent 10 years. A reduction of the incidence of thromboembolism and an increase of the incidence of heart ruptures in the recent years were revealed. Thromboembolism and heart ruptures play an important role among the causes of mortality in myocardial infarction. The development of thromboembolism in myocardial infarction is favoured by the macro-focal nature of the heart lesion, repeated necroses of the myocardium, localization of infarction in the posterior and posteriolateral zones, old age of the patients (over 60), presence of diabetes mellitus and acute cardiac aneurysm. Thromboembolism occurs with the same incidence rate within the initial 7 days, and later during the acute phase. Thrombi are most often found in the cardiac cavities, pulmonary, renal and splenic vessels, in the cerebral, mesenteric and other vessels. Heart ruptures are favoured by the macro-focal nature of the cardiac lesion, localization of the infarction in the anterior and anteriolateral zones, old age (over 60), presence of acute cardiac aneurysm. Most frequently the ruptures are observed in primary myocardial infarction within the initial 5--7 days of the disease. The use of anticoagulants in myocardial infarction decreases the incidence of thromboembolic complications and heart ruptures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/758050/"}

{"id": "14714350", "title": "[FACT: French national registry of acute coronary syndromes. Specific study of French general hospital centers].", "text": "The FACT registry is currently the French registry including the greatest number of patients with acute coronary syndromes. The study presents epidemiologic data, modalities and delays for medical admission. Three thousand nine hundred and two patients were included in FACT by 362 French centers of cardiology between 06/01/2003 and 03/02/2003. One thousand eight hundred and ten patients, who had been placed in the cardiology departments of French general hospitals, were isolated from this registry. The French general hospitals represented 50.8% of the 362 centers. In order to clarify the study, these patients were divided into three groups: group A: patients without ST segment elevation but with suggestive ECG modifications; group B: patients with ST segment elevation; group C: all other patients. The results were mainly studied for groups A and B and compared. These results were also compared to those of the FACT registry and of other registries. The results show that the average delay for admission is 2.9 h after a first delay between the pain and the help of 6.7 h. The first intervening party is a general practitioner (36.4%) then the SAMU (31.6%) and finally the emergency departments (18.7%). 16.6% of the patients from group B undergo pre-hospital thrombolysis. The recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology are widely applied except for the most recent of them since only 27.6% of the patients from group A having a TIMI score > or = 5 receive an anti-GIIB IIIA treatment. The reasons of the non-prescription of the recommended classes are mostly linked to contra-indication and intolerance. The strategy of coronary reopening mainly depends on the presence or the absence in the department of an available medical equipment for angioplasty. If there is one, the percentage of primary angioplasty reaches 54.2% and the percentage of thrombolysis 7.9%. On the opposite, there is 8.3% of angioplasty and 54.2% of thrombolysis for the unequipped centers. The global mortality reaches 5.8% but is inversely proportional to the level of equipment of the departments: 5.9% for the departments with angioplasty, 11% for the departments with coronarography but without angioplasty and 13.8% for the departments without any interventional equipment. Nevertheless, the age of the patients is different and this influences the results: we notice that the less equipped the department is, the older the patients are. The FACT registry and the data from the general hospitals give the opportunity to think about the possibilities to improve the delays of call to the first intervening party (more particularly to the SAMU) but it also allows us to think about how to better organize the geographical distribution giving access to a medical equipment for angioplasty. All these information will also help the cardiologists to gather around the recommendations by convincing them that the benefit/risk ratio is positive.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14714350/"}

This paper introduces a novel accountable care design in cardiology. Preliminary study using baseline data. The Accelerating Clinical Transformation for Creating Value and Controlling Cost in Cardiology concept study involved providers employed by the Providence Medical Group, Oregon. First, using claims data from 2009 through 2011, we created a historic budget to capture cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related costs for attributed patients on a per patient per year basis. Second, we introduced a validated quality metric, the Clinical Performance and Value vignette, to a sample of cardiology providers to examine clinical practice variation in treating coronary heart disease (CHD), coronary heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AF). Lastly, we analyzed reimbursement claims paid for CHD, CHF, and AF, and forecasted potential cost savings from reductions in clinical variation. Examining historic costs, we found they were stable over time, but variable by provider and disease. Quality scores, measured against evidence-based cardiology guidelines, ranged from 48.9% to 85.4% (mean=66.8%; SD=5.4%), and the prevalence of unnecessary testing was 46% in CHD, 71% in CHF, and 30% in AF. We project that reducing unnecessary care by 15% to 25% would yield $200,000 to $498,000 in savings ($50-$83 per patient visit) annually. And, if the top 10% of providers as determined by CVD-related costs reduced their costs by 25%, savings would be an additional $283,512 per year. This accountable care design framework is timely for cardiology and could be applied for other specialty conditions, such as cancer.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26014467/"}

Conscious survivors of OHCA with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be treated according to recommendations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and high-risk non-ST-segment elevation -ACS (NSTE-ACS) without OHCA and should undergo immediate (if STEMI) or rapid (less than two hours if NSTE-ACS) coronary invasive strategy. Comatose survivors of OHCA with ECG criteria for STEMI on the post-resuscitation ECG should be admitted directly to the catheterisation laboratory. For patients without STEMI ECG criteria, a short \"emergency department or intensive care unit stop\" is advised to exclude non-coronary causes. In the absence of an obvious non-coronary cause, CAG should be performed as soon as possible (less than two hours), in particular in haemodynamically unstable patients. Immediate PCI should be mainly directed towards the culprit lesion if identified. Interventional cardiologists should become an essential part of the \"survival chain\" for patients with OHCA.

This would allow the delivery of interventions such as radiofrequency ablation or therapeutic agents to critical areas within the scar and scar periphery. Substrate mapping was performed on seven sheep 36.5 +/- 32.9 weeks after a left anterior descending artery myocardial infarction had been induced. Contact electrograms and the mapping catheter three-dimensional (3D) location were recorded simultaneously. A computer program was written in-house to automatically identify sinus beats, analyze electrogram characteristics (e.g., electrogram amplitude and minimum slope), and integrate the analysis results into a 3D scar map. The total time required to produce the scar maps was a mean of 8.3 +/- 2.0 minutes. The automated substrate mapping (ASM) system beat detection algorithm had a high sensitivity (i.e., detected 87.4% of the recorded beats) and excellent specificity (only one false activation over 58.2 minutes of total recorded data). The system was able to classify the detected beats ('sinus' or 'ectopic') with high specificity (specificity = 97.3% confidence interval (CI): 96.9-97.7) and moderate sensitivity (sensitivity = 78.3% CI: 77.3%-79.5%). The scar area identified by the ASM system correlated well with the pathologically defined scar area (R2 = 0.87 p < 0.001). ASM enables accurate scar maps to be produced rapidly.

This fact was the main reason for monitoring patients treated at Department of Internal Medicine, Zabok General Hospital with the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Data on all patients treated for coronary heart disease from 2000 to 2006 were analyzed. Coronary disease was diagnosed on the basis of history data, clinical examination, laboratory tests for biochemical coronary markers and electrocardiogram. Depending on the diagnosis, patients were treated at Intensive Care Unit, Cardiology Department, or were referred for emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients were analyzed according to the diagnosis, age and sex, and results were graphically presented. Considering age factor, most of the patients were older than 70 and few were younger than 50. Considering sex, there were more male than female patients. The leading diagnosis was acute myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI) in male patients and angina pectoris in female patients. A relatively small number of STEMI patients were referred for PCI. The main reason was the fact that patients came to the hospital too late, i.e. the time elapsed from symptoms onset was too long. Another reason was rather poor organization of the invasive cardiologist teams that could perform the operation 24 hours a day. This type of the work organization was introduced in 2003 in Zagorje County, with an increase in 2004 and at the Zagreb Ring level in 2005.

Two cohorts of consecutive patients satisfying diagnostic criteria for AMI: 184 in the tertiary hospital and 207 in the community hospitals. Frequency of use, in highly eligible patients, of thrombolysis, beta-blockers, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents, nitrates, and calcium antagonists. Cohorts were compared for differences in prognostic factors or illness severity. In community hospital patients, there was greater use of thrombolysis [100% versus 83% in the tertiary hospital; difference 17%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11-26%; P < 0.001] and of ACE inhibitors (84% versus 66%; difference 18%, 95% CI 3-34%; P = 0.02), and lower median length of stay (6.0 days versus 7.0 days; P = 0.001) compared with tertiary hospital patients. Frequency of use of other drugs, and adjusted rates of death and re-infarction were the same for both cohorts. With respect to pharmacological management of patients hospitalized with AMI, cardiologists and general physicians appear to provide care of similar quality and achieve equivalent outcomes. Further studies are required to confirm the generalizability of these results to Australian practice as a whole.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12705709/"}

We sought to identify the effect of BP change among individuals with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension on incident heart failure (HF) and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 616 483 individuals (median age 46 years, 73.7% men) with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension based on the ACC/AHA BP guideline. Participants were categorized using BP classification at one-year as normal BP (n = 173 558), elevated BP/stage 1 hypertension (n = 367 454), or stage 2 hypertension (n = 75 471). The primary outcome was HF, and the secondary outcomes included (separately) myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris (AP), and stroke. Over a mean follow-up of 1097 ± 908 days, 10 544 HFs, 1317 MIs, 11 070 APs, and 5198 strokes were recorded. Compared with elevated BP/stage 1 hypertension at one-year, normal BP at one-year was associated with a lower risk of developing HF [hazard ratio (HR): 0.89, 95% CI:0.85-0.94], whereas stage 2 hypertension at one-year was associated with an elevated risk of developing HF (HR:1.43, 95% CI:1.36-1.51). This association was also present in other cardiovascular outcomes including MI, AP, and stroke. The relationship was consistent in all subgroups stratified by age, sex, baseline BP category, and overweight/obesity. A one-year decline in BP was associated with the lower risk of HF, MI, AP, and stroke, suggesting the importance of lowering BP in individuals with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension according to the ACC/AHA guideline to prevent the risk of developing CVD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36047246/"}

Based on the latter, major resources have been invested in clinical trials of stem cell therapy. In this review, the cardiac regenerative construct is critically analyzed. This analysis reconfirms the fundamental pathobiological realities that: 1) the mammalian heart behaves as a terminally differentiated organ with limited regenerative capacity and uncertain contribution from endogenous cardiac stem cells, 2) the healing of infarction is by scar formation, and 3) the progression of pathological myocardial remodeling produces heart failure in non-ischemic as well as ischemic disease. Some influential studies underpinning the cardiac regenerative construct now have been called into question. The efficacy of stem cell therapy to produce sustained beneficial effects in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease remains unproven.

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine motivational differences, and logistic regression analysis was used to examine whether socioeconomic factors or other differences affected people's ability to continue to work after heart disease. Self-efficacy for future work strongly impacted the likelihood of being incapacitated for work during the 2-year follow-up. The household's total income and emotional problems were statistically significant related to patients dropping out from work in the course of the observation. The association between emotional problems and future work was mediated by motivational problems. The relation between income and future incapacity for work could not be explained by motivational factors. The study shows a clear Matthew effect on people's ability to continue to work after heart disease as low-income groups and people with emotional problems are more at risk of dropping out of work.

In the Trentino region, a mountainous area with about 500,000 inhabitants, very close to Lombardy that was the epicenter of the pandemic in Italy, to avoid these dramatic consequences, we developed a new protocol tailored to our specificity to keep our institution, and above all the cath-lab, clean from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, to ensure full operativity for cardiologic emergencies.

Information is limited about the knowledge and practices of generalist and specialist physicians regarding conditions that both groups treat, such as myocardial infarction. We therefore surveyed 1211 cardiologists, internists, and family practitioners in the states of New York and Texas about four treatments demonstrated by randomized clinical trials to be associated with improved survival after myocardial infarction (thrombolytic therapy, immediate and long-term use of aspirin, and long-term use of beta-blockers) and two treatments for which such evidence is lacking (diltiazem for patients with pulmonary congestion and prophylactic lidocaine). We asked physicians about the effect of each treatment on survival and the likelihood that they would prescribe each class of drugs. For the four beneficial treatments, the cardiologists believed more strongly than the internists and family physicians that survival was improved by the treatment, and they were more likely to prescribe these drugs (P < 0.001). For example, 94.1 percent of cardiologists said they were very likely to prescribe thrombolytic agents to treat an acute myocardial infarction, as compared with 82.0 percent of internists and 77.3 percent of family practitioners. Conversely, for the two treatments for which trials showed no evidence of a survival benefit, cardiologists were less likely than internists and family practitioners to think there was such a benefit and less likely to prescribe the drugs (P < 0.001). For example, 4.7 percent of cardiologists reported that they were very likely to use prophylactic lidocaine, as compared with 13.1 percent of internists, and 16.5 percent of family practitioners. When we used logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders, all the differences between the cardiologists and the internists and family practitioners remained significant (P < 0.02). Internists and family practitioners are less aware of or less certain about key advances in the treatment of myocardial infarction than are cardiologists.

To compare the immediate and long-term outcomes after primary angioplasty strategy and bailout stenting versus primary stent placement strategy in patients with AMI. We analysed data from a single-centre registry of consecutive patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction admitted between January 1998 and October 2003. In our centre in years 1998-2000 stenting was used only after failed or suboptimal balloon angioplasty. Starting from year 2001 we used routine primary stenting strategy. We compared these two angioplasty strategies applied in different time intervals with regard to in-hospital outcome and long-term mortality. Patients with cardiogenic shock at admission were excluded. Out of a total of 1602 patients treated invasively for AMI (cardiogenic shock excluded) 479 underwent primary balloon angioplasty strategy with bailout stenting - group 1 (years 1998-2000) and 1123 were treated with primary stenting strategy - group 2 (years 2001-2003). In group 1 bailout stenting occurred in 34.4% of patients whereas in group 2 stents were implanted in 83% of patients. Patients in the balloon angioplasty group were younger, had shorter time from the onset of symptom to hospital arrival and more frequently underwent rescue coronary intervention after failed thrombolysis. In-hospital mortality was 2.9 vs. 2.4% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=NS). Twenty-four month mortality rate was 9.8% in group 1 and 10.06% in group 2 (p=NS). 1. Effectiveness of coronary angioplasty is high and comparable in both groups. 2.

The question is whether disease is present at all. In this borderland between health and disease, the interpretation of technological data is inherently uncertain. The diagnosis then depends more heavily on the social utility of particular disease categories. Shifts in diagnostic categorisation are not therefore attributable solely to more extensive forms of cardiac imaging but are socially constructed in an interactive context which involves the technology, the medical profession and the wider social structures which exist at the time of diagnosis. Claims of technological certainty create a social space within which the medical profession generates disease categories.

At the bedside, in front of a crowd of postgraduate students, registrars, and visitors, he was renowned for his showmanship and dazzling ability. His commanding personality--caustic, sarcastic, and combative--impressed many and offended some as he openly argued with himself and others to sleuth out the correct diagnosis. His 1950 textbook, Diseases of the Heart and Circulation, characterized by his lucid and personal style of writing and a fresh physiologic approach to cardiology, brought Wood worldwide recognition as the European authority on heart disease. The incessant demands to see patients, teach, and lecture, the burden of writing his third edition of the book, and his heavy smoking eventually took their toll.

To establish a strategy for ECG interpretation in health surveys, we also studied the diagnostic capacity of three scenarios: use of the computer program alone (A), computer program and cardiologist (B), and computer program, research physician, and cardiologist (C). A stratified random sample of 381 ECGs was drawn from ECGs collected in the Rotterdam Study (n = 3057), which were interpreted both by a trained research physician using a form for structured clinical evaluation and by MEANS. All ECGs were interpreted independently by two cardiologists; if they disagreed (n = 175) the ECG was judged by a third cardiologist. Five ECG diagnoses were considered: anterior and inferior myocardial infarction (MI), left and right bundle branch block (LBBB and RBBB), and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Overall, sensitivities and specificities of MEANS and the research physicians were high. The sensitivity of MEANS ranged from 73.8% to 92.9% and of the research physician ranged from 71.8% to 96.9%. The specificity of MEANS ranged from 97.5% to 99.8% and of the research physician from 96.3% to 99.6%. To diagnose LVH, LBBB, and RBBB, use of the computer program alone gives satisfactory results. Preferably, all positive findings of anterior and inferior MI by the program should be verified by a cardiologist. We conclude that diagnostic ECG interpretation by computer can be very helpful in population-based research, being at least as good as ECG interpretation by a trained research physician, but much more efficient and therefore less expensive.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9291880/"}

It has been evaluated in over 150 randomised controlled trials and a small daily dose of around 100 mg has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke by about 30 per cent. The saving of lives and prevention of vascular events in patients judged to be at increased risk of a vascular event for any reason is large. In healthy subjects, however, the risk of a vascular event is so low that prophylaxis by any drug is inappropriate. The earlier aspirin is given in the acute phase of a myocardial infarction the greater the saving of lives. Patients judged to be at increased risk of a vascular event, for any reason, should therefore be advised to carry aspirin and to chew and swallow one or two tablets immediately, if they experience sudden severe chest pain. Aspirin is derived from a salicylate, and salicylates are widely distributed in nature, with many functions in plants. Its use in cardiovascular disease derives from an effect on blood platelets, but other possible effects have led to suggestions that it may be of benefit in conditions other than heart disease and stroke.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have published methodology for the selection and creation of performance measures for quantifying the quality of cardiovascular care. The purpose of this study is to grade each of the 9 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative emergency medicine process measures according to the ACC/AHA criteria related to clinical evidence (yes, no, indeterminate). Five of the 9 recently selected metrics in emergency medicine do not appear to meet all of the ACC/AHA criteria for measurement selection. Several of the metrics, including aspirin for acute myocardial infarction (mean hospital adherence 94.7%; SD 6.7%) and pulse oximetry for community-acquired pneumonia (mean 99.4%; SD 2.0%), already have high levels of performance nationally, which raises uncertainty about the overall cost-effectiveness of quality improvement interventions for these measures. Formal methodology needs to be established for future selection of performance measures for quality improvement programs in emergency care. These performance measures should focus on unique aspects of emergency and acute care, including recognition and treatment of time-sensitive life-threatening conditions, assessment of patients with undifferentiated signs and symptoms, and care of all-inclusive geographically based patient populations. In key emergency therapeutic areas, the evidence linking treatment and improved patient outcomes will require additional study before inclusion in pay for performance programs.

Position paper from the Working Group of Cellular Biology of the Heart of the European Society of Cardiology.", "text": "Ischaemic postconditioning (brief periods of ischaemia alternating with brief periods of reflow applied at the onset of reperfusion following sustained ischaemia) effectively reduces myocardial infarct size in all species tested so far, including humans. Ischaemic postconditioning is a simple and safe manoeuvre, but because reperfusion injury is initiated within minutes of reflow, postconditioning must be applied at the onset of reperfusion. The mechanisms of protection by postconditioning include: formation and release of several autacoids and cytokines; maintained acidosis during early reperfusion; activation of protein kinases; preservation of mitochondrial function, most strikingly the attenuation of opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Exogenous recruitment of some of the identified signalling steps can induce cardioprotection when applied at the time of reperfusion in animal experiments, but more recently cardioprotection was also observed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial. Indeed, studies in patients with an acute myocardial infarction showed a reduction of infarct size and improved left ventricular function when they underwent ischaemic postconditioning or pharmacological inhibition of MPTP opening during interventional reperfusion. Further animal studies and large-scale human studies are needed to determine whether patients with different co-morbidities and co-medications respond equally to protection by postconditioning. Also, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms must be improved to develop new therapeutic strategies to be applied at reperfusion with the ultimate aim of limiting the burden of ischaemic heart disease and potentially providing protection for other organs at risk of reperfusion injury, such as brain and kidney.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20448097/"}

A decision analysis.", "text": "Beta-blocker therapy postmyocardial infarction is generally recommended because it reduces mortality. However, beta-blockers may increase anaphylaxis mortality in the growing population of patients with peanut-induced anaphylaxis. We sought to assess the risks and benefits of beta-blocker therapy among patients with peanut allergy and heart disease. We created a Markov model for patients with heart disease at risk for peanut-induced anaphylaxis to compare life expectancy with the following strategies: (1) beta-blocker and (2) no beta-blocker. Meta-analysis and a literature review were used to estimate model parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to explore parameter uncertainty. For peanut-allergic patients who are postmyocardial infarction or who have congestive heart failure, the heart disease benefit of beta-blockers outweighs the increased likelihood of dying from anaphylaxis, increasing life expectancy by 9.4 and 17.4 months, respectively. Beta-blocker was preferred unless (1) the annual rate of moderate to severe anaphylaxis exceeded 6.0% for postmyocardial infarction and 15% for congestive heart failure patients; (2) beta-blocker therapy increased the incidence of moderate to severe anaphylaxis >2.5-fold for postmyocardial infarction and >5.8-fold for congestive heart failure patients; (3) anaphylaxis case fatality exceeded 6.5% postmyocardial infarction; or (4) beta-blocker therapy increased anaphylaxis case fatality >25-fold postmyocardial infarction. Our results suggest that for patients postmyocardial infarction or with congestive heart failure who are at risk for peanut-induced anaphylaxis, beta-blocker use should still improve survival.

Since the introduction of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), the rate of patients who die of a myocardial infarction or suffer from numerous complications afterwards has significantly decreased. During PPCI, the patient sustains postreperfusion myocardial injury, which entails an extension of the myocardial infarct size related to ischemia. Research on the ways of limiting this phenomenon has been carried out for years. One of the investigated methods is hypothermia. The first animal studies have yielded promising results. The application of hypothermia has been proved to reduce the myocardial injury size provided that the cooling commenced before reperfusion. Moreover, the trial conducted by Götberg M. et al. showed a significant reduction of microvascular obstruction (MVO) in pigs subjected to hypothermia before reperfusion. MVO was assessed via ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging. The conducted randomized clinical trials have shown the possibility of applying mild hypothermia in conscious patients without causing significant complications. In the presented trials, hypothermia was induced and maintained using an intravascular catheter inserted into the inferior vena cava, cold saline solution infusions into peripheral veins or directly into the coronary arteries or via peritoneal hypothermia. The myocardial injury size was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Despite the promising results obtained by Young-Sheng Wang et al., who applied selective intracoronary hypothermia and the myocardial infarct size (IS/MaR) was significantly reduced (p=0.022), it has not been unambiguously confirmed yet that hypothermia is effective as an adjunctive therapy for revascularization in myocardial injury size reduction during a myocardial infarction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33130801/"}

In addition, the impact of TRT on heart-related diseases, as derived from pharmaco-epidemiological studies as well as from randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs), was also investigated. Available evidence indicates that endogenous low T represents a risk factor of AMI incidence and its related mortality.

In the previous month, the patient presented with progressive dyspnea on light exertion. In the preceding four months, he had experience occasional episodes of flushing and diarrhea, and had inexplicably lost 22.7 kg. Night sweats and fever were absent. ST segment elevation in the inferior leads and ST segment depression in the precordial leads were documented during an episode of chest pain. The coronary angiogram showed diffuse disease with 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 50% stenosis on the second diagonal (D(2)). An echocardiogram showed a patent foramen ovale. Balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed on the two lesions. Two days later, prolonged chest pain recurred. Cardiac catheterization was repeated and showed occlusive thrombus within the stent on the D(2). Angioplasty was repeated. Symptoms recurred 36 h later, with the electrocardiogram showing ST segment elevation. The first angiogram was reviewed and vasospasm was suspected on a branch of the D(2), on the second marginal and in the distal circumflex artery. The diagnosis of vasospastic angina was retained. Beta-blockers were replaced by high doses of a calcium channel blocker with an excellent clinical response. The case described is of a patient with an acute coronary syndrome, vasospastic angina, in-stent thrombosis and carcinoid disease. Coronary vasospasm was attributed to serotonin, which was secreted by the carcinoid tumour that reached an atherosclerotic coronary vasculature through a patent foramen ovale, thereby avoiding pulmonary inactivation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16639480/"}

However, the majority of patients do not access standard CR and have higher baseline coronary risk and poorer knowledge of CHD than those persons due to commence CR. The objective of this study is to investigate whether a modular guided self-choice approach to secondary prevention improves coronary risk profile and knowledge in patients who do not access standard CR. This randomised controlled trial with one year follow-up will be conducted at a tertiary referral hospital. Participants eligible for but not accessing standard CR will be randomly allocated to either a modular or conventional care group. Modular care will involve participation in individualised modules that involve choice, goal-setting and coaching. Conventional care will involve ongoing heart disease management as directed by the participant's doctors. Both modular and conventional groups will be compared with a contemporary reference group of patients attending CR. Outcomes include measured modifiable risk factors, relative heart disease risk and knowledge of risk factors. We present the rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial testing a modular approach for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease following acute coronary syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16762079/"}

This review summarizes various nanomaterial applications in myocardial infarction from multiple aspects, including high precision detection, pro-angiogenesis, regulating immune homeostasis, and miRNA and stem cell delivery vehicles. We also propose promising research hotspots that have not been reported much yet, such as conjugating pro-angiogenetic elements with nanoparticles to construct drug carriers, developing nanodrugs targeting other immune cells except for macrophages in the infarcted myocardium or the remote region.

In Germany, CHD-DMPs, in addition to incorporating medical care according to guidelines (guideline-care), also ensure regular quarterly follow-up. Thus, our aim was to examine whether CHD-DMPs increase the frequency of guideline-care and whether CHD-DMPs and guideline-care improve survival over 4 years. The study included 975 post-MI patients, registered by the KORA-MI Registry (Augsburg, Germany), who completed a questionnaire in 2006. CHD-DMP enrolment was reported by physicians. Guideline-care was based on patient reports regarding medical advice (smoking, diet, or exercise) and prescribed medications (statins and platelet aggregation inhibitors plus beta-blockers or renin-angiotensin inhibitors). All-cause mortality until December 31, 2010 was based on municipal registration data. Cox regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, years since last MI, and smoking and diabetes. Physicians reported that 495 patients were CHD-DMP participants. CHD-DMP participation increased the likelihood of receiving guideline-care (odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.20; 2.02) but did not significantly improve survival (hazard rate 0.90, 95% CI 0.64-1.27). Guideline-care significantly improved survival (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28; 0.59). Individual guideline-care components, which significantly improved survival, were beta-blockers, statins and platelet aggregation inhibitors. However, these improved survival less than guideline-care. This study shows that CHD-DMPs increase the likelihood of guideline care and that guideline care is the important component of CHD-DMPs for increasing survival. A relatively high percentage of usual care patients receiving guideline-care indicate high quality of care of post-MI patients. Reasons for not implementing guideline-care should be investigated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24287605/"}

The results of prehospital diagnosis and treatment (2 cities in the Netherlands) were compared with those of inhospital treatment. Unjustified fibrinolysis must be differentiated from justified thrombolysis resulting in aborted myocardial infarction. Both have the absence of a significant rise in cardiac enzymes in common. In aborted myocardial infarction, this is a result of timely reperfusion; in unjustified thrombolysis, this is the result of an incorrect diagnosis. In the city of Rotterdam, 118 patients were treated before hospitalization for myocardial infarction, diagnosed through the use of a mobile computer electrocardiogram; in the city of Nijmegen, 132 patients were treated before hospitalization with the use of transtelephonic transmission of the electrocardiogram to the coronary care unit and judged by a cardiologist. Their data were compared with those of 269 patients treated inhospital in the city of Arnhem, using the same electrocardiographic criteria. Abortion of myocardial infarction was diagnosed as the absence of a significant rise in cardiac enzymes and the presence of resolution of chest pain and 50% of ST-segment deviation within 2 hours after onset of therapy. Lacking these, the diagnosis of unjustified fibrinolytic therapy was made. Unjustified treatment occurred in 8 (3.2%) prehospital-treated patients (4 in Rotterdam and 4 in Nijmegen).

ECG criteria for STEMI detection require that ST elevation meet predetermined millivolt thresholds and appear in at least two spatially contiguous ECG leads. The typical ECG reader recognizes only three contiguous pairs: aVL and I; II and aVF; aVF and III. However, viewing the \"orderly sequenced\" 12-lead ECG display, two more contiguous pairs become obvious in the frontal plane: +I and -aVR; -aVR and +II.

The basic assumption is that left ventricular dysfunction is largely due to the loss of a critical number of cardiomyocytes and that it can be partly reversed by implantation of new contractile cells into the postinfarction scars. Primarily for practical reasons, autologous skeletal myoblasts have been the first to undergo clinical trials and now that the feasibility of the procedure is well established, efficacy data are expected from the ongoing randomized studies. Bone marrow stem cells are also generating a great deal of interest, particularly in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and are currently undergoing extensive clinical testing although recent data have raised a cautionary note about the transdifferentiation potential of these cells. While experimental studies and early-phase clinical trials tend to support the concept that cell therapy may enhance cardiac repair, several key issues still need to be addressed including (1) the optimal type of donor cells in relation to the clinical profile of the patients, (2) the mechanism by which cell engraftment improves cardiac function, (3) the optimization of cell survival, (4) the development of less invasive cell delivery techniques and (5) the potential benefits of cell transplantation in nonischemic heart failure. Current evidence suggests, however, that adult stem cells (myogenic or marrow-derived) fail to electromechanically integrate within the recipient heart, thereby mandating the search for second generation cell types able to achieve this goal which is the prerequisite for an effective enhancement of contractile function. Preliminary data suggest that cells that feature a true cardiomyogenic phenotype such as cardiac stem cells and cardiac-precommitted embryonic stem cells may fall in this category and carry the potential for ensuring a true regeneration of dead myocardium.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16270619/"}

However, even in the absence of the hyperglycaemic state which characterizes type 2 diabetic patients, non diabetic individuals with a specific form of obesity, named abdominal obesity, often show clustering metabolic abnormalities which include high triglyceride levels, increased apolipoprotein B, small dense low density lipoproteins and decreased high density lipoproteins-cholesterol levels, a hyperinsulinemic-insulin resistant state, alterations in coagulation factors as well as an inflammatory profile. This agglomeration of abnormalities has been referred to as the metabolic syndrome which can be identified by the presence of three of the five following variables: abdominal obesity, elevated triglyceride concentrations, low HDL-cholesterol levels, increased blood pressure and elevated fasting glucose. Post-mortem analyses of coronary arteries have indicated that obesity (associated with a high accumulation of abdominal fat measured at autopsy) was predictive of earlier and greater extent of large vessels atherosclerosis as well as increase of coronary fatty streaks. Metabolic syndrome linked to abdominal obesity is also predictive of recurrent coronary events both in post-myocardial infarction patients and among coronary artery disease men who underwent a revascularization procedures. It is suggested that until the epidemic progression of obesity is stopped and obesity prevented or at least properly managed, cardiologists will be confronted to an evolving contribution of risk factors where smoking, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension may be relatively less prevalent but at the expense of a much greater contribution of abdominal obesity and related features of the metabolic syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14613004/"}

This study aimed to understand physician preferences for guideline format, placement, content, evidence, and learning strategies in different clinical environments. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 500 randomly selected physicians from 4 major US health systems who were involved in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction or pediatric asthma. Paired sample t tests and Tukey's method of comparisons determined the relative ranking of physicians' guideline implementation preferences. Physicians preferred guidelines located on the front of the patient chart, in palm pilots, or in progress notes and presented as flow charts/flow diagrams, algorithms, or preprinted orders that contain strategies to minimize readmits/encourage self-management and immediate treatment flows. Discussions with colleagues and continuing medical education are the most effective strategies for encouraging guideline use, and randomized controlled trials remain the most persuasive medical evidence. Health care organizations must align guideline implementation efforts with physician preferences to encourage utilization. The results of this study reveal systematic physician preferences for guideline implementation that can be applied to clinical settings to encourage guideline use by physicians.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16027596/"}

MR tomography is based on induction and spatial encoding of a nuclear magnetic resonance signal. Due to the high tissue concentration and MR sensitivity, medical MR imaging chiefly uses protons of water, 1H. MR tomography of protons presents highly contrasted images of soft tissue organs with spatial resolution in millimeters. Parametric analysis of the MR signal enables quantitative assessments of physico-chemical tissue properties, blood flow and perfusion. The method is noninvasive and without serious biological side effects. Ionising radiation or traditional contrast agents are not utilized. Using conventional ECG synchronized MR tomography the cardiac and great vessels anatomy are superbly resolved, exceptions being the resolution of coronary vasculature and cardiac valve apparatus. The excellent spatial resolution and flexible spatial image orientation are important advantages of quantitative assessment of cardiac function by MR imaging. Preliminary studies demonstrated clinical utility of tomographic assessments of T1 and T2 relaxation parameters as well as phase angle analysis for definition of myocardial ischemia, blood flow rates and wall motion dynamics. The first comparative studies between imaging modalities in diagnostics of specific cardiac disorders point to a superior anatomic resolution of the heart and vascular morphology by MR tomography. The utilization of MR tomography in cardiovascular medicine is new and it would be premature to assign a definite value to this costly technique in clinical evaluations of patients with heart disease. However, there is unequivocal evidence that MR technology will play a decisive role in cardiology in the future, and MR imaging already represents significant progress in the evaluation of patients with cardiac disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4049993/"}

The age-adjusted prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease is approximately 12% in the general population. The overall prevalence and incidence of the disease is likely to increase with the aging of the population. Peripheral arterial disease is a relatively benign condition in terms of local disease. Five years after the diagnosis, 75% of the patients remain clinically stable. On the contrary, life expectancy, even in the absence of any history of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, has decreased by 10 years. These patients have approximately the same relative risk of death from cardiovascular causes as do patients with history of coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, the severity of peripheral arterial disease is closely associated with the risk of myocardial infarction and death from vascular disease. The lower the ankle-brachial index, the greater the risk of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, peripheral arterial disease is a significant independent predictor for cardiovascular mortality also in coronary patients. The risk factors associated with peripheral arterial disease are essentially the same as for coronary heart disease: older age, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The excess morbidity and mortality for cardiovascular disease in these patients has not been fully explained. Patients with peripheral arterial disease show a systemic endothelial dysfunction and an increase in the serum concentration of activated white blood cells, endothelin, and C-reactive protein that may trigger acute coronary syndromes. In peripheral arterial disease the functional status is often severely impaired. Peak exercise performance has decreased to about 50% of that of age-matched controls, equivalent to moderate-severe heart failure. Epidemiological studies support the concept that patients affected by peripheral arterial disease, without established coronary heart disease, have a coronary heart disease high risk equivalent. In spite of this, peripheral arterial disease remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease.

Although interventional and conventional drug therapy may delay ventricular remodelling, there is no basic therapeutic regime available for preventing or even reversing this process. Chronic coronary artery disease and heart failure impair quality of life and are associated with subsequent worsening of the cardiac pump function. Numerous studies carried out in the past few years have demonstrated, that the intracoronary stem cell therapy has to be considered as a safe therapeutic procedure in heart disease, when destroyed and/or compromised heart muscle must be regenerated. This kind of cell therapy with autologous bone marrow cells is completely justified ethically, except for the small numbers of patients with direct or indirect bone marrow disease (e.g. myeloma, leukemic infiltration) in whom there would be lesions of mononuclear cells. Several preclinical as well as clinical trials have shown that transplantation of autologous bone marrow cells or precursor cells improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction and in chronic coronary heart disease. The age of infarction seems to be irrelevant to regenerative potency of stem cells, since stem cells therapy in old infarctions (many years old) is almost equally effective in comparison to previous infarcts. Further indications are non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (dilatative cardiomyopathy) and heart failure due to hypertensive heart disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19274033/"}

Two major radionuclide techniques are currently used in evaluating the total ischemic burden in patients with CAD. These are myocardial perfusion imaging with either thallium-201 or rubidium-82, and radionuclide angiography performed after administration of technetium-99m. Areas of diminished thallium-201 activity on early postexercise images are abnormal and represent either areas of stress-induced ischemia or myocardial scar. To differentiate between the two, delayed images are obtained to determine if the initial postexercise defect either persists or demonstrates redistribution (i.e., delayed defect disappearance or improvement). Defects demonstrating redistribution represent transient ischemia, whereas areas of previous infarction or scar usually appear as persistent defects. Patients with left main or 3-vessel CAD usually show multiple thallium-201 redistribution defects in more than 1 vascular supply region, a phenomenon often associated with abnormal lung thallium-201 uptake. In terms of radionuclide angiography, the normal ventricular response to exercise has been defined as an absolute increment of at least 5% in the left ventricular ejection fraction without the development of regional wall motion abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2950749/"}

However, recent data suggest that in a real-world setting, median door-to-balloon (DTB) time is closer to 180 min for transfer patients, with less than 5% of patients being treated within 90 min. A retrospective observational study was conducted to assess time to treatment in patients undergoing primary PCI at the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute (QHLI). Consecutive lytic-eligible patients undergoing primary PCI at the QHLI for STEMI between April 2004 and March 2005 were included in the present analysis. The primary evaluation was DTB time measured from arrival at the first hospital to first balloon inflation. Clinical outcomes were in-hospital death, reinfarction and bleeding. DTB times and hospital outcomes of patients transferred from referring hospitals were compared with those of patients presenting directly to the QHLI. During the study period, 203 lytic-eligible patients were treated with primary PCI. Sixty-nine patients presented directly to the QHLI and 134 were transferred from other hospitals. Six transfer patients were excluded because of missing time variables. The median DTB time was 114 min in transfer patients, compared with 87 min in patients presenting directly to the QHLI (P<0.001). DTB time was less than 90 min in 24% of the transfer population compared with 55% of patients presenting directly to the QHLI (P<0.001). In patients referred from hospitals within a radius of 30 km from the QHLI (n=100), median DTB time was 106 min with 30% receiving PCI within 90 min. In these patients, estimated PCI-related delay was 74 min. For patients presenting to hospitals beyond 30 km (n=28), median DTB time was 142 min with 4% receiving reperfusion within 90 min. In these patients, estimated PCI-related delay was 110 min. Median DTB time for patients presenting during off hours at the QHLI was 92 min compared with 79 min for patients presenting during regular business hours (P=0.02). In patients transferred from other hospitals, median DTB time was 118 min during off hours and 108 min during normal business hours (P=0.07). A DTB time of less than 90 min can be achieved in the majority of patients presenting directly to a primary PCI centre. However, for patients presenting to community hospitals, transfer for primary PCI is often associated with delayed revascularization.

There is a strong healthy hired effect (a component of the HWE) among firefighters, owing particularly to the recruitment of nondiabetic candidates. This is shown in previous studies in which the reported standardized mortality ratios for diabetes are much less than unity, generally around 0.3 to 0.5. Because diabetes is known to increase the risk of heart disease, a deficit of diabetes among firefighters is expected to lead to a deficit of heart injury and disease. This would make the cohort mortality studies incapable of detecting any increase in risk of heart injury and disease among firefighters. There is also a strong healthy worker survivor effect (another component of the HWE) among firefighters. In addition, heart disease is a classic example of the HWE because heart disease is chronic and its risk factors can be identified in the selection process. It is believed that (1) a major problem of previous studies on firefighting and heart disease is their failure to recognize the importance of the HWE when interpreting their results, and (2) a technique to re-assess results in light of the HWE is urgently needed. This article addresses the generally accepted principles relating to the HWE, including its definition and sources, and proposes a technique for re-assessing the literature in light of the HWE. The technique was applied to carefully re-assess 23 studies that provided direct evidence for the relationship between firefighting and heart disease. Before the re-assessment, 7 of the 23 studies showed positive evidence and 16 showed no evidence. After the re-assessment, 11 studies showed positive evidence and 12 showed no evidence. Based on the results of the re-assessment of the 23 studies, we concluded that (1) there is strong evidence of an increased risk of death overall from heart disease among firefighters; (2) there is insufficient evidence, even after considering the HWE, that there is an increased risk of death from aortic aneurysm among firefighters; and (3) there is insufficient evidence, even after considering the HWE, for a relationship between firefighting and any heart disease subtype, such as acute myocardial infarction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11039166/"}

DM-CKD was associated with excessive total mortality (35.6%) when compared to DM-nCKD (11.6%, P<0.001) and to nDM (9.8%, P<0.001). Mortality and major adverse cardiovascular event rates did not differ significantly between DM-nCKD and nDM groups. Diabetes coexisting with CKD was one of the strongest independent risk factors for death (hazard ratio 1.93; confidence interval 1.79-2.07; P<0.001). The prognosis in diabetics with AMI is significantly related to renal function. Diabetics without CKD had similar prognosis to non-diabetics. Multivariate analyses showed that unlike diabetes without renal dysfunction, DM-CKD was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications and total mortality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20110917/"}

Very different proportions of these two groups have been reported in both clinical studies in resuscitated subjects with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, and in necropsy series. In 168 cases of sudden death due to ischaemic heart disease coming to necropsy 73 (43.5%) had mural intraluminal coronary thrombi, 50 (29.8%) had occlusive intraluminal thrombi, and 45 (26.7%) had no intraluminal thrombi, giving a ratio of 2.7:1 for those with and without coronary thrombosis. Single vessel disease, the presence of acute infarction at autopsy and prodromal symptoms were positively associated with the presence of coronary thrombosis. Conversely, the presence of old myocardial infarction at necropsy, a known clinical history of ischaemic heart disease and triple vessel disease were associated with the absence of acute thrombosis. The reported variation in the incidence of coronary thrombi in sudden ischaemic death can be largely explained by selection of subjects with those clinical characteristics which are positively or negatively associated with coronary thrombosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2707268/"}

Individual patient data from all patients in our hospital with a discharge diagnosis of MI between Jan 2001 and Jan 2002 were evaluated. Follow-up data were obtained until December 2004. Patients were categorized according to the presenting electrocardiogram into non-STEMI or STEMI. A total of 824 patients were discharged with a diagnosis of MI, 29% with non-STEMI and 71% with STEMI. Patients with non-STEMI were significantly older and had a higher cardiovascular risk profile.

Early-stage CAD can progress if undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), deep learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the most useful architectures for classification. A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. A classification accuracy of 98.5% was achieved.

Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were genome-wide significantly associated with plasma homocysteine levels in 57,644 subjects from the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) consortium genome-wide association study and were known to be associated at p < 5×10-8, were used as an instrumental variable. None of the nine single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (p > 0.05 for all).

With successful implementation of network logistics and standardized therapeutic pathways, current guidelines and requested timelines versus thrombolysis could be met. The implemented logistics comprised 24 h/7 days stand-by services of an experienced PCI team, direct telephone hotline contact between rescue service/emergency physician and interventional cardiologist on call, and direct open access to a catheterization laboratory at any time. Within the Drip&Ship network Rostock, to date (July 2007) 1,022 consecutive patients with PCI for STEMI were documented and analyzed over 5 years; of these, 490 patients were transferred from a community hospital to the PCI center and 532 patients were admitted directly to the interventional center.

Assessment by noninvasive methods allows better prognostic stratification. Cardiac-gated SPECT provides appropriate parameters to support treatment selection and monitoring of these patients. Assess the prognostic value--ability to predict occurrence of major cardiac events--of perfusion and cardiac function obtained by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in myocardial infarction patients treated by any myocardial reperfusion method, whether pharmacological or surgical. Forty patients were included, mean age 58.8 ± 9 years, diagnosed with myocardial infarction. Participants were divided into two groups: primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (15) or thrombolysis (25). All received myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with cardiac-gated SPECT to assess perfusion and left ventricular function, and were followed for six months with telephone interviews and review of clinical records. In the 11 patients who had major cardiac events within six months of followup, a nonsignificant increase in perfusion defect extent was seen post reperfusion. Six (54.5%) of those with major cardiac events had anterior perfusion defects. In functional parameters, a significant increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed post stress (p = 0.006) and at rest (p = 0.001).

Frequencies of cerebral infarction in those with myocardial infarction, rheumatic heart disease, non-bacterial thromboendocarditis, and atrial fibrillation were higher than in those with no heart disease. These differences can be ascribed to the higher incidence of large and medium-sized cerebral infarction, including many cases of cerebral embolism originating from the heart. Only 3.4% of those with small cerebral infarction were assessed to be cases of embolism. Non-embolic cerebral infarction was more frequently noted in those with myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation than in those with no heart disease.

Because clinical features of TC mimic those of anterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the differential diagnosis is important in selecting the appropriate treatment strategy in the acute phase. But it was difficult to differentiate those two diseases because the TC-like findings; such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and left ventricular wall motion abnormality can occur in AMI especially with the anatomical variance of the coronary artery. A 63-year-old man was admitted due to sudden onset of chest pain and was in a cardiogenic shock state. His ECG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial (V2-6) and inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and ST-segment depression in lead aVR. Blood biochemistry showed that cardiac enzymes were not elevated. Ultrasonic cardiography showed that the left ventricular apical level was akinetic, papillary muscle level was severely hypokinetic, and basal level was hyperkinetic, mimicking TC. However, coronary angiogram showed total occlusion of his right coronary artery wrapping around the cardiac apex. Successful percutaneous coronary intervention reversed his critical status. To our knowledge, the present case is the first report described AMI with wrap-around RCA, mimicking TC.

Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) by depicting local myocardial motion can potentially quantify regional myocardial function. Strain rate imaging (SRI) that depicts regional deformation is less susceptible to cardiac translation and tethering and may be superior to TDI for regional function analysis. We examined regional myocardial function using TDI and SRI in a unique clinical model of a small, discrete myocardial infarction. Ten patients with severely symptomatic septal hypertrophy underwent basal septal ablation via intracoronary alcohol injection and had TDI and SRI pre- and postablation. Invasive hemodynamics showed no appreciable change in global function. Peak systolic strain rate was significantly lower postablation versus preablation (-0.5 versus -1.2 s(-1), P<0.001) and when comparing infarct and noninfarct areas (-0.5 versus -1.5 s(-1), P<0.001). In contrast, peak systolic tissue velocities were similar pre- and postablation (3.9 versus 2.9 cm/s, P=0.16) and between infarct and noninfarct areas (2.9 versus 2.2 cm/s, P=0.13). SRI analysis demonstrated reduced systolic function in the peri-infarct zone and preserved systolic function in the remote nonischemic zone. In the clinical setting of a small, discrete infarct unaccompanied by changes in global function, SRI accurately depicted changes in regional function.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 325 AMI patients hospitalized in the Department of Cardiology. AMI patients underwent emergency thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). AMI patients were classified into NAFLD group and non-NAFLD group. General clinical data, creatinine and myocardial enzyme, GRACE scores of AMI patients were evaluated and compared between two groups. Incidence of adverse cardiovascular events, including ECG instability, hemodynamic instability and death were evaluated. RESULTS Compared to patients in the non-NAFLD group, patients in the NAFLD group had remarkably lower proportions of diabetic patients (p=0.001), coronary heart disease (CHD) patients (p=0.027), and CABG/PCI patients (p<0.001), and had significantly higher EF values (p=0.042). Meanwhile, the proportion of adverse cardiovascular events (ECG instability (p<0.001), hemodynamic instability (p=0.033), and deaths (p=0.016)) in patients in the NAFLD group was significantly higher compared to patients in the non-NAFLD group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that GRACE score >140 (OR: 3.005, 95% CI: 1.504-6.032), EF <35% (OR: 2.649, 95% CI: 1.364-4.346), diabetes (OR: 1.308, 95% CI: 1.072-1.589), and NAFLD (OR: 1.112, 95% CI: 1.043-1.324) were independent predictors for elderly AMI patients' adverse cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS The risk for adverse cardiovascular events in elderly acute myocardial infarction patients who also had NAFLD was significantly higher. Therefore, strengthening monitoring and active treatment for elderly AMI patients who also have NAFLD could reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and improve survival rate prognosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475980/"}

In 2003, a prospective study of 217 consecutive patients admitted to a 24-bed telemetry unit was conducted for 25 days at a major academic hospital. Patients were categorized per ACC/ECC guidelines as appropriate (class I & II) or inappropriate (class III) based on a non-cardiologist admission diagnosis. A cardiologist-led group then reclassified patients at the time of admission using a brief interview. Continuous telemetry-recorded arrhythmias and resultant management changes were reviewed and recorded daily. Subgroup analysis of patients admitted with a chief complaint of chest pain was also performed. In 2004, after this trial was performed, the American Heart Association released a scientific statement updating practice standards for ECG monitor; however, this paper is based upon the original 1991 ACC/ECC guidelines. Reclassification significantly decreased the percentage of all class I & II patients from 91% to 71% (P<0.001) and the percentage of class I & II patients with chest pain from 100% to 58% (P<0.001) without increasing the percentage of arrhythmias occurring in class III patients. Class II patients had a statistically significant higher percentage of arrhythmias than class I and III patients before and after reclassification (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Management changes occurring as a direct result of telemetry events were higher in class II than class I or III patients before and after reclassification (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03). Life-threatening arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) occurred in 1% of the 216 patients enrolled in this study. (1) Cardiology input using ACC/ECC guidelines and a brief interview at admission safely reduced total admissions primarily by identifying low risk chest pain admissions inappropriate for inpatient telemetry monitoring.

PIVSDs remains a major clinical challenge with extremely high mortality. Data concerning interventional closure of PIVSD is scarce. All percutaneous PIVSD closures performed between 2003 and 2016 in 8 participating centres were identified. Data concerning patients and procedures was acquired. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the time interval between VSD diagnosis and closure (≤14 days-acute phase, >14 days-non-acute phase). Twenty-one percutaneous PIVSD closures were performed on 20 patients (9 females, mean age: 70 years). Mean interval between the diagnosis and the procedure was 182.6 ± 500 days (range: 7-2228). Defects were mostly located in apical (55%) segments of the septum. In 7 cases (33%) the procedure was performed in the acute phase. The closure was technically successful in 17 cases (81%). Four patients died within 48 hours after the procedure. 30-days survival rate of the entire cohort was 70%. Univariate analysis revealed impact of technical success of the procedure (HR 0.13, CI 0.03-0.68 P = 0.016) and white blood cell count (HR 1.36 per unit increase, CI 1.1-1.69, P = 0.005) on 30-day mortality. In a selected population of patients percutaneous PIVSD closure is feasible and provides satisfactory survival rate. Procedural success has a protective impact on survival. Timing of the closure remains controversial. Procedure in the non-acute phase carries lower mortality, but at the same time introduces a selection bias.

These new data have been added to existing data in cumulative meta-analyses. The WATCH study randomised 1587 patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction to warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel. The study showed no difference between the effects of these agents on mortality or myocardial infarction, but hospitalisations for heart failure were higher on aspirin (22.2%) compared to warfarin (16.1%). The SCD-HeFT study showed that ICD therapy reduced all-cause mortality at 5 years by 23% in patients with predominantly NYHA class II heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but amiodarone was ineffective. The DINAMIT study showed that ICD therapy was not beneficial in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a recent MI, even in those with risk factors for arrhythmic death. In CASINO, levosimendan improved survival compared with dobutamine or placebo in patients with decompensated heart failure. INSPIRE showed that SPECT imaging can be used to assess risk early after acute MI safely and accurately.

A total of 156/385 patients developed myocardial infarction (n=68), angina (n=44), heart failure (n=34) or died (n=109). A high mortality was seen in patients with myocardial infarction (73%) and heart failure (71%), in contrast, to patients with angina (25%).

Four (17%) of patients with bypass surgery or angioplasty died compared with 57 (67%) of the patients with no intervention (p<0.001). The occurrence of myocardial infarction was associated with age (p<0.0001), and mean systolic (p<0.05) and diastolic (p<0.05) blood pressure and degree of albuminuria at entry (p<0.05). Heart failure was associated with age (p<0.0001), and mean HbA(1c) levels (p<0.05), while angina was associated with age only (p<0.05).

This process of getting together was founded on the basic principle that active participation can be much more effective and rewarding than education (a passive process). Accordingly, further studies were undertaken dealing with clinical epidemiology, observational outcome research introduced complementarily to develop lines of clinical investigation along 2 mainstreams: ischemic heart disease and heart failure. The original decision to directly sponsor countrywide research projects in critical and relevant areas of care had broader implications not only for the role of scientific societies, but more generally for the nurture of independent research, which is today widely recognized to be at risk.

Apart from characterizing reversible perfusion defect (RevPD) from flow-limiting coronary stenosis, CMR late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is currently the most sensitive method for detecting subendocardial infarction (MI). We therefore tested the hypothesis that characterization of these 2 processes from coronary artery disease by CMR can provide complementary prognostic values. We performed CMR myocardial perfusion imaging followed by LGE imaging on 254 patients referred with symptoms of myocardial ischemia. At a median follow-up of 17 months, 49 cardiac events occurred, including 12 cardiac deaths, 16 acute MIs, and 21 cardiac hospitalizations. RevPD and LGE both maintained a >3-fold association with cardiac death or acute MI (death/MI) when adjusted for each other and for the effects of patient age and gender (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.31; P=0.02; and hazard ratio, 3.43; P=0.01, respectively). In patients without a history of MI who had negative RevPD, LGE presence was associated with a >11-fold hazards increase in death/MI. Patients with neither RevPD nor LGE had a 98.1% negative annual event rate for death/MI. For association with major adverse cardiac events, RevPD was the strongest multivariable variable in the best overall model (hazard ratio, 10.92; P<0.0001).

Self-reported household financial problems, measured at baseline (1985-88) and Phase 3 (1991-93), were used to construct a five-category score of persistent economic difficulties. Associations between economic difficulties and incident coronary events were determined over an average follow-up of 7 years. Other socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioural and biological explanatory variables were obtained from the Phase 3 questionnaire and clinical examination. Age-adjusted Cox regression analyses demonstrated steep gradients in the incidence of coronary events with economic difficulties. The relative hazard between the bottom and the top of the difficulties hierarchy was 2.5 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.2-5.2) for fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), 2.1 (1.3-3.6) for MI plus definite angina and 2.8 (1.9-4.2) for total coronary events. Adjustment for other markers of socioeconomic position, early life factors, psychosocial work environment characteristics and health-related behaviours had little effect, while adjustment for the biological factors reduced the association between difficulties and coronary events by 16-24%.

This coronarogenic theory was supported by the very close correspondence between poststenotic supplying areas and the localization and extent of myocardial infarctions (Hort 1979).

Assessment of the coronary blood flow velocity using high-frequency Doppler enables us to examine the presence of coronary stenosis and the patency of bypass graft. Left ventricular remodeling is a cause of progressive heart failure after myocardial infarction, and echocardiography allows us to measure the left ventricular volume and ejection fraction. Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography has made this measurement process accurate and easy. Dyssynchrony is another mechanism that worsens ventricular contractile performance, and several echocardiographic indexes were proposed to diagnose it. Cardiac resynchronization therapy, if it is performed with cardiac surgery, can correct the dyssynchrony and enhance the functional improvement. Severity of diastolic dysfunction can predict the prognosis of patients with coronary artery diseases, and we can assess it from the mitral flow velocity pattern; normal, abnormal, pseudonormal and restrictive.

Platelet reactivity was measured in 49 patients with means of impedance aggregometry (Multiplate) before reperfusion and repeated in the subacute phase of STEMI. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was used to detect IMH, which was found in 16 (33%) patients. There were no differences in platelet reactivity between patients with and without IMH before reperfusion. Reassessment in the subacute phase of STEMI demonstrated that patients with IMH had lower thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation (P = .004) and trends toward lower values of ristocetin and collagen-induced platelet aggregation (P = .09 and P = .07). The TRAP-induced platelet aggregation and initial perfusion grade were the factors independently associated with IMH.

However, fatal ventricular fibrillation occurs frequently in the absence of symptomatic warning arrhythmias. Several classifications of ventricular arrhythmias are discussed. The morphology of ventricular premature complexes (VPC), their frequency and complexity at rest, during ordinary activity, or after exercise do not influence life expectancy of subjects without heart disease, nor in those with coronary artery disease with no history of myocardial infarction. In the survivors of myocardial infarction, the frequency and \"complexity\" of ventricular arrhythmias appears to be an independent risk factor for sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. However, the low specificity and predictive value of ventricular arrhythmias makes their assessment difficult for practical purposes. The prognosis of most patients with ventricular arrhythmias is determined predominantly by the condition of the heart. \"Complex\" arrhythmias at rest and during exercise do not appear to worsen prognosis and life expectancy in individuals without heart disease. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has serious limitations as a guide for clinical decision making. Ventricular tachycardias in patients with coronary artery disease are not strictly related to the frequency and \"complexity\" of ventricular premature complex, but correlate with the presence of ventricular aneurysms, poor ventricular function and late potentials in the signal-averaged high frequency electrocardiogram. Recording of such late potentials is a new and promising noninvasive technique for identification of patients with serious arrhythmias but the sensitivity and specificity of this method remains to be established.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2429748/"}

The prevalence of risk factors were: 84% heart attack, 31% diabetes and 84% hypertension. There were no angiographic pathological findings in 12% of the sample. The neuroticism levels of the sample was higher than in the general population. There were almost no pre-post differences for depression, anxiety, psychological well-being, self-efficacy, resilience or locus of control. At the mid-term, well-being and anxiety decreased and internal locus of control increased. Neuroticism was negatively and extraversion and openness were positively associated with mental state and resources. The sample showed persistent adverse subsyndromal depressivity.

Incidence is generally not as readily accessible as prevalence. Cohort studies and electronic health record systems are two major way to estimate disease incidence. The former is time-consuming and expensive; the latter is not available in most developing countries. Alternatively, mathematical models could be used to estimate disease incidence from prevalence. We proposed and validated a method to estimate the age-standardized incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with prevalence data from successive surveys and mortality data from empirical studies. Hallett's method designed for estimating HIV infections in Africa was modified to estimate the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in the U.S. population and incidence of heart disease in the Canadian population. Model-derived estimates were in close agreement with observed incidence from cohort studies and population surveillance systems. This method correctly captured the trend in incidence given sufficient waves of cross-sectional surveys. The estimated MI declining rate in the U.S. population was in accordance with the literature. This method was superior to closed cohort, in terms of the estimating trend of population cardiovascular disease incidence. It is possible to estimate CVD incidence accurately at the population level from cross-sectional prevalence data. This method has the potential to be used for age- and sex- specific incidence estimates, or to be expanded to other chronic conditions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28114890/"}

Acoustic cardiography (AUDICOR, Inovise Medical, Inc., Portland, OR, USA) is a major recent advance in the evolution of cardiac auscultation technology. The technique is more efficient and less operator-dependent. It synchronizes cardiac auscultation with ECG recording and provides a comprehensive assessment of both mechanical and electronic function of the heart. The application of acoustic cardiography is far beyond auscultation only. It generates various parameters which have been proven to correlate with gold standards in heart failure diagnosis and ischemic heart disease detection. Its application can be extended to other diseases, including LV hypertrophy, constrictive pericarditis, sleep apnea and ventricular fibrillation.

The primary objective of the present study was to determine the proportion of PCI patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy at a large, tertiary-care referral centre. Patients undergoing a first PCI between August 2000 and August 2002 with corresponding inpatient medication information were included in the study. Patient demographics, procedural variables, and lipid-lowering and other evidence-based cardiac medication data were collected. A multiple logistical regression model was constructed to evaluate the factors associated with the use of lipid-lowering therapy. Of the 3254 cases included in the analyses, 52% were elective, 44% were urgent or salvage, and 4% were emergent. The mean patient age was 63 years, and 73% of patients were male. Over 76% of patients were receiving lipid-lowering therapy at the time of PCI. Patient use of other medications was as follows: acetylsalicylic acid in 96%, beta-blocker in 80% and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in 59%. In the multiple regression analysis, variables significantly associated with lipid-lowering therapy use included hypercholesterolemia, beta-blocker use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, case urgency, prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, age and sex. Lipid-lowering therapy use rates exceeded those previously reported in the literature. Women and patients undergoing elective procedures appear to be treated less often with lipid-lowering therapy.

The purpose of this study was to determine the added value of the new ACS algorithm in assisting ED physicians to obtain a more accurate diagnosis in patients with ACS. The new algorithm combines a rule-based decision tree, which uses well-known clinical criteria and a data-centered neural network model for more robust pattern recognition. Input parameters of the neural network model consist of morphology features of derived Frank X, Y, Z waveforms and the patient's gender and age. The neural network model was trained with electrocardiograms obtained from documented acute myocardial infarction patients at the Mayo Clinic who were a part of a research ACS database, which includes electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 5,000 individuals at hospital admission (1st ECG in the ED). The test set portion of the study was conducted in 2 steps: 1) One emergency physician and 1 cardiologist classified 1,902 clinically correlated out-of-hospital ECGs without seeing the interpretation statement from the algorithm into 1 of the following categories: 1) acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemia, or nonischemic; 2) After 9 months, the same 2 physicians classified the same group of ECGs but with the interpretation statement of the algorithm printed on the tracing. The results demonstrated that with the assistance of the new algorithm, the emergency physician and cardiologist improved their sensitivity of interpreting acute myocardial infarction by 50% and 26%, respectively, without a loss of specificity. The new algorithm also improved the emergency physician's acute ischemia interpretation sensitivity by 53% and still maintained a reasonable specificity (91%).

However, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for percutaneous coronary intervention door-to-balloon time (<90 minutes) in patients with STEMI is a infrequently accomplished goal. This study enrolled 277 patients with STEMI who were self-transported or transported by emergency medical services to NorthEast Medical Center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. This study tested the hypothesis that prehospital wireless transmission of an electrocardiogram to a cardiologist's hand-held device results in shorter emergency department door-to-reperfusion time. A comparison was made between patients whose electrocardiogram was successfully transmitted during the intervention phase with (1) patients transported by the emergency medical services in the preintervention, (2) patients self-transported in the intervention phase, and (3) patients whose wireless transmission failed in the intervention phase. During the preintervention phase (2001 to 2003), 48 patients were enrolled. During the intervention phase (2003 to 2005), the following patients were enrolled: 101 self-transported patients, 24 patients with successful electrocardiographic transmission, and 19 patients for whom transmission failed. The median door-to-reperfusion time for patients with successful electrocardiographic transmission was 50 minutes, which was significantly shorter than a preintervention time of 101 minutes (p <0.0001), an intervention phase self-transport time of 96 minutes (p <0.0001), and a failed transmission time of 78 minutes (p <0.0001). In conclusion, prehospital wireless electrocardiographic transmission to a cardiologist's hand-held device significantly decreased emergency department door-to-reperfusion time, thus achieving the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for patients with STEMI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056318/"}

Patients in the first group have no significant complications, and approximately 95 per cent of these patients recover fully without any specific therapy. Patients in the second group may have various complications, some of which are benign, whereas others may lead to a fatal outcome. The complications may be divided into four major types: 1. Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction defects. The tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias are the most frequently encountered complications in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Tachyarrhythmias include ventricular premature beats, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. Bradyarrhythmias include sinus and junctional bradycardia and various degrees of heart block. Those patients who are unable to reach a hospital and die suddenly presumably succumb to ventricular fibrillation. 2. Left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. In more than 33 per cent of patients with acute myocardial infarction, a third heart sound and pulmonary rales may be heard. If they are present for only 24 hours, the physical findings may indicate an alteration of left ventricular failure. However, if they persist for a few days and disappear after medical therapy, mild left ventricular failure may be present. About 12 per cent of patients have acute pulmonary edema, and 10 per cent of patients develop cardiogenic shock. These two complications carry a high mortality rate (40 per cent and nearly 100 per cent respectively). 3. Rupture of the heart. Cardiac rupture may occur in the free wall, ventricular septum, and papillary muscles. These complications, although less frequently encountered, cause a number of deaths in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 4. Thromboembolism. Under this category are included pulmonary embolism, systemic arterial embolism, and systemic venous thrombosis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1104171/"}

Summary data for telomere length, four epigenetic clocks (such as intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration), four types of coronary heart disease (such as myocardial infarction) were collected from the most updated and available genome-wide association studies. Instrumental variables were extracted from the exposure-related summary data according to correlation, independence and exclusivity assumptions. Three Mendelian randomization methods (such as inverse variance weighted) were used for causal inference. Four sensitivity analyses (such as MR-Egger intercept) were performed to prevent horizontal pleiotropy. Inverse variance weighted reported that longer telomere length was related to the lower risk of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris and coronary atherosclerosis (P = 8.840e-11, P = 9.830e-04, P = 1.539e-05, P = 2.607e-09). Inverse variance weighted also reported that four epigenetic clocks might be not implicated in the risk of these coronary heart diseases. Furthermore, there was not enough evidence to confirm the effect of coronary heart disease on these ageing biomarkers. Longer telomere length, but not the epigenetic clock changes, genetically decreased the risk of coronary heart disease. Considering that telomere length and epigenetic clocks were two independent ageing biomarkers, the correlation between ageing and coronary heart disease might be redefined at the genetic level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37948032/"}

It has been well established that cardiovascular dysregulation plays major roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. This is the reason why most drugs currently used in cardiology have significant pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular regulatory system. Since the ultimate center for cardiovascular regulation is the brainstem, it is conceivable that autonomic neuromodulation would have significant impacts on cardiovascular diseases. On the basis of this framework, we first developed a bionic, neurally regulated artificial pacemaker. We then substituted the brainstem by CPU and developed a bionic artificial baroreflex system. We further developed a bionic brain that achieved better regulatory conditions than the native brainstem in order to improve survival in animal model with heart failure. We recently developed a bionic neuromodulation system to reduce infarction size following acute myocardial infarction. We believe that the bionic neuromodulation will inspire even more intricate applications in cardiology in the 21(st) century.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19964774/"}

SENC was initially described in the year 2001. Since then, the SENC sequence has undergone several technical developments, aiming at the detection of strain during single-heartbeat acquisitions (fast-SENC). Experimental and clinical studies that used SENC and fast-SENC or compared SENC with conventional cine or tagged magnetic resonance in phantoms, animals, healthy volunteers, or patients were systematically searched for in PubMed. Using 'strain-encoded magnetic resonance and SENC' as keywords, three phantom and three animal studies were identified, along with 27 further clinical studies, involving 185 healthy subjects and 904 patients. SENC (i) enabled reproducible assessment of myocardial deformation in vitro, in animals and in healthy volunteers, (ii) showed high reproducibility and substantially lower time spent compared with conventional tagging, (iii) exhibited incremental value to standard cine imaging for the detection of inducible ischaemia and for the risk stratification of patients with ischaemic heart disease, and (iv) enabled the diagnostic classification of patients with transplant vasculopathy, cardiomyopathies, pulmonary hypertension, and diabetic heart disease. SENC has the potential to detect a wide range of myocardial diseases early, accurately, and without the need of contrast agent injection, possibly enabling the initiation of specific cardiac therapies during earlier disease stages. Its one-heartbeat acquisition mode during free breathing results in shorter cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocols, making its implementation in the clinical realm promising.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021534/"}

Of the patients, 34.8% underwent VSR closure in acute phase (<21 days after VSR occurrence), 17.4% underwent device closure due to significant residual shunt after previous VSR surgery. Success rate was 78.3%. More than moderate residual shunt, major complications, and early surgical reintervention affected 18.9%, 15.2% (including 2 intra-procedural deaths), and 21.7% of patients, respectively. Early mortality was 26.1% (13.9% in successful vs. 70% in unsuccessful closure; p < 0.001). Older age, need for intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, severe complications, and procedural failure were identified as risk factors for early mortality. Among patients who survived the early period, the 5-year survival rate was 57.1%. NYHA class improved in 88.2% patients at the latest follow-up. Procedure of VSR device closure demonstrates an acceptable technical success rate; however, the incidence of severe complications and early mortality is notably high. Older patients in poor hemodynamic condition and those with unsuccessful occluder deployment are particularly at a higher risk of a fatal outcome. The prognosis after early survival is promising.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38307419/"}

However, the role of factor V Leiden in the formation of left ventricular (LV) thrombus has not been studied. We investigated whether factor V Leiden is a risk factor for LV thrombus in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We have analyzed clinical, echocardiographic and biochemical data in 135 consecutive patients (aged 58 +/- 13 years; 31 women) with first anterior AMI. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination was performed on days 1, 3, 7, 15 and 30; LV thrombus was detected in 33 (24.4%) of 135 patients with AMI. The study also included 95 control subjects. Healthy age and sex-matched subjects without a personal or family history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke or thromboembolic disease served as a control group. Blood samples from the patients and controls were analyzed for the factor V Leiden mutation by DNA analysis, using the polymerase chain reaction. In addition, concentrations of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and D-dimer were measured in 135 patients. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of factor V Leiden between patients and control subjects. The prevalence of the factor V mutation was 9% (3/33) in patients with thrombus, and 7.7% (8/103) in patients without thrombus. The prevalence of factor V Leiden was 7.3% (7/95) in control subjects. No significant differences in plasma fibrinogen (480 +/- 195 vs. 444 +/- 179 mg/dl, p = 0.6), D-dimer (471 +/- 256 vs. 497 +/- 293 ng/dl, p = 0.7), vWF (112 +/- 18 vs. 103 +/- 15%, p=0.5), PAI-1 (26.7+/- 9.8 vs. 28.1 +/- 10.2 ng/dl, p = 0.6), and t-PA (19.8 +/- 8.7 vs. 17.2 +/- 9.1 ng/dl, p = 0.7), levels are found in patients with LV thrombus when compared with those without LV thrombus.

{"id": "25403783", "title": "Intramyocardial haemorrhage after acute myocardial infarction.", "text": "In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the guideline-recommended treatment is mechanical revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is effective at reducing mortality. However, a substantial proportion of patients with AMI develop chronic cardiac failure owing to poor restoration of microvascular function and myocardial perfusion, despite restoration of epicardial vessel patency. This occurrence is called the 'no-reflow' phenomenon. Although pathological and clinical observations initially seemed to support the hypothesis that no-reflow was the result of microvascular obstruction, irreversible microvascular injury and subsequent intramyocardial haemorrhage are now also thought to be important factors in this process. Intramyocardial haemorrhage shares several pathophysiological features with the haemorrhagic transformation that occurs after ischaemic stroke. Understanding of the role of intramyocardial haemorrhage in the no-reflow phenomenon and myocardial injury is crucial to the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat AMI. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the pathogenesis and clinical relevance of intramyocardial haemorrhage, and discuss diagnostic options and future therapeutic strategies.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25403783/"}

(a) The hyperkinetic syndrome, the earliest clinical sign in thyrotoxicosis (vasodilatation, increase in inotropism, automatism, etc.), is mediated by a two-fold increase in the number of beta-receptors, and supported by an adequate synthesis of ATP and creatinphosphate (CP) in the young and, to a lesser extent, in the elderly. Genetical heart reserves are mobilized, thus significantly increasing the number and the size of mitochondria and also the enzymatic equipment (such as: the alpha-glycerophosphate-dehydrogenase, malic, pentosic cycles, etc.), a.s.o. Due to an excessive adrenergic action (glycogenolysis, an excessive oxygen consumption, up to necrosis, the ATP and CP syntheses dramatically drop; the phosphorus/oxygen ratio decreases to 2 (normal = 4). In this condition, the high functional cardiovascular performances are also impaired (the submaximal effort capacity is attained at a smaller and smaller oxygen consumption; Propranolol 2 mg i.v. decreased the cardiac output by above 30% (vs 10%--normal); electrocardiogram presents aspects of \"coronary disease\", tachycardia, etc.). An ultrastructural damage occurs: from \"mitochondrial disease\", partial lysis of myofibrils, to myofibrosis (revealed postmortem), in spite of a reduced degree of coronary atherosclerosis. Ultrastructural and biochemical experimental data support this point of view. (b) The incidence, precocity and severity of the thyrotoxic heart increase with age and the existence of a previous cardiovascular pathology. Cardiothyreosis is not present under 27 years; in 4,353 patients its incidence is of 25% (arrhythmia--21%, heart failure--12%, coronary insufficiency--1-3%). Of a major interest are tachyarrhythmias which may lead to a high mortality by hypodiastolic congestive heart failure, heart failure with secondary hyperaldosteronism, thromboembolic episodes and ventricular fibrillation. Thyrotoxicosis favours the disease of papillary muscles--mitral prolapse and insufficiency, reversible especially in children. (c) The treatment of thyrotoxic heart is an etiologic one (medical, surgical, radioactive--the last two being preferable after the adequate medical therapy). In particular, cardiothyreosis requires a reinforced irradiation (10,000 rads instead of 7,000 rads) in smaller 131I doses. The protection against the increased nocivity of catechols in thyrotoxicosis is very important (which explains the high mortality in the thyrotoxic \"storm\") and requires propranolol; doses above 2 mg/kilo body/day are recommended. In the elderly, the sensitivity to propranolol decreases: verapamil i.v. is more efficient in paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias (flutter, atrial fibrillation) and in those occurring intra-operatively during halothane narcosis. The anticoagulant therapy is administered in tachyarrhythmias with high ventricular rate, especially in the elderly, to avoid the embolic risk, higher in defibrillation condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1821070/"}

Although patients with FDG+ segments have been found to be at risk for adverse events, the prognostic significance of viable myocardium in relation to other influences on postinfarction prognosis, including revascularization, remain ill defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative prognostic significance of FDG+ tissue and to establish whether myocardial revascularization in patients with viable tissue attenuates the risk of adverse outcome. One hundred thirty-seven patients with left ventricular dysfunction and resting perfusion defects after myocardial infarction underwent positron emission tomography with both dipyridamole stress Rb-82 perfusion imaging and FDG imaging. After the exclusion of 4 patients proceeding to transplantation, 2 with uninterpretable scans and 2 lost to follow-up, 129 patients were followed clinically for 17 +/- 9 months. Four groups were defined: patients with FDG+ dysfunctional myocardium who were revascularized (n = 49) or treated medically (n = 21) and those with FDG- segments who were revascularized (n = 19) or treated medically (n = 40). The groups of patients with FDG+ or FDG- findings, with and without revascularization, did not differ with respect to known determinants of postinfarction prognosis: age, left ventricular ejection fraction, or the prevalence of multivessel disease. Nonfatal ischemic events occurred in 48% of medically treated FDG+ patients compared with 8% of revascularized patients with FDG+ tissue (P < .001) and 5% of patients with FDG- myocardium (P < .001). Thirteen patients died from cardiac causes; 11 (85%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 30%, and these patients were evenly distributed between FDG+ and FDG- groups. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, only the presence of FDG+ myocardium (odds ratio, 12.9; P < .001) and the absence of revascularization (odds ratio, 5.8; P = .002) independently predicted ischemic events, while only age (P = .02) and ejection fraction (P < .001) but not the presence of viable myocardium were predictive of death. Residual viable myocardium after myocardial infarction may act as an unstable substrate for further events unless it is revascularized. Despite this association, age and left ventricular dysfunction remained the strongest predictors of cardiac death after myocardial infarction in these patients with a spectrum of left ventricular dysfunction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7994809/"}

We studied first AMI patients who participated in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (N = 1732). During or shortly after the hospitalization, patients or their family members completed a questionnaire regarding bereavement, sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle factors; five months after their first infarction, surviving patients attended a clinical examination. Participants were followed for cardiovascular events and mortality for a median of 14 years. Overall bereavement, that is, death of a close friend or family member (including spouse/partner), the year before the first AMI was not associated with the combined outcome of non-fatal recurrent AMI and death due to ischaemic heart diseases. However, exposure to the loss of the spouse/partner was associated with an increased risk of the outcome (adjusted hazard ratio and (95% confidence interval): 1.55 (1.06-2.27)).

ED patients with chest pain had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hs-cTnT) collected on presentation and 1- and 2-hours later at a single academic centre over a 2-year period. The primary outcome was index MI, and the secondary outcome was 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). All outcomes were adjudicated. We enrolled 608 patients undergoing serial hs-cTnT sampling. Of these, 350 had a valid 1-hour and 550 had a 2-hour hs-cTnT sample. Index MI and 30-day MACE prevalence was ~12% and 14%. Sensitivity of the 1- and 2-hour algorithms was similar for index MI 97.3% (95% CI: 85.8-99.9%) and 100% (95% CI: 91.6-100%) and 30-day MACE: 80.9% (95% CI: 66.7-90.9%) and 83.3% (95% CI: 73.2-90.8%), respectively.

Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large aneurysm of the lateral wall of the left ventricle with a thrombus adhering to the wall. Coronary angiography and levocardiography confirmed the aneurysm and detected an occlusion of the distal part of the circumflex artery. Surgical aneurysm resection with thrombectomy and endoventricular circular plasty (Dor procedure) was performed without postoperative complications. Six months after surgery the patient was in good general condition without any angina. Follow-up echocardiography as well as cardiac MRI gave proof of an excellent postoperative result.

Detection of these events can be challenging, because 'typical' symptoms of myocardial ischemia may not be present or may be masked in the perioperative period. Therefore, surveillance by means of intraoperative cardiac monitoring and postoperative serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) and troponins may be needed. Cardiac monitoring not infrequently detects ST-segment changes suggestive of ischemia during or shortly after surgery. To respond to these changes, the risk for coronary artery disease should be assessed before recommending additional interventions. For all vascular surgery patients, and for patients who have or are felt to be at risk for coronary artery disease, serial postoperative 12-lead ECGs and troponins should be considered. Among surgical patients not meeting these criteria, obtaining routine ECGs in the absence of signs or symptoms that suggest a cardiac event may be falsely reassuring and is not felt to be useful. The presence of elevated postoperative troponins predicts worsened prognosis, and argues for intensified risk factor modification. The need for noninvasive cardiac testing or cardiac catheterization should be made on an individual basis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18176293/"}

The nature of the electrocardiographic abnormalities and their relationship with symptoms of effort pain and prolonged chest pain suggests that much of the disease seen in this population is ultimately ischaemic in origin despite evidence that classical myocardial infarction and severe coronary atheroma are relatively infrequent. Nevertheless both the symptoms and the electrocardiographic abnormalities had features that were not completely typical of occlusive disease of extramural coronary arteries. These findings are discussed in terms of the four conditions-hypertension, conventional coronary heart disease, small artery disease, and cardiomyopathy-that are believed to account for most cases of heart disease in this community, and it is concluded that the overall pattern of disease cannot be explained by any single disorder of overriding importance.

Aerobic interval training (AIT), walking/running four times four minutes at 85-95% of peak heart rate, has proven to be effective in increasing peak oxygen uptake in coronary heart disease patients. As some patients do not attend organized rehabilitation programs, home-based exercise should be an alternative. We investigated whether AIT could be performed effectively at home, and compared the effects on peak oxygen uptake with that observed after a standard care, four-week residential rehabilitation. Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were randomized to residential rehabilitation or home-based AIT. At six months follow-up, peak oxygen uptake increased 4.6 (±2.7) and 3.9 (±3.6) mL·kg(-1) min(-1) (both p<0.005, non-significant between-group difference) after residential rehabilitation and AIT, respectively. Quality of life increased significantly in both groups, with no statistical significant difference between groups. We found no evidence for a different treatment effect between patients randomized to home-based AIT compared to patients attending organized rehabilitation (95% confidence interval -1.8, 3.5). AIT patients reported good adherence to exercise training. Even though these first data indicate positive effects of home-based AIT in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, more studies are needed to provide supporting evidence for the application of this rehabilitation strategy.

Besides, any error in diagnosis of cardiac disease can be dangerous and risks an individual's life. Accurate diagnosis is therefore critical in cardiology. Data Mining (DM) classification techniques have been used to diagnosis heart diseases but still limited by some challenges of data quality such as inconsistencies, noise, missing data, outliers, high dimensionality and imbalanced data. Data preprocessing (DP) techniques were therefore used to prepare data with the goal of improving the performance of heart disease DM based prediction systems. The purpose of this study is to review and summarize the current evidence on the use of preprocessing techniques in heart disease classification as regards: (1) the DP tasks and techniques most frequently used, (2) the impact of DP tasks and techniques on the performance of classification in cardiology, (3) the overall performance of classifiers when using DP techniques, and (4) comparisons of different combinations classifier-preprocessing in terms of accuracy rate. A systematic literature review is carried out, by identifying and analyzing empirical studies on the application of data preprocessing in heart disease classification published in the period between January 2000 and June 2019. A total of 49 studies were therefore selected and analyzed according to the aforementioned criteria. The review results show that data reduction is the most used preprocessing task in cardiology, followed by data cleaning. In general, preprocessing either maintained or improved the performance of heart disease classifiers. Some combinations such as (ANN + PCA), (ANN + CHI) and (SVM + PCA) are promising terms of accuracy.

However, evaluation of cardiac function by this technique has been limited by long imaging times and low temporal resolution. New, recently described pulse sequences shorten imaging time considerably and improve temporal resolution. This paper reports our early experience with cine MR imaging of the heart, a technique of gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS) that uses low flip angles and gradient-recalled echoes. Images were obtained in 36 subjects (14 normal volunteers and 22 patients with coronary artery or valvular heart disease) and displayed in a cinegraphic mode for assessment of cardiac function. The acquisition of 10 to 12 levels, covering the whole heart with up to 24 time frames per level, required a maximum imaging time of only 30 min. Because systole and diastole were readily identified, and the contrast between blood and surrounding structures was excellent, systolic wall thickening, wall motion, and motion of the cardiac valves were visualized easily. Regions of myocardial infarcts were clearly visible and characterized by lack of systolic wall thickening and/or diastolic wall thinning. Turbulence caused signal loss within the flowing blood, which usually had higher signal intensity than myocardium. Therefore, turbulent blood flow in valvular regurgitation and in valvular and subvalvular stenosis could be detected. Cine MR imaging is a promising new technique for the evaluation of myocardial and valvular function.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3492096/"}

A prospective, multicenter registry study of CCTA with a Visipaque injection 320 mg I/ml was carried out in symptomatic patients suspected of having CAD as part of their medical care. CCTA findings were used to guide patient management decisions. Patient cardiac outcomes were followed at 1, 6, and 12 months after the CCTA procedure for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization). All cardiac outcome events or deaths were adjudicated independently. Of 874 patients (mean age=59 years; 51% men) who received Visipaque, 857 were included in the efficacy analysis. Using cardiac outcomes as the endpoint, the sensitivity of CCTA was 96.1, 95.8, and 94.7%, specificity was 84.5, 86.6, and 87.0%, and negative predictive value more than 99.0% at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

Issues related to trial design and insufficient accounting for female-predominant disease patterns have contributed to low rates of enrollment of women in certain domains of cardiology research. Accordingly, women do not benefit from as rich an evidence base for cardiology as men. Here, we review major sex differences in heart disease and discuss areas of cardiology research in which women have been underrepresented. Considering the widespread sex differences in cardiovascular structure and function, it is important to include balanced numbers of women and men in cardiovascular clinical trials. Beyond inclusion, sex-specific reporting is also essential. Moreover, with ongoing developments of clinical-trial methodology, it is imperative to seek innovative ways to learn as much as possible about how interventions behave in women and men. Adaptive trials are specifically identified as promising opportunities to consider sex-based analyses at interim stages, allowing sex-specific flexibility as these trials unfold.

In patients with ischemic heart disease, the U wave vector tends to be directed away from the site of the akinetic or dyskinetic region. The change from a negative to an upright U wave after a reduction in blood pressure, renal transplantation, insertion of a valve prosthesis or a coronary arterial bypass graft procedure is associated with a decrease in the QRS amplitude but with no consistent changes in T wave polarity. The timing of the U wave apex is dependent on the duration of ventricular repolarization but not on the duration of the QRS complex.

Therefore, several studies have been performed in order to assess the efficacy of different antithrombotic drugs in resolving the detected thrombi or reducing their embolic potential. Fibrinolytic agents appear effective in this regard: in the majority of cases, they produce complete lysis and resolution of the thrombi. However, this treatment may itself cause embolic complications by producing a rapid fragmentation of thrombus and the subsequent emission of disrupted portions of the intracardiac mass into the systemic vascular bed [2]. This dramatic effect of thrombolysis has suggested the possibility that even the standard treatment of acute myocardial infarction with fibrinolysis implies a danger of embolization in those patients in whom a left ventricular thrombus may be present either from a previous myocardial infarction or from a very early thrombus development. However, this hypothesis has not yet been confirmed by direct observation.

High-risk patients qualifying for antihypertensive medications under the 2017 guidelines were identified using Optum data.

Treatment reduced the risk of AMI or stroke for patients with diabetes, chronic renal disease and obesity and also significantly lowered all-cause healthcare costs in the first postindex year. Initiating antihypertensive medications before experiencing a cardiovascular disease-related clinical event was associated with reduced risk of AMI, stroke and death for all hypertensive patients identified in the new guidelines.

There was also considerable variation in the angle of the maximum vector in the frontal plane (frontal plane angle) and the angle of 50 msec vector in the frontal plane. Similar results were observed in 17 cases of ostium primum atrial septal defect. These differences contrasted with the findings in a normal group of 50 subjects where a close correlation was found. The initial vector was directed to the right in approximately 80% of normals and 60% of the patients with LAD indicative of conduction defects in the left anterior fascicular or its distal ramifications. We conclude that a rightward orientation of the 5--10 msec vector (i.e. causing a Q wave in lead 1) should not be required for diagnosis of left anterior fascicular block. The spatial orientation of the initial vector was always anterior in the control subjects. In these 'normals', as well as in the patients with left axis deviation, the initial vector varied markedly in its azimuth direction (right or left) when superiorly directed; but when inferiorly directed in the normal subjects it was virtually always directed rightward. From these data we were unable to construct rigid criteria which would reliably distinguish aberrant excitation patterns manifested by gross left axis deviation in the electrocardiograms of patients with established heart disease from subjects without defined heart disease.

The goal of the companion AUC documents is to provide a comprehensive resource for multimodality imaging in the context of structural and valvular heart disease, encompassing multiple imaging modalities. Using standardized methodology, the clinical scenarios (indications) were developed by a diverse writing group to represent patient presentations encountered in everyday practice and included common applications and anticipated uses.

A separate, independent rating panel scored the 102 clinical scenarios in this document on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that a modality is considered appropriate for the clinical scenario presented. Midrange scores of 4 to 6 indicate that a modality may be appropriate for the clinical scenario, and scores of 1 to 3 indicate that a modality is considered rarely appropriate for the clinical scenario. The primary objective of the AUC is to provide a framework for the assessment of these scenarios by practices that will improve and standardize physician decision making.

Patients in Taranaki were managed by general physicians and in Waikato they were managed by cardiologists.

The most frequent geriatric patients had heart failure, followed by endocrinological diseases (type 2 diabetes, obesity, struma), neurological diseases (insultus, paresis), and chronic kidney diseases (pielonephritis, nephrolithiasis). The combination of hypertension, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes had the highest comorbidity frequency. The mortality rate for 1998 was 8.81%, for 1999 7.74%, and for 2000 13.41%. The mortality rate at the first 12 hours at the beginning of the acute coronary syndrome was 66.6%. Geriatric patients suffer from many diseases, and at the beginning of the onset of acute coronary syndrome they have multiorganal failure.

Women with a first singleton birth between 1973 and 2019 were included. The outcome of myocardial infarction was categorized as severe if it resulted in death within 7 days, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, impaired left ventricular systolic function, mechanical complication, or ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. The association between preeclampsia and myocardial infarction was investigated using cause-specific hazard models. Among 1 966 096 women with a first singleton birth, 82 980 (4.2%) had preeclampsia. Myocardial infarction was registered in 10 758 (0.5%) of the total population. One-third (n=3672, 34.1%) of myocardial infarctions had severe features and two-thirds (n=6996, 69.1%) were nonsevere. Preeclampsia was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.71 (95% CI, 1.50-1.94) for severe and 1.86 (95% CI, 1.71-2.04) for nonsevere myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction in women with prior preeclampsia compared with women without preeclampsia was associated with a higher risk of death (HR, 3.00 [95% CI, 1.10-8.14]), cardiogenic shock (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.11-2.58]), and impaired left ventricular systolic function (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.11-2.58]), while no association was observed for cardiac arrest (HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.98-1.93]), ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.86-1.18]), or mechanical complication (HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.08-4.15]).

A total of 5362 patients were admitted on 7157 occasions; men accounted for 55% of the admissions. The 1-year mortality rate was 11% for men compared with 10% for women. The women were older and had a higher prevalence of known congestive heart failure and hypertension, whereas the prevalence of previous myocardial infarction was higher in men. When correcting for the dissimilarities in age and history of cardiovascular diseases, male gender appeared as an independent predictor of death. Development of myocardial infarction occurred in 25% of the men and 16% of the women (P < 0.001) during 1 year. The symptoms that brought patients to the emergency room were interpreted as being caused by myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia in 29% of men compared with 21% of women (P < 0.001). In a consecutive series of patients with chest pain or other symptoms suggesting acute myocardial infarction in the emergency room, male gender was an independent risk indicator for death during 1 year.

However, heart failure cannot be regarded as a physiological process; it is caused by a coincidence of an increasing polypathy of the aging heart (coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, hypertrophy, valve-changes,disseminated degenerative changes) and the polypathy or multimorbidity of the whole aging organism. In advanced age the various forms of ischaemic heart disease (angina pectoris, infarction, failure, arrhythmias) show increasingly atypical courses, complications and a higher degree of mortality.

There is a substantial risk of acute decompensation and death in patients with cardiogenic shock or a reduced cardiac reserve undergoing high-risk cardiovascular interventions. The TandemHeart PVAD provides near-total hemodynamic support in this setting. Thirty-seven high-risk patients underwent placement of the TandemHeart PVAD during 38 separate procedures between April 2007 and April 2009. PVAD insertion was considered emergent if a patient was not expected to survive more than 6 hours without PVAD support. Technical success was defined as successful initiation of the PVAD and completion of the intended interventional procedure. All 37 patients were in cardiogenic shock or undergoing complex coronary and valvular interventions with a high probability of hemodynamic collapse. The mean (+/- standard deviation) patient age was 73 +/- 14 years; 97% were in either NYHA class III-IV heart failure or cardiogenic shock; and the mean EuroSCORE was 11 +/- 3.4. Indications for ventricular assist device placement included critical aortic stenosis (n = 8), severe left main coronary stenosis (n = 18), severe multivessel coronary stenosis (n = 19) and severe cardiomyopathy (n = 23). Four patients were being managed for fulminant myocarditis, ventricular free-wall rupture, flail mitral valve or severe paravalvular leak. Despite their critical status and frequent (82%) need for post-procedure blood transfusion, this complex and high-risk patient population tolerated PVAD-supported intervention well and technical success was achieved in all patients. Seventy-one percent of patients survived to hospital discharge with improved functional status. Most deaths occurred in patients not expected to survive due to their moribund status and multiorgan failure.

The authors compared the electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretations of these two entities by emergency physicians (EPs) and cardiologists. Twenty-five cases (13 BER, 12 AMI) of patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain were identified. Criteria for BER required four of the following: 1) widespread STE (precordial greater than limb leads), 2) J-point elevation, 3) concavity of initial up-sloping portion of ST segment, 4) notching or irregular contour of J point, and 5) prominent, concordant T waves. Additional BER criteria were 1) stable ECG pattern, 2) negative cardiac injury markers, and 3) normal cardiac stress test or angiography. AMI criteria were 1) regional STE, 2) positive cardiac injury markers, and 3) identification of culprit coronary artery by angiography in less than eight hours of presentation. The 25 ECGs were distributed to 12 EPs and 12 cardiologists (four in academic medicine, four in community practice, and four in community academics [health maintenance organization] in each physician group). The physicians were informed of the patients' age, gender, and race, and they then interpreted the ECGs as BER or AMI. Undercalls (AMI misdiagnosed as BER) and overcalls (BER misdiagnosed as AMI) were calculated for each physician group. Cardiologists correctly interpreted 90% of ECGs, and EPs correctly interpreted 81% of ECGs. The proportion of undercalls (missed AMI/total AMI) was 2.8% for cardiologists (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09% to 5.5%) compared with 9.7% for EPs (95% CI = 4.8% to 14.6%) (p = 0.02). The proportion of overcalls (missed BER/total BER) was 17.3% for cardiologists (95% CI = 11.4% to 23.3%) versus 27.6% for EPs (95% CI = 20.6% to 34.6%) (p = 0.03).

Forty six patients (41 men and five women; mean age 56 years) were allocated into two groups based on the extent of precordial ST segment depression: widespread (V1-V6) ST depression v localised (V1-V4) ST depression. Patients with no reciprocal ST depression or patients with ST depression in V1-V4 but with ST elevation in V5 and V6 (inferolateral acute myocardial infarction) were excluded. All patients were catheterised during hospital admission for infarction. Twenty four of the 28 patients with ST depression in V1-V6 had significant lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery whereas 16 of the 18 patients with ST depression in V1-V4 had insignificant or no lesions in the left anterior descending artery. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of widespread ST depression in predicting disease in the left anterior descending coronary artery were 92%, 80%, and 86% and 89% respectively. In patients with inferior acute myocardial infarction and precordial ST depression, the extent of ST depression is of clinical significance. Widespread (V1-V6) ST depression suggests disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery, whereas localised ST depression (V1-V4) indicates its absence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2375894/"}

Somewhat discordant results from smaller clinical trials with diverse study designs, BMC types, routes of injection, timing after myocardial infarction (MI), and other key study variables have been less than conclusive. Because of this uncertainty regarding outcomes of BMC therapy, a large number of meta-analyses have been performed, also with dissimilar findings. Although the field continues to evolve with emergence of data from newer and larger clinical trials with more stringent design, the overall evidence does support efficacy of BMC injection in patients with IHD with regard to improvement in cardiac parameters as well as patient outcomes. Given the limitless potential of adult stem cell therapy in general, at this juncture, a careful appraisal of the cumulative evidence is critically necessary to appreciate the true impact of BMC therapy on injured heart.

To provide an analysis of the self-reported prevalence of heart disease and three specific cardiac conditions--myocardial infarction (MI), angina and congestive heart failure (CHF)--in subgroups of the Canadian population. Data from the Public Use Microdata File from Statistics Canada's 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) were used to estimate the crude self-reported prevalence of heart disease, MI, angina and CHF in Canada. The data are reported by age and sex groups, as well as by province or territory and health region. Based on the 2000/2001 CCHS data, it was estimated that among Canadians 12 years of age and older, 5.0% (n=1,286,000) have heart disease, 2.1% (n=537,000) have had a heart attack, 1.9% (n=483,000) have angina and 1.0% (n=264,000) have CHF. Marked variation in the prevalence of heart disease and the other specific cardiac conditions exists across age and sex groups, and across geographical regions. The prevalence of heart disease is low among those younger than 50 years; thereafter, the prevalence of heart disease increases and is more common among men than among women. By 70 years of age, at least one in four men and one in five women report having heart disease. Large differences in the burden of heart disease were observed across provinces, territories and health regions. Comparison of the highest and lowest prevalence rates among provinces and territories revealed a 1.9-fold difference for heart disease, a 2.8-fold difference for MI, a 2.3-fold difference for angina and a 3.3-fold difference for CHF. Large regional differences in the prevalence of heart disease and other specific cardiac conditions were observed across Canada. These data may assist health system planners to identify those regions and population subgroups most affected by heart disease, and to support the development of heart disease prevention and treatment programs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16341294/"}

Later on, such units have expanded their attitude according to patients' needs. In fact, during the last decades, subjects have become progressively older, with an increasing number of comorbidities. In addition, growing numbers of patients with severe heart failure, rhythm disturbances, massive pulmonary embolism or severe valvular dysfunction need intensive care. Thus, at present admission to CCUs is not limited to patients with AMI, but has extended to a large number of severe cardiac conditions that need highly specialized care and very complex procedures. Therefore, it is not surprising that physicians in charge of these CCUs need to expand their skills. In fact, they should be able to recognize and treat a wide variety of acute cardiac conditions and different comorbidities. In addition, they should be familiar with all the diagnostic and therapeutic options available in a modern CCU (ECG, echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements and their interpretation, cardiac and coronary angiography, cardiac and non-cardiac pharmacotherapy, and interventional cardiology). In addition they should be able to use all the equipment needed like cardiac echocardiography, pulmonary artery catheters, cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators, mechanical ventilators, dialysis equipment, intra-aortic balloon pump and ventricular assist devices). Moreover, CCUs have a crucial role in the management of all cardiac emergencies according to an integrated cardiac network model. In this model, the CCU of a referring center (Hub) plays a central role in keeping continuous and tight relations with the other peripheral hospitals (Spoke) that have a prominent and unique role in the selection and early treatment of acute cardiac patients and their follow-up. Thus, all these evolving needs of acute cardiac patients look for skilled doctors and highly specialized CCUs.

In developed countries, congenital heart disease is becoming increasingly prevalent in nonpediatric patients, including pregnant women. Actions aimed at preventing coronary heart disease must be started early in infancy and should involve the promotion of a healthy diet and lifestyle. Recent developments in echocardiography include the introduction of three-dimensional echocardiography and of new techniques such as two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging, which can be used for both anatomical and functional investigations in patients with complex heart disease, including a univentricular heart. Progress has also occurred in fetal cardiology, with new data on prognosis and prognostic factors and developments in intrauterine interventions, though indications for these interventions have still to be established. Heart transplantation has become a routine procedure, supplemented in some cases by circulatory support devices. In catheter interventions, new devices have become available for the closure of atrial or ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus as well as for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation.

Coronary thrombotic events involve conditions of high shear rate present in areas of vessel stenosis or disrupted atherosclerotic plaque, which lead to activation of both platelets and the coagulation system, and are best prevented by platelet inhibitors alone or in combination with an anticoagulant. However, thromboembolism that originates in the venous system or cardiac chambers is related to situations of blood stasis and low shear rate, which predominantly result in clotting activation and fibrin-thrombus formation and are best approached with anticoagulant therapy. For prevention of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, early mobilization is essential and should be supplemented by low-dose heparin in patients at high risk, including the elderly and those with large infarcts, heart failure or previous thromboembolic events. For prevention of left ventricular mural thrombosis and systemic embolism, high-dose heparinization is indicated in patients with large infarcts, particularly in the anterior location and in those with heart failure. Subsequently, warfarin therapy should be considered for patients at high embolic risk, including those with echocardiographic evidence of mobile and protruding thrombi, severe left ventricular dysfunction or prior emboli. In patients with acute infarction, aspirin is recommended for preventing coronary reocclusion and reinfarction. Although anticoagulants may also be of benefit for this purpose, their use is still controversial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2665469/"}

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with normal or near-normal coronary arteries (ACS-NNOCA) appear to have a higher prevalence in both COVID-19 positive and negative patients in the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic era. Echocardiography, coronary angiography, chest computed tomography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may render a correct diagnosis, obviating the need for endomyocardial biopsy. Importantly, a significant delay has been recorded in patients with ACS seeking advice for their symptoms, while their routine care has been sharply disrupted with fewer urgent coronary angiographies and/or primary percutaneous coronary interventions performed in the case of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) with an inappropriate shift toward thrombolysis, all contributing to a higher complication rate in these patients.

A total of 22 697 consecutive patients undergoing either CABG or PCI were included. Associations between operator grade and mortality were assessed by hazard ratios, estimated by Cox regression analyses; 6689 patients underwent CABG, whereas 16 008 underwent PCI. Trainees performed 1968 (29.4%) CABG procedures and 8502 (53.1%) PCI procedures. The proportion of procedures performed by trainees declined over time for both CABG (30.2% in 2003 vs. 26.0% in 2010) and for PCI (58.1% in 2003 vs. 44.5% in 2010). In the unadjusted Cox analysis, consultant operator grade was associated with an increased 5-year mortality after both CABG [HR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.07-1.47)] and PCI procedures [HR: 1.34 (95% CI: 1.22-1.47)] compared with a trainee operator. However, following multiple adjustment, consultant grade was no longer associated with mortality after either procedure [CABG: HR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.87-1.20), PCI: HR: 1.08 (95% CI: 0.98-1.20)]. There was no observed detrimental effect on patient outcomes arising from procedures undertaken by trainees working in a structured training environment compared with consultants.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23677845/"}

One-thousand eight-hundred and ninety-seven non-AMI patients and 1,401 patients with AMI consecutively admitted to 1 of 16 coronary care units participating in The Danish Verapamil Infarction Study were included. During follow-up, 630 deaths occurred among the non-AMI patients and 415 of these could be classified as cardiac deaths. Multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors containing independent prognostic information about mortality for non-AMI patients: age, previous AMI, sex, and diabetes. In patients with AMI the risk factors were: age, previous AMI, clinical heart failure, diabetes, and angina pectoris. By including the diagnosis at discharge for non-AMI patients in the Cox analysis, the prognostic significance was compared to the variables from the medical history. Only the diagnoses bronchopneumonia, musculoskeletal disorders and observatio sine indicatione therapiae added independent prognostic information. We conclude that non-AMI patients are at high risk for mortal events in the long term. High-risk patients can be identified from their medical history, whereas the diagnosis at discharge only adds limited prognostic information.

Large studies of Caucasians associate T allele carriage with lower platelet reactivity. To evaluate whether the GNB3 genotype would predispose to bleeding in patients treated with a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. GNB3 genotype distribution was determined in DNA samples from patients in the orbofiban in patients with unstable coronary syndromes-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (OPUS-TIMI) 16 genetic sub-study. Impact of genotype on the bleeding endpoint and the composite primary endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI), re-hospitalization for ischemia and urgent revascularization was estimated in the treatment and placebo arm. Out of 887 patients, 45.1% carried the GNB3 CC genotype, 44.5% CT and 10.4% TT. Interaction between T allele carriership and treatment for bleeding was significant (P = 0.008). This reflects the fact that GNB3 non-T carriers treated with orbofiban had no bleeding effect compared with placebo (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.55-1.55) whereas T carriers did (RR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.58-4.35, P < 0.001).

The RR for cardiac death was 3.1 (CI, 2.4 to 3.7). Mediastinal radiation of 30 Gy or less (n = 385 patients) did not increase risk; above 30 Gy (n = 1830), RR was 3.5 (CI, 2.7 to 4.3). Blocking to limit cardiac exposure reduced the RR for other cardiac diseases from 5.3 (CI, 3.1 to 7.5) to 1.4 (CI, 0.6 to 2.9), but not acute myocardial infarction (RR, 3.7 vs 3.4). The RRs increased with duration after treatment (trend in acute myocardial infarction, P = .02; in other cardiac diseases, P = .004). The RR for acute myocardial infarction was highest after irradiation before 20 years of age and decreased with increasing age at treatment (P < .0001 for trend).

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury, and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on (a) varied clinical presentations; (b) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; (c) the roles of the emergency department, emergency medical system, and the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL); and (4) regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI-capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely manner, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room.

The symptomatology of coronary events may differ and coronary care data show a higher incidence of sudden death in diabetic patients who have a myocardial infarction than in their non-diabetic counterparts. Insulin may play a role in the myocardial adjustment to an ischemic insult by enhancing glucose intake and suppressing lipolysis and ketogenesis. Carbohydrate intolerance in dogs, rhesus monkeys and humans appears associated with similar histologic and compositional changes in the myocardium. Abnormalities in diastolic ventricular function not attributable to large- or small-vessel coronary disease have been found in the diabetic subjects of each species. Studies in humans who have diabetes have assessed single pressure-volume relationships and more exacting measures of ventricular compliance are needed. Abnormalities of myocardial function in patients with diabetes have been found using echo and radionuclide techniques.

Valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, left ventricular failure and/or cor pulmonale were observed in 16 (22%) patients.

Valvular heart disease in five patients was significantly associated with LA (P = 0.05). Cor pulmonale due to chronic pulmonary embolism was present in two patients with LA. Myocardial infarctions in five patients occurred late in the course of disease but in relatively young patients (mean 43 years). Fatal myocardial infarction in the absence of atherosclerosis in two LA-positive patients supports a pathogenetic role for LA in these cases. In conclusion, of the various cardiac complications in SLE, valvular heart disease and cor pulmonale appear to be connected with the antiphospholipid syndrome.

{"id": "3850765", "title": "Prostaglandins and heart disease.", "text": "The role of prostaglandins (PGs) in cardiac pathophysiology has been reviewed with special emphasis on clinically applied aspects. Several PGs are synthesized and released by the heart and coronary vessels. Their synthesis is altered by various factors such as physical manipulation of tissue, pharmacological treatments and pathological conditions such as myocardial over-reactivity and ischemia. The involvement of PGs in cardiac dysfunction remains controversial, although it has been proposed that various PGs such as PGI2 or PGB2 may play a role in disaggregating platelets, inhibiting thrombus progression and coronary vasodilatation. The balance between thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a proaggregatory agent released from platelets and PGI2 may have a role in the genesis and management of angina and myocardial infarction. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in these conditions remains controversial; their possible beneficial effects are believed to be due to inhibition of TXA2 synthesis whereas their failure to be effective may be a consequence of concomitant inhibition of PGI2 production. Modulation of endogenous PG synthesis and administration of exogenous PGs or their analogues appear to be two therapeutic approaches in the management of certain cardiac diseases. Accordingly, there is a great need for synthesizing stable and potent PG analogues as well as specific inhibitors of PG synthesis in addition to studying their pharmacology and therapeutics.

We aimed to assess the incremental value of preoperative cardiac troponin (cTn) concentration in the prediction of PMI. Among prospectively recruited patients at high cardiovascular risk (age ≥65 years or ≥45 years with preexisting cardiovascular disease), PMI was defined as an absolute increase in high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) concentration of ≥14 ng/L (the 99th percentile) above the preoperative concentration. Perioperative myocardial infarction/injury was centrally adjudicated by two independent cardiologists using serial measurements of hs-cTnT. Using logistic regression, three models were derived: Model 1 including patient- and procedure-related information, Model 2 adding routinely available laboratory values, and Model 3 further adding preoperative hs-cTnT concentration. Models were also compared vs. preoperative hs-cTnT alone. The findings were validated in two independent cohorts. Among 6944 patients, PMI occurred in 1058 patients (15.2%). The predictive accuracy as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.74] for Model 1, 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.77) for Model 2, 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.80) for Model 3, and 0.74 for hs-cTnT alone.

Also reviewed is the success of recent trials of a telecardiology service in the north west of England. Thanks to developments in technology and ever decreasing costs, telecardiology has the potential to save time, money and lives. Telecardiology, it would seem, is set to revolutionize cardiac care in the community, making savings and bridging the gap between primary and secondary care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20959351/"}

Yet, many patients with STEMI can seldom avail timely and evidence based reperfusion treatments. This gap in care is a result of financial barriers, limited healthcare infrastructure, poor knowledge and accessibility of acute medical services for a majority of the population. Addressing some of these issues, STEMI India, a not-for-profit organization, Cardiological Society of India (CSI) and Association Physicians of India (API) have developed a protocol of \"systems of care\" for efficient management of STEMI, with integrated networks of facilities. Leveraging newly-developed ambulance and emergency medical services, incorporating recent state insurance schemes for vulnerable populations to broaden access, and combining innovative, \"state-of-the-art\" information technology platforms with existing hospital infrastructure, are the crucial aspects of this system. A pilot program was successfully employed in the state of Tamilnadu. The purpose of this article is to describe the framework and methods associated with this programme with an aim to improve delivery of reperfusion therapy for STEMI in India. This programme can serve as model STEMI systems of care for other low-and-middle income countries.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26432748/"}

{"id": "8181869", "title": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure: new strategies justified by recent clinical trials.", "text": "New information suggests that heart failure treatment strategies should change. Indeed, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors now should be considered first-line therapy in some instances. It is important, therefore, to review results of recently completed mortality end-point trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. In the Treatment Trial of Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), addition of enalapril to baseline therapy significantly improved prognosis in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. These results extend the findings of the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), and indicate that ACE inhibition is beneficial to patients with all grades of overt congestive heart failure. In the Prevention Trial of SOLVD, and the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study (SAVE), therapy with enalapril or captopril improved prognosis among patients with, generally, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. In particular, the risk of development of overt heart failure was reduced. Importantly, a marked anti-ischaemic effect of ACE inhibition was identified in both the SOLVD and SAVE trials. Clinical data amassed in nearly 9000 patients identify a substantial role for ACE inhibition in patients with all grades of symptomatic heart failure as well as in those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (such as often follows a myocardial infarction). Data support early intervention with ACE inhibitor therapy alone in asymptomatic cardiac failure and triple combination therapy (ACE inhibitor, diuretic, digoxin) in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8181869/"}

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of post myocardial infarction mechanical, inflammatory, and embolic complications. While 30-day mortality rate after AMI has decreased in the past two decades, it remains significantly elevated at 7.8%, owing to a wide variety of subacute complications evolving over weeks. Mechanical complications such as ventricular free wall rupture, ventricular septal rupture, mitral valve regurgitation, and formation of left ventricular aneurysms carry significant morbidity. Additional complications include ischemic stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and cardiac dysrhythmias. This review provides several guiding principles for management of these complications. Understanding these complications and an approach to the management of various complications is essential to optimizing patient care. Mechanical, inflammatory, and embolic complications of AMI can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these conditions while evaluating for other diseases. In addition to understanding the natural progression of disease and performing a focused physical examination, an electrocardiogram and bedside echocardiogram provide quick, noninvasive determinations of the underlying pathophysiology.

There is a relationship between LVT formation and 1-year major adverse cardio-cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients with ant-AMI treated by PPCI. Our study population included 1488 consecutive patients with ant-AMI. The primary endpoint was the incidence of MACCE within 1 year after AMI. The secondary endpoint was the thrombosis disappearance. A total of 106 (7.1%) patients were diagnosed with LVT and 1382 (92.9%) patients without LVT. Patients with LVT had a higher incidence of MACCE than in patients without LVT (21.7%vs10.3%; P < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed LVT was associated with an increase in MACCE risk (odds ratio [OR] = 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.37-4.21]; P < 0.001).

LV thrombi were detected in 26 patients in group A (27%) and in 71 in group B (57%; p <0.005). Embolism occurred in 12 patients (5.4%; 1 in group A [1%] vs 11% in group B [9%], p < 0.04). At multivariate analysis, thrombus morphologic changes were the most powerful predictor of embolism (p <0.001), followed by protruding shape (p <0.01) and mobility (p <0.02). In patients untreated with thrombolysis, a higher occurrence of thrombus morphologic changes (48% vs 8%, p <0.002) and protruding shape (69% vs 31%, p <0.002) were observed, whereas thrombus mobility was similar in the 2 groups (18% vs 8%, p = NS). Thrombus resolution occurred more frequently in thrombolysed patients (85% vs 56%, p <0.002). Thus, after anterior AMI, changes in LV thrombus anatomy frequently occur and appear the most powerful predictor of embolization. A minor prevalence of thrombus, a more favorable thrombus anatomy, and a higher resolution rate may contribute to reduce embolic risk after thrombolysis.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10073854/"}

However, inappropriate shocks may occur if tachycardias are misdiagnosed. Inappropriate shocks are harmful and impair patient quality of life. The risk of inappropriate therapy increases with lower detection rates programmed in the ICD. Single-chamber detection poses greater risks for misdiagnosis when compared with dual-chamber devices that have the benefit of additional atrial information. However, using a dual-chamber device merely for the sake of detection is generally not accepted, since the risks associated with the second electrode may outweigh the benefits of detection. Therefore, BIOTRONIK developed a ventricular lead called the Linox(SMART) S DX, which allows for the detection of atrial signals from two electrodes positioned at the atrial part of the ventricular electrode. This device contains two ring electrodes; one that contacts the atrial wall at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and one positioned at the free floating part of the electrode in the atrium. The excellent signal quality can only be achieved by a special filter setting in the ICD (Lumax 540 and 740 VR-T DX, BIOTRONIK). Here, the ease of implantation of the system will be demonstrated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22395536/"}

This research focuses on a 3D convolutional representation to characterize cardiac kinematic patterns during the cardiac cycle, which may be associated with pathologies. The kinematic maps are obtained from the apparent velocity maps computed from a dense optical flow strategy. Then, a 3D convolutional scheme learns to differentiate pathologies from kinematic maps. The proposed strategy was validated with respect to the capability to discriminate among myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal right ventricle, and normal cardiac sequences. The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 78.00% and a F1 score of 75.55%. Likewise, the approach achieved 92.31% accuracy for binary classification between pathologies and control cases. The proposed method can support the identification of kinematically abnormal patterns associated with a pathological condition.

The recommendations on DAT pay special attention to the timing of the therapy and to the choice of its drugs. The updated data on the treatment of patients with STEMI accurately determine the time to percutaneous coronary interventions, approaches to revascularization; the updates touch upon fibrinolytic therapy and new approaches to lipid-lowering therapy too. Recommendations for the management of patients with peripheral artery atherosclerosis propose for the first time a section devoted to the choice of antiplatelet therapy (an antiaggregant and/or an anticoagulant) depending on the clinical situation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411754/"}

This prospective study involved 10 cardiologists in Cameroon. Enrolment started on 1 June 2006 and ended on 30 June 2007. Consecutive patients were included if they were >18 years and AF was documented on an ECG during the index office visit. In this survey, 172 patients were enrolled (75 males and 97 females; mean age 65.8 +/- 13 years). The prevalence of paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF was 22.7, 21.5, and 55.8%, respectively. Underlying cardiac disorders, present in 156/172 patients (90.7%), included hypertensive heart disease (47.7%), valvular heart disease (25.6%), dilated cardiomyopathy (15.7%), and coronary artery disease (6%). A rate-control strategy was chosen in 83.7% of patients (144 of 172) and drugs most commonly used were digoxin and amiodarone. The mean CHADS(2) score was 1.9 +/- 1.1 and 158 of 172 patients (91.9%) had a CHADS(2) score > or =1. Among patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC), only 34.2% (54 of 158) actually received it. During a follow-up of 318 +/- 124 days, 26 of 88 patients died (29.5%), essentially from a cardiovascular cause (15 of 26). Ten patients (16.1%) had a non-lethal embolic stroke and 23 (26.1%) had symptoms of severe congestive heart failure. Clinical presentation of AF in Cameroon is much more severe than in developed countries. A rate-control strategy is predominant in Cameroon and OAC is prescribed in only 34.2% of eligible patients, despite a high CHADS(2) score at inclusion. Death and stroke rate at 1 year are very high in Cameroon possibly because of a lower use of OAC, and a higher prevalence of rheumatic mitral disease and of more severe co-morbidities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179174/"}

A myriad of cell types have been tested experimentally, each of them being usually credited by its advocates of a high \"regeneration\" potential. This has led to a flurry of clinical trials entailing the use of skeletal myoblasts or bone marrow-derived cells either unfractionated or enriched in progenitor subpopulations. As often in medicine, the hype generated by the early uncontrolled and small-sized studies has been dampened by the marginally successful outcomes of the subsequent, more rigorously conducted randomized trials. Although they may have failed to achieve their primary end points, these trials have been positive in the sense that they have allowed to identify some key issues and it is reasonable to speculate that if these issues can now be addressed by appropriately focused benchwork, the outcomes of the second generation of cell-transplantation studies would likely be upgraded. It, thus, appears that not \"one cell fits all\" but that the selection of the cell type should be tailored to the primary clinical indication. On the one hand, it does not make sense to develop an \"ideal\" cell in a culture dish, if we remain unable to deliver it appropriately and to keep it alive, at least for a while, which requires to improve on the delivery techniques and to provide cells along with the vascular and extracellular matrix type of support necessary for their survival and patterning. On the other hand, the persisting mechanistic uncertainties about cell therapy should not preclude continuing clinical trials, which often provide the unique opportunity of identifying issues missed by our suboptimal preclinical models. Finally, regardless of whether cells are expected to act paracrinally or by physically replacing lost cardiomyocytes and, thus, effecting a true myocardial regeneration, safety remains a primary concern. It is, thus, important that clinical development programs be shaped in a way that allows the final cell-therapy product to be manufactured from fully traceable materials, phenotypically well characterized, consistent, scalable, sterile, and genetically stable as these characteristics are those that will be required by the ultimate gatekeeper, i.e., the regulator, and are thus unbypassable prerequisites for an effective and streamlined leap from bench to bedside.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19277020/"}

In actual heart diseases, in contrast, there is very little direct morphological evidence of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes occurring at any stage of myocardial infarction and heart failure, despite the availability of much indirect evidence that includes detection of DNA fragmentation and apoptosis-related factors. For that reason, the potential efficacy of therapeutic intervention to prevent apoptosis remains controversial. This review will survey available data from both animals and humans to critically assess the role of cardiomyocyte apoptosis during myocardial infarction and its relevance to myocardial remodeling and during progression to heart failure. Also considered will be nonmyocyte interstitial cells, which have received less attention than myocytes despite definitive evidence of their apoptosis in the infarcted heart and recent studies suggesting that blockade of apoptosis among these cells mitigates postinfarction cardiac remodeling and heart failure.

This population-based cohort study included residents in Ontario between 2002 and 2012 who were ≥66 years of age without known cardiovascular disease. We compared the incident risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, coronary artery revascularization, or cardiovascular death, at 1 year in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke vs propensity-matched individuals without stroke (4:1 matching using 31 variables). To estimate cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs), we used Cox regression models adjusted for variables with weighted standardized differences >0.10 or known to influence the risk of MACE. We included 21,931 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke and 71,696 propensity-matched individuals, well balanced on all variables used for propensity matching. First-ever ischemic stroke was associated with increased unadjusted incident MACE risk (HR 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3-4.8).

The objective of this study was to examine the degree to which somatic symptom items influence BDI scores among hospitalized post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to psychiatry outpatients with MDD matched on cognitive/affective scores, sex, and age. Somatic scores of post-MI patients with MDD and matched psychiatry outpatients with MDD were compared using independent samples t-tests. A total of 579 post-MI patients with MDD (mean age=54.4 years, SD=9.9) and 579 psychiatry outpatients with MDD (mean age=51.2 years, SD=9.7) were matched on cognitive/affective scores, sex, and age.

Notably, however, morphological evidence definitively demonstrating cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been very rare in actual heart diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. By contrast, within the postinfarction heart, interstitial noncardiomyocytes such as granulation tissue cells do die via apoptosis to form scar tissue. Blockade of this apoptosis improves survival and mitigates ventricular remodeling and dysfunction during the chronic stage. Possible mechanisms to explain this benefit might be preservation of infarcted wall thickness and preservation of myofibroblasts, which could promote infarct shrinkage; both would reduce wall stress through Laplace's law. On the other hand, autophagy is an intracellular degradation mechanism that compensates for energy insufficiency by digesting and recycling intracellular components, and is often observed in cardiomyocytes within failing hearts with various origins including postinfarction. Starvation strongly induces and activates autophagic degeneration within cardiomyocytes. When that activation is inhibited, the starved animals suffer from heart failure. Promoting autophagy through caloric restriction or several reagents not only reduces the acute infarct size but also mitigates postinfarction cardiac remodeling and dysfunction during chronic stages. Moreover, augmenting autophagy by the treatment with resveratrol or exercise can bring about reverse remodeling in failing hearts with a large old myocardial infarction. In conclusion, we propose two strategies for managing postinfarction heart failure through control of cell death/degeneration: (1) anti-apoptosis in granulation tissue noncardiomyocytes; and (2) pro-autophagy in salvaged cardiomyocytes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29737434/"}

In-hospital mortality was similar in both HbA(1c) groups (3.37% vs 2.88%, P = 0.803). Six-month MACE was also similar (26.40% vs 26.47%, P = 0.919). All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, symptom-driven revascularization, rehospitalization for angina, and hospitalization for heart failure were also similar in both groups. The hazard ratios for 6-month MACE and individual endpoints were also similar in both groups. This study suggests that HbA(1c) levels before admission are not associated with short-term cardiovascular outcome in diabetic patients subsequently admitted with ACS.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21717470/"}

The main therapeutic strategy to treat ischemic heart disease is reperfusion that could either be medical or surgical. However, reperfusion following ischemia is known to increase the infarct size further. Newer strategies such as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), ischemic postconditioning, and remote IPC have been shown to condition the myocardium to ischemia-reperfusion injury and thus reduce the final infarct size. Research over the past 3 decades has deepened our understanding of cellular and subcellular pathways that mediate ischemia-reperfusion injury. This in turn has resulted in the development of several pharmacological agents that act as conditioning agents, which reduce the final myocardial infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion. This review discusses many of these agents, their mechanisms of action, and the animal and clinical evidence behind them.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24038018/"}

Frequently, management guidelines are derived from published research data and disseminated among practitioners to help optimize patient care. The ultimate clinical impact of these guidelines in the \"real world,\" however, is often clouded by an incomplete assessment of patient outcomes throughout the continuum of health-care delivery models. In order to address this gap in clinical outcome assessment, we propose to establish the Connecticut Cardiovascular Consortium. The Consortium will consist of a collaborative partnership among all 31 Connecticut hospitals working in concert with Connecticut Office of Health Care Access (OHCA). The primary objective of the Consortium will be to assess, compare, and optimize clinical outcomes among Connecticut residents with cardiovascular disease. As an initial goal for the Consortium, we further propose to undertake a prospective, observational study of Connecticut residents who present with ST Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Recent advances in pharmacologic and mechanical reperfusion for STEMI have resulted in a need to define the optimal use of these therapies in the community at large. The primary purpose of this study will be to determine the relative merits of different treatment patterns for STEMI with regard to the use of fibrinolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the relative benefits of urgent mechanical revascularization performed at the state's seven tertiary facilities with PCI capability compared to all other treatment modalities. Successful completion of this unique collaborative endeavor is expected to have significant impact on improved patient care and on current health-care policy for medical resource allocation. Moreover, continued collaboration of health-care providers within the Connecticut Cardiovascular Consortium infrastructure should serve as a useful mechanism for ongoing improvements in evidence-based cardiovascular medicine and clinical research in the state of Connecticut.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11702518/"}

We recommend a new anticoagulation strategy using enoxaparin in combination with UFH. Enoxaparin has a more predictable anticoagulant response with no need of repeatedly monitoring anticoagulation during PCI. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using enoxaparin in combination with UFH in PCI patients with complex coronary artery disease. Between January 2015 and April 2017, 600 PCI patients who received intravenous UFH at an initial dose of 3000 U plus intravenous enoxaparin at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg (observation group) and 600 PCI patients who received UFH at a dose of 100 U/kg (control group) were consecutively included in this retrospective study. The endpoints were postoperative 48-h thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) bleeding and transfusion and 30-day and 1-year major adverse cardio-cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Baseline clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics were similar between groups, except there was less stent implantation per patient in the observation group (2.13 vs. 2.25 in the control group, P = 0.002).

The persistence of no-reflow was likely due to the fact that the myocardial territory supplied by the infarct-related artery was completely necrosed resulting in persistent flow impairment through the vessel.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29246934/"}

{"id": "33045975", "title": "Nuclear Imaging of Post-infarction Inflammation in Ischemic Cardiac Diseases - New Radiotracers for Potential Clinical Applications.", "text": "Acute myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of death in the western world. Despite major improvements in myocardial reperfusion with sophisticated percutaneous coronary intervention technologies and new antithrombotic agents, there is still no effective therapy for preventing post- infarction myocardial injury and remodeling. Death of cardiomyocytes following ischemia results in \"danger signals\" that elicit an inflammatory reaction to remove cell debris and form scar tissue. Optimal healing of the damaged myocardial tissue requires a coordinated cellular response for sufficient wound healing and scar formation. However, if this inflammatory reaction is overactive or incompletely resolved, adverse left ventricular remodeling and heart failure may occur. Treatment aimed at the modulation of the post-MI inflammatory response has been widely pursued and investigated. Although improved infarct healing was shown in many experimental preclinical studies, to date, clinical trials using anti-inflammatory treatment strategies have been far less successful. Clearly, a need exists for predicting and selecting patients at risk and selecting the most appropriate therapy for individual patients. To this end, imaging of the post-MI response has been a topic of significant interest. In this review, we first discuss the clinical complications resulting from myocardial inflammation following AMI and the need for non-invasive imaging techniques using radiolabeled tracers. We then discuss the inflammatory reaction cascade following acute myocardial infarction, the inflammatory reaction cascade following acute myocardial infarction focusing on inflammatory cell types involved herein, and potential imaging targets for identifying these cells during the inflammatory process. In addition, we discuss specific characteristics and limitations of various preclinical animal models for ischemic heart disease since they are crucial in the development and evaluation of the imaging techniques. Finally, we discuss the need for non-invasive imaging approaches using radiolabeled tracers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33045975/"}

{"id": "17405561", "title": "[The best of valvular heart disease in 2006].", "text": "In the field of valvular diseases, the year 2006 has been above all marked by the publication of new joint AHA/ACC guidelines. Besides, other publications included severe aortic stenosis, drug therapy in chronic aortic regurgitation, the indications for surgery in asymptomatic mitral regurgitation, as well as valve surgery in the elderly and mismatch severity after aortic valve replacement. In a series of 66 cases of aortic stenosis with poor LV function undergoing stress echocardiography, it has been shown that whether the absence of contractile reserve identifies a high-risk subgroup for aortic valve replacement (33% vs. 6%), this exam does not predict the functional prognosis and the post-operative LV function improvement. Hence, the absence of contractile reserve should not contra-indicate aortic valve replacement surgery, even though the prognosis is severe, since the natural prognosis is extremely severe. The question of aortic valve replacement in case of mild stenosis with the indication of CABG remains difficult. Taking into account the important mortality of redo surgery, a study was in favor of a systematic aortic valve replacement associated to CABG in patients <75 years who had a mean aortic gradient > 30 mmHg, a LVH and aortic valve calcifications. Old patients (>80 years) with severe aortic stenosis have a very severe natural prognosis, authorizing wide indications for aortic valve replacement, in the absence of important comorbidities. The use of vasodilators in severe chronic aortic regurgitation remains debated. In a randomized study comparing Nifedipine 40 mg vs. Enalapril 20 mm vs. placebo, it has been shown that the use of a vasodilator does not modify the time of valvular surgery at all. After a mean follow-up of 7 years, the rates of aortic valve replacement were identical in the 3 groups, and there wa no difference regarding the preoperative regurgitation volume, LV dimensions and mass, and LVEF. The timing for huge chronic and asymptomatic mitral regurgitation remains debated, even though the present trend is to prefer early surgery, due to the risk of sudden death. A new study evidenced the interest of clinical and echocardiographic surveillance on a prospective series of 129 consecutive asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. The surgical indication was only based on the occurrence of symptoms, an echographic LV diameters increase, a LV dysfunction, the presence of pulmonary hypertension or atrial fibrillation. At 8 years, the overall mortality was at 91 + 3%, with a survival rate not statistically different from the expected rates; 35 patients have been operated. The 6-years and 8-years surgical indication-free survival were respectively at 65 +/- 5% and 55 +/- 6%, with a null operative mortality, and favorable data regarding post-operative survival, symptoms and LV function. The indication for surgical correction of mitral regurgitation in the elderly remains a difficult problem, due to the surgical risk. The Mayo Clinic team analyzed the evolution of 284 patients > 75 years operated for mitral regurgitation between 1980 and 1995, compared to younger subjects (65 - 74 years old, n=504, and <65 years, n=556). The age-adjusted 5-years survival was lower in the older patients, but the age-adjusted observed/estimated survival ratios were similar in the different age groups. The perioperative risk, significantly higher in the older patients (p<0.001) decreased systematically for all age ranges in the most recent periods (the 1980-83 period vs. 1992-95), from 27% to 5%, 21% to 4%, and 7% to 2% respectively in patients > 75 years, 65-74 years and <65 years. An age >75 years was an independent predictive factor for the surgical mortality. These data show that, despite the surgical risk, the surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation should be extended to the oldest patients. One of the most surprising information provided in the ACC/AHA guidelines is the necessity of adding a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg of aspirin systematically to VKA in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or in those with a valvular bioprosthesis with one or several risk factors for thrombo-embolic events (AF, history of thromboembolic event, LV dysfunction, hypercoagulable state). This major recommendation (Class 1, level of evidence B) appears surprising, since it is not actually based on definite results issued from randomized studies using these doses of aspirin. According to these guidelines, this association not only reduces the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with valvular prosthesis, but also decreases the mortality related to other cardiovascular causes (especially coronary artery disease), with the cost of a minimal risk augmentation for hemorrhagic complications. The importance of pejorative prognosis of mismatch (defined as an inadequacy between the aortic orifice size and patient's body surface after aortic valve replacement) has been subject to several publications this year. The substantial increase of post-operative events and poor survival in patients with this mismatch imply adapted preventive strategies in terms of selection of diameters and type of aortic valvular prosthesis and associated aortic surgical techniques (such as annular enlargement or supra-annular position).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17405561/"}

Outcome has improved during the last decades due to secondary prevention and widespread coronary interventions, but recent studies still show sex differences and insufficient drug adherence. We aimed to determine differences in the treatment strategies and outcomes between women and men with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Germany. From the Federal Association of the Local Health Insurance Funds (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse), 175,187 patients were identified who were hospitalized due to STEMI in Germany between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017.

These changes have been the result of both scientific progress and improved standard of living in developed countries. The availability of penicillin to treat streptococcal pharyngitis and less crowded living conditions have now made rheumatic fever uncommon in these countries. However, other forms of valve impairment have appeared over the past several years. The etiology of some of these valvular diseases remains obscure (e. g. myxomatous mitral valve); others, such as the senile type of calcific aortic valve stenosis, seem to be the price to be paid for the extension of life expectancy. With regard to diagnosis, echocardiography has constituted a formidable tool for visualizing anatomic valve changes, interpreting complex hemodynamic derangements, and evaluating repercussion on the left ventricle. In addition, the iteration of this non-invasive examination has allowed a much better understanding of the natural history of non-severe valvular disease and therefore of the precise timing for surgical intervention, without awaiting, in most cases, the appearance of advanced symptomatology. This has also been possible because of the great advances in cardiac surgery which can be summarised as: a) the improvement in extracorporeal circulation and myocardial preservation techniques; b) the greatly improved biologic and mechanic valve substitutes; c) the introduction of imaginative mitral valve repair procedures, and d) the use of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography to assess the adequacy of valve repair. At the same time, percutaneous catheter balloon valvuloplasty has emerged as a valid alternative to mitral surgical commissurotomy for mitral stenosis.

Research has shown that this effect cannot be accounted for by increased genetic vulnerability alone. We tested the hypothesis that FH-MI is associated with psychological distress, which is known to increase CHD risk, and that this effect is sustained over years and mediated by personality traits and coping strategies. Levels of distress (i.e., exhaustion, depression, and anxiety) were compared between patients with versus without FH-MI and those with versus without own history of myocardial infarction (MI) from the large observational Diagnostic trial on Prevalence and Clinical Course of Diastolic Dysfunction and Heart Failure (DIAST-CHF) study of patients with cardiovascular risk factors or manifest heart disease (N = 1,470). FH-MI was associated with a range of personality traits and coping strategies and independently predicted psychological distress, whereas own MI did not. In mediation analysis, we found that sociotropy and avoidant coping serially mediated significant portions of the effect of FH-MI on distress. Proportions of explained variance ranged from R2 = .11 for depressive symptoms to R2 = .25 for anxiety. Effects remained stable at 1-year follow-up. Several alternative hypotheses were tested and found to be less well supported by the data. Participants with cardiovascular risk factors and FH-MI report increased distress, even years after the event, which might be one component leading to their increased CHD risk. They should be offered support for dealing with distress and life events recurring on sociotropy and avoidant coping as important diathesis factors.

The clinical diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease is often based largely on a history of typical chest or arm pain, and the major therapeutic endeavour in such patients is directed towards abolition or amelioration of angina. Indeed physicians have, at least up until recently, been confident in assuming that angina is a reliable marker of ongoing ischaemia and that success of medical or surgical treatment of coronary heart disease can be accurately gauged according to improvement or disappearance of anginal symptoms (Cohn & Braunwald, 1988). However, the results of a number of important clinical studies, reported over that last 10 to 15 years, appear to challenge these traditional medical assumptions. In many patients with coronary heart disease, acute episodes of myocardial ischaemia are frequently unaccompanied by angina, often referred to as \"silent myocardial ischaemia\" (Epstein et al., 1988; Fox, 1988; Cohn, 1985; Maseri, 1985). It has to be pointed out that not all painless ischaemic episodes are truly silent. Instead of experiencing pain during some episodes of acute myocardial ischaemia, patients may, on occasion, instead report symptoms such as dyspnoea or palpitations (these symptoms being known as \"anginal equivalents\") (Cohn & Braunwald, 1988). Nevertheless, the great majority of painless ischaemic episodes are, truly silent and not accompanied by \"anginal equivalents\", which has led to the trend in the recent literature to regard the terms \"silent\" and \"painless\" myocardial ischaemia as synonymous.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1957549/"}

Primed BM-MSCs through HGF-eMSCs exhibited improved vasculogenic potential and cell viability, which ultimately enhanced vascular regeneration and restored cardiac function to the MI hearts. Histological analyses further demonstrated that the primed BM-MSCs survived longer within a cardiac patch and conferred cardioprotection evidenced by substantially higher numbers of viable cardiomyocytes in the MI hearts.

This study aimed to determine and evaluate changes in AMI morbidity and mortality from IHD among the middle-aged urban Lithuanian population during 2000-2023. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The data source was the Kaunas ischemic heart disease registry for residents aged 25-64. The diagnosis of AMI was based on the proposed epidemiological criteria used in the WHO MONICA project protocol. Age-standardized morbidity and mortality rates were calculated per 100,000 population. The changes in morbidity and mortality rates were calculated using the Joinpoint regression analysis method, and changes presented as a percentage estimate per year. <i>Results</i>: During 2000-2023, it was observed that age-standardized AMI morbidity significantly changed in the 25-64-year-old male and female population (-1.3%/yr., <i>p</i> = 0.006 and -2.3%/yr., <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). In males aged 25-54, a significant decrease in AMI morbidity rates by an average of 2.2%/yr.

PPAC after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may prevent recurrent ischemic events but may increase the risk of bleeding. No consensus has been reached on PPAC use. Using data from the Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China-Acute Coronary Syndrome registry, conducted between 2014 and 2019, we stratified all STEMI patients who underwent pPCI according to the use of PPAC or not. Inverse probability of treatment weighting and a Cox proportional hazards model with hospital as random effect were used to analyze differences in in-hospital clinical outcomes: the primary efficacy endpoint was mortality and the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Of 34,826 evaluable patients, 26,272 (75.4%) were treated with PPAC and were on average younger, more stable at admission with lower bleeding risk score, more likely to have comorbidities and multivessel disease, and more often treated within 12 hours of symptom onset than those without PPAC. After inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment for baseline differences, PPAC was associated with significantly reduced risk of in-hospital mortality (0.9% vs 1.8%; HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.43-0.89; P < 0.001) and a nonsignificant difference in risk of in-hospital major bleeding (2.5% vs 2.2%; HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.83-1.32; P = 0.14).

It has been shown that these changes can be reduced by early myocardial reperfusion and by administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These findings were established first in animals, then in man. Administering ACE inhibitors to patients with symptomatic heart failure consecutive to advanced ischaemic cardiopathy prolongs the patients' survival. When ACE inhibitors are given to patients with severe asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction which started soon or long after a myocardial infarction, they reduce the frequency of ischaemic events, passage to symptomatic heart failure and, at least in one study, mortality. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce the size of myocardial necrosis when administered in the acute phase of experimental myocardial infarction. Preliminary data have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction reduce the left ventricular dilatation which follows infarction. However, a study of ACE inhibitors administered to a large number of patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction had to be interrupted because of the over-mortality in the treated group. These facts are reviewed in this article, and attempts have been made at deducing from them the current indications of ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary heart disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1299942/"}

This gap has been particularly apparent in the area of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In this article, three areas are discussed in which new scientific advances have not been adequately translated to clinical practice. These include: 1) the most appropriate measures to define the risks associated with obesity; 2) the under-diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and its relation to cardiovascular risk; and 3) the use and misuse of the exercise test and other functional status tools to predict health outcomes. Each is discussed in terms of how they should be quantified, their contribution to the estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, their response to interventions, and implications for cardiac rehabilitation. Clinical cardiac rehabilitation programs can benefit from routinely including these measures, both for their value in stratifying risk and for their importance in quantifying program efficacy. Physicians and allied health professionals should expand their routine medical evaluations and coronary risk factor profiling to include these measures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19032912/"}

However, prior to the thrombus aspiration during ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia (TASTE) trial, it remained unclear whether routine thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment of STEMI would result in patients overall survival benefit. The TASTE trial was a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial. In order to randomize patients to treatment and collect data, the infrastructure of a clinical population-based registry was used. Online data collection used the national comprehensive Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry, a part of the SWEDEHEART registry. Monitoring and adjudication was done as part of the regular registry validation. There was no separate, dedicated monitoring or adjudication of endpoints. Included were 7244 patients with STEMI with chest pain and time of symptoms to hospital admission <24 h, in addition to new electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block. Exclusion criteria were the need for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. All-cause mortality at 30 days occurred in 2.8 % of the patients in the thrombus-aspiration group, as compared with 3.0 % in the PCI-only group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.22; p = 0.63). All-cause mortality at 1 year occurred in 5.3 % of the patients in the thrombus-aspiration group, as compared with 5.6 % in the PCI-only group (HR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.78-1.15; p = 0.57). No patients were lost to follow-up at 1 year. The incremental cost for trial execution was approximately US$ 300,000 or $50 per patient. Routine thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with STEMI did not reduce the rate of all-cause mortality at 1 year.

MRI made it possible to obtain multiplanar anatomical images of the cardio-vascular system without X-rays and conventional contrast medium. MRI supplied with indirect flow evaluation, too. MRI was particularly useful in the assessment of congenital heart diseases, since it shows the heart chambers and the great vessels at the same time and in the different phases of cardiac revolution. MRI was also useful in the evaluation of many acquired heart diseases, such as myocardium diseases, valve diseases, myocardial ischemias, pericardium diseases. Moreover, MRI correctly showed aortic aneurysms. In all the 55 patients examined, it was possible to obtain a good definition of the cardiac structures, especially when \"cardiac gating\" was employed. In the 3 ventricular and in the 5 atrial defects, the dimensions of the defect and the dilatation of the involved cardiac chambers were precisely assessed. In the 6 aortic coarctations, MRI evaluated the level and the grade of the stenosis, with consequent definition of the anatomic type. Moreover, collateral circulation and dilatation before and/or after the stenosis were evident. In all the 7 complex cardiopathies examined (3 Fallot tetralogies, 1 Fallot pentalogy, 1 aortic cervical arch, and 2 Ebstein diseases) MRI demonstrated each single anomaly of the malformations, at both cardiac and vascular levels. In 2 patients with atrial fibrillation, MRI visualized endoatrial thrombi. In the 7 patients with previous myocardial infarction, the site of ischemia was depicted as a thinning of the wall, while the remaining myocardium appeared hypertrophic. MRI correctly demonstrated all thoracic aorta aneurysms, even in a case where both CT and angiography were negative, due to the aneurysm being thrombosed. Mural thrombi were evident with both MRI and CT, but not always visible with angiography. In the 5 dissected aneurysms, MRI--like CT--assessed the origin of the dissection, and the dimensions of the true and false lumen; moreover, it indirectly evaluated the slow and turbulent blood flow within the true lumen, and the presence of thrombi in the false lumen.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3375487/"}

Final diagnoses were adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists 2 times using all available clinical information: first using standard cardiac troponin levels and second using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels for adjudication. Patients were followed up for a mean of 19±9 months. The use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T instead of standard cardiac troponin resulted in an increase in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction from 18% to 22% (242 vs 198 patients), a relative increase of 22%. Of the 44 additional acute myocardial infarctions, 35 were type 1 acute myocardial infarctions and 9 were type 2 acute myocardial infarctions. This was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in the incidence of unstable angina (unstable angina, 11% vs 13%). The most pronounced increase was observed in patients adjudicated with cardiac symptoms of origin other than coronary artery disease with cardiomyocyte damage (83 vs 31 patients, relative increase of 268%). Cumulative 30-month mortality rates were 4.8% in patients without acute myocardial infarction, 16.4% in patients with a small acute myocardial infarction detected only by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T but not standard cardiac troponin, and 23.9% in patients with a moderate/large acute myocardial infarction according to standard cardiac troponin assays and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (P<.001).

{"id": "12698252", "title": "New directions in strategies using cell therapy for heart disease.", "text": "Congestive heart failure remains a major public health problem and is frequently the end result of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrous replacement after myocardial infarction, a process referred to as left ventricular remodeling. Cardiomyocytes undergo terminal differentiation soon after birth and are generally considered to irreversibly withdraw from the cell cycle. In response to ischemic insult adult cardiomyocytes undergo cellular hypertrophy, nuclear ploidy, and a high degree of apoptosis. A small number of human cardiomyocytes retain the capacity to proliferate and regenerate in response to ischemic injury. However, whether these cells are derived from a resident pool of cardiomyocyte stem cells or from a renewable source of circulating bone marrow-derived stem cells that home to the damaged myocardium is at present not known. Replacement and regeneration of functional cardiac muscle after an ischemic insult to the heart could be achieved by either stimulating proliferation of endogenous mature cardiomyocytes or resident cardiac stem cells or by implanting exogenous donor-derived or allogeneic cells such as fetal or embryonic cardiomyocyte precursors, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, or skeletal myoblasts. The newly formed cardiomyocytes must integrate precisely into the existing myocardial wall in order to augment synchronized contractility and avoid potentially life-threatening alterations in the electrical conduction of the heart. A major impediment to survival of the implanted cells is altered immunogenicity by prolonged ex vivo culture conditions. In addition, concurrent myocardial revascularization is required to ensure viability of the repaired region and prevent further scar tissue formation. Human adult bone marrow contains endothelial precursors which resemble embryonic angioblasts and can be used to induce infarct bed neovascularization after experimental myocardial infarction. This results in protection of cardiomyocytes against apoptosis, induction of cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration, long-term salvage and survival of viable myocardium, prevention of left ventricular remodeling, and sustained improvement in cardiac function. It is reasonable to anticipate that cell therapy strategies for ischemic heart disease will need to incorporate (a) a renewable source of proliferating, functional cardiomyocytes, and (b) angioblasts to generate a network of capillaries and larger size blood vessels for supply of oxygen and nutrients to both the chronically ischemic endogenous myocardium and to the newly implanted cardiomyocytes", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12698252/"}

{"id": "15356432", "title": "Prevention of ventricular fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction (myocardial necrosis), heart failure, and mortality by bretylium: is ischemic heart disease primarily adrenergic cardiovascular disease?", "text": "It is widely, but mistakenly, believed that ischemic heart disease (IsHD) and its complications are the sole and direct result of reduced coronary blood flow by obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). However, cardiac angina, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and sudden cardiac death (SCD) occur in 15%-20% of patients with anatomically unobstructed and grossly normal coronaries. Moreover, severe obstructive coronary disease often occurs without associated pathologic myocardiopathy or prior symptoms, ie, unexpected sudden death, silent myocardial infarction, or the insidious appearance of congestive heart failure (CHF). The fact that catecholamines explosively augment oxidative metabolism much more than cardiac work is generally underappreciated. Thus, adrenergic actions alone are likely to be more prone to cause cardiac ischemia than reduced coronary blood flow per se. The autonomic etiology of IsHD raises contradictions to the traditional concept of anatomically obstructive CAD as the lone cause of cardiac ischemia and AMI. Actually, all the signs and symptoms of IsHD reflect autonomic nervous system imbalance, particularly adrenergic hyperactivity, which may by itself cause ischemia as in rest angina. Adrenergic activity causing ischemia signals cardiac pain to pain centers via sympathetic efferent pathways and tend to induce arrhythmogenic and necrotizing ischemic actions on the cardiovascular system. This may result in ischemia induced metabolic myocardiopathy not unlike that caused by anatomic or spasmogenic coronary obstruction. The clinical study and review presented herein suggest that adrenergic hyperactivity alone without CAD can be a primary cause of IsHD. Thus, adrenergic heart disease (AdHD), or actually adrenergic cardiovascular heart disease (ACVHD), appears to be a distinct entity, most commonly but not necessarily occurring in parallel with CAD. CAD certainly contributes to vulnerability as well as the progression of IsHD. This vicious cycle, which explains the frequent parallel occurrence of arteriosclerosis and IHD, an association that appears to be linked by the same cause, comprises a common vulnerability to deleterious adrenergic actions on the myocardium, lipid metabolism, and vascular system alike, rather than viewing CAD and IsHD as having a putative cause and effect relationship as commonly thought. Adrenergic actions can also cause the abnormal lipid metabolism that is associated with CAD and IsHD by catecholamine-induced metabolic actions on lipid mobilization by activation of phospholipases. This may also be part of toxic catecholamine hypermetabolic actions by enhancing deleterious cholesterol and lipid actions in damaging coronary vessels by plaque formation as well as inducing obstructive coronary spasm and platelet aggregation. This may also cause direct toxic necrosis on the myocardium as well as atherosclerosis in blood vessels. In fact, drugs that inhibit adrenergic actions like propranolol, reserpine, and guanethidine all inhibit arteriosclerosis induced by hypercholesterolemia in experimental animals and prevent carotid vascular disease (associated with stroke) in humans. The concomitant development of myocardiopathy and coronary vascular lesions or coronary and carotid artery intimal medial thickening by catecholamine toxicity is reflected by the frequent primary presentation of patients with catecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma with cardiovascular disease, ie, hypertension arrhythmias, AMI, SCD, CHF, and vascular disease, which represents a clear example of the primary deleterious impact of catecholamines on the entire cardiovascular system causing adrenergic cardiovascular disease. Thus, like myocardiopathy, CAD and atherosclerosis in general may be the consequences of or a complication of catecholamine actions rather than its putative cause. This report shows how prophylactic bretylium not only prevents arrhythmias but prevents myocardial necrosis, shock, CHF, maintains or restores normal contractility, and lowers mortality in AMI patients by inducing adrenergic blockade.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15356432/"}

There are 2 million deaths due to cardiovascular disease each year in the European Union; the main cause of death being the coronary heart disease responsible for 16% of deaths in men and 15% in women. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Romania is estimated at 7 million people, of which 2.8 million have ischemic heart disease. In this epidemiological context, risk stratification is required for individualization of therapeutic strategies for each patient. The continuing evolution of the diagnosis and treatment techniques combines personalized medicine with the trend of therapeutic management leveling, based on guidelines and consensus, which are in constant update. The guidelines used in clinical practice have involved risk stratification and identification of patient groups in whom the risk-benefit ratio of using new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques has a positive value. Presence of several risk factors may indicate a more important total risk than the presence / significant increase from normal values of a single risk factor. Modern trends in risk stratification of patients with coronary heart disease are polarized between the use of simple data versus complex scores, traditional data versus new risk factors, generally valid scores versus personalized scores, depending on patient characteristics, type of coronary artery disease, with impact on the suggested therapy. All known information and techniques can be integrated in a complex system of risk assessment. The current trend in risk assessment is to identify coronary artery disease in early forms, before clinical manifestation, and to guide therapy, particularly in patients with intermediate risk, which can be classified in another class of risk based on new obtained information.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22514570/"}

At present, nearly 25% of individuals develop chronic heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction. It is estimated that nearly 2.6% of the American population suffers from heart failure. In the modern era, miniaturized continuous flow ventricular assist devices are now demonstrating nearly 75% 2-year survival rates with improved patient functionality. As a result, elderly patients with cardiogenic shock for whom medical treatment held minimal promise, may now be viable candidates for advanced mechanical therapies. Given this option, there is a need for more approaches to salvage patients from cardiogenic shock with percutaneously delivered mechanical circulatory support (pMCS) systems. The use of pMCS is growing and now includes patients with acute and chronic heart failure as well as patients undergoing high risk interventional and electrophysiology procedures. Each of these devices has a unique hemodynamic effect and therefore an in-depth understanding of device characteristics is required for optimal patient management. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is one of the earliest types of pMCS systems primarily used for cardiorespiratory failure. ECMO can be used in different configurations, which makes it a versatile hemodynamic support device for different patient scenarios.

The evidence that magnesium deficiency has untoward effects in patients with ischaemic heart disease is only circumstantial and direct proof that magnesium deficiency causes cardiac disorders is at present lacking. A ubiquitous calcium-channel blockade mechanism is the main and well-established way of action whereby magnesium acts at pharmacological levels; other mechanisms may be involved as well but at present remain questionable or unsettled. On the basis of the present knowledge, beneficial effects may thus be expected from high dose intravenous magnesium therapy in the setting of acute myocardial infarction with respect to mortality rates, even when there is concurrent thrombolytic therapy, as recently demonstrated by the large LIMIT-2 study, although this could not be confirmed from the ISIS-4 trial. High dose intravenous magnesium is also a first choice therapy for terminating torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia but cannot be considered an established therapy for other cardiac rhythm disturbances nor for settings other than acute myocardial infarction in the case of ischaemic heart disease. The preliminary evidence that magnesium deficiency has a high prevalence in patients with ischaemic heart disease and that it may have a detrimental influence on the course of ischaemic heart disease needs to be validated by larger prospective and controlled clinical studies. Magnesium therapy in ischaemic heart disease thus proves a promising approach which, however, requires that the respective pharmacological and physiological effects be distinguished and further delineated and that the type and stage of ischaemic heart disease be characterized.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7999528/"}

Audibility scores were compared with phonocardiographic, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic measurements. An S4 was recorded graphically in 35 (68.6%) of all 51 subjects and splitting of the first sound (S1), in 37 subjects (72.5%). The abnormal group did not differ significantly from the normal subjects in incidence of recordable S4 or splitting of S1. Audibility of S4, however, correlated with its recorded amplitude, size, and palpability of the presystolic apical impulse, left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters, and history of myocardial infarction. Despite variation among examiners, house staff officers were likelier than cardiologists to believe an S4 present even in cases lacking a recordable S4 and in normal subjects and were more apt to believe an S4 present when splitting of S1 was identified graphically. We conclude that an audible S4 continues to provide evidence for cardiac disease, and that increasing examiner experience renders this finding fairly specific.

The results show that the level of plasma UCA1 is decreased at the early state of AMI patients and increased at day 3 after AMI. In addition, the UCA1 alteration is inversely associated with the expression of miR-1. These findings indicate that the circulating UCA1 could be used as a promising novel biomarker for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of AMI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26949706/"}

We used a genetic approach to distinguish the relevance of two distinct components of this pathway, apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and circulating lipoprotein(a) concentration, to coronary heart disease. In this mendelian randomisation study, we measured lipoprotein(a) concentration and determined apolipoprotein(a) isoform size with a genetic method (kringle IV type 2 [KIV2] repeats in the LPA gene) and a serum-based electrophoretic assay in patients and controls (frequency matched for age and sex) from the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for myocardial infarction per 1-SD difference in either LPA KIV2 repeats or lipoprotein(a) concentration. In a genome-wide analysis of up to 17 503 participants in PROMIS, we identified genetic variants associated with either apolipoprotein(a) isoform size or lipoprotein(a) concentration. Using a mendelian randomisation study design and genetic data on 60 801 patients with coronary heart disease and 123 504 controls from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium, we calculated ORs for myocardial infarction with variants that produced similar differences in either apolipoprotein(a) isoform size in serum or lipoprotein(a) concentration. Finally, we compared phenotypic versus genotypic ORs to estimate whether apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, lipoprotein(a) concentration, or both were causally associated with coronary heart disease. The PROMIS cohort included 9015 patients with acute myocardial infarction and 8629 matched controls. In participants for whom KIV2 repeat and lipoprotein(a) data were available, the OR for myocardial infarction was 0·93 (95% CI 0·90-0·97; p<0·0001) per 1-SD increment in LPA KIV2 repeats after adjustment for lipoprotein(a) concentration and conventional lipid concentrations. The OR for myocardial infarction was 1·10 (1·05-1·14; p<0·0001) per 1-SD increment in lipoprotein(a) concentration, after adjustment for LPA KIV2 repeats and conventional lipids. Genome-wide analysis identified rs2457564 as a variant associated with smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, but not lipoprotein(a) concentration, and rs3777392 as a variant associated with lipoprotein(a) concentration, but not apolipoprotein(a) isoform size. In 60 801 patients with coronary heart disease and 123 504 controls, OR for myocardial infarction was 0·96 (0·94-0·98; p<0·0001) per 1-SD increment in apolipoprotein(a) protein isoform size in serum due to rs2457564, which was directionally concordant with the OR observed in PROMIS for a similar change. The OR for myocardial infarction was 1·27 (1·07-1·50; p=0·007) per 1-SD increment in lipoprotein(a) concentration due to rs3777392, which was directionally concordant with the OR observed for a similar change in PROMIS. Human genetic data suggest that both smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and increased lipoprotein(a) concentration are independent and causal risk factors for coronary heart disease. Lipoprotein(a)-lowering interventions could be preferentially effective in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in individuals with smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms.

Most cardiovascular deaths are caused by ischaemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction (MI). Hereby atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries often precedes disease manifestation. Since tissue remodelling plays an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis as well as in outcome after MI, regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as the major ECM-degrading enzymes with diverse other functions is crucial. Here, we provide an overview of the expression profiles of MMPs in coronary artery and left ventricular tissue using publicly available data from whole tissue to single-cell resolution. To approach an association between MMP expression and the development and outcome of CVDs, we further review studies investigating polymorphisms in MMP genes since polymorphisms are known to have an impact on gene expression. This review therefore aims to shed light on the role of MMPs in atherosclerosis and MI by summarizing current knowledge from publically available datasets, human studies, and analyses of polymorphisms up to preclinical and clinical trials of pharmacological MMP inhibition.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37160529/"}

The impact of valvular heart disease in patients with CS remains unclear. We therefore conducted a post hoc analysis of the randomized Dobutamine Compared to Milrinone (DOREMI) trial to determine the impact of valvular disease on outcomes in patients with CS. We defined significant valvular disease as moderate to severe or greater valvular stenosis or regurgitation and divided participants into a group of those with significant valvular disease and those without. Our primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included resuscitated cardiac arrest; cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support; nonfatal myocardial infarction; stroke; initiation of renal replacement therapy; as well as changes in renal function, perfusion, and hemodynamics over time. One hundred eighty-nine (98.4%) participants from the DOREMI trial were included in our analysis, and 74 (39.2%) had significant valvular dysfunction. Thirty-six (48.7%) patients with valvular disease died in hospital, compared with 37 (32.2%) in the comparator group (relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.15; P = 0.02).

Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines published until May 2023 were systematically screened for recommendations related to cardiac MRI. The class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) for cardiac MRI recommendations were compared between the two guidelines and between newer versus older versions of each guideline using χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests. Results ESC guidelines included 109 recommendations regarding cardiac MRI, and ACC/AHA guidelines included 90 recommendations. The proportion of COR I and LOE B was higher in ACC/AHA versus ESC guidelines (60% [54 of 90] vs 46.8% [51 of 109]; <i>P</i> = .06 and 53% [48 of 90] vs 35.8% [39 of 109], respectively; <i>P</i> = .01). The increase in the number of cardiac MRI recommendations over time was significantly higher in ESC guidelines (from 63 to 109 for ESC vs from 65 to 90 for ACC/AHA; <i>P</i> = .03). The main areas of consensus were found in heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while the main divergences were in valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and aortic disease. Conclusion ESC guidelines included more recommendations related to cardiac MRI use, whereas the ACC/AHA recommendations had higher COR and LOE. The number of cardiac MRI recommendations increased significantly over time in both guidelines, indicating the increasing role of cardiac MRI evaluation and management of cardiovascular disease. <b>Keywords:</b> Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Guideline, European Society of Cardiology, ESC, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2024.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38842455/"}

In a mere 4 decades of its clinical use, the technology used to image myocardial perfusion has made quantum leaps from planar to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and now to a more contemporary rapid SPECT, positron emission tomography (PET), and hybrid SPECT-computed tomography (CT) and PET-CT techniques. Meanwhile, radiotracers have flourished from potassium-43 and red blood cell-tagged blood pool imaging to thallium-201 and technetium-99m-labeled SPECT perfusion tracers along with rubidium-82, ammonia N-13, and more recently F-18 fluorine-labeled PET perfusion tracers. Concurrent with this expansion is the introduction of new quantitative methods and software for image processing, evaluation, and data interpretation. Technical advances, particularly in obtaining quantitative data, have led to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases beyond discrete epicardial coronary artery disease to coronary vasomotor function in the early stages of the development of coronary atherosclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Progress in the areas of molecular and hybrid imaging are equally important areas of growth in nuclear cardiology.

In the second half of this century, 85% of reduction in age-adjusted mortality rates from all causes can be ascribed to the decline in death from cardiovascular disease and stroke. Approximately half of such dramatic decline in mortality rates from ischemic heart disease (IHD) can be explained by primary and secondary prevention and half by therapeutic improvements. Epidemiology of therapeutic regimens in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) indicates substantial increases in the use of thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers and, in some countries, coronary angioplasty. The long-term results of several thrombolytic trials have shown the persistence of early benefit until 10 years after AMI. However, approximately half of the patients with AMI are admitted to the hospital too late to fully benefit from thrombolytic therapy, and one fourth of eligible patients do not receive any form of reperfusion. Primary angioplasty is advocated by some as the treatment of choice in AMI. The present results are not convincing enough to induce the enormously complex and costly reorganization of the health system, allowing the immediate access to coronary angiography for all or most patients with AMI. However, stenting the infarct coronary artery at the site of previous occlusion appears to improve the immediate and medium-term results of coronary revascularization procedures. Approximately half of the AMI survivors are rehospitalized within 1 year after the index event, and postinfarction mortality rate remains exceedingly high. After AMI, prognostic and therapeutic procedures have been introduced in the absence of evidence from controlled trials of their effectiveness profile. Outcome research is needed to standardize effective post-AMI policies. Moreover, new strategies are needed to reduce the incidence and mortality rates of acute ischemic events. A number of new candidate risk factors for IHD are emerging; they are associated with endothelial dysfunction, thrombogenic state, and inflammatory state. It is hoped that advances in molecular approach to cardiovascular disease, molecular genetics and transgenic techniques will allow better understanding and more effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and control IHD.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10426859/"}

We examined whether neighborhood socioeconomic position and neighborhood residential stability (as a determinant of social interaction patterns) have an influence on ischemic heart disease risk. Moreover, we investigated whether dissimilar contextual influences operate at different stages of the disease process, ie, on incidence, 1-day case-fatality, and long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Using a large 27-year longitudinal cohort (baseline: 1 January 1996) defined in the Scania region, Sweden, we estimated multilevel survival models adjusted for individual sociodemographic factors and previous diseases of the persons. After adjustment, multilevel survival models indicated that the incidence of ischemic heart disease increased with neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation but was only weakly associated with neighborhood residential instability (for high vs low residential instability, hazard ratio = 1.2; 95% credible interval = 1.0-1.4). Conversely, beyond effects of individual and contextual socioeconomic circumstances and distance to the hospital, we saw a markedly higher 1-day case-fatality (4.9; 1.8-15) and shorter survival time after MI among individuals still alive 28 days after MI (4.3; 1.2-17) in neighborhoods with a high versus low residential instability. Effects of residential instability on post-MI survival may be mediated by the lower availability of social support in residentially unstable neighborhoods, suggesting a new class of intermediate processes that should be taken into account when investigating contextual influences on ischemic heart disease.

Methods and results Data from the Polish Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes and Acute Myocardial Infarction in Poland Registry were combined to achieve complete information on inhospital course, treatment and outcomes. An all-comer population of patients discharged with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less formed the sample population ( n = 28,080). The patients were analysed for the incidence of significant temporal trends and their possible consequences. The implementation of guideline-based treatment at discharge was high. In the post-discharge course a trend towards a higher frequency of percutaneous coronary intervention and a lower prevalence of planned coronary artery bypass grafting procedures was observed. The number of implantable cardioverter defibrillator/cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillator implantations was increasing. Cardiac rehabilitation was performed in 19-23% cases. The post-discharge outpatient care was based on general practitioner visits, with only 47.9-48.1% of patients attending an ambulatory cardiology specialist visit. In 12 months of observation the frequency of heart failure rehospitalisations was 17.5-19.1%, while the prevalence of rehospitalisations due to myocardial infarction decreased (8.3% in 2009 to 6.7% in 2013, P < 0.001). A trend towards lower all-cause mortality was observed. Assessment of composite outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure rehospitalisation) adjusted for sex and age at 12 months revealed a significant decreasing trend.

However, there has been a lack of information regarding the outcomes for patients who have gout attacks during hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. We reviewed the data of 444 consecutive patients who were admitted to our hospital between 2005 and 2008 due to acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The clinical outcomes were compared between patients with gout attack and those without. Of the 444, 48 patients with acute STEMI developed acute gouty arthritis during hospitalization. The multivariate analysis identified prior history of gout and estimated glomerular filtration rate as independent risk factors of gout attack for patients with acute STEMI (odds ratio (OR) 21.02, 95 % CI 2.96-149.26, p = 0.002; OR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.86-0.99, p = 0.035, respectively). The in-hospital mortality and duration of hospital stay did not differ significantly between the gouty group and the non-gouty group (controls). During a mean follow-up of 49 ± 28 months, all-cause mortality and stroke were similar for both groups. Multivariate Cox regression showed that gout attack was independently associated with short- and long-term adverse non-fatal cardiac events (hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95 % CI 1.09-3.24, p = 0.024; HR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.09-3.03, p = 0.022, respectively).

Findings in patients who died suddenly generally did not differ when the patients were groups by electrocardiographic rhythm on arrival of the mobile coronary aid unit. The pathologic changes of acute thrombosis and recent myocardial infarction did not occur with sufficient frequency in the entire group to be considered causally related to the sudden collapse, occurring in 10 and 5 percent of cases, respectively. Although most patients had evidence of obstructive coronary disease and old myocardial infarction, 8 percent had no significant vascular disease, acute thrombosis, myocarditis or valve disease that might be implicated as a factor in sudden death. There was no relation between age and severity of obstructive coronary disease or frequency of old myocardial infarction in patients who died suddenly. Complete atherosclerotic occlusion in one or more coronary vessels occurred in 51 of 87 (59 percent) and old myocardial infarction in 48 of 87 (55 percent). Although the mean age of this autopsy population was similar to that of all patients in the community who have had ventricular fibrillation on arrival of the aid unit, the nonsurvivors had a greater incidence of myocardial infarction and symptomatic heart disease (73 of 87) than did survivors. Comparison of this autopsy group with persons from the community who were resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation and subsequently had coronary angiograms indicates that the severity of coronary stenosis does not distinguish between survivors and nonsurvivors of an episode of ventricular fibrillation and suggests that other factors influence the outcome of an episode of ventricular fibrillation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/871113/"}

We linked Danish nationwide registries to identify patients taking DAPT 7 days following hospital discharge for an acute MI, and excluded individuals on anticoagulation therapy. We used multiple Cox regression modelling, to compute average risk of UGI bleeding in relation to PPI use. The associated treatment efficacy was compared based on guideline risk assessment. We studied 46 301 patients on DAPT after MI. Only 35% of patients at higher risk of UGI bleeding received recommended treatment with a PPI based on the guideline criteria. The 1--year risk of UGI bleeding was 1.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.1%] and 1.7% (CI 1.5-2.0%) for high-risk patients. Overall PPI compared with no therapy, was associated with a risk ratio for UGI bleeding of 0.62 (CI 0.48-0.77) corresponding to an absolute risk difference of 0.44% (CI 0.39-0.48%). Proton pump inhibitor therapy was associated with a similar absolute risk difference [0.47% (CI 0.43-0.51%)] for high-risk patients. Proton pump inhibitor therapy is used less than suggested by guidelines in patients treated with DAPT following MI and was generally associated with reduced risk of UGI bleeding.

MSCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats were transfected with adenoviral small interfering RNA to silence MR (siRNA-MR). MR silencing decreased hypoxia-induced MSCs' apoptosis, as demonstrated by Annexin V/7-AAD staining.

Consequently, the rate of cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction has decreased to approximately 5% over a period of 2 years as compared with the 20% to 30% reported in the prethrombolytic era. In this context, it is unlikely that the results of previous studies in the prereperfusion era can be applied to this group of patients. Others have demonstrated that the identification of subgroups of patients at greater risk and the search for new risk markers can significantly improve survival of patients who are at high risk despite reperfusion therapy. For example, it was found in the GISSI-2 study that unsuitability for exercise stress testing was associated with a mortality of 7% at 6 months. Other factors that determine poor prognosis after myocardial infarction are transitory heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and advanced age. The active search for new risk markers has identified other factors such as nonresolution of ST-segment changes, impaired ventricular filling, anomalous baroreflex sensitivity, or T-wave alternans that may be of benefit in assessing risk. Also, the timing of risk stratification can be critical. Often, risk factors have been analyzed weeks or even months after infarction instead of before hospital discharge. Approximately 30% of patients have deterioration of left ventricular function in the next 2 or 3 months, whereas others have improvement, highlighting the difficulties in attempting to risk stratify at one point in time. Although nobody doubts the effect that coronary revascularization has had on the prognosis of ischemic heart disease or the effectiveness of aspirin, beta -blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the search for cardiac or noncardiac risk markers can contribute notably to increasing the survival of patients who have had myocardial infarction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12783727/"}

We retrospectively analyzed 1,059 patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to our tertiary cardiac center and treated with pPCI. Preprocedural pharmacology and procedural technique (including access route, the use of drug-eluting stents, and thrombectomy) were at the operators' discretion. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before discharge; echo contrast agent was used when appropriate. LVT was detected in 42 subjects (4%). There were no significant differences in baseline demographics or pre-PCI clinical features between the 2 groups. Post-treatment, mean ejection fraction (EF) in patients with LVT was 35±8.4% and in those without LVT was 47±10%, p<0.001. Thirty-seven patients (88%) in the LVT group presented with an anterior STEMI versus 471 patients (42%) in the without LVT group (p<0.001). Apical akinesis was noted in all patients with LVT irrespective of the principal location of the MI. Multivariate analysis predictors of LVT were reduced EF, anterior site of MI, and the use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. After diagnosis of LVT, patients were treated with warfarin for 3 to 6 months. No significant difference in mortality was detectable at discharge between the 2 groups. In conclusion, in the contemporary era of pPCI, the incidence of LVT in patients with STEMI is significantly lower than that of the previous (thrombolysis) literature. The early presence of LVT is more likely in patients with anterior STEMI (involving the apex) and reduced EF.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24485697/"}

Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiology of CS, its management has only improved slightly. The prevalence of CS has remained stable over the past decade, but its outcome has seen few improvements, with the 1-month mortality rate still in the range of 40-60%. Inotropes and vasopressors are the first-line therapies for CS, but they are associated with significant hazards, and have well-known deleterious effects. Furthermore, a significant number of patients develop refractory CS with haemodynamic instability, causing critical organ hypoperfusion and/or pulmonary congestion, despite increasing doses of catecholamines. A major change has resulted from the recent advent and availability of potent mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices. These devices, which ensure sustained blood flow, provide a great and long-awaited opportunity to improve the prognosis of CS. Several efficient MCS devices are now available, including left ventricle-to-aorta circulatory support devices and full pulmonary and circulatory support with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, evidence to support their indications, the timing of implantation and the selection of patients and devices is scarce.

This method had a excellent correlation with RVEF of 99mTc first-pass technique (gamma = 0.92, p less than 0.001, n = 20). 2) RVEF was measured in 10 normal volunteers, 76 patients with myocardial infarction (OMI), 20 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 5 patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and 5 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). In OMI and DCM, their RVEF was lower than that of normal volunteers and, in ARVD and PPH, lower than that of OMI and DCM. There was a significant inverse correlation between RVEF, mean pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index. 3) The effect of the location of right coronary artery (RCA) lesions on RVEF during exercise was also evaluated. Ten normal volunteers and 27 patients with OMI were studied at rest and during exercise. The patients with OMI were divided into two groups: those without proximal RCA lesions (non RCA group, n = 12) and those with proximal RCA lesions (RCA group, n = 15). Although there were no significant increases of RVEF during exercise in both group, the percent change in RVEF was less in RCA group than in non RCA group. These findings suggested that proximal RCA stenosis is a major determinant of exercise RVEF. 4) To assess the right atrial function, right atrial volume curve was measured in 10 normal volunteers, 32 patients with OMI and 4 patients with PPH. The curve was clearly divided into 4 phase; filling phase (312 +/- 40 msec), early ejection phase (276 +/- 53 msec), plateau an index of right atrial reservoir function, was 0.41 +/- 0.05 and Contractile Volume/Stroke Volume (Contr.

By searching the websites of Circulation and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, we entered the word \"depression\" on August 28, 2009. We ignored articles using \"depression\" in the context of cardiovascular concepts such as \"ST-segment depression.\" By searching articles dating back to 1995, we selected publications that studied the prognostic association of depression and coronary heart disease. There were 5 relevant publications: 3 from Circulation and 2 from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The methods used to assess coronary heart disease (specifically, myocardial infarction) are largely homogenous across the studies, but the methods used to assess depression are heterogeneous. Parameters used to diagnose myocardial infarction and determine its severity are precise, objective, and reliable, whereas those used to assess depression and its severity exhibit less precision and lack comparable objectivity and reliability. This mismatch may compromise our understanding of the link between coronary heart disease and depression in depressed patients with comorbid coronary heart disease. We propose using precise instruments to identify and quantitate coronary heart disease as outcome variables to assess psychiatric interventions and to better define depression in depressed patients with comorbid coronary heart disease.

Additionally, multivariable Mendelian randomization was employed to regulate confounding factors, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), diabetes, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and metformin. A mediation analysis was conducted to assess the mediating effects on the association between exposure and outcome by treating atrial fibrillation and stroke as mediator variables of levothyroxine treatment and bradycardia as mediator variables of hypothyroidism. Genetically predicted hypothyroidism and levothyroxine treatment were significantly associated with the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction [levothyroxine: odds ratio (OR) 3.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.80-7.80; hypothyroidism: OR: 15.11, 95% CI: 2.93-77.88]. Levothyroxine treatment was also significantly related to the risk of experiencing heart failure (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.21-3.88). However, no associations were detected between hypothyroidism and the risk of experiencing heart failure or between hypothyroidism or levothyroxine treatment and the risk of experiencing cardiac death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the results remained stable. Additionally, mediation analysis indicated that atrial fibrillation and stroke may serve as potential mediators in the relationships between levothyroxine treatment and the risk of experiencing heart failure or myocardial infarction. The results of our study suggest a positive association between hypothyroidism and myocardial infarction and highlight the potential effects of levothyroxine treatment, the main thyroid hormone replacement therapy approach, on increasing the risk of experiencing myocardial infarction and heart failure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39256710/"}

This study was undertaken to identify predictors of PMI and in-hospital death in major vascular surgical patients. From the Vascular Surgery Registry (6,948 operations from January 1989 through June 1997) the authors identified 107 patients in whom PMI developed during the same hospital stay. Case-control patients (patients without PMI) were matched at a 1x:x1 ratio with index cases according to the type of surgery, gender, patient age, and year of surgery. The authors analyzed data regarding preoperative cardiac disease and surgical and anesthetic factors to study association with PMI and cardiac death. By using univariable analysis the authors identified the following predictors of PMI: valvular disease (P = 0.007), previous congestive heart failure (P = 0.04), emergency surgery (P = 0.02), general anesthesia (P = 0.03), preoperative history of coronary artery disease (P = 0.001), preoperative treatment with beta-blockers (P = 0.003), lower preoperative (P = 0.03) and postoperative (P = 0.002) hemoglobin concentrations, increased bleeding rate (as assessed from increased cell salvage; P = 0.025), and lower ejection fraction (P = 0.02). Of the 107 patients with PMI, 20.6% died of cardiac cause during the same hospital stay. The following factors increased the odds ratios for cardiac death: age (P = 0.001), recent congestive heart failure (P = 0.01), type of surgery (P = 0.04), emergency surgery (P = 0.02), lower intraoperative diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.001), new intraoperative ST-T changes (P = 0.01), and increased intraoperative use of blood (P = 0.005). Patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, even more than 12 months before index surgery, had a 79% reduction in risk of death if they had PMI (P = 0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed preoperative definitive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (P = 0.001) and significant valvular disease (P = 0.03) were associated with increased risk of PMI. Congestive heart failure less than 1 yr before index vascular surgery (P = 0. 0002) and increased intraoperative use of blood (P = 0.007) were associated with cardiac death. The history of coronary artery bypass grafting reduced the risk of cardiac death (P = 0.04) in patients with PMI. The in-hospital cardiac mortality rate is high for patients who undergo vascular surgery and experience clinically significant PMI. Stress of surgery (increased intraoperative bleeding and aortic, peripheral vascular, and emergency surgery), poor preoperative cardiac functional status (congestive heart failure, lower ejection fraction, diagnosis of coronary artery disease), and preoperative history of coronary artery bypass grafting are the factors that determine perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality rates.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10861156/"}

Although anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin)-derivatives has been shown to be effective in some of these situations, there is no evidence regarding the role of antiplatelet agents. The common factor in the thromboembolic potential of acute myocardial infarction, chronic left ventricular aneurysm and dilated cardiomyopathy is mural thrombus. This can be detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and indium-111 platelet scintigraphy. Although of value in elucidating the natural history of mural thrombus, in most cases, management is not substantially aided by these investigations. In patients with extensive myocardial infarction, particularly anterior infarction, moderate intensity anticoagulation started soon after hospital admission reduces the rate of embolism. After 8 to 12 weeks, embolic risk is low so that anticoagulants can usually be discontinued. Patients with chronic left ventricular aneurysm have a low incidence of embolism; anticoagulation is, therefore, inappropriate. Dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with a high risk of embolism; moderate intensity anticoagulation may be advisable in many such cases. Little information is available regarding the incidence of thromboembolism or the role of antithrombotic therapy in the patient with a diffusely dilated left ventricle due to ischemic heart disease. In native valve infective endocarditis, the risk of hemorrhage is high, and the efficacy of conventional anticoagulants unclear; thus, anticoagulation should not be instituted for the cardiac condition as such. However, in prosthetic valve endocarditis, the risk of embolism seems to be very high, and anticoagulant therapy should be continued, but with great care because there is a substantial risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation in patients with valvular heart disease is dealt with in a previous review. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at varying risk of embolism, depending on the etiology of the arrhythmia; trials of antithrombotic therapy are needed for the various subsets of patients. In most elderly patients, the etiology is not known, and their stroke risk is high. The risk of embolism in younger patients with idiopathic atrial fibrillation is so low as to make any antithrombotic therapy unnecessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3537072/"}

Specific guidance for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and MitraClip procedures varies according to pandemic phase.

To improve compliance in a tertiary care teaching hospital with these evidence-based quality measures, a clinical-decision-support system (CDSS) that uses an electronic checklist was developed. The CDSS prompts clinicians at every training level to consistently create comprehensive discharge instructions addressing quality measures. The authors compared compliance during the 15-month preintervention and postintervention periods. Compliance with discharge measures for AMI (i.e., aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI], or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] use) and for HF (i.e., discharge instructions, left ventricular systolic function [LVSF] evaluation, and ACEI/ARB use) was assessed. The delivery of discharge instructions showed significant improvement from the preintervention period to the postintervention period (37.2% to 93.0%; P < .001). Compliance with prescription of ACEI or ARB also improved significantly for HF (80.7% to 96.4%; P < .001) and AMI (88.1% to 100%; P = .014) patients.

Thus, an analysis was made of mortality and hospital admission trends due to acute and chronic ischemic heart diseases in the 1980-1994 period in Spain. Population-based study of temporal trends with data of primary diagnosis of acute (CIE-9: 410-411) and chronic (CIE-9: 412-414) ischemic heart disease obtained from the National Vital Statistics and the National Survey of Hospital Morbidity.

Using the spin-echo technique, images of diagnostic quality were obtained in 93% of cases with TE = 28 msec and in 65% of cases with TE = 56 msec. Transverse multisection sequences encompassing most of the left ventricle required approximately 6-8 minutes. Corroborative studies were available in 134 of 141 patients who had cardiovascular disease; two dimensional echocardiograms and angiography in 133 and 100 patients, respectively. Gated MR demonstrated the wall thinning and complications caused by prior myocardial infarctions and high signal intensity of the myocardium at the site of acute myocardial infarctions. MR accurately demonstrated anatomic abnormalities owing to hypertrophic and congestive cardiomyopathies, congenital abnormalities of the heart and great vessels, rheumatic heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac and paracardiac masses. Depiction of cardiovascular anatomy and pathoanatomy was attained without the use of any contrast media. Consequently, gated MR is an effective technique for cardiac diagnosis. The short time required for tomographic examination of the entire heart using the multisection technique renders this a practical cardiac imaging modality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3159039/"}

On the other hand, apoptosis is a strongly controlled, cell removal procedure that has a crucial part in numerous cardiac problems, such as reperfusion injury, MI (myocardial infarction), consecutive heart failure, and inflammation of myocardium. Completely comprehending the managing procedures of cell death signaling is critical as it is the primary factor that influences patient mortality and morbidity, owing to cardiomyocyte damage. Indeed, the prevention of heart cell death appears to be a viable treatment approach for heart illnesses. According to current researches, a number of long non-coding RNAs cause the heart cells death via different methods that are embroiled in controlling the activity of transcription elements, the pathways that signals transmission within cells, small miRNAs, and the constancy of proteins. When there is too much cell death in the heart, it can cause problems like reduced blood flow, heart damage after restoring blood flow, heart disease in diabetics, and changes in the heart after reduced blood flow. Therefore, studying how lncRNAs control apoptosis could help us find new treatments for heart diseases. In this review, we present recent discoveries about how lncRNAs are involved in causing cell death in different cardiovascular diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38238070/"}

During 5 years, measures aimed at active primary and secondary prophylaxis of coronary heart disease were carried out in one of the groups. Prospective survey over the death rate has demonstrated that cardiovascular diseases rank the first in the structure of the death rate among the adult male population, with their portion being increased with age. Studies into the relationship between the death rate and the main risk factors in the population provided evidence that risk of the death from cardiovascular diseases rises with an increase in the systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, in the body weight index, and in total cholesterol. The active composite preventive measures brought about a significant reduction in risk of the death from cardiovascular diseases, in the incidence of the fresh cases of myocardial infarction, and brain stroke. At the same time the death rate of cardiovascular diseases dropped by 40.7% as compared to the expected one, the number of lethal cases due to various reasons by 12.7%, an the incidence of myocardial infarction and brain stroke by 18.8%.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2588175/"}

The relationship between HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was assessed using linear regression analysis, which is presented as HbA1c = 0.272 × FPG(mmol/L) + 4.302. Predicted HbA1c for each participant was calculated by inserting corresponding FPG levels into this regression equation. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Overall, 94 diabetic patients (4.5%) and 131 nondiabetic patients (4.1%) died during hospitalization. Restricted cubic splines analysis revealed an L-shaped association between HGI and in-hospital mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas a strong trend toward a linear negative association was observed in patients without T2DM. In both diabetic and nondiabetic populations, patients with low HGI had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared with those with moderate HGI, whereas no significant difference was found between high HGI and moderate HGI groups.

We performed a study on nationwide data of all Polish AMI patients in 2009-2012 to assess incidence, quality of care, and cardiovascular events during 1 year following AMI. The database of the only public, obligatory health insurer in Poland (National Health Fund) together with data from the Central Statistical Office were used. AMI cases were selected based on primary diagnosis ICD-10 codes I21-I22. For years 2009-2012, index hospitalisations (n = 311,813) in a given year and death records were analysed. Additionally, data on hospitalisations, procedures and deaths during 1 year follow-up were obtained for 2009. Age-adjusted incidence of AMI in Poland in 2009 was 196 cases per 100,000 population (176 per 100,000 were hospitalised), with a decreasing trend over time. The incidence was 2.5 times higher in men than in women. The median age was 63 years in men and 74 years in women. The proportion of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) decreased from 59% to 48% in 2012, and the proportion of patients receiving invasive treatment increased from 72% to 81%. Age-adjusted case fatality rate was equal in women and men. In 2009, the number of patients with AMI was 75,054 (61% men, 39% women) and 83% of them were treated in cardiology units. Invasive strategy was used in 77% of patients with STEMI and 66% of those with non-STEMI, thrombolysis in 1% and coronary artery bypass grafting in 1.9% of patients. Invasive treatment was used less frequently in women and the elderly patients. When all hospitals where a patient was treated until the final discharge were taken into account, in-hospital mortality was 10.5%. The lowest in-hospital mortality was noted among patients treated invasively (6.3%). The total number of readmissions within 1 year following AMI was 84,718, of which 61.9% were due to cardiovascular causes. The most common causes were stable coronary artery disease (27%), heart failure (7.9%), recurrent infarction (7.0%), and unstable angina (6.8%). Within 1 year after AMI, only 22% of patients participated in a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Total 1-year mortality was 19.4% (invasive treatment 12.3%, non-invasive treatment 38.0%). Standards of care and early outcomes in AMI in Poland are similar to Western countries. The major cause of higher mortality due to AMI in the Polish population is a high incidence of AMI, indicating a need for intensification of primary prevention programmes. Secondary prevention is also underused, especially in the field of cardiac rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25371307/"}

We used a feature selection approach to identify a set of gene expression variables which successfully differentiate different cardiovascular diseases. The initial features were discovered by fitting a linear model for each probe set across all arrays of normal individuals and patients with myocardial infarction. Three different feature optimisation algorithms were devised which identified two discriminating sets of genes, one using MI and normal controls (total genes = 6) and another one using MI and unstable angina patients (total genes = 7). In all our classification approaches we used a non-parametric k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification method (k = 3). The results proved the diagnostic robustness of the final feature sets in discriminating patients with myocardial infarction from healthy controls.

Besides cardiac rehabilitation, disease management programs (DMPs) are an important component of outpatient care after AMI in Germany. This study aims to analyze outcomes after AMI among those who participated in DMPs and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in a region with overall increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Based on data from a regional myocardial infarction registry and a 2-year follow-up period, we assessed the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in relation to participation in CR and DMP, risk factors for complications and individual healths well as lifestyle characteristics. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to compare survival time between participants and non-participants until an adverse event occurred. Of 1094 observed patients post-AMI, 272 were enrolled in a DMP. An association between DMP participation and lower hazard rates for MACE compared to non-enrollees could not be proven in the crude model (hazard ratio = 0.93; 95% confidence interval = 0.65-1.33). When adjusted for possible confounding variables, these results remained virtually unchanged (1.03; 0.72-1.48). Furthermore, smokers and obese patients showed a distinctly lower chance of DMP enrollment. In contrast, those who participated in CR showed a lower risk for MACE in crude (0.52; 0.41-0.65) and adjusted analysis (0.56; 0.44-0.71).

The 8 gated perfusion maps were transformed by contrast normalization, the count minimums of which were tracked to quantify torsion. Measured torsion was used to correct maps of perfusion and wall thickening. Torsion was found to be visually detectable equally well in groups 1 and 2. Apical torsion was significantly greater for group 1 than groups 2 and 3 (15 degrees +/- 9 degrees vs 9 degrees +/- 15 degrees and 2 degrees +/- 12 degrees ) and was opposite in sign for patients with apical aneurysms (-4 degrees +/- 13 degrees ) and for patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (-4 degrees +/- 15 degrees ). Maximum percent count differences were 10% +/- 16% between torsion-corrected versus uncorrected perfusion maps.

Hypericum perforatum L. (genus Hypericum, family Hypericaceae) has a long history as a traditional Chinese medicine, which was traditionally used for the treatment of emotional distress, cardiothoracic depression, and acute mastitis. Hyperoside (Hyp) extracted from Hypericum perforatum L. has been affirmed to exert therapeutic effects on cardiovascular diseases, with widespread existence in plants of genus Hypericum. Hyp could also be extracted from Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge (genus Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge, family Rosaceae), another traditional Chinese medicine that traditionally prevented and treated heart disease in China. The cardioprotection and mechanism of Hyp comprise anti-inflammation, anti-fibrosis, activation of autophagy, and reversal of cardiac remodeling. This study aimed to explore the Hyp effect against MI and its underlying mechanism. The MI model was constructed in the KM mice via a ligating surgery of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Subsequently, the mice were divided into following seven groups: Sham group, MI group, MI + Hyp 9 mg/kg group, MI + Hyp18 mg/kg group, MI + Hyp36 mg/kg group, MI + Fosinopril group, and MI + Hyp-36 mg/kg+3-MA group. Each group was treated with Hyp in different concentrations or positive medicine for two weeks except for the sham group. After two weeks, we examined the cardiac function, electrocardiogram (ECG), myocardial hypertrophy in the non-infarct area, collagen volume fraction (CVF), perivascular collagen area (PVCA) in the infarct area, and several serum cytokines. Autophagy and inflammation in cardiomyocytes were assessed via measuring autophagy-associated proteins and NLRP1 inflammasome pathway related proteins. Hyp reversed LV remodeling and adverse ECG changes through reducing CVF and myocardial hypertrophy. Additionally, Hyp treatment could reduce inflammation levels in cardiomyocytes, compared with those in MI group. Moreover, NLRP1inflammation pathway was activated after MI. Up-regulation of autophagic flux suppressed NLRP1 inflammation pathway after Hyp treatment. However, co-treatment with 3-MA abrogated above effects of Hyp. Hyp had obvious protective effect on heart injury in MI mice. Echocanrdiographic and histological measurements demonstrated that Hyp treatment improved cardiac function, and ameliorated myocardial hypertrophy and fibrinogen deposition after MI. The partial mechanism is that Hyp could up-regulate autophagy after MI. Furthermore, the promotion of autophagic flux would suppress NLRP1 inflammation pathway induced by MI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33957207/"}

Initial lapses of consciousness were a bad prognostic sign--they appeared as well as seizures more often in embolic than in thrombotic brain infarctions. The clearly higher incidence of emboli to the left cerebral hemisphere has anatomical reasons. Angiographic findings depend on the time of examination; common are occlusions of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery, media-occlusions at the trifurcation, media-branch-occlusions and disturbed middle cerebral blood flow.

However, research points to several potential strategies to stem this expected rise in cardioembolic stroke. First, although one-third of strokes are of unclear cause, it is increasingly accepted that many of these cryptogenic strokes arise from a distant embolism rather than in situ cerebrovascular disease, leading to the recent formulation of embolic stroke of undetermined source as a distinct target for investigation. Second, recent clinical trials have indicated that embolic stroke of undetermined source may often stem from subclinical atrial fibrillation, which can be diagnosed with prolonged heart rhythm monitoring. Third, emerging evidence indicates that a thrombogenic atrial substrate can lead to atrial thromboembolism even in the absence of atrial fibrillation. Such an atrial cardiomyopathy may explain many cases of embolic stroke of undetermined source, and oral anticoagulant drugs may prove to reduce stroke risk from atrial cardiomyopathy given its parallels to atrial fibrillation. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drugs have recently expanded therapeutic options for preventing cardioembolic stroke and are currently being tested for stroke prevention in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source, including specifically those with atrial cardiomyopathy. Fourth, increasing appreciation of thrombogenic atrial substrate and the common coexistence of cardiac and extracardiac stroke risk factors suggest benefits from global vascular risk factor management in addition to anticoagulation. Finally, improved imaging of ventricular thrombus plus the availability of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drugs may lead to better prevention of stroke from acute myocardial infarction and heart failure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28154101/"}

Sexual problems have been found to influence quality of life and well-being, and sexual dysfunction has been associated with anxiety and depression. International guidelines recommend that healthcare professionals address sexuality; however, this is rarely done in practice, due to multiple causes, for example ignorance, embarrassment and lack of systematic treatment. Insight into women's sexual challenges after having a myocardial infarction is much needed. Qualitative interview study. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 patients representative of the population and later transcribed. The analysis was inspired by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation, which consists of three levels: naive reading, structured analysis, and critical interpretation and discussion. The overall finding that emerged regarding the women's sexual health was an anxious resuming of sexual activity. Four themes emerged: (1) the partner, (2) support, (3) the heart disease's influence on sex and (4) the relationship. The women experienced anxious resuming of sexual activity. The heart disease had influence on their sex life, and relationship with their partner could be affected. Some needed support from health professionals or their network to dare sexual activity again. This study indicates that health professionals should focus more on identifying anxiety and exhaustion after myocardial infarction and articulating their potential influence on women's sexual lives.

Into a retrospective study, we enrolled 2,882 patients in the Cardiology Department with an initial diagnosis of AMI between 2009 and 2012. Diagnosis of AMI was made based on ESC criteria. In all patients, coronary angiography was performed in order to exclude haemodynamically significant coronary lesions. Among 2,882 patients hospitalised in the described time period, 58 (2%) patients were diagnosed with type 2 AMI.The mean age of the study group was 67.3 ± 13.2 years; and the majority of the study group, 60.3%, were women.

Understanding of the actions of C-type natriuretic peptide and dendroaspis natriuretic peptide is incomplete, but these two new family members also act as vasodilators. Because of the rapid evolution of information about this peptide family, we reviewed the state of the art with respect to risk stratification and therapeutic ability. English-language papers were identified by a MEDLINE database search covering 1966 through 1997 and supplemented with bibliographic references and texts. The natriuretic peptides are counterregulatory hormones with prognostically important levels. They are similarly upregulated in heart failure and counteract neurohormones that induce vasoconstriction and fluid retention. BNP may be the superior prognosticator for risk stratification after myocardial infarction and is independent of left ventricular ejection fraction.

DATA SOURCES--Publications in the peer-reviewed literature were located via MEDLINE, citation in other relevant articles, and appropriate reports by scientific agencies. Greatest emphasis was given to work published since 1990. CONCLUSIONS--Passive smoking reduces the blood's ability to deliver oxygen to the heart and compromises the myocardium's ability to use oxygen to create adenosine triphosphate. These effects are manifest as reduced exercise capability in people breathing secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke increases platelet activity, accelerates atherosclerotic lesions, and increases tissue damage following ischemia or myocardial infarction. The effects of secondhand tobacco smoke on the cardiovascular system are not caused by a single component of the smoke, but rather are caused by the effects of many elements, including carbon monoxide, nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other, not fully specified elements in the smoke. Nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke in everyday life exhibit an increased risk of both fatal and nonfatal cardiac events.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7897790/"}

In 1958, Sherry and others started using streptokinase in patients with acute myocardial infarction and changed the focus of treatment from palliation to \"cure.\" Initial trials that used streptokinase infusion produced conflicting results. An innovative approach of intracoronary streptokinase infusion was initiated by Rentrop and colleagues in 1979. Subsequently, larger trials of intracoronary infusion achieved reperfusion rates ranging from 70% to 90%. The need for a meticulously planned and systematically executed randomized multicenter trial was fulfilled by the Gruppo Italiano per la Sperimentazione della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI) trial in 1986, which not only validated streptokinase as an effective therapeutic method but also established a fixed protocol for its use in acute myocardial infarction.

Confounders include the surgical stresses of a thoracotomy and abnormal physiology of an open chest. The need to reposition the animal interferes with the study of the early changes associated with ischemia. Direct comparison of pre-ischemia and post-ischemia images is then difficult. We developed a novel \"closed chest\" model of ischemia/reperfusion to overcome these issues. Following thoracotomy, we sutured a balloon occluder to the left coronary artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats. We used both visual inspection and ECG to assess for successful occlusion and reperfusion of the coronary artery at the time of operation by brief inflation and deflation of the balloon. The tubing was then placed under the skin and the incision closed. Following a recovery period (5-10 days), the animals underwent MRI. We performed baseline assessment of left ventricle function, and repeated LV measurement during a 15-min coronary occlusion and again during a 60-min reperfusion period following reopening of the coronary artery. The occluder was successfully placed in 40 of 44 animals. Four developed intraoperative complications; two large myocardial infarction, two terminal bleeding. Six died in the week following surgery, [four sudden deaths (presumed arrhythmic), one anterior infarction, one sepsis]. Cine-MRI demonstrated localised hypokinesia in 31 of the remaining 34 animals. LV ejection fraction (EF) was reduced from 63 ± 7 % at baseline, to 49 ± 9 % during coronary occlusion. LV EF recovered to 61 ± 2 %. The area at risk on staining of the heart was 41.9 ± 15.8 %. This method allows the effects of ischemia/reperfusion to be studied before, during, and after coronary occlusion. Ischemia can be caused while the animal is in the MRI.

Summary-level data for exposure variables (sleep duration, chronotype, and insomnia) and outcome variables (ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) were derived from UK Biobank. Data from the FinnGen consortium was used as a robustness check. In MR analysis, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to infer causality between exposure and outcome. MR-Egger regression was used to identify pleiotropy, and MR-PRESSO outlier test was used to remove the pleiotropy of the genetic instruments. Based on UK Biobank, MR analysis suggested that sleep duration was weakly associated with atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.9999, 95% CI: 0.9998-0.9999) and ischaemic heart disease (OR = 0.9997, 95% CI: 0.9995-0.9998). Insomnia was associated with ischaemic heart disease (OR = 1.0117, 95% CI: 1.0051-1.0183) and myocardial infarction (OR = 1.0049, 95% CI: 1.0019-1.0079). No associations were found between chronotype and cardiac diseases (P > 0.05). We did not find pleiotropy except for insomnia with ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction using MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO analysis consistent with IVW. Finally, we obtained the same direction as with UK Biobank using the FinnGen data. Sleep duration and insomnia might be the potential causal risk factors of cardiac diseases. As the OR was small, these associations are probably not clinically relevant. Further validation studies are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35765714/"}

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of anemia on the short- and long-term prognosis of patients with AMI treated with PCI, including high-risk subgroups. The study group consisted of 1,497 consecutive patients with AMI treated in the acute phase with PCI. Anemia was defined using World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin level <13 g/dl for men and <12 g/dl for women). The study population was divided into 2 major groups (patients with [n = 248, 16.6%] and without [n = 1,249, 83.4%] anemia) and 6 subgroups (diabetes mellitus, impaired renal function, age >70 years, left ventricular dysfunction, incomplete revascularization, and multivessel disease). A comparative analysis was performed between both groups within the whole population and within the particular subgroups. Significantly greater 30-day (13.2% vs 7.3%), 1-year (20.5% vs 11.3%), and total (24.1% vs 12.7%; all p <0.05) mortality rates were observed in the anemic group. Multivariate analysis identified anemia as an independent predictor of any-cause death in the whole population during the observation period (covariate-adjusted hazard ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 1.61, p <0.05). Anemia was significantly associated with excessive long-term mortality in the multivessel disease group (adjusted hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.74) and in the incomplete revascularization group (hazard ratio 1.67, both p <0.05). In conclusion, anemia on admission in patients with AMI treated in the acute phase with PCI was independently associated with increasing short- and long-term mortality, especially in the subgroups with incomplete revascularization and multivessel disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185005/"}

Prospective, nonrandomized study enrolled low-risk patients with normal ECG and troponin on admission who underwent observation and/or stress testing by unstandardized clinical judgment. Patients who experienced recurrent angina or positive ECGs or positive troponins during observation or patients with positive stress testing were admitted; otherwise, they were discharged. The end points are cardiac events at short- and long-term follow-up including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and revascularization. Of 5656 patients considered, 1732 with ischemic ECG were initially admitted and, therefore, excluded from the analysis; 2860 with pleuritic chest pain and normal ECG were discharged; 1064 with visceral chest pain and normal ECG were enrolled. Patients with known coronary disease (45%) were older and likely presented known vascular disease. Patients with known vascular disease, older age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and lower chest pain score were likely managed with observation. In patients with known coronary disease as compared with patients without, overall cardiac events account for 35% vs 14%, respectively (P < .001), as follows: in-hospital, 23% vs 10%, (P < .001); 1 month, 4% vs 2% (P = .133); and 9.9 ± 4.9 months, 8% vs 2%, respectively (P < .001).

Evidence of areal myocardial dysfunction detected only by echocardiography.", "text": "To assess the diagnostic value of routine two-dimensional echocardiography in the coronary care unit setting, we studied 81 unselected patients admitted for acute chest pain. Using electrocardiography (ECG), clinical history and serum markers of myocardial injury, the patients were retrospectively diagnosed as having had definite acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with (n=13) or without (n=31) previous infarction, possible AMI with (n=14) or without (n=15) previous infarction, and non-coronary cardiac or other causes of chest pain (n=8). Abnormal wall motion was observed in 75/77 patients with a cardiac origin of symptoms (sensitivity 97%), and there were no false-positive wall motion findings. In the 73 patients who were finally diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD), echocardiography showed wall motion abnormality in at least one additional coronary territory area in which there were no diagnostic ECG changes for 56% of patients with CAD (41/73) (P<0. 001). These areas were considered to be indicative of the presence of myocardium at risk for future cardiac events. We conclude that in addition to being a sensitive and accurate tool for detection of ischaemic wall motion abnormalities, two-dimensional echocardiography can give valuable information about the area of myocardium at risk. Therefore, therapeutic decisions can be affected by the findings of the routine echocardiographic examination, which is recommended even in unselected coronary care unit patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10583339/"}

However, it is unknown whether hyperglycemic state is associated with increased major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after AMI. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between glucometabolic status and MACE in patients after AMI, and determined the critical level of 2 h post-load plasma glucose that may be used to predict MACE. AMI patients (n = 422) were divided into 4 groups as follows: normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group, IGT group, newly diagnosed DM (NDM) group, and previously known DM (PDM) group. MACE of the 4 groups were compared for 2 years from AMI onset. The NDM group had a significantly higher event rate than the IGT and NGT groups and had a similar event rate curve to PDM group. The logistic models analyses revealed that 2 h post-load plasma glucose values of ≥160 mg/dL was the only independent predictor of long-term MACE after AMI (p = 0.028, OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.07-3.21).

Prompt primary percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with lower mortality. However, community hospitals in Japan lack human and medical resources, and implementation of the same strategies as those used in the USA, such as an on-call cardiologist at the hospital, to achieve a door-to-balloon time of ≤ 90 min appears particularly challenging. Therefore, we used Training for Effective and Efficient Action in Medical Service-Better Process (TEAMS-BP) to develop a new process and assessed its effectiveness in reducing door-to-balloon time. TEAMS-BP can optimize the process by making the best use of available materials, machines, facilities and manpower. All processes conducted by physicians, nurses, electrocardiogram technicians, radiological technologists, and clerical staff in the emergency room were reviewed, documented, and standardized using the four steps of TEAMS-BP. The following processes were implemented: setting time goals, calling an electrocardiogram technician beforehand, minimizing tasks before calling a cardiologist, confirming the checklist, and providing data feedback. Forty-four STEMI patients who were treated after TEAMS-BP implementation were compared with 58 who were treated before implementation. Median door-to-balloon, door-to-electrocardiogram and door-to-laboratory times were significantly reduced after TEAMS-BP implementation, decreasing from 106 to 82 min, 14 to 6 min, and 67 to 45 min, respectively. In conclusion, implementation of TEAMS-BP improved the door-to-balloon time of STEMI cases without additional resources or costs incurred by the hospital.

However, using an item response modeling framework, it is possible to create a decision-aligned response model that captures a clinician's decision-making behavior on a continuous scale that fully represents competing diagnostic possibilities. In this proof-of-concept study, the authors demonstrate the necessary statistical conceptualization of this model using a specific electrocardiogram (ECG) example. The authors collected a range of ECGs with elevated ST segments due to either ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or pericarditis. Based on pilot data, 20 ECGs were chosen to represent a continuum from \"definitely STEMI\" to \"definitely pericarditis,\" including intermediate cases in which the diagnosis was intentionally unclear. Emergency medicine and cardiology physicians rated these ECGs on a 5-point scale (\"definitely STEMI\" to \"definitely pericarditis\"). The authors analyzed these ratings using a graded response model showing the degree to which each participant could separate the ECGs along the diagnostic continuum. The authors compared these metrics with the discharge diagnoses noted on chart review. Thirty-seven participants rated the ECGs. As desired, the ECGs represented a range of phenotypes, including cases where participants were uncertain in their diagnosis. The response model showed that participants varied both in their propensity to diagnose one condition over another and in where they placed the thresholds between the 5 diagnostic categories. The most capable participants were able to meaningfully use all categories, with precise thresholds between categories. The authors present a decision-aligned response model that demonstrates the confusability of a particular ECG and the skill with which a clinician can distinguish 2 diagnoses along a continuum of confusability.

The use of tools designed to improve quality of care in the American College of Cardiology AMI Guidelines Applied in Practice Pilot Project resulted in improved adherence to evidence-based therapies for patients, but overall, tool use was modest. The current project, implemented in five hospitals, was modeled after the previous project, but with greater emphasis on tool use. This allowed early identification of barriers to tool use and strategies to overcome barriers. Main outcome measures were AMI quality indicators in pre-measurement (January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2001) and post-measurement (December 15, 2001 to March 31, 2002) samples. One or more tools were used in 93% of patients (standard orders = 82%, and discharge document = 47%). Tool use was associated with significantly higher adherence to most discharge quality indicator rates with increases in aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and smoking cessation and dietary counseling. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had low rates of discharge indicators. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization were more likely to receive evidence-based therapies. These data validate the results of the pilot project that quality of AMI care can be improved through the use of guideline-based tools. Identifying and overcoming barriers to tool use led to substantially higher rates of tool use. The low rates of adherence to quality indicators in patients undergoing CABG suggest that these patients should be particularly targeted for quality improvement efforts.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15193675/"}

Using records from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims database (2003-2015) and by obtaining the causes of death (Korean Statistical Information Service, 2006-2017), we analyzed the crude and age-standardized incidence rates from 2006 to 2015 and the case fatality rates from 2006 to 2017 of HD and its subtypes. Between 2006 and 2015, the incidence of overall HD changed minimally, but the age-standardized incidence of HD decreased from 210.0 persons per 100,000 populations in 2006 to 161.3 persons in 2015. However, incidence rates have increased in arrhythmia, HD other, pulmonary HD, and the case fatality rates have increased in HF, valvular HD, and HD other.

In 425 patients (mean age 68 +/- 15 years, 54% men) presenting to the emergency room with chest pain, we studied the relationship among aortic sclerosis, the presence and acuity of coronary artery disease, serologic markers of inflammation, and cardiovascular outcomes. Patients underwent echocardiography and serologic testing including C-reactive protein (CRP). Aortic valves were graded for the degree of sclerosis, and cardiovascular outcomes including cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) were analyzed over one year. Aortic sclerosis was identified in 203 patients (49%), whereas 212 (51%) had normal aortic valves. On univariate analysis at one year, patients with aortic sclerosis had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events (16.8% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.002) and worse event-free survival (normal valves = 93%, mild aortic sclerosis = 85%, and moderate to severe aortic sclerosis = 77%, p = 0.002).

In the 21st century these diseases will continue to dominate the disease spectrum and death statistics in both the industrialised and developing worlds. Since 1975 mortality from cardiovascular disease has decreased by about 24 to 28% in most countries. About 45% of this reduction can be attributed to an improvement in treatment of coronary heart disease and around 55% are attributable to a reduction in risk factors, in particular, stopping smoking and control of hypertension. However, especially in the case of ischaemic heart disease, it is not clear whether the reduction in mortality reflects a reduction in incidence of this disease. Due to the aging population and the reduction in age-related mortality, it is expected that the absolute number of people with heart disease will increase. Furthermore, the increase in prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes as well as the higher prevalence of female smokers compared with thirty years ago could result in an increase in mortality over the next years and decades. It has been shown that prevention strategies, such as education campaigns aimed at the general public, can potentially greatly contribute to a reduction in incidence of cardiovascular disease at every stage. In order for such campaigns to be effective, it is necessary to understand and reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of these risk factors are associated with lifestyle and are therefore modifiable. These modifiable risk factors include smoking, hypertension, poor diet, dyslipidemia, lack of exercise, overweight, adiposity and diabetes mellitus and optimisation of these should be a key aim for all adults. Gender differences also play a role in the incidence and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Incidence of myocardial infarction in women increases significantly after the menopause, and mortality through coronary heart disease is higher amongst women than men. Hormonal status, use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy all influence risk for cardiovascular disease in women. Due to the enormity of the problem that cardiovascular disease presents to society and the great potential for management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease through preventive medicine, a number of health promotion and prevention programmes have been initiated by various national and global organisations. This paper presents an analysis of modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease together with a review of targeted prevention programmes aiming at reducing these risks.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15287702/"}

The present study analyzed data from the China Acute Myocardial Infarction (CAMI) registry involving 23,825 consecutive AMI patients admitted to 108 hospitals from January 2013 to February 2018. Cardiac arrhythmias were defined as the presence of bradyarrhythmias, sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias, and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias that occurred during hospitalization. In-hospital outcome was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, cardiogenic shock, re-infarction, stroke, or heart failure. Cardiac arrhythmia was presented in 1991 (8.35%) AMI patients, including 3.4% ventricular tachyarrhythmias, 2.44% bradyarrhythmias, 1.78% atrial tachyarrhythmias, and 0.73% ≥2 kinds of arrhythmias. Patients with arrhythmias were more common with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (83.3% vs. 75.5%, P < 0.001), fibrinolysis (12.8% vs. 8.0%, P < 0.001), and previous heart failure (3.7% vs. 1.5%, P < 0.001).

It is therefore not surprising that complications of coronary artery disease are the most common causes of mortality following peripheral vascular operations. If the incidence of cardiac complications is to be reduced, it is first necessary to identify patients at risk through screening tests that will reliably detect hemodynamically important coronary occlusive disease. The operative risk can then be reduced by modifying the magnitude of the procedure, taking measures that can enhance the tolerance for a specific operation, or employing a combination of both. Screening methods in current use include risk factor analysis, exercise testing, routine coronary angiography, and dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy. The risk factor approach has the advantage of being widely applicable since it makes use of historical, physical, and electrocardiographic findings that are already familiar to surgeons and anesthesiologists. It is also inexpensive. However, it may overlook the patient who has no symptoms of coronary artery disease, possibly as a result of the sedentary lifestyle imposed by complications of peripheral vascular disease. The electrocardiographically monitored stress test will identify the asymptomatic patient with occult coronary disease and is helpful in predicting operative risk. However, a meaningful test is dependent on the patient's ability to exercise--an activity that is frequently limited by claudication, amputation, or arthritis. Exercise testing also suffers from a lack of sensitivity and specificity when compared with coronary arteriography. Routine preoperative coronary angiography overcomes the exercise limitation of treadmill testing but is not widely applicable as a screening test for reasons of cost and inherent risk. Dipyridamole thallium-201 scanning, on the other hand, is safe and of relatively low cost and does not require exercise. Further, it has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity when compared with coronary arteriography. It appears to be an accurate predictor of postoperative cardiac complications.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3952602/"}

We find that the total morbidity rate is significantly higher in the MI group (44%) than the Angina (15.7%), AF (18.8%), and HF (23.1%) groups (P < 0.01). Moreover, we note that the risk for postoperative cardiac problems is higher in patients with a history of HF (23.1%) than patients with a history of Angina (2.2%), AF (4.3%), or MI (6%; P = 0.01). The HF and MI groups each have 1 case of cardiogenic mortality. We conclude that MI patients have a higher risk of morbidity, and HF patients have a higher risk of postoperative cardiac problems than Angina or AF.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26074701/"}

We now know that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for women. Women and men share many similarities in the pathophysiology and manifestations of heart disease. However, as research advances with the continued inclusion of more women, knowledge about gender differences between the female and male heart, both on a physiological and pathophysiological basis, grows. These differences can be found in all domains of cardiovascular health and disease, including heart rhythm, heart failure, coronary disease and valvular disease. Further understanding of gender differences in the heart is crucial for advancing our ability to maintain a healthy population and identify and treat heart disease in both women and men. Specific examples within the spectrum of heart disease will be discussed in this review paper, and areas for further research will be proposed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26957643/"}

CAP, considered by many to be the most underestimated disease worldwide, poses a particular threat to the elderly whose numbers are steadily increasing in developed countries. Indeed, elderly patients with severe CAP, as well as those with other risk factors, are at significant risk for development of inflammation-mediated acute cardiac events that may undermine the success of antimicrobial therapy. Adjunctive antiinflammatory strategies are, therefore, of considerable potential benefit in this setting. Currently, the most promising of these are the macrolides, corticosteroids, and, more recently, statins, all of which target immune/inflammatory cells. In addition, recent insights into the immunopathogenesis of acute coronary events in patients with CAP have revealed a probable pivotal role of platelet activation, potentially modifiable by agents that possess antiinflammatory or platelet-targeted activities or both. Statins, which not only possess antiinflammatory activity but also appear to target several pathways involved in platelet activation, seem particularly well suited as adjuncts to antibiotic therapy in bacterial CAP. Following a brief consideration of the immunopathogenesis of bacterial CAP, this review is focused on mechanisms of platelet activation by CAP pathogens, as well as the pharmacologic control thereof, with emphasis on statins.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25951315/"}

Cannulating the radial artery can be one of the most challenging aspects of the radial approach. Ultrasound-guided vascular access may be a method to improve first-attempt success rates and shorten time to radial artery access. Fifty consecutive patients underwent ultrasound-guided radial artery access (UGRAA) by a senior interventional cardiologist with little prior experience with UGRAA. The operator had 20 run-in cases before enrolling subjects. Time to establish access and number of attempts required for each patient were recorded. Ultrasound was also used to measure radial arterial diameter and the distance between the skin and the anterior wall of the radial artery. All patients had successful UGRAA, 80% on the first attempt and 92% on the first or second attempt. The median time for access was 35 seconds, with an interquartile range of 31-55 seconds. UGRAA improved first-attempt success rates and shortened the time needed for radial artery cannulation when compared to historical data of palpation-directed radial artery access. A large randomized trial of palpation versus UGRAA will be required to confirm this finding. Furthermore, this technique is easy to learn and incorporate into everyday practice in the cardiac catheterization lab.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24296389/"}

A Mendelian randomisation study.", "text": "Protein C is an environmentally modifiable anticoagulant, which protects against venous thrombosis, whether it also protects against ischaemic heart disease is unclear, based on observational studies and relatively small genetic studies. It was our study aim to clarify the role of protein C in ischaemic heart disease. The risk of coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (CAD/MI) was assessed according to genetically predicted protein C in very large studies. Associations with lipids and diabetes were similarly assessed to rule out effects via traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Separate sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments (Mendelian randomisation) was used to obtain an unconfounded estimate of the association of protein C (based on (rs867186 (PROCR), rs3746429 (EDEM2), rs7580658 (inter/PROC)) with CAD/MI in an extensively genotyped case (n=64374)-control (n=130681) study, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D. Associations with lipids and diabetes were similarly assessed using the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n=196,475) and the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis case (n=34,380)-control (n=114,981) study. Genetically predicted protein C was negatively associated with CAD/MI, odds ratio (OR) 0.85 µg/ml, 95 % confidence interval 0.80 to 0.90, but had no such negative association with lipids or diabetes. Results were similar for the SNP rs867186 functionally relevant to protein C, and including additional potentially pleiotropic SNPs (rs1260326 (GCKR), rs17145713 (BAZ1B) and rs4321325 (CYP27C1)). In conclusion, protein C may protect against CAD/MI.

The register used current World Health Organisation criteria for definite or possible coronary heart disease and identified all suspected events in people aged less than 65 years for the years 1983 and 1984. During this period 768 coronary heart disease cases were included in the register and in the same population 772 death certificates were coded 410-414 (coronary heart disease), according to the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, by the National Health Statistics Centre. Ninety one percent of deaths meeting the register's criteria for definite or possible coronary heart disease were coded 410-414 in the official data. Conversely of all death certificates coded 410-414, 93% were registered as due to coronary heart disease. The validity of subcategories was considerably lower; only 49% of deaths coded 410 (acute myocardial infarction) were categorised as definite myocardial infarction by the register. These findings suggest that the broad official statistics for the category coronary heart disease mortality (codes 410-414) are accurate to within approximately 10% in New Zealand; the validity of the subcategory myocardial infarction (code 410) is considerably lower.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3186004/"}

We determined the clinical implications of angio-based coronary functional assessment in evaluation of suboptimal perfusion and further outcomes among STEMI patients after successful PPCI. In this study, STEMI patients in the Chinese STEMI PPCI registry trial (NCT04996901) who achieved post-PPCI thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow were retrospectively screened. Post-procedural quantitative flow ratio (QFR), angio-based microvascular resistance (AMR), and coronary flow velocity (CFV) of the infarct-related artery were calculated. QFR and AMR measure epicardial stenosis severity and microvascular resistance, respectively. QFR+ was defined as QFR < 0.90 while QFR- was QFR ≥ 0.90. AMR+ was defined as AMR ≥ 250 mmHg*s/m while AMR- was AMR < 250 mmHg*s/m. The primary outcome was 30-day new-onset HF. The Kaplan-Meier curves were used to establish the associations between QFR, AMR, CFV, and HF incidences. The relationship between CFV and combined QFR and AMR indices was further assessed. Independent predictors were determined using Cox regression analysis. The receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to assess discriminant ability to predict HF. A total of 942 patients (mean age was 57.8 ± 11.7 years and 84.6% were men) were enrolled. Among them, 129 patients had new-onset HF episodes. Patients in the QFR-/AMR- group had a low risk of HF compared with those in the QFR+/AMR+ group (10.5% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.027). A higher CFV ≥ 17.4 cm/s was associated with low HF incidences as compared with CFV < 17.4 cm/s (10.3% vs. 16.8%, P = 0.005), whereas isolated QFR or AMR did not reveal any marked differences in HF incidences (P = 0.150 and 0.079, respectively). The highest and lowest medians of CFV were observed in the QFR-/AMR- and QFR+/AMR+ groups, respectively. CFV correlated well with the QFR/AMR ratio (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>  = 1, P < 0.001) and post-PPCI CFV was found to be an independent predictor of post-STEMI HF (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.90, P = 0.012). The area under curve estimate of the multivariable regression model was 0.749. CFV is an integrated coronary physiological assessment approach that incorporates epicardial and microcirculatory contributions. Patients with post-PPCI CFV < 17.4 cm/s were strongly associated with a high risk for post-STEMI HF, even achieving thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow.

The objective of this study is to establish the contemporary incidence of LVT in this population, to identify their risk factors, and to examine their association with clinical outcomes. A multicenter retrospective cohort study including AMI patients with new-onset antero-apical wall motion abnormalities treated with pPCI between 2009 and 2017 was conducted. The primary outcome was LVT during the index hospitalization. Predictors of LVT were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Net adverse clinical events (NACE), a composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, systemic thromboembolism or BARC type 3 or 5 bleeding at 6 months were compared between the LVT and no LVT groups. Among the 2136 patients included, 83 (3.9%) patients developed a LVT during index hospitalization. A lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.97; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.94-0.99] and the degree of worse anterior WMA (aOR 4.34; 95% CI 2.24-8.40) were independent predictors of LVT. A NACE occurred in 5 (5.72 per 100 patient-year) patients in the LVT group and in 127 (6.71 per 100 patient-year) patients in the no LVT group at 6 months [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.87; 95% CI 0.35-2.14].
