This article will review the most promising up and coming interventional cardiovascular therapies, with a primary focus on the treatment of coronary artery disease. From the first stent, to the first transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and the left appendage closure technique, percutaneous interventions revolutionized the treatment of multiple diseases and dramatically improved the prognosis of many patients. While these advances have decreased the risk of mortality in some patients (such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction), 15% of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients still experience recurrent ischemic events within the first year, challenging us to develop new pharmaceutical targets and new devices. The continued emergence of data supporting inflammation as a risk factor and pharmacologic target as well as data supporting the importance of cholesterol efflux have identified novel therapeutic targets that may play a major role in the improvement of prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. In addition, novel medical devices are being developed to allow even earlier detection of acute cardiac events and to support high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions. Advances in computing and the ability to analyze large datasets will allow us to use artificial intelligence to augment the clinician patient experience, both in and out of the catheterization laboratory, with live procedural guidance as well as pre- and post-operative prognostication tools.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30868280/"}

In patients with cardiac arrest secondary to NSTEMI, another article examines the rationale for expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest center. The STREAM-2 (Strategic Reperfusion in Elderly Patients Early After Myocardial Infarction) trial builds on looking at half-dose thrombolysis in older populations with STEMI. Emphasis is placed on guideline-directed medical therapy before hospital discharge in those with heart failure. In addition, in patients with stable symptomatic coronary artery disease, initial noninvasive testing using coronary computed tomography angiography may be a viable option compared with invasive strategies.

The council chose five areas on which to focus their efforts; chest pain, Kawasaki Disease, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries after arterial switch, and infection prevention. Here, we sought to describe the process, evaluation, and results of the Infection Prevention Committee's metric design process. The infection prevention metrics team consisted of 12 members from 11 institutions in North America. The group agreed to work on specific infection prevention topics including antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and asplenia/hyposplenism; influenza vaccination and respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis (palivizumab); preoperative methods to reduce intraoperative infections; vaccinations after cardiopulmonary bypass; hand hygiene; and testing to identify splenic function in patients with heterotaxy. An extensive literature review was performed. When available, previously published guidelines were used fully in determining metrics. The committee chose eight metrics to submit to the ACC Quality Metric Expert Panel for review. Ultimately, metrics regarding hand hygiene and influenza vaccination recommendation for patients did not pass the RAND analysis. Both endocarditis prophylaxis metrics and the RSV/palivizumab metric passed the RAND analysis but fell out during the open comment period. Three metrics passed all analyses, including those for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with heterotaxy/asplenia, for influenza vaccination compliance in healthcare personnel, and for adherence to recommended regimens of secondary prevention of rheumatic fever. The lack of convincing data to guide quality improvement initiatives in pediatric cardiology is widespread, particularly in infection prevention.

The costs and barriers with COCATS standards and board certification processes are not insignificant, however the degree to which the job marketplace demands them has not been well characterized. The intent of this investigation study was to estimate the demand for COCATS standards and board certification in cardiology job advertisements. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of job listings on the American College of Cardiology's \"Cardiology Careers\" page, to establish how often advanced COCATS standards and certifications are requested. Of a total of 314 total cardiology job postings (including 133 academic positions), only eight (2.5%) job postings explicitly noted COCATS standards. Aside from American Board of Internal Medicine subspecialty certification, only 8.60% required certification in another cardiology related board certification. Despite the perception that COCATS standards and subspecialty certifications are vital to the cardiology job application process, our analysis suggests that few job postings require them.

Prior reviews published in 2013 have shown that adjusting for confounding is poorly done, if done at all. Although these reviews raised awareness on the issues, it is unclear if their results improved the methodological quality of future work. We therefore aimed to investigate whether and how confounding was accounted for in recently published observational economic evaluations in the field of cardiology. <b>Methods.</b> We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases using a set of Medical Subject Headings and keywords covering topics in \"observational economic evaluations in health within humans\" and \"cardiovascular diseases.\" Any study published in either English or French between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, addressing our search criteria was eligible for inclusion in our review.

Therapies harnessing the immune system have been associated with an immune-mediated myocardial injury described as myocarditis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are one such therapy with an increasing number of case and cohort reports describing a clinical syndrome of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis. Although the full spectrum of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated cardiovascular disease still needs to be fully defined, described cases of myocarditis range from syndromes with mild signs and symptoms to fatal events. These observations in the clinical setting stand in contrast to outcomes from randomized clinical trials in which myocarditis is a rare event that is investigator reported and lacking in a specific case definition. The complexities associated with diagnosis, as well as the heterogeneous clinical presentation of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis, have made ascertainment and identification of myocarditis with high specificity challenging in clinical trials and other data sets, limiting the ability to better understand the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of these rare events. Therefore, establishing a uniform definition of myocarditis for application in clinical trials of cancer immunotherapies will enable greater understanding of these events. We propose an operational definition of cancer therapy-associated myocarditis that may facilitate case ascertainment and report and therefore may enhance the understanding of the incidence, outcomes, and risk factors of this novel clinical syndrome.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31390169/"}

Validated techniques (such as aortic or pulmonary valve dilatations and occlusion of persistent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects) are improving thanks to the use of smaller introducers and sheaths, low-profile balloons and novel devices. Moreover, catheter-based interventions have emerged as an attractive alternative to surgery in other fields: pulmonary valve replacement, balloon and stent implantation for native and recurrent coarctation, and percutaneous closure of ventricular septal defects. On the other hand, percutaneous interventions in the paediatric population may be limited by patient size or the anatomy of the defect. Hybrid approaches involving both cardiac interventionists and surgeons are being developed to overcome these limitations. Based on a better understanding of cardiac development, fetal cardiac interventions are being attempted in order to alter the history of severe obstructive lesions. Finally, some interventional procedures still carry a low success rate-for example, pulmonary vein stenosis, even with the use of conventional stents. Biodegradable stents and devices are being developed and may find an application in this setting as well as in others. The purpose of this review is to highlight the advances in paediatric interventional cardiology since the beginning of the third millennium.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19664577/"}

The discussion encompasses: (1) the association between SB and mortality, with a specific focus on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes; (2) biological mechanisms that link SB to CV health, additionally differentiating between the effects of acute and chronic sitting; (3) sex and gender differences in SB; and (4) SB as an independent CV risk factor is explored. The review concludes with an examination of the potential beneficial effects of PA on mitigating the detrimental effects of SB and an analysis of evidence that supports the use of break-up strategies in preventive cardiology. This analysis sheds light on the significant deleterious consequences of SB on CV health. It highlights the potential of incorporating strategies to reduce and interrupt prolonged sitting alongside existing guidelines that promote PA. These findings suggest considering SB as a major CV risk factor, and emphasize the importance of targeting SB reduction and interruption as a valuable approach for preventing and managing CV disease. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of SB interventions, to inform the development of optimal guidelines for CV health management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39709014/"}

Good clinical practices and safety conditions are better defined regarding the structure, location, material, staff competency, as well as convention with hospital structures. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease remains the principal indication for a stress test. Interpretation of the results is crucial - it must be multivariate and provide either a low, intermediate or strong probability of the existence of coronary lesions, taking into account the studied population (risk factors, age, sex and symptoms). We no longer have to talk about a \"positive, negative or litigious\" test. Several new indications for a stress test have been defined for the assessment of cardiac pathologies. With such indications, the use of gas expiration measurements is highly recommended in order to provide a precise prognosis for all the various cardiac pathologies : congenital, ischemic, valvular, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, rhythm and conduction disorders, pacemaker fine-tuning, or pulmonary hypertension. Indications for stress tests and contraindications are defined according to different population subgroups, for instance : athletes, women, children, the elderly, asymptomatic patients, diabetics, hypertensive patients, peripheral arteritis disease patients, or in the context of a non-cardiac surgery pre-op visit. The new guidelines are considerably different from those dating from 1997 and further pinpoint the relevance and importance of an EKG stress test within the arsenal of complementary cardiologic exams. With the improvements made in providing diagnostic value in CAD, as well as better prognostic value for any underlying pathology, the indication for an EKG stress test has extended to all cardiovascular disease.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31679896/"}

However, abnormalities of intracardial blood flow, notably shunts and regurgitations, could only be diagnosed indirectly from their effects on cardiac cavities. A new step forward was the advent of pulsed and continuous doppler ultrasound, since from that moment it has been possible to demonstrate abnormal blood flows, to measure their velocity and to determine, albeit with some reservation, such crucial values as pressure gradients. Yet even when these two techniques were combined in the doppler-echotomography systems blind areas persisted, and a blood flow of strongly abnormal direction could in fact escape doppler velocimetry. This is where another development came to the rescue, for it enabled both normal and abnormal flows to be visualized in colours. Owing to this visualization, and provided all possible projections are used, it has become exceptional to \"miss\" an abnormal blood flow. The diagnosis is now easier and more accurate, and in a second stage the flow can be quantified by pulsed or continuous doppler ultrasound.

The performance score ranged from a median of 31 (ISQ=40.5) to a median of 120 (ISQ=19.7), (p=0.001). The competence score for coronary angiography improved significantly, from a median of 16 (ISQ=18) to a median of 70 (ISQ=6), (p=0.001). The competence score for angioplasty improved significantly from a median of 10 (ISQ=17) to a median of 50 (ISQ=13.7), p=0.001. Procedure time of coronary angiography and angioplasty were significantly shortened from 12 min (ISQ=2) to 7 min (ISQ=1) after the simulation cycle (p=0.001), and from a median of 19 min to a median of 17 min after simulation, p=0.002. despite a short-time simulation training, our pilot study demonstrates a significant improvement in the learners´ skills and performance, as well as a reduction in the time taken to carry out procedures and irradiation. This could eventually increase the number of procedures carried out daily in our cathlab and limit radiation exposure of staff and patients, while ensuring that the learners receive adequate training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38465004/"}
{"id": "7702422", "title": "[Ethics and cardiology].", "text": "The multiplication of therapeutic protocols and progressively more complex procedures, and the development of invasive procedures of interventional cardiology, have made ethics all the more important in cardiology. They should be prominent in the field of research where the primary objective is improvement of the health of the individual without abusing the dignity of the human person. The Huriet-Serusclat law of the December 20th 1988 was formulated in this spirit. However, ethics also intervene in clinical cardiological practice which should provide patients with the best treatment whilst avoiding technological excesses. Moreover, economical considerations constitute a true ethical challenge. Each individual should have access to quality health care without financial difficulties being an obstacle to this right. This equality necessitates a rational use of available resources and the taking into account of the collective interest. As an aid to decision and a barrier of protection, ethics imply constant reflection in order to supply patients with the best treatment without ignoring the interests of society.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7702422/"}

An analysis was carried out on the results obtained from a specifically designed questionnaire, prepared by the Spanish Society of Paediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart disease, that was sent to all hospitals around the country that offer the speciality of paediatric cardiology. A total of 86 questionnaires were obtained, including 14 hospitals that perform cardiac surgery on children. A total of 190 paediatric cardiology consultants, 40 cardiac surgeons, and 27 middle grade doctors performing their paediatric residency (MIR program) were identified. All hospitals had adequate equipment to perform an optimal initial evaluation of any child with a possible cardiac abnormality, but only tertiary centres could perform complex diagnostic procedures, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgery. In almost all units around the country, paediatric cardiology consultants were responsible for outpatient clinics and hospital admissions, whereas foetal cardiology units were still mainly managed by obstetricians. The number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was similar to those reported in the first survey, except for a slight decrease in the total number of closed cardiac surgery procedures, and a proportional increase in the number of therapeutic catheterisations. Paediatric Cardiology in Spain is performed by paediatric cardiology consultants that were trained initially as general paediatricians, and then completed a paediatric cardiology training period. Almost all units have adequate means for diagnosis and treatment. Efforts should be directed to create a national registry that would not only allow a prospective quantification of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, but also focus on their clinical outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29706438/"}

Dr. Manuel Carpio, the future first head of department of physiology in this school, translated to Spanish language and published, in 1823, the article On pectoriloquo of the French physician Marat and later performed some experiments on the heart' motion. During the Secont Empire (1864-1867), the physician Samuel von Basch performed studies to define the arterial hypertension, called by him \"latent atherosclerosis\", i.e. the \"essential hypertension\". Once he had returned to his country, he invented in 1880, a sphygmomanometer of mercury column, that was the model for the instrument constructed by the Italian physician Scipione Riva-Rocci and presented in 1896. In our time, Dr. Demetrio Sodi Pallares systematized a metabolic therapy called \"polarizing therapy\", i.e. capable of repolarizing the heart's cells partly depolarized due to hypoxia or direct aggressions.

To achieve this goal, a search for a gold standard of the different techniques of general interventional practice was carried out, and predictors of postprocedural outcome were analyzed, as well as their relation with different kinds of circumstances. This analysis identified coronary angioplasty as the standard on which recommendations regarding competence in overall interventional cardiology standards of quality and assessment and maintenance of proficiency must be based. On the other hand, the strong influence of experience and knowledge of results has been documented, especially in high-risk or high-complexity settings. On this basis, the report establishes specific recommendations about proficiency for practice and advanced training.

The most important apparatus was the kymograph, which, for the first time, made recording and documenting of functional parameters possible. This instrument was also used for the functional evaluation of the isolated perfused frog heart that was developed by Elias Cyon in Ludwig's Leipzig Physiological Institute. In the isolated frog heart, important phenomena were discovered such as the staircase ('Treppe'), the absolute refractory period and the all-or-none law of the heart. The isolated dog heart was used to determine the origin of the first heart sound, which was characterized as a muscle tone. To measure regional blood flow and eventually cardiac output, a flowmeter ('Stromuhr') was designed. Precise measurements of cardiac output became possible only when Adolf Fick had developed his principle, which served as the basis for the modern indicator methods. Cyon and Ludwig also discoverd the depressor nerve, which constitutes the basis of the baroreceptor reflex. Finally, the precise localization of the vasomotor centre in the ventrolateral medulla was achieved in Ludwig's Leipzig Physiological Institute. This was confirmed more than 100 years later with modern neuroanatomical methods making use of retrograde axonal transport. Thus, Ludwig and his scholars made major substantial contributions to cardiovascular knowledge that can be considered to constitute the basis of modern cardiology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10202196/"}

These improvements have enabled earlier and more precise diagnosis, assessment of the proper timing of surgical and interventional procedures, improved prosthetic and biologic valve replacements and repairs, recognition of postoperative complications and their management, and the introduction of minimally invasive approaches that have enabled definitive and durable treatment for patients who were previously considered inoperable. This review summarizes the current state of our understanding of the mechanisms of heart valve health and disease arrived at through innovative research on the cell and molecular biology of valves, clinical and pathological features of the most frequent intrinsic structural diseases that affect the valves, and the status and pathological considerations in the technological advances in valvular surgery and interventions.

Up to 15% of ambulatory patients with HF are affected and present with a loss of different tissue types including muscle mass. Whilst cardiac cachexia has long been a neglected clinical entity, current HF guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) include a section on weight management in patients with HF at risk of cardiac cachexia. This article highlights some recent studies of metabolic and functional alterations of the muscle in HF that were presented at the annual meeting of the ESC in August 2012 in Munich, Germany. The studies presented were focused on dysfunction of respiratory and limb skeletal musculature as well as metabolic features of myocardium in HF. Strategies improving muscle function and peak oxygen consumption in HF such as (inspiratory) muscle training and treatment of central sleep apnea by adaptive servoventilation are described. The latter shows promising results regarding HF symptoms and exercise capacity but still has to prove survival benefits in larger trials. A rat model highlights the value of microRNAs to regulate exercise-induced skeletal muscle angiogenesis. Another study provides evidence for changes in substrate utilisation depending on the functional status of mitochondria in the failing heart and points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mediator of metabolic remodelling. Though treatments remain to be established, these findings may pave the way for effective therapeutic approaches to altered muscle function and cardiac cachexia.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23121913/"}

The survey identified practice patterns including personnel, volumes, protocols used, and laboratory characteristics. We employed random sampling methodology stratified geographically. The response rate was 19.5% (73/374 laboratories). A non-random survey conducted in 2001 of 25 laboratories served as a comparator. A total of 73 laboratories, representing 202 physicians and 177 technologists responded. The reported median procedural volume was 1,225 studies annually; 88.9% of laboratories were accredited. Compared with 2001, dual isotope imaging protocol use dropped from 72% to 15.6%. Five markers of quality were surveyed. Half of laboratories use the American College of Cardiology's Appropriate Use Criteria, 61% used segmental scoring, and 32% provided guidance on post-test therapeutic management. 89% perform catheterization correlations while only 33% implemented radiation dose tracking.

The Pan-African Society of Cardiology (PASCAR) collected data on invasive management of cardiac arrhythmias from 2011 to 2016 from 31 African countries. A specific template was completed by physicians, and additional information obtained from industry. Information on health care systems, demographics, economics, procedure rates, and specific training programs was collected. Considerable heterogeneity in the access to arrhythmia care was observed across Africa. Eight of the 31 countries surveyed (26%) did not perform pacemaker implantations. The median pacemaker implantation rate was 2.66 per million population per country (range: 0.14-233 per million population). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy were performed in 12/31 (39%) and 15/31 (48%) countries respectively, mostly by visiting teams. Electrophysiological studies, including complex catheter ablations were performed in all countries from Maghreb, but only one sub-Saharan African country (South Africa). Marked variation in cost (up to 1000-fold) was observed across countries with an inverse correlation between implant rates and the procedure fees standardized to the gross domestic product per capita. Lack of economic resources and facilities, high cost of procedures, deficiency of trained physicians, and non-existent fellowship programs were the main drivers of under-utilization of interventional cardiac arrhythmia care. There is limited access to CIED and ablation procedures in Africa. A quarter of countries did not have pacemaker implantation services, and catheter ablations were only available in one country in sub-Saharan Africa.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29309556/"}

Such improvement in patient outcome may be partly attributed to interventional cardiology procedures. However, these encouraging results are not uniformly observed in men and women and the rate of cardiovascular mortality in female patients remains unchanged. A number of studies have shown a poorer outcome in women with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Several reasons may explain the difference in post-PCI outcome between men and women. More advanced age and higher percentage of diabetics are documented clinical factors. Other angiographic factors such as vessel size, smaller in the female population, may also account for such a difference. Finally, the occurrence of vascular complications is one of the reasons affecting the outcome of female patients. The radial vascular approach contributes to the reduction in the incidence of complications which may compromise survival. This vascular route may be more complex in the female population because of the size of the radial artery which is smaller than in men. Nevertheless, the transradial approach is very safe and efficient in experienced hands and it is probably one of the techniques which may help close the prognosis gap between men and women undergoing PCI.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883902/"}

In the latter context, a close collaboration has been established since 1996 between the regional hospital of Rodez in the Aveyron region and the University Hospital of Toulouse for cases of coronary artery disease and/or valvular heart disease. The coronary angiogrammes are sent by a digitized network at a high speed of 384 Kbits/sec, providing a quality of dynamic imaging which is adequate for validating a therapeutic decision. The patient is therefore at the centre of a network of heath care, the object of which is optimal diagnosis and management.

Even as the patient population with CVD grows increasingly diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, age, and sex, many cardiologists and other health care providers are unaware of the negative influence of disparate care on CVD outcomes and do not have the tools needed to improve care and outcomes for patients from different demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Reviewed published reports assessed the need for redressing CVD disparities and the evidence concerning interventions that can assist cardiology care providers in improving care and outcomes for diverse CVD patient populations. Evidence points to the effectiveness of performance measure-based quality improvement, provider cultural competency training, team-based care, and patient education as strategies to promote the elimination of disparate CVD care and in turn might lead to better outcomes. credo has launched several initiatives built on these evidence-based principles and will be expanding these tools along with research. credo will provide the CVD treatment community with greater awareness of disparities and tools to help close the gap in care and outcomes for all patient subpopulations.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21232662/"}

Evidence will be based on a proposed undue negativity by cardiology to a radical hypothesis I first described two and a half decades ago--the spasm of resistance vessel (S-RV) concept of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The theory is regarded as an alternate paradigm and deals with basic pathogenetic mechanisms of IHD, the most significant disorder of Western civilization. The concept, if valid, might help in reducing the impact of this disorder, and I believe that the evidence for the theory and the importance of IHD support a more open minded attitude toward the idea. Cardiology's negativity is attributed to the nature of research; the most important factor is considered to be the Kuhnian negativity of scientific communities to hypotheses which are destructive of conventional wisdom, and a second factor is the special nature of biomedical research. Biomedicine is regarded as special because a low level of specific information about complex biomedical processes has fostered an essentially total study-based approach. Such an approach is assumed to have resulted in biomedicine's use of induction as 'the' method of scientific inquiry, and prompted negativity towards the hypothetico-deductive method used to develop and test the theory. Also, the study-based nature of biomedicine appears to have fostered an intuitive reliance on only newly performed studies to test hypotheses, which led to ignoring evidence for the concept derived from known information about IHD. Biomedicine is also regarded as special because its infrequent use of paradigm-change has resulted in unfamiliarity with this method, and because the practical method of training in biomedical research has worsened the general unfamiliarity of scientists with theoretical aspects of science. Because of these factors, the S-RV concept has not yet been properly evaluated--a quarter of a century after it was first created.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8231972/"}

The results of the 2000 inquiry have been analysed in particular. The number of coronarography centres has increased by 27% in 10 years, growing from 173 in 1991 to stabilise at 220, and the number of centres performing percutaneous coronary angioplasty grew from 128 to 175 (+27%) at the same time. The number of coronarographies increased by 79% (131,636 to 236,111), and angioplasties increased by 197% (30,885 to 91,901). In the year 2000, angiographic procedures represented 39% of coronarographies, against 23% in 1991. Endoprosthesis implantation constitutes the principal revolution of this decade, the number of procedures growing from 393 to 77,388 between 1991 and 2000, some 84.2% of angioplasties, and a total number of endoprostheses of 107,869 (1.39 stents per procedure). The other revascularisation techniques remain anecdotal, representing only 1.9% of procedures. In 2000, at the 135 centres supplying detailed information, direct stenting represented 38.5% of procedures, and the indications for restenosis were 9.9%. The number of interventions performed in the public or private sector is almost identical for each category, only morphological or functional explorations remain the privilege of the public sector in the university setting. The activity of the University Hospitals Centres has noticeably and regularly decreased since 1991, falling from 39.2% to 28.7% of coronarographies and from 41.8% to 31.1% of angioplasties in 2000.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12611039/"}

The most current diagnostic methods were relatively scarce at the time-ECG, chest X ray, phonocardiography, pulse wave tracings, coupled with vectorcardiography and ballistocardiography, but in the well equipped hospitals right ventricular catheterization was already performed. The therapeutics of the important morbid situations-like congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction and ischemia was disappointing, but closed heart surgery was already taking place. Since then, things had changed suddenly. Over the last 40 years a marked scientific and technology explosion has emerged, that had benefited cardiology science, encompassing several broad areas, namely, patient approaching, pathophysiology understanding, the emergence of new drugs and clinical use, interventional cardiology and remarkable progress in open heart surgery. Imaging techniques development and other technology lead to a simple and accurate cardiac diagnosis. 24 hours ECG and blood pressure recording, and cardiac output measurement, greatly improves our medical knowledge. Computers development, representing the most significant technology advances, has given to cardiology non-predicted advances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2206585/"}

Thus, expenditure for the health system represents one of the most important items of the national balance. Nowadays, the optimal management of health organization is essential. In addition, patients expect hospitals to provide more and more effective and efficient cures. With respect to this need, in order to achieve high standard of health cure, the identification of work and the time that the medical departments dedicate to a specific therapeutic and/or diagnostic procedure represent a fundamental tool for the optimal management of patients. However, to provide reliable results, these data should be collected in the largest number of structures possible. For this purpose, 17 departments of cardiology have organized a network with the goal of creating the most important data base on this matter available in Italy. The evaluation of the data obtained (more than 8000 medical procedures) allows us to identify the resources normally used for curing patients admitted to cardiological departments. These provide an extensive view of the work load in the Public Health Services fundamental to implementing a health service in accordance with the criteria of Total Quality Management. The present paper illustrates the scope of this study and the methods used to create the data base.

The purpose of this study was to determine residents' perception of the consequences of WHR on their training, well-being and patient care. A self-administered survey was e-mailed to all French cardiology residents (n=413)in June 2007.186 (45%) returned the questionnaire. Most residents reported spending less time in the hospital but did not believe they missed educational experiences. On the contrary they feel more receptive to learning and use some of the extra time out of the hospital for reading medical literature. Overall, WHR do not influence residents' satisfaction with their training (P>0.05). Residents believe that patient care has been unaffected or maybe improved: 75% declare they are less likely to make errors due to fatigue and 58% never cut corners in patient care after their night call. However, residents' perception of their commitment to patient care may not reflect reality: indeed, 78% of residents feel that attendings believe commitment was higher before the implementation of WHR. Finally, residents report that WHR had a positive effect on their well-being, feeling less exhausted and less under pressure. Overall, 83% of residents consider that consequences of WHR are beneficial for the patient. Cardiology residents report that implementation of WHR lead to benefits to their well-being and probably patient care, without negative effects on their education.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18672668/"}

To assess more thoroughly the characteristics of Italian clinical cardiological research we examined, over the period 1983-1993, all original articles published by five important international cardiology journals (Circulation, American Heart Journal, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of the American College of Cardiology and European Heart Journal). During the mentioned period the Italian contribution (743 articles over a total of 16375, mean prevalence of 4.5%) has increased from 3% in 1983-1985 to 5.8% in 1991-1993 (p < 0.0001). Taking into account that research often results from the joint-work of different centers, the 743 articles derived from 1056 contributions from just over 120 centers. Of these contributions 57% were from universities, 23% from hospitals, 19% from research institutes, and 1% from private foundations. The cooperation with foreign countries has steadily increased, particularly with the USA (45%) and with the European nations (42%). Within the first three names, the contribution of female Authors has increased from 7% in 1983-1985 to 16% in 1991-1993 (p = 0.0001). The mean prevalence of female Authors as last name was 4% and did not change with time. As to geographic distribution, 57% of the scientific publications comes from the North, 28% from the Centre, and 15% from the South. After adjusting these data for population size, the percentages were respectively 40, 46, and 14%. An index of productivity (the ratio between the number of scientific contributions from universities and research institutes and their funding) was highest in the North. The Italian scientific contribution to international cardiological research is not satisfactory, although it is significantly increasing; yet, this trend might worsen due to the shortage of funding. The collected data outline that in the three main national geographic areas, the distribution of funds and scientific productivity are markedly unbalanced.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289368/"}

Data merging from national centres was completed in the common server and after proper data integration in the common database; a comparison was performed between French and Italian populations. Standardization of contents allowed for 89% overall interoperability (merged fields) to be achieved with only 11% divergent fields. All (100%) merged homogeneous data on the first 2717 patients from peripheral centres were selected consecutively from the common database and analysed successfully.

An example of intervention in the cardiology field and considerations on \"total quality\" in medicine].", "text": "The Cardiology Unit of the Este General Hospital began its activity in 1988. We soon identified a mismatch between a good, up-to-date diagnostic instrumentation with growing customers' demand and an inadequate utilization of the instruments. Waiting lists were getting longer, customers were not satisfied, no-shows at the appointments increased and we had a progressive loss in image. We therefore decided to intervene on our processes, starting the project \"TOTAL QUALITY IN CARDIOLOGY\". We focused our attention on two main fields, namely (1) electrocardiography, (2) other diagnostic techniques, separately analyzed because of important differences. Point (1) is basically worked out by paramedical personnel, in high numbers and with stable demand, while point (2) is determinantly linked to medical activity, although with concomitant need for paramedical support. The figures are lower for point (2) but are steadily growing. In the two operating fields we further identified two separate adverse effects: 1). ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS (ECG) ARE TOO TIME CONSUMING, 2) THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES IS TOO LOW FOR THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE. We used preliminary analysis with process flow diagrams and our interventional methods were policy deployment and daily routine work. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS ARE TOO TIME CONSUMING. From cause-effect diagram for cause classification and subsequent Pareto analysis we identified two groups of main causes: 1. the paramedical-patient team is not able to optimise usage of the instrument; in particular, total time for undressing of the patient, lead attachment, dressing of the patient, change in ECG conductivity cream and, if necessary, repetition of ECG for mistakes in procedure is much longer than operative time of the instrument; 2. the necessary copy of the ECG done by the instrument was too time consuming (2') as compared to total procedure time. Implementation plans have been as follows: activity was concentrated in one single room at constant temperature (20 degrees); we augmented the number of dressing rooms and nurses (from 1 to 2 unit); we substituted the ECG conductivity cream with a water-alcoholic solution and the copy with a photocopy. decrease in mean time for ECG from 6'52\" to 3'25\" (for example: total ECGs 1992: 14,827, total spared time: 852 working hours); reductions in dead times; capability to cope rapidly with high demand; consequent possibility to utilise paramedical personnel for other activities; reduction in copy costs from 156 to 50 Lit each (total reduction 1,571,662 Lit). EXPECTATIONS. further revision of the procedures to keep pace with new electrocardiographic instruments and to achieve shorter operative times.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7557035/"}

In the context of this evolution, a functional reorganization of CICUs in Italy has to be implemented in order to meet the changing needs of the population with cardiovascular disease requiring critical care. Therefore, the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) proposes this position paper for the reorganization of CICUs into three levels with increasing functional complexity, based on the hospital characteristics, the available technology, and clinical cases treated. The system would be functionally integrated into a regional CICU organization modeled on a time-dependent care network. This proposed network aims to standardize diagnostic and therapeutic protocols and establish unified data collection registries to facilitate self-assessment and support clinical research. The document delineates specific requirements for each CICU level, including the management of clinical cases, the expertise of intensive care cardiologists, the technological facilities, and the medical and nursing staff needed to ensure optimal care delivery.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39898743/"}

{"id": "17405561", "title": "[The best of valvular heart disease in 2006].", "text": "In the field of valvular diseases, the year 2006 has been above all marked by the publication of new joint AHA/ACC guidelines. Besides, other publications included severe aortic stenosis, drug therapy in chronic aortic regurgitation, the indications for surgery in asymptomatic mitral regurgitation, as well as valve surgery in the elderly and mismatch severity after aortic valve replacement. In a series of 66 cases of aortic stenosis with poor LV function undergoing stress echocardiography, it has been shown that whether the absence of contractile reserve identifies a high-risk subgroup for aortic valve replacement (33% vs. 6%), this exam does not predict the functional prognosis and the post-operative LV function improvement. Hence, the absence of contractile reserve should not contra-indicate aortic valve replacement surgery, even though the prognosis is severe, since the natural prognosis is extremely severe. The question of aortic valve replacement in case of mild stenosis with the indication of CABG remains difficult. Taking into account the important mortality of redo surgery, a study was in favor of a systematic aortic valve replacement associated to CABG in patients <75 years who had a mean aortic gradient > 30 mmHg, a LVH and aortic valve calcifications. Old patients (>80 years) with severe aortic stenosis have a very severe natural prognosis, authorizing wide indications for aortic valve replacement, in the absence of important comorbidities. The use of vasodilators in severe chronic aortic regurgitation remains debated. In a randomized study comparing Nifedipine 40 mg vs. Enalapril 20 mm vs. placebo, it has been shown that the use of a vasodilator does not modify the time of valvular surgery at all. After a mean follow-up of 7 years, the rates of aortic valve replacement were identical in the 3 groups, and there wa no difference regarding the preoperative regurgitation volume, LV dimensions and mass, and LVEF. The timing for huge chronic and asymptomatic mitral regurgitation remains debated, even though the present trend is to prefer early surgery, due to the risk of sudden death. A new study evidenced the interest of clinical and echocardiographic surveillance on a prospective series of 129 consecutive asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. The surgical indication was only based on the occurrence of symptoms, an echographic LV diameters increase, a LV dysfunction, the presence of pulmonary hypertension or atrial fibrillation. At 8 years, the overall mortality was at 91 + 3%, with a survival rate not statistically different from the expected rates; 35 patients have been operated. The 6-years and 8-years surgical indication-free survival were respectively at 65 +/- 5% and 55 +/- 6%, with a null operative mortality, and favorable data regarding post-operative survival, symptoms and LV function. The indication for surgical correction of mitral regurgitation in the elderly remains a difficult problem, due to the surgical risk. The Mayo Clinic team analyzed the evolution of 284 patients > 75 years operated for mitral regurgitation between 1980 and 1995, compared to younger subjects (65 - 74 years old, n=504, and <65 years, n=556). The age-adjusted 5-years survival was lower in the older patients, but the age-adjusted observed/estimated survival ratios were similar in the different age groups. The perioperative risk, significantly higher in the older patients (p<0.001) decreased systematically for all age ranges in the most recent periods (the 1980-83 period vs. 1992-95), from 27% to 5%, 21% to 4%, and 7% to 2% respectively in patients > 75 years, 65-74 years and <65 years. An age >75 years was an independent predictive factor for the surgical mortality. These data show that, despite the surgical risk, the surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation should be extended to the oldest patients. One of the most surprising information provided in the ACC/AHA guidelines is the necessity of adding a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg of aspirin systematically to VKA in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or in those with a valvular bioprosthesis with one or several risk factors for thrombo-embolic events (AF, history of thromboembolic event, LV dysfunction, hypercoagulable state). This major recommendation (Class 1, level of evidence B) appears surprising, since it is not actually based on definite results issued from randomized studies using these doses of aspirin. According to these guidelines, this association not only reduces the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with valvular prosthesis, but also decreases the mortality related to other cardiovascular causes (especially coronary artery disease), with the cost of a minimal risk augmentation for hemorrhagic complications. The importance of pejorative prognosis of mismatch (defined as an inadequacy between the aortic orifice size and patient's body surface after aortic valve replacement) has been subject to several publications this year. The substantial increase of post-operative events and poor survival in patients with this mismatch imply adapted preventive strategies in terms of selection of diameters and type of aortic valvular prosthesis and associated aortic surgical techniques (such as annular enlargement or supra-annular position).", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17405561/"}

Candidates to MCS are selected based on concepts, strategies and classifications that are specific to this indication. As results drastically improve, supported by stronger scientific evidence, the trend is towards earlier implantation. An adequate pre-implant follow-up is mandatory in order to avoid missing the best window of opportunity for implantation. While on chronic support, the hemodynamic profile of patients with continuous-flow ventricular assist devices is unique and remarkably influenced by the hydration status. Optimal management of these patients from the pre-implant phase to the long-term support phase requires a multidisciplinary approach that is similar to that already long validated for organ transplantation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23789184/"}

To begin to address these perceived barriers, the Heart Rhythm Society convened a forum of stakeholders in medical device innovation in conjunction with the 2015 Heart Rhythm Society Annual Scientific Sessions. The forum facilitated open discussion on medical device innovation, including obstacles to physician involvement and possible solutions. This report is based on the themes that emerged. First, physician innovators must take an organized approach to identifying unmet clinical needs and potential solutions. Second, extensive funds, usually secured through solicitation for investment, are often required to achieve meaningful progress, developing an idea into a device. Third, planning for regulatory requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is essential. In addition to these issues, intellectual property and overall trends in health care, including international markets, are critically relevant considerations for the physician innovator. Importantly, there are a number of ways in which professional societies can assist physician innovators to navigate the complex medical device innovation landscape, bring clinically meaningful devices to market more quickly, and ultimately improve patient care. These efforts include facilitating interaction between potential collaborators through scientific meetings and other gatherings; collecting, evaluating, and disseminating state-of-the-art scientific information; and representing the interests of members in interactions with regulators and policymakers.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26801401/"}

During the decade before 1958, cardiology and cardiovascular surgery emerged as specialties. Surgery by closed techniques flourished and open heart surgery began. Since 1958, spectacular progress has occurred. Closed chest massage and defibrillation, electronic monitoring, advances in electrophysiology and a new pharmacology have changed cardiology. The coronary care unit has evolved into a comprehensive coronary care system. Pacemakers, myocardial revascularization and open heart surgery have become commonplace and percutaneous angioplasty an option. As custodians of cardiology's historic advances, the cardiologist and cardiovascular surgeon are cast in a role of decision maker and problem solver. Today's diagnostic and therapeutic cardiology, used appropriately, has great potential for good--used inappropriately, for great harm. The patient has the right to expect the physician to act objectively and appropriately in dealing with problems that may threaten his or her livelihood or life. The physician who does less is an unworthy heir to cardiology's great legacy of 1983.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6338080/"}

Oucome dello Scompenso Cardiaco in relazione all'Utilizzo delle Risore.", "text": "This study was designed to identify potential specialty-related differences in the epidemiology, clinical profile, management and outcome of patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure in departments of cardiology or internal medicine. From 1 July to 31 December 1998, we prospectively recorded epidemiological and clinical data from patients with congestive heart failure consecutively admitted to 11 departments of cardiology and 12 departments of internal medicine in Liguria, a northern area of Italy. The overall study population included 749 patients; 22% were treated by cardiologists and 78% by internists (P<0.0001). Patients managed by cardiologists were more likely to undergo echocardiography (92% vs 37%), Holter monitoring (25% vs 3%) and exercise stress testing (20% vs 0.5%) than those managed by internists (P=0.001). At discharge, patients treated by cardiologists were more likely to be prescribed beta-blockers (41% to 4%) and ACE inhibitors (100% to 74%) than those treated by internists (P<0.0001), and the latter medication at higher dosages by cardiologists than internists. In addition, patients followed by cardiologists were younger (70+/-9 to 79+/-1 years;P<0.0001), more likely to be male (61% to 50%;P=0.011) and to have coronary artery disease (57% to 45%;P<0.006) than those followed by internists. Conversely, patients followed by internists were more likely to have diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation and renal failure (P<0.03). In the overall study population, 53 patients (7%) died during hospitalization. Patients treated by cardiologists had a mortality not significantly different from that of patients treated by internists (10% and 6%, respectively;P=0.067), although congestive heart failure was more severe on admission in patients treated by cardiologists. Cardiologists follow published guidelines for congestive heart failure more strictly than internists, but treat a smaller number of patients who are younger, have more severe congestive heart failure and fewer co-morbidities than those managed by internists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11259147/"}

Those physicians in the young subspecialty of cardiac anesthesiology have fulfilled these obligations by developing a body of scientific and clinical knowledge and the technical bases to increase survival and decrease morbidity of patients with heart disease undergoing either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Furthermore, they have contributed effectively to the broad practice of medicine. However, a strong argument can be made that these contributions, though benefiting many individual patients, do not by themselves completely fulfill our obligations. The concept of Civic Professionalism states that our moral responsibilities as physicians must be expanded beyond our immediate patients. Physicians have the obligation to use their knowledge and influence to promote the common good. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes access to health care as a basic tenet. The present health care system of the United States excludes many people. Thus, cardiac anesthesiologists have a moral obligation to actively advocate for universal access to health care until it is achieved. Doing so will make the specialty of cardiac anesthesiology an example to the entire profession of medicine. Cardiac anesthesiologists have contributed to enhanced survival and decreased morbidity of patients with heart disease undergoing surgery. These achievements do not by themselves fulfill the moral obligations incurred by the concept of Civic Professionalism, however. Cardiac anesthesiologists, in common with all physicians, must share the obligation to advocate for the human right of universal access to health care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15041574/"}

Medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram represents the cornerstones of the cardiological workout allowing about 50% of likely diagnosis. The cardiologist will also have to distinguish between a disease of benign prognosis and a disease possibly associated with future sudden cardiac death. The main cardiological causes are: neurally mediated hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, other cardiac or pulmonary diseases. Neurological, metabolic or psychiatric causes occur much less frequently.

A document by the \"e-cardio\" area of the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO)].", "text": "In Italy, health protection is an individual right protected by the article 32 of the Constitution, granted to everyone since 1978 by the foundation of the National Health Service. However, regionalization of the healthcare system has caused noticeable discrepancies among the different areas of the country. The use of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) may be useful to solve them. The purpose of this document is to analyze the implementation of ICT in Italy, on the basis of the suggestions given by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO). In 2010, the Italian government introduced the electronic health record (EHR), which includes a minimum core of essential documents that should be created and updated by general practitioners. The obvious limitations of this methodology become clear in the urgency-emergency clinical setting, where the availability of particular clinical data may influence both patient prognosis and cost reduction. Also the privacy rules, currently very restrictive, cause a drawback in reliability of the data reported in the EHR, thus arising the need for a balance shift from privacy to health rights at the level of both the individual and the community. A minimum core of mandatory clinical data to be included in the EHR should be defined. No formal indications for filling out the medical records are available and most few experiences concern \"bureaucratic documents\" on the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Conversely, we believe that medical records should become a diagnostic and therapeutic tool that makes health rights uniform across the country. Each medical record form should include the following features: a simple interface, a mandatory association of clinical findings and reports, data portability and accessibility, and adherence of the information to a minimal dataset. Additionally, medical records data should merge into a modified EHR available at any time and place through network access points with adequate connection speed. In this respect, inhomogeneous availability of broadband in Italy is at present a major challenging issue. Finally, current training programs in medicine do not allow for widespread application of ICT among young physicians. Some essential topics should be covered by university formative credits. It is crucial to address different needs: the patient needs, making data on \"biological heritage\" always available; the physician needs, providing them with professional tools able to improve their daily quality of work; the managers' and public decision makers' needs, helping to optimize costs of the healthcare system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24336602/"}

Yet, costs of attending these conferences represent a major barrier, particularly for trainees and participants from low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Our study aimed to analyze the registration fees of major cardiology conferences worldwide. We included conferences organized by international cardiovascular societies and those representing global regions. We did not include individual national or institutional conferences due to inability to systematically identify them. We collected 2024 registration fees from official conference websites, taking 2023 or 2022 fees if unavailable, and categorized them according to career stage and society membership status. Where specified, we chose 'early-bird' fees. All fees were converted to US dollars according to currency exchange rates per the International Monetary Fund on December 4, 2023, or if unavailable, per the last reported US Treasury Data. Other data collected included host country, virtual option availability, and LMIC discounts. 30 (65.2 %) conferences provided discounts for medical students, regardless of membership status, while 1 (2.2 %) provided discounts only for student-members. 36 (78.2 %) conferences offered discounts for residents/fellows, while 2 (4.3 %) offered discounts only for resident/fellow-members. Median fees for students and residents/fellows with membership were $255 and $287 (in US dollars), respectively while median fees for non-members were $303.5 and $397, respectively. 31 (67.4 %) conferences provided discounts for staff- members. Median fees for staff were $701 and $800 for members and non-members, respectively. Only 12 (26.1 %) conferences mentioned a virtual component, with 11 offering discounted registration compared with in-person rates. 7 (15.2 %) conferences had special in-person fees for LMIC-based registrants. 5 offered the same discounted rate regardless of training stage, while 2 offered additional discounts for trainees. We found that conference registration costs were substantial, including for trainees, with only a minority of conferences providing discounted rates for LMICs. Professional societies must reduce registration costs, potentially by implementing a tiered system based on training stage and country of origin. Further, to augment LMIC participation, dedicated scholarships and mentorship programs for LMIC-based registrants are needed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38852909/"}

Our careful analysis shows that the 2019 guidelines contain a number of positive innovations, including a new definition, a central role of non-invasive testing for myocardial ischaemia, the most contemporary prevalence of the disease, the fact that medical therapy remains paramount despite the important advances in revascularisation and many other good issues as well as some limitations. The section on medical therapy of chronic coronary syndromes patients shows some inconsistency between text and the suggested scheme as well as contradictions with recommendations of regulatory agencies.

We performed a systematic analysis of all cardiovascular device clinical trials from 2001 to 2012 published in medical and cardiovascular journals with the 8 highest impact factors. Of the 1,224 identified cardiovascular clinical trials, 299 (24.4%) focused specifically on devices. Each trial included a median of 335 patients (162 to 745) recruited from a median of 14 sites (3 to 38) over a median enrollment duration of 1.9 years (1.2 to 3.3). Median enrollment rate was 1.1 patients/site/month (0.5 to 4.2). Most device trials targeted coronary artery disease (55.2%), followed by arrhythmias (17.4%). Most were industry sponsored (53.6%) and included mortality as a primary end point (69.6%). The median number of patients (225 to 499, p <0.001 for trend) and enrolling sites (11 to 19, p = 0.07 for trend) increased from 2001 to 2012. During the study period, multinational enrollment grew and approached 50% (p = 0.03), whereas trials enrolling in North America exclusively decreased from 30% to 17% (p = 0.10 for trend). Approximately 70% of device trials met their primary end points; this rate did not significantly change over time. In conclusion, this descriptive study of the contemporary cardiovascular device clinical trials highlights recent trends toward larger, more international trial programs.

Increasingly, clinicians are demonstrating the features of the heart as it is located within the body. It is no longer satisfactory, therefore, to describe these components in a ‘Valentine’ fashion, as continues to be the case in most textbooks of normal or cardiac anatomy. We then emphasize the importance of the so-called morphological method, which states that structures within the heart should be defined on the basis of their own intrinsic morphology, and not according to other parts, which are themselves variable. We continue by using this concept to show how the appendages serve to distinguish between the atrial chambers, while the apical trabecular components provide the features to distinguish the ventricles. We then return to the cardiac chambers, emphasizing features of surgical significance, in particular the locations of the cardiac conduction tissues. We proceed by examining the cardiac valves, and conclude by providing a detailed analysis of the septal structures.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500767/"}

This paper aims to offer a concise overview of these significant advances and to put them into clinical context. Trials presented at the major international cardiology meetings during 2019 were reviewed including The American College of Cardiology (ACC), Euro PCR, The European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), and the American Heart Association (AHA). In addition to this a literature search identified several other publications eligible for inclusion based on their relevance to clinical cardiology, their potential impact on clinical practice and on future guidelines. A total of 70 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining use of drug-coated balloons in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), interventions following shockable cardiac arrest, mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock complicating MI, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, surgical or percutaneous revascularisation strategies in left main coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation MI, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (dapagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (evolocumab), bempedoic acid, and novel approaches to the management of hypertension. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents and regimes including combination antithrombotic therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril-valsartan in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure but without diabetes. Electrophysiology data included trials examining alcohol in atrial fibrillation and the use of wearable fitness devices for identifying atrial fibrillation.

The NHLBI's Strategic Vision, developed with extensive input from the extramural research community and published in 2016, included overarching goals and strategic objectives that serve to provide a general blueprint for sustaining the legacy of the Institute by leveraging opportunities in emerging scientific areas (e.g., regenerative medicine, omics technology, data science, precision medicine, and mobile health), finding new ways to address enduring challenges (e.g., social determinants of health, health inequities, prevention, and health promotion), and training the next generation of heart, lung, blood, and sleep researchers. DCVS has developed a strategic vision implementation plan to provide a cardiovascular framing for the pursuit of the Institute's overarching goals and strategic objectives garnered from the input of the broader NHLBI community. This plan highlights six scientific focus areas that demonstrate a cross-cutting and multifaceted approach to addressing cardiovascular sciences, including 1) addressing social determinants of cardiovascular health (CVH) and health inequities, 2) enhancing resilience, 3) promoting CVH and preventing CVD Across the lifespan, 4) eliminating hypertension-related CVD, 5) reducing the burden of heart failure, and 6) preventing vascular dementia. These priorities will guide our efforts in Institute-driven activities in the coming years but will not exclude development of other novel ideas or the support of investigator-initiated grant awards. The DCVS Strategic Vision implementation plan is a living document that will evolve with iterative dialogue with the NHLBI community and adapt as the dynamic scientific landscape changes to seize emerging opportunities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31031412/"}

As the amount of imaging and other diagnostic data increases, paralleled by the greater capacity to personalize treatment, the difficulty of using the full array of measurements of a patient to determine an optimal treatment seems also to be paradoxically increasing. Computational models are progressively addressing this issue by providing a common framework for integrating multiple data sets from individual patients. These models, which are based on physiology and physics rather than on population statistics, enable computational simulations to reveal diagnostic information that would have otherwise remained concealed and to predict treatment outcomes for individual patients. The inherent need for patient-specific models in cardiology is clear and is driving the rapid development of tools and techniques for creating personalized methods to guide pharmaceutical therapy, deployment of devices and surgical interventions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361497/"}

Regular reviews of the subject can be found in all major journals. Most intensivists surveyed feel that echocardiography is the way of the future. Yet, despite the undisputed advantages of echocardiography, uptake of the technique into the intensive care unit has been slow. Reasons for this are multiple, and include conservatism among senior clinicians and limited availability of equipment. Above all, the lack of a consistent and widely available education program has limited the opportunities for intensive care trainees to learn echocardiography. There is a need for a \"three-tier\" program, where all intensivists learn the basic skills to perform a focused examination on a patient whose condition is unstable, while those with a special interest develop more comprehensive skills or go on to lead a critical care echocardiography program.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17767457/"}

However, medical therapies targeted to improve quality of life are underused; when resting and/or exercise obstruction is present, an incremental and additive approach should be used based on a high dosage of beta-blockers, verapamil and/or disopyramide. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation or A-V node has been proposed in some instances. Treatment of syncope or presyncope due to an abnormal blood pressure response during exercise remains challenging. Only patients with obstruction who remain severely symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy should be considered for invasive procedures, including dual-chamber (DDD) pacing, ASA or surgery. The reported complication rates of ASA (essentially complete A-V block, incidence above 5-10%, with mortality rates ranging from 0-4%) and the benefits at medium-term follow-up appear comparable to those observed after myectomy, which, according to guidelines, should remain the primary treatment for most severely symptomatic drug-refractory young patients with obstruction. While the overall survival of patients with HCM is similar to that of the general population, detection of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death remains challenging, particularly in the young, and indications for ICDs in high risk patients without prior cardiac arrest should be patient- and family-orientated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19520330/"}

Modifications to our computer-assisted mapping system allowed us to record electrical activity from 56 epicardial electrodes within 5 ms of the end of a countershock. Modifications included the use of solid-state switches to disconnect the filter section of the amplifiers during the shock and changing the low-frequency response of the amplifiers from 0.1 to 10 Hz to filter out large, low-frequency potentials after the shock. Six-millisecond truncated exponential shocks were delivered between the superior vena cava and right ventricular apex through a quadripolar catheter during normal rhythm in seven dogs. As shocks of increasing voltage were delivered during the T-Q interval, progressively more of the epicardium was directly depolarized. A shock of 109 +/- 17 (SD) V directly depolarized the entire epicardium. Shocks of constant voltage were then delivered with increasing prematurity during diastole. As the ventricles became more refractory with increasing shock prematurity, the amount of epicardium depolarized became progressively less. Thus computer-assisted mapping techniques are capable of measuring the area depolarized by a shock during normal rhythm and may be useful during arrhythmias to improve our understanding of defibrillation and cardioversion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3706548/"}

The E.S.C. will and must be able to exert more influence than ever before on the legislative and executive processes in Brussels, now and in 1993, and therefore collectively in the partner countries. 2. Only then, like its American counterparts the A.C.C. and A.H.A., will the E.S.C. be able to join with the politicians to guide the all-important question of allotment of funds. Funds for patient care, teaching, research, advanced planning, for investments in hospitals and laboratories, are all part of our fight against heart disease. These can much better be applied for and allocated on a European scale than on a national basis. The mere avoidance of duplication and repetition may be the greatest benefit of integration. 3. Only by strengthening the E.S.C. with a \"cadre\" of experienced cardiologists we can deliver the expert manpower which this integrative process will require: \"Let not our Society miss the opportunities which 1992 offers!\" 4. As a final point, only when we, as a professional unit show that we can make choices, and desist from asking everything possible for every patient we see, will we be able to regain and retain the trust of the patient as well as the political representatives of our member nations.

This type of individual usually became the director of the division. Now, however, the amount of knowledge and specialisation in each of these three areas of expertise has exploded. It is not certain that triple threat individuals can or do exist today. Instead, we need to be aiming higher, for a \"quintuple threat profession\". Not only do we need expertise in clinical care, teaching, and research, but also we now require business leadership and alignment. No single person can be expert in all five of these areas. In paediatric cardiology we need to invest in the right people. Our new \"quintuple threat profession\" needs to match the expertise and passion of the right people with our current and future needs. Going forward, we should focus on leadership, teams, and alignment. We need to identify, develop, and empower leaders at all levels within our profession, including physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators. Ultimately, we need a profession that remains clinically led, but professionally managed. The second step of the formula is the development of successful teams, and teamwork. Successful \"team behaviour\" is not a part of traditional medical education. The third step is alignment. Alignment can be defined as representing the degree to which physicians and organisations, such as hospitals, acting out of enlightened self-interest, operate inside a common vision, mutual goals, and the acceptance of a shared destiny. Imagine the benefits to our profession and our kids if we can provide a new level of leadership, teamwork, and alignment going forward.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21087574/"}

Those which have marked the year 1999 include the introduction of new techniques of cardiovascular imaging and interventional cardiology, and the new consequences of collaboration with workers in foetal cardiology and medical and molecular genetics. The advances in imaging are the result of those of microprocessors which enable three-dimensional reconstruction of ultrasonic, radiological or magnetic resonance images. This provides intracardiac or intravascular views which are very similar to those seen by the surgeon. This is a major tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. Similarly, the introduction of programmes of tissue recognition enables fine ultrasonic analysis of the vascular wall and of endothelial function leading to the opening of a new chapter of preventive vascular medicine from the earliest age. Paediatric interventional cardiology has also progressed rapidly and the past year has been that of a consensus on the closure of a great number of atrial septal defects by new prostheses implanted and anchored in a simpler and safer manner. Prenatal diagnosis has become a crucial factor in the treatment and prognosis of congenital heart disease which is life-threatening in the first hours of life, explaining the benefit when this is applied to transposition of the great vessels or to coarctation of the aorta. Finally, advances in genetics have led to the identification of several genes of heart malformations and the correlations between interstitial microdeletions and syndromes often associated with heart disease: chromosome 22q11 and the Di George syndrome, chromosome 7q and the Williams syndrome. They have even allowed linking of myocardial and cerebellar abnormalities of a degenerative neuropathy (Friedreich's disease) to an abnormality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus giving the opportunity of a real treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10721449/"}

As a consequence, standardization of the measurement conditions is imperative. General and method/device-specific user procedures are discussed. The subject's conditions should be standardized before starting measurements. These conditions include a minimal resting period of 10 min in a quiet room. It also includes prohibitions on smoking, meals, alcohol, and beverages containing caffeine before measurements. The position of the subject and time of measurements should be standardized. In comparative studies, corrections should be made for confounding factors. Repeated measurements are done preferably by the same investigator, and if available validated with user-independent automated procedures. As it is not feasible to discuss all methods or devices measuring arterial stiffness in one article, more attention is given to user procedures of commercially available devices, because these devices are of interest for a wider group of investigators. User procedures of methods/devices are discussed according to the nature of arterial stiffness measured: systemic, regional, or local arterial stiffness. Each section discusses general or method/device-specific user procedures and is followed by recommendations. Each recommendation discussed during the First International Consensus Conference on the Clinical Applications of Arterial Stiffness is quoted with the level of agreement reached during the conference.

The 4th ESC Education Conference, held in Sophia Antipolis (December 2016), brought together ESC education leaders, National Directors of Training of 43 ESC countries, and representatives of the ESC Young Community. Integrating national descriptions of education and cardiology training, we discussed innovative pathways to further improve knowledge and skills across different training programmes and health care systems. We developed an ESC roadmap supporting better cardiology training and continued medical education (CME), noting: (i) The ESC provides an excellent framework for unbiased and up-to-date cardiovascular education in close cooperation with its National Societies. (ii) The ESC should support the harmonization of cardiology training, curriculum development, and professional dialogue and mentorship. (iii) ESC congresses are an essential forum to learn and discuss the latest developments in cardiovascular medicine. (iv) The ESC should create a unified, interactive educational platform for cardiology training and continued cardiovascular education combining Webinars, eLearning Courses, Clinical Cases, and other educational programmes, along with ESC Congress content, Practice Guidelines and the next ESC Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. (v) ESC-delivered online education should be integrated into National and regional cardiology training and CME programmes. These recommendations support the ESC to deliver excellent and comprehensive cardiovascular education for the next generation of specialists. Teamwork between international, national and local partners is essential to achieve this objective.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30226525/"}

The objective of the study was to determine whether it is feasible to develop a valid and reliable evaluation approach using medical simulation to assess technical and cognitive skills of physicians performing coronary interventions. Clinical case scenarios were developed by a committee of subject matter experts, who defined key decision nodes, such as stent positioning, and introduced unanticipated complications, such as coronary perforation. Subjects were 115 physicians from 10 U.S. healthcare institutions at three levels of expertise: novice, skilled, or expert. Subjects completed a questionnaire, one practice case and six test cases on a SimSuite simulator (Medical Simulation Corporation, Denver, CO), and an opinion survey. Clinical specialists rated subjects' procedural skills. A technical and cognitive skills evaluation of performance in interventional cardiology procedures using medical simulation yielded results that distinguished between a novice group and skilled or expert groups (P<0.001) and scores correlated moderately with clinical specialist ratings of subjects' procedural skills and with number and complexity of procedures performed in practice during the previous year. Approximately 90% of subjects generally thought that the cases were well simulated and presented situations encountered in practice. This study suggests that an evaluation approach using high-fidelity medical simulation to assess technical and cognitive skills of physicians performing interventional cardiology procedures can be used to identify physicians who are extremely poor performers and not likely to be providing appropriate patient care. We believe that use of a high-fidelity simulator incorporating situations with multiple events, immediate feedback, and high sensory load would complement the results of traditional written examinations of medical knowledge to provide a more comprehensive assessment of physician ability in interventional cardiology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20661006/"}

Prolonged physical activity leads to notable cardiovascular adaptations, known as the athlete's heart, which can resemble certain pathological conditions, complicating accurate diagnoses and potentially leading to serious consequences such as unnecessary exclusion from sports or missed treatment opportunities. Wearable devices, including smartwatches and smart glasses, have become prevalent for monitoring health metrics, offering potential clinical applications for sports cardiologists. These gadgets are capable of spotting exercise-induced arrhythmias, uncovering hidden heart problems, and offering crucial information for training and recovery, to minimize exercise-related cardiac incidents and enhance heart health care. However, concerns about data accuracy and the actionable value of the obtained information persist. A major challenge lies in the integration of artificial intelligence with wearables, research gaps remain regarding their ability to provide real-time, reliable, and clinically relevant insights. Combining artificial intelligence with wearable devices can improve how data is managed and used in sports cardiology. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, can classify, predict, and draw inferences from the data collected by wearables, revolutionizing patient data usage. Despite artificial intelligence's proven effectiveness in managing chronic conditions, the limited research on its application in sports cardiology, particularly regarding wearables, creates a critical gap that needs to be addressed.

However, they are inherently low in validity because they are based on oversimplified algorithms and yield estimates rather than measurements of function and changes therein.

We investigated whether a single auscultation training class using a cardiology patient simulator for medical students provides competence required for clinical clerkship, and whether students' proficiency after the training differs among heart sounds and murmurs. A total of 324 fourth-year medical students (93-117/year for 3 years) were divided into groups of 6-8 students; each group participated in a three-hour training session using a cardiology patient simulator. After a mini-lecture and facilitated training, each student took two different tests. In the first test, they tried to identify three sounds of Category A (non-split, respiratory split, and abnormally wide split S2s) in random order, after being informed that they were from Category A. They then did the same with sounds of Category B (S3, S4, and S3+S4) and Category C (four heart murmurs). In the second test, they tried to identify only one from each of the three categories in random order without any category information. The overall accuracy rate declined from 80.4% in the first test to 62.0% in the second test (p<0.0001). The accuracy rate of all the heart murmurs was similar in the first (81.3%) and second tests (77.5%). That of all the heart sounds (S2/S3/S4) decreased from 79.9% to 54.3% in the second test (p<0.0001). The individual accuracy rate decreased in the second test as compared with the first test in all three S2s, S3, and S3+S4 (p<0.0001). Medical students may be less likely to correctly identify S2/S3/S4 as compared with heart murmurs in a situation close to clinical setting even immediately after training. We may have to consider such a characteristic of students when we provide them with cardiac auscultation training.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27916238/"}

In addition, many patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass procedures could likely benefit from these less invasive procedures. Although atherectomy has a theoretic potential for reducing the rate of restenosis by removing the plaque rather than pushing it to the side, it is unlikely to eliminate the restenosis problem completely. A more important advantage of atherectomy may be the potential for successful treatment of lesions that are anatomically unsuitable for PTCA. Even though balloon catheter technology has evolved to the point that almost all lesions in the coronary anatomy can be successfully negotiated, approximately half the coronary patients who require invasive therapy in the United States are still undergoing open-heart bypass procedures. Thus, if atherectomy can expand the indications for interventional therapy to the types of lesions that are currently considered unsuitable for PTCA, the large number of patients who are currently unable to benefit from interventional catheterization techniques could be treated. With all the new devices under investigation, carefully controlled prospective randomized trials must be conducted once the developmental phases have been completed. Each new technology must be compared with the current state-of-the-art techniques of balloon angioplasty and coronary artery bypass operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2528039/"}

These performance measures have been developed using ACC/AHA methodology, often in collaboration with other organizations, and include the process of public comment and peer review. Quality metrics are those measures that have been developed to support self assessment and quality improvement at the provider, hospital, and/or health care system level. These metrics represent valuable tools to aid clinicians and hospitals in improving quality of care and enhancing patient outcomes, but may not meet all specifications of formal performance measures. These quality metrics may also be considered \"candidate\" measures that with further research or field testing would meet the criteria for formal performance measures in the future.

The development of coronary care units is often credited for a dramatic decline in mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction throughout the 1960s. As the underlying patient population became progressively sicker, changes in organizational structure, staffing, care delivery, and training paradigms lagged. The coronary care unit gradually evolved from a focus on rapid resuscitation from ventricular arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction into a comprehensive cardiac intensive care unit designed to care for the sickest patients with cardiovascular disease. Over the past decade, the cardiac intensive care unit has continued to transform with an aging population, increased clinical acuity, burgeoning cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, technologic advances in cardiovascular interventions, and increased use of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices. Herein, we provide an update and contemporary expert perspective on the organizational structure, staffing, and care delivery in the cardiac intensive care unit; examine the challenges and opportunities present in the education and training of the next generation of physicians for critical care cardiology; and explore quality improvement initiatives and scientific investigation, including multicenter registry initiatives and randomized clinical trials, that may change clinical practice, care delivery, and the research landscape in this rapidly evolving discipline.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39945062/"}

In the first part, an inventory of the teaching/learning methods was taken, using 21 questions (Yes/No format). The second part was a knowledge test, comprising 15 multiple-choice questions, exploring the core curriculum. Of the 21 variables tested, four emerged as independent predictors of the score obtained in the knowledge test: access to self-assessment (P=0.0093); access to teaching methods other than lectures (P=0.036); systematic discussion about clinical decisions (P=0.013); and the opportunity to prepare and give lectures (P=0.039). The fifth variable was seniority in residency (P=0.0003). Each item of the knowledge test was analysed independently: the score was higher when teaching the item was driven by reading guidelines and was lower if the item had not been covered by the programme (P<0.001). Finally, 91% of students would find it useful to have a national source for each topic of the curriculum; 76% of them would often connect to an e-learning platform if available. It is necessary to rethink teaching in cardiology by involving students in the training, by using teaching methods other than lectures and by facilitating access to self-assessment.

Priority six of this action plan is to promote a task-shifting/task-sharing approach in the management of hypertension. This capacity-building initiative aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and core competences of primary healthcare physicians in the management of hypertension and related complications. In a collaborative approach with the International Society of Hypertension, the British and Irish Hypertension Society, the Public Health Foundation of India and the Centre for Chronic Disease Control, the PASCAR hypertension taskforce held a continental faculty meeting in Kenya on 25 and 26 February 2018 to review and discuss a process of effective contextualisation and implementation of the Indian hypertension management course on the African continent. A tailored African course in terms of evidence-based learning, up-to-date curriculum and on-the-job training was developed with a robust monitoring and evaluation strategy. The course will be offered on a modular basis with a judicious mix of case studies, group discussions and contact sessions, with great flexibility to accommodate participants' queries. Hypertension affects millions of people in Africa and if left untreated is a major cause of heart disease, kidney disease and stroke. CCMH-Africa will train in the next 10 years, 25 000 certified general physicians and 50 000 nurses, capable of adequately managing uncomplicated hypertension, thereby freeing the few available specialists to focus on severe or complicated cases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395142/"}

AF is associated with a high risk of recurrence, which can be reduced using optimal prevention strategies, mainly anticoagulant therapy. The availability of effective prophylaxis justifies the need for a significant, coordinated and thorough transdisciplinary effort to screen for AF associated with stroke. A recent French national survey, initiated and supported by the Société française neurovasculaire (SFNV) and the Société française de cardiologie (SFC), revealed many shortcomings, such as the absence or inadequacy of telemetry equipment in more than half of stroke units, insufficient and highly variable access to monitoring tools, delays in performing screening tests, heterogeneous access to advanced or connected ambulatory monitoring techniques, and a lack of dedicated human resources. The present scientific document has been prepared on the initiative of the SFNV and the SFC with the aim of helping to address the current shortcomings and gaps, to promote efficient and cost-effective AF detection, and to improve and, where possible, homogenize the quality of practice in AF screening among stroke units and outpatient post-stroke care networks. The working group, composed of cardiologists and vascular neurologists who are experts in the field and are nominated by their peers, reviewed the literature to propose statements, which were discussed in successive cycles, and maintained, either by consensus or by vote, as appropriate. The text was then submitted to the SFNV and SFC board members for review. This scientific statement document argues for the widespread development of patient pathways to enable the most efficient AF screening after stroke. This assessment should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, including expert cardiologists and vascular neurologists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39510937/"}

Following the publication of major landmark randomised controlled trials reporting that CRT confers a survival advantage in patients with severe heart failure and improves symptoms,many subsequent studies have been performed to further refine the selection of patients for CRT and determine the clinical characteristics associated with a favourable response. The field of sudden cardiac death and implantable cardioverter defibrillators also continues to be actively researched, with important new epidemiological and clinical data emerging on improved methods for patient selection, risk stratification, and management.

In German hospitals the input data of the statutory quality assurance (in cardiology: left heart catheterization, cardiac implantable electronic devices and transcatheter aortic valve implantation, TAVI), the data according to § 21 of the Hospital Remuneration Act and mandatory quality assurance reports of hospitals are available. In addition, the health insurance companies also have social data at their disposal. The very restrictive interpretation of data safety in Germany as well as a partition of the data according to the private or statutory health insurance status, outpatient and inpatient forms of treatment and two different remuneration sources exacerbate in the current reality an effective central use of routine data, as is possible in other countries, e.g., Sweden. Routine data are a powerful tool for quality assurance in terms of critical self-reflection and as a basis for peer review by colleagues; however, public reporting of routine data (publication of the results of individual hospitals) is questionable due to methodological limitations, such as data quality and risk adjustment, as it puts hospitals in the pillory without any chance to critically reflect on the validity of the data. Consequently, risk-avoiding behavior in medical services could compromise patient care. The current development of healthcare policies with a structural reform of the hospital landscape and the recommendations of the government committee will increase the demands on the quality assessment based on routine data. Simplified data acquisition, methodological improvements as well as new aspects, such as the quality of indications, assessment of nursing services and patient orientation will be added. In future, a quality-oriented remuneration based on routine data is intended to help control the healthcare system.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40080175/"}

{"id": "7653607", "title": "Biaxial mechanics of excised canine pulmonary arteries.", "text": "A new method has been developed for measuring the stress-strain relationship in excised canine pulmonary arteries. Segments of dog main right pulmonary arteries were isolated by making two transverse cuts at each end of a segment near the bifurcations, yielding short cylinders, which were then cut radially, relieving the residual stress, causing the cylindrical shells to spring open to approximately flat rectangular slabs with dimensions approximately 1.0 x 3.0 x 0.1 cm. The specimens were then tested using a biaxial tensile testing machine. The resulting data show an approximately linear relationship between Kirchhoff stress and Lagrangian strain with very little hysteresis. The following pseudostrain energy function serves as a practical approximation for pulmonary arteries subjected to physiological levels of stress and strain: rho 0W(2) = 1/2(a1E2xx + a2E2yy + 2 a4ExxEyy), where rho 0 is the density of the wall (mass per unit volume), W is the energy per unit mass [superscript \"(2)\" indicates this is a 2-dimensional strain energy function], E is strain, a1, a2, and a4 are material constants with units of stress, and the subscripts x and y refer to the circumferential and axial axes, respectively, of the artery. To assess the physiological level of strain in the main right pulmonary artery, vessels were perfused in situ at physiological pressure (26 cmH2O) with silicone elastomer. The arteries were then excised and marked with small ink spots. Photographs of the spots on four tangent planes of the excised artery indicate a maximum circumferential strain of 21.5% and a maximum axial strain of 36.5% relative to the zero-stress state. These values are within the range of strain used in the biaxial tests. The relationship between Kirchhoff stress and Green's strain is approximately linear within the physiological range. The stress levels required to cause tissue failure are at least 10 times greater than the estimated normal physiological level.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7653607/"}

He published monographs on Diseases of the Lungs, and the Climatic Treatment of Consumption, but his later Medical Axioms show his deep appreciation of studied clinical observation. Although practice was changing in the new century Lindsay displayed an ability to change with the new requirements, as evidenced by his lecture on electrocardiography as president of the section of medicine of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland in 1915. He was impressed by the way the string galvanometer changed attention from stenosis and incompetence of the valves to the cardiac musculature, but rightly suspected that there was more to be told about the state of the myocardium than Einthoven's three leads revealed.

This met with resistance from both clinicians and scientists and was only accepted in more recent times with the development of clinical epidemiology and clinical trials. EMB claims to utilize the best available evidence to reach scientific conclusions, rejecting the appeal to expert authority. This involves a hierarchy of sources which places large controlled trials at the apex. Less value is attributed to arguments from clinical observation or pathophysiology. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials therefore provide the strongest evidence for clinical decisions. The approach advocated in EBM is an over-simplification of the process of clinical thinking which involves interpretation and synthesis of relevant evidence from all sources and extrapolation to the clinical situation. In this process, there is no hierarchy of evidence. The relative value given to any particular evidence depends more upon its relevance and persuasiveness than the category to which it belongs. Discussion and debate amongst informed 'experts' is an integral feature of this process at each stage. Although advocates of EBM acknowledge the contribution of all forms of evidence, the differential value attached to different sources has led to naïve and simplistic attempts to omit the traditional processes of interpretation, synthesis and extrapolation and to draw wide-ranging conclusions from trial data without adequate scientific discussion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10608462/"}

Consequently, the prevalence of patients with CHD has shifted away from infancy and childhood towards adulthood. Adult CHD cardiology is now encompassing not only young or middle-aged adults but also patients with CHD over 60 years old. Many adult patients are afflicted by residual haemodynamic lesions and also face additional opportunities and/or challenges such as pregnancy, acquired heart disease, non-cardiac pathology etc., necessitating integrated care and all medical disciplines. We are faced with a \"tsunami\" in terms of adult CHD numbers, disease heterogeneity and complexity of work and interventions needed. We need to secure resources, welcome more people in our field, learn from \"marching with our patients\", and educate better patients, public and ourselves so that every single patient with CHD, born anywhere in the world, may reach their full life potential.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31254360/"}

Whereas the vast majority of medical and surgical ICUs are staffed by physicians trained in critical care medicine, that is not commonly the case in coronary care units (CCUs) in this country. Despite that, the breadth and diversity of comorbidities in patients that occupy our CCU beds is continuously growing. No longer is the CCU merely an observation unit for peri-infarction complications, but rather it has truly become an ICU for patients with cardiovascular disease.

However, the associated ionizing radiation raises long-term health concerns, emphasizing the need for dose optimization. To establish multicenter diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for pediatric IC procedures within the French COCCINELLE cohort as part of the HARMONIC European project, providing data to optimize radiation exposure. A retrospective analysis of radiation dose metrics was conducted on pediatric IC procedures performed across seven hospitals from 2018 to 2020. Data were stratified by five weight groups (<5, 5- < 15, 15- < 30, 30- < 50, 50- < 80 kg) and seven IC procedure categories. Median and 75th quantile values for dose-area product (DAP), DAP normalized to body-weight (DAP/BW) and fluoroscopy time (FT) were calculated to define typical values and DRLs, respectively. The DRL-weight curve approach was also used to determine the 50th quantile curve for each IC procedure category. A total of 1815 pediatric IC procedures were analyzed, comprising 534 diagnostic and 1281 therapeutic procedures. Significant variations in DAP were observed across different procedure types and weight groups, while fluoroscopy time showed no significant variation. Typical-DRL values (median-75th percentile values) of DAP (Gy·cm²) ranged from 1.9-3.9 to 4.8-5.8 for coronarography, from 0.7-1.3 to 9.2-15.6 for angiography, from 0.3-0.6 to 0.8-1.5 for pulmonary valve dilatation, from 2.8-3.7 to 11.6-14.6 for pulmonary artery dilatation and stenting, from 0.6-1.3 to 2.8-6.0 for atrial septal defect closure and from 0.1-0.4 to 3.1-5.4 for patent ductus arteriosus closure in function of weight groups and 0.2-0.3 for Rashkind in patients <5 kg.

Guideline report.", "text": "Diseases of the heart are the leading cause of death and the major reason for days stayed in the hospital and discharges from the hospital. Nearly 1 million Americans died last year from cardiac disease, and over 60 million suffer from some form of cardiac disease. Conservatively stated, 300,000 cardiac surgeries and 600,000 cardiac catheterizations are performed annually, and the number is rising. Therefore, heart disease is understandably big business for hospitals and physicians. The organization of cardiac delivery systems is changing dramatically, primarily as the result of advancements made in the nonsurgical treatment of cardiac disease. The balance of power is shifting from cardiac surgery to cardiology, resulting in political and economic consequences for hospitals. Cardiac diagnosis is also undergoing a transformation, as less invasive procedures increase in sophistication. As hospitals consider their options in this market and observe physicians, medical groups, and alternative delivery systems providing competing services, the strategic alternatives become confusing and decidedly difficult. This report is written as a guide to assist hospitals in understanding the technological forces underlying the changing market and the effect these changes will have on the ownership, organization, and structure of delivery systems and, most specifically, on the delivery of cardiovascular services. Because of the tremendous interest in invasive cardiology services and the significance of the financial, organizational, and quality commitment involved in the delivery of invasive cardiology services, this guideline report addresses primarily those services. Noninvasive technologies also are addressed because of their importance to a cardiology program, the magnitude of the technological changes taking place, and their potential impact on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. The report begins with a discussion of the general planning issues that provide the foundation for the development of an effective cardiology program and details the methodologies and practices necessary to implement the planning process. Included are market assessment and financial planning models, which contain sample reports and provide conceptual and factual starting points for market-specific planning in such areas as demographic and market research, equipment costs, staffing considerations, and pricing alternatives. In addition to strategic, financial, and market planning issues, the report addresses the clinical factors involved in the operation of a cardiology department.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10318127/"}

He is mainly remembered for describing the 'Graham Steel murmur', however his name is also associated with the 'Graham Steell monaural stethoscope', which he designed. His clinical examination of the cardiovascular system at the bedside was meticulous, using only his stethoscope, percussion hammer, and a sphygmograph to record the radial pulse. His work is described in his monograph, <i>Diseases of the Heart</i> (1906) and other numerous papers. The University of Manchester Museum of Medicine and Health has a collection of monaural stethoscopes, percussors and sphygmographs. This article explores Dr Steell's clinical techniques and contribution to cardiology in an era before chest X-rays and electrocardiography, and also discusses the use of monaural stethoscopes and percussion hammers by the wider medical profession during the Victorian and Edwardian period.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37797176/"}

At that time some critics predicted PTCA would remain the hobby of some cardiologists. During the last two decades, however, an explosive proliferation in the number of PTCA procedures has occurred, which soon exceed the number of CABG procedures. As technology has advanced and operator experience has increased, the application of PTCA has expanded from dilatation of simple, concentric single-vessel stenotic lesions to progressively more complex lesions in multivessel disease. Within the last 5 years the minimally invasive cardiac surgery has progressed, which allows the performance of even complex cardiac surgery through small incisions with (port-access technique) or without (MIDCAB technique) cardiopulmonary bypass. The rationale of enthusiastic users of these new techniques leads to improved cosmetic results, less surgical trauma, decreased length of hospital stay, reduced cost, and comparable long-term results with respect to conventional CABG. Similar to the prediction about PTCA two decades ago, some critics say that minimally invasive cardiac surgery would remain the hobby of some cardiac surgeons.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10613571/"}

The inverse problem was solved using an equivalent current dipole in a homogeneous boundary element torso model. The dipole parameters were determined with a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the goodness of fit of the calculated localisations were used in assessing the quality of the results. The dependence between the SNR and the goodness of fit was derived, and the results were found to correspond to the model. With SNR between 5 and 10, the average localisation error was found to be 9 +/- 8 mm, while for SNR between 30 and 40 and goodness of fit between 99.5% and 100%, the average error reduced to 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm.

(2) The working party appreciates that the short term problem with appointment of paediatric cardiologists cannot be solved immediately and recommends that appointing authorities should show patience. They should look to the possibility of identifying suitable candidates, at present in training, and making proleptic appointments to allow appropriate training to be completed. (3) There is a need for an increase in the number of paediatric cardiologists to service the specialty during a period when the patient load will increase because of population trends and changes in work patterns (specifically adults with congenital heart disease and prenatal cardiology). The care of adults with congenital heart disease has to be planned, certainly at regional and probably supraregional levels, and the financial and training implication has to be recognised. (4) The working party therefore recommends that there should be one consultant paediatric cardiologist per million of the population to allow for these changes in the service. (5) The working party considers that this report makes a very strong case for an increase in the number of senior registrar and registrar posts in the specialty. The existing number of junior posts will not fill the increase in agreed new posts and those made vacant by retirements between now and the end of the decade. When the additional posts recommended by the working party are taken into account at least three new senior registrar posts are needed. To make sure that a satisfactory supply of experienced candidates is available to fill the senior registrar posts the working party recommends the provision of two full time middle grade registrar jobs for each senior registrar position.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1467061/"}

However, there may be little to be gained by frequently monitoring patients with well-treated stable disease. Trials of implantable monitoring-only devices suggest that there is a subgroup of patients that may benefit from such remote monitoring. Remote monitoring is still not widely adopted due to a number of social, technological and reimbursement issues, but this is likely to change rapidly.

{"id": "33314988", "title": "Hybrid Organizations in Health Systems: The Corporatization of Malaysia's National Heart Institute.", "text": "Health system reforms across high- and middle-income countries often involve changes to public hospital governance. Corporatization is one such reform, in which public sector hospitals are granted greater functional independence while remaining publicly owned. In theory, this can improve public hospital efficiency, while retaining a public service ethos. However, the extent to which efficiency gains are realized and public purpose is maintained depends on policy choices about governance and payment systems. We present a case study of Malaysia's National Heart Institute (IJN), which was created in 1992 by corporatization of one department in a large public hospital. The aim of the paper is to examine whether IJN has achieved the goals for which it was created, and if so, whether it provides a potential model for further reforms in Malaysia and other similar health systems. Using a combination of document analysis and key informant interviews, we examine key governance, health financing and payment, and equity issues. For governance, we highlight the choice to have IJN owned by and answerable to a Ministry of Finance (MOF) holding company and MOF-appointed board, rather than the Ministry of Health (MOH). On financing and payment, we analyze the implications of IJN's combined role as fee-for-service provider to MOH as well as provider of care to private patients. For equity, we analyze the targeting of IJN care across publicly-referred and private patients. These issues demonstrate unresolved tensions between IJN's objectives and public service goals. As an institutional innovation that has endured for 28 years and grown dramatically in size and revenue, IJN's trajectory offers critical insights on the relevance of the hybrid public-private models for hospitals in Malaysia as well as in other middle-income countries. While IJN appears to have achieved its goal of establishing itself as a commercially viable, publicly owned center of clinical excellence in Malaysia, the value for money and equity of the services it provides to the Ministry of Health remain unclear. IJN is accountable to a small Ministry of Finance holding company, which means that detailed information required to evaluate these critical questions is not published. The case of IJN highlights that corporatization cannot achieve its stated goals of efficiency, innovation, and equity in isolation; rather it must be supported by broader reforms, including of health financing, payment, governance, and transparency, in order to ensure that autonomous hospitals improve quality and provide efficient care in an equitable way.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314988/"}

Of the 5,050 cardiologists contacted, 1,431 (28.3%) replied. The cardiologists were attracted by the non-invasive nature (84%) of radionuclide techniques and their complementarity with other methods of investigation (74%) but regretted their cost (55%), their lick of availability in emergencies (35%) and, in general, their difficult of access (30%). Only 38% of the cardiologists who replied used radionuclide investigation on an everyday basis, this being impossible for some because of the distance to the nearest centre with these facilities (on average 32 km but exceeding 50 km in 29% of cases, and the delay before obtaining an appointment (average 13 days) which was often excessive, especially for myocardial scintigraphy (thallium or equivalent). Each cardiologist prescribed an average of 5 myocardial scintigraphies, 3 pulmonary scintigraphies and 2 radioisotopic ventriculography per month. These results seem to be an overestimation; in fact, radionuclide investigations are relatively underemployed, probably more because of the factors cited above than because of lack interest or quality, these latter two points being generally judged positively by the majority of cardiologists. Cardiologists require more from the conclusions of the investigation than a simple description of the images obtained. As with all other investigations that they perform themselves, the interpretation of the results must take the clinical context into consideration and form part of the diagnostic and therapeutic management of the patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7487282/"}

Despite its importance, errors in ECGs interpretation are common, and the optimal teaching methods have not yet been clearly established.

First, we conducted a survey on ECG learning among fourth to sixth-year medical students. Second, a 5-week multicenter comparative study was conducted with fourth-year medical students during their cardiology internship. Two different teaching methods were used, assigned by center. The first group participated in 5-minutes workshops 4 times a week using a \"reversed classroom\" method, supervised by a cardiologist, where students took turns selecting, presenting and discussing ECGs. The control group attended a single 2-hour face-to-face ECG course. All participants completed a 30-minute ECGs analysis test at baseline and after 5 weeks. Out of 401 survey respondents, the confidence levels in ECG interpretation were 3/5 (IQR 2-3) for routine situations and 2/5 (IQR 1-3) for emergency situations. Satisfaction with ECG teaching was low (2/5, IQR 1-3) and 96.3% of respondents favored more extensive ECG training.

Its prognosis, previously considered as benign, is similar to heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Studies are difficult in this field and we are often satisfied by imperfect results: PEP CHF, limited by the enrollment issue, showed only a trend for a beneficial effect of ACE-inhibitors. However the study can be considered as significant if only limited to the first year of follow-up, which can be justified. The second major field of research is resynchronization therapy: echocardiographic studies keep on providing asynchrony criteria. The benefit is greater in case of less extended fibrosis, and if the heart disease is non-ischemic, and if the paced zone does not contain fibrosis. Finally, a promising study on the interest of left ventricular discharge by a long-term circulatory assistance in case of severe systolic dysfunction should be cited.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17405568/"}

Three representative clinical cases of the specialty were developed. The OSCE consisted of a sequence of clinical situations presented in three stations of 7minutes each. The role of the simulated patient was played by medical students. At the end of the OSCE, observers and students completed the evaluation form. We compared the performances between junior and senior vascular medicine students. Written questionnaires were used to measure OSCE satisfaction. We were able to develop and organize this examination without difficulties. Fifteen students were evaluated. All participants agreed that the clinical situations were representative of vascular medicine practice, the cases were realistic and standardized patients were convincing. The performance of senior students was statistically higher than junior students in one case. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of the OSCE in students in vascular medicine.

The Society for Cardiovascular Pathology sponsored a special workshop within the frame of the USCAP Annual Meeting, held in Vancouver, March 6-12, 2004, to address the present and future role of cardiovascular pathology in research, clinical care, and education. Clearly, the recruitment and training of young pathologists are crucial to this aim. The forum tried to answer a series of questions. First, is there room for cardiovascular pathologists and clinicopathologic correlations in the era of extraordinary advances of in vivo human body imaging? What is the evolving role of the autopsy? How can the cardiovascular pathologist simultaneously be an autopsy prosector, a surgical pathologist, a molecular pathologist, and an experimental pathologist? Is there a specific domain content for training in cardiovascular pathology and does it meet the constellation of market needs and demands? What are the experiences in Europe, North America and elsewhere? What is the influence of cardiovascular pathology in departments of pathology? Is the subdiscipline still a Cinderella in the anatomic theatre or a Princess with a double helix coat of arms? The Society for Cardiovascular Pathology is strongly committed to optimizing the academic and professional profile of the future generation of cardiovascular pathologists.

Over the medium-term, these effects will be more acute in the cardiovascular imaging context, in which AI models are already successfully performing at approximately human levels of accuracy and efficiency in certain applications. Yet, the adoption of unexplainable AI systems for cardiovascular imaging still raises significant legal and ethical challenges. We focus in particular on challenges posed by the unexplainable character of deep learning and other forms of sophisticated AI modelling used for cardiovascular imaging by briefly outlining the systems being developed in this space, describing how they work, and considering how they might generate outputs that are not reviewable by physicians or system programmers. We suggest that an unexplainable tendency presents 2 specific ethico-legal concerns: (1) difficulty for health regulators; and (2) confusion about the assignment of liability for error or fault in the use of AI systems. We suggest that addressing these concerns is critical for ensuring AI's successful implementation in cardiovascular imaging.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34737036/"}

While this training ideally ends with an EHRA certification, the description of the learning pathway (what, how, when, and where) through an EHRA core curriculum is also a prerequisite for a successful training. The first EHRA core curriculum for physicians was published in 2009. Due to the huge developments in the field of EP and device therapy, this document needed updating. In addition, a certification process for APs has been introduced, as well as a recertification process and accreditation of EHRA recognized training centres. Learning pathways are more individualized now, with Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) to monitor learning progression of trainees. The 2024 updated EHRA core curriculum for physicians and APs describes, for both CIED and EP, the syllabus, OSATS, training programme and certification, and recertification for physicians and APs and stresses the importance of continued medical education after certification.

Twenty of the 44 studies did not provide adequate information on how the propensity-score-matched pairs were formed. Fourteen studies did not report whether matching on the propensity score balanced baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample. Only 4 studies explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for matched studies to compare baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects. Only 11 (25%) of the 44 studies explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the effect of treatment on the outcomes. Only 2 studies described the matching method used, assessed balance in baseline covariates by appropriate methods, and used appropriate statistical methods to estimate the treatment effect and its significance.

From as early as 400 BC when Hippocrates recognized that diseases had natural causes, the steadfast advances made by biologists, scientists, physicians and scholars were fueled by timely and important facts and information- much of it gained through animal observations that contributed importantly to understanding anatomy, physiology, and pathology. There have been many breakthroughs and historic developments. For example, William Harvey in the 16th and 17th centuries clarified the importance of the circulatory system, aided by observations in dogs and pigs, which helped to clarify and confirm his concepts. The nineteenth century witnessed advances in physical examination techniques including auscultation and percussion. These helped create the basis for enhanced proficiency in clinical cardiology. An explosion of technologic advances that followed in the 20th century have made possible sophisticated, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostics. This permitted rapid patient assessment, effective monitoring, the development of new cardiotonic drugs, clinical trials to assess efficacy, and multi-therapy strategies. The latter 20th century has marshaled a dizzying array of advances in medical genetics and molecular science, expanding the frontiers of etiologies and disease mechanisms in man, with important implications for animal health. Veterinary medicine has evolved during the last half century, from a trade designed to serve agrarian cultures, to a diverse profession supporting an array of career opportunities ranging from private, specialty practice, to highly organized, specialized medicine and subspecialty academic training programs in cardiology and allied disciplines.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453139/"}

This study tests how easily omission of patients or selection amongst irreproducible measurements generate fictitious strong correlations, without data fabrication. Two forms of manipulation are applied to a pair of normally-distributed, uncorrelated variables: first, exclusion of patients least favourable to a hypothesised association and, second, making multiple poorly-reproducible measurements per patient and choosing the most supportive. Excluding patients raises correlations powerfully, from 0.0 ± 0.11 (no patients omitted) to 0.40 ± 0.11 (one-fifth omitted), 0.59 ± 0.08 (one-third omitted) and 0.78 ± 0.05 (half omitted). Study size offers no protection: omitting just one-fifth of 75 patients (i.e. publishing 60) makes 92% of correlations statistically significant. Worse, simply selecting the most favourable amongst several measurements raises correlations from 0.0 ± 0.12 (single measurement of each variable) to 0.73 ± 0.06 (best of 2), and 0.90 ± 0.03 (best of 4). 100% of correlation coefficients become statistically significant. Scatterplots may reveal a telltale \"shave sign\" or \"bite sign\". Simple statistical tests are presented for these suspicious signatures in single or multiple studies. Correlations are vulnerable to data manipulation. Cardiology is especially vulnerable to patient deletion (because cardiologists ourselves might completely control enrolment and measurement), and selection of \"best\" measurements (because alternative heartbeats are numerous, and some modalities poorly reproducible). Source data verification cannot detect these but tests might highlight suspicious data and--aggregating across studies--unreliable laboratories or research fields.

Mario Verani (1943-2001) will be remembered foremost for his major contributions to the field of nuclear cardiology (Figure 1). For instance, he was one of the first investigators to recognize that fixed thallium defects were often not just scar but could be reversed by coronary revascularization. This led to an extensive revision of accepted traditional concepts on the meaning of image patterns. Mario's work on risk stratification by myocardial perfusion and function imaging after acute myocardial infarction was equally pioneering. He also laid out the basic principles for the safe use of adenosine for pharmacologic stress testing. Adenosine is now the preferred procedure all over the world in millions of patients. Dr Verani was a founding member and past president (1996-1997) of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC). The day before he died, he received the ASNC Distinguished Service Award. Personally, I will remember Mario as a very dear friend. We spent many hours together at meetings and gatherings all over the world. I still miss his outgoing personality, his warmth, his humor, and his enthusiasm. Above all, I enjoyed his comfortable friendship. That this friendship extended itself naturally to our wives, Regina and Marjan, made it all the more special. One of the best times we had was during a cardiology meeting in Recife, in the country of his birth, Brazil. I was greatly amused and, at the same time, impressed by the admiration and respect bestowed on him by his fellow Brazilians. One evening, we were going some place in the street on foot. We could not walk down the street without Mario being stopped by one or another Brazilian cardiologist who wanted to speak and consult with him. He was clearly greatly admired and appreciated in his country. I jokingly called him \"King of Recife,\" and the king was holding audience. We arrived rather late where we were going... . I will always cherish the memories of our times together. I am grateful that I could visit Mario at his sickbed on the day before he passed away. He was so fragile and, at the same time, so courageous. I felt sad that there was so much that we could have discussed that we did not. Life seems sometimes full of missed opportunities... .", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16084426/"}

To separate the effect of active relaxation and filling, a method was introduced [E. L. Yellin, M. Hori, C. Yoran, E. H. Sonnenblick, S. Gabbay, R. W. M. Frater, Am. J. Physiol. 250 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 19): H620-H629, 1986] to interrupt mitral inflow and keep LV volume constant throughout diastole. Their preparation requires replacing the mitral valve with an artificial valve using cardiopulmonary bypass, which might cause significant change in cardiac performance or produce detrimental systemic effects. We developed a new volume-clamping method that preserves the native mitral valve and apparatus intact and avoids cardiopulmonary bypass. A modified Bjork-Shiley prosthetic valve (20 mm orifice diam) in a special mounting ring was placed above the native mitral valve through the left atrium and secured from outside the heart. This prosthetic valve was controlled by a cable connected to solenoids outside the dog, triggered by the electrocardiogram or other physiological signal. We compared our method (n = 7) with that of Yellin et al. (n = 2) in nine random source dogs. In our method, no end-diastolic pressure gradient or regurgitant pressure wave was observed, and the prosthetic valve did not disturb movement of the native mitral valve. When the prosthetic valve was forced to a closed position at end systole, LV volume, measured with a conductance catheter, was maintained at or near end-systolic volume throughout diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1928415/"}

It was distributed via newsletter and social media to cardiologists, collecting demographic, professional data, and information on clinical practices for evaluating competitive athletes to explore current practices, challenges, and educational needs. A total of 375 responded to this survey revealing that 51.2 % of cardiologists do not have specific training in sports cardiology, despite 90.1 % believing it would improve clinical practice. The majority (58.9 %) operates without a dedicated workflow, and only 25.9 % are part of a specialized team. Legal considerations significantly influence clinical management (60.8 %), and 70.1 % frequently refer athletes to advanced imaging compared to non-athletes. Timely access to imaging services is often limited (76.8 %). There is also an increase in referrals for older athletes (masters), who are often referred by general practitioners rather than sports doctors. The survey highlights significant shortcomings in the practice of sports cardiology in Italy, including a lack of specialist training, dedicated workflows, and multidisciplinary teams.

Automatic compensation of flowmeter drift is incorporated and inappropriate triggering of integration by diastolic artefact is prevented by applying both amplitude and duration criteria for the recognition of systolic forward flow. Early diastolic reverse flow is excluded from integration. The cardiac output, mean aortic flow per beat, and interbeat interval are also computed from the velocity signal. With aortic pressure as an additional input signal the mean arterial pressure per beat and systemic vascular resistance can be computed. The computer outputs are calibrated by a manual method.

It is all too easy (when dependent on the Internet) to consider arterial stiffness to be a new issue. The terms arterial stiffness, aortic stiffness, or wave reflection do not appear as categories for articles such as this in respectable journals, nor in categories for meetings of specialized physicians. Yet as described in this article, the subject was of interest to clinicians, to investigators such as Harvey in the 17th century, and to physicists who developed laws and principles of elasticity from the study of biological materials including ligaments and arteries. This paper provides a perspective on arterial stiffness from the time of William Harvey and Isaac Newton to the present, with a glance into the future.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27001969/"}

The greater part of its foundation was possible owing to Prof. Dimitar Arsov and Prof. Radovan Percinkovski, who was the clinic's first director in the period from 1974 to 1984. In 1985, the Clinic moved into its own new building, and in that way was physically detached from the Internal Clinics. Until its move to the new building, the Clinic functioned in the Internal Clinics building, organized as an outpatient polyclinic and inpatient infirmary department with clinical beds, a coronary intensive care unit and a haemodynamics laboratory equipped with the most modern equipment of that time. Today the Clinic functions through two integral divisions: an inpatient infirmary department which comprises an intensive coronary care unit and fourteen wards which altogether have 139 clinical beds, and the diagnostic centre which comprises an emergency clinic and day hospital, a communal and consultative outpatients' clinic functioning on a daily basis, through which some 300-350 patients pass every day, and diagnostic laboratories with a capacity of nearly 100 non-invasive and 20-30 invasive diagnostic procedures daily. The Clinic is a teaching base, and its doctors are educators of students at the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Faculties, and also of students at the High School for Nurses and X-ray technicians, but also for those in Internal Medicine and especially Cardiology. The Clinic is also a base for scientific Masters' and post-doctoral studies, and such higher degrees are achieved not only by doctors who work here, but also by doctors from Medical Centres both in the country and abroad. Doctors working in this institution publish widely, not only a great number of books and monographs, but also original scientific papers published in indexed medical journals.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23921478/"}

Alterations in the valvular assembly, displacement of the papillary muscles or dilatation of the mitral valve annulus can disrupt the normal force balance on the mitral leaflets and result in an abnormal coaptation geometry with incomplete mitral leaflet closure. The force balance imposed on the mitral leaflets is created by the coapting forces generated by the transmitral pressure difference and the tethering forces at the leaflet attachments. A unique force vector cell capable of accurately measuring the three-component force vector applied by the papillary muscle on the left-ventricular wall was designed and manufactured to permit quantification of the alteration in the force balance acting on the mitral leaflets, and to allow for the study of the influence of papillary muscle displacement on mitral regurgitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9391876/"}

Compared with earlier guidelines, the focus has changed from coronary heart disease to total cardiovascular disease prevention. A new system for predicting total cardiovascular disease mortality risk (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) is presented. Explicit clinical priorities are defined. Total cardiovascular risk should be assessed before making management decisions. Individuals with established cardiovascular disease and those with high total cardiovascular risk gain most from preventive advice.

Trials presented at the major international cardiology meetings during 2018 were reviewed including The American College of Cardiology, EuroPCR, The European Society of Cardiology, PCR London Valves, Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, and the American Heart Association. In addition to this a literature search identified several other publications eligible for inclusion based on their relevance to clinical cardiology, their potential impact on clinical practice and on future guidelines. A total of 78 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining novel stent designs (Biofreedom™, COMBO), use of drug-coated balloons in patients with high bleeding risk, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation myocardial infarction, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (alirocumab) and approaches of hypertension management. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril-valsartan during acute hospital admission and the management of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Electrophysiology data included trials examining atrial fibrillation ablation, wearable cardiac defibrillators (LifeVest) and His-bundle pacing.

Twenty cardiology residents were randomized to ST or control before performing real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. The control group underwent secondary ST and reperformed real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. Skill metrics were compared between the ST and the control group, and within the control group between before and after ST. In real-life cases, the procedure time was shorter (p = 0.002), the radiation dose lower (p = 0.001), and the global procedure skill score was higher (p = 0.0001) in the ST group as compared with the control (before ST) group. During virtual ST procedural time (p <0.001), fluoroscopic time (p <0.001), training contrast amount (p <0.001), and global training score (p <0.001) significantly decreased. In the control group, all monitoring procedure parameters were significantly improved after ST, as well as, the global procedure flow score (p <0.0001). In conclusion, simulator-based training in coronary angiography improved operator skills compared with traditional in catheterization laboratory mentor-based training.

However, the number of procedures in Europe is very far from that which would be expected on the basis of epidemiological data, particularly when comparison is made with the USA. As a preliminary step for future action aimed at improving and increasing nuclear cardiology practice in Europe, the European Council of Nuclear Cardiology performed a survey to identify the regulatory issues and the training components pertaining to the practice of nuclear cardiology. a questionnaire was sent to 31 national nuclear medicine societies and to 40 national cardiology societies. The main areas covered by the survey were: (1) the license requirements, (2) the theoretical and practical aspects of training and (3) supervision of the stress test during a nuclear cardiology study. The results show that, in a setting of wide heterogeneity of national regulations, education and professional practice, nuclear medicine is a restricted and closely regulated specialty. This situation guarantees the quality and safe use of radionuclides; at the same time, however, it limits integration of nuclear medicine into the clinical arena. Cardiologists should become more involved in nuclear cardiology, to further stimulate the use of this powerful diagnostic and prognostic imaging modality.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16909224/"}

Graphic methods for clinical pulse wave recording were introduced by Marey in Paris and by Mahomed in London last century. Mahomed showed how such recordings could be used to detect asymptomatic hypertension, and used them to chart the natural history of essential hypertension and to distinguish between this condition and chronic nephritis. Interest in arterial pulse analysis, as applied by Mahomed, lapsed with the introduction of the cuff sphygmomanometer 100 years ago. MODERN PULSE WAVE ANALYSIS: Analysis of the arterial pulse is now regaining favour as limitations of the cuff sphygmomanometer are better recognized (including the ability only to measure extremes of the pulse in the brachial artery). In addition, high-fidelity tonometers have been introduced for very accurate, non-invasive measurement of arterial pulse contour, and there is now a better understanding of arterial hemodynamics, and appreciation of disease and aging effects in humans. It is now possible to record the pulse wave accurately in the radial or carotid artery, to synthesize the ascending aortic pulse waveform, to identify systolic and diastolic periods and to generate indices of ventricular-vascular interaction previously only possible with invasive arterial catheterization. Pressure pulse wave analysis now permits more accurate diagnosis and more logical therapy than was ever possible in the past.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9120672/"}

This is the first AUC to address the topic of AS and its treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. A number of common patient scenarios experienced in daily practice were developed along with assumptions and definitions for those scenarios, which were all created using guidelines, clinical trial data and expert opinion in the field of AS. The '2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines' [1] and its 2017 focused update paper [2] were used as the primary guiding references in developing these indications. The Writing Group identified 95 clinical scenarios based on patient symptoms and clinical presentation, and up to 6 potential treatment options for those patients. A separate, independent Rating Panel was asked to score each indication from 1 to 9, with 1-3 categorized as 'Rarely Appropriate', 4-6 as 'May Be Appropriate' and 7-9 as 'Appropriate'. After considering factors such as symptom status, left ventricular function, surgical risk, and the presence of concomitant coronary or other valve disease, the Rating Panel determined that either surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement is appropriate in most patients with symptomatic AS at intermediate or high surgical risk; however, situations commonly arise in clinical practice in which the indications for surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement are less clear, including situations in which one form of valve replacement would appear reasonable when the other is less so, as do other circumstances in which neither intervention is the suitable treatment option. The purpose of this AUC is to provide guidance to clinicians in the care of patients with severe AS by identifying the reasonable treatment and intervention options available based on the myriad clinical scenarios with which patients present. This AUC document also serves as an educational and quality improvement tool to identify patterns of care and reduce the number of rarely appropriate interventions in clinical practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31089712/"}

Aim of this study is to establish the WL of 19 cardiologists (C) operating in a referral Hospital. We examined the years 1993-1995. We calculated all medical procedures (P) carried out by our Institute (\"procedure\" method), and we determined the theoretical time needed to perform them based on STD. The activities of the Coronary Unit (CCU) and of the Ward (W) have been evaluated based on the duty-time table (\"presence\" method). The sum of the hours calculated with the two methods is the theoretical duty-time per week (TDT = sigma P x STD Time + CCU hours + W hours). We then measured the actual duty-time (ADT). By comparing TDT and ADT we obtained an efficiency index EI = [(TDT - ADT)/TDT]%. The DDF has been estimated based on the waiting-lists. We noticed an increase in invasive P and related activities, and a stable trend or a small decrease in non-invasive P, except for echography. TDT was always found to be superior to ADT (1993: 731.3 vs 670; 1994: 742.7 vs 670.9; 1995: 734 vs 652.1) with an increasing IE (8.3; 9.6; 11.1 respectively). We found rather high figures for extra hours per week (mean 31.6), C time (mean 34.9) and hours lost for vacation, illness, etc. (mean 137.5/week, equal to duty-time of more than three C). When GCS was considered, the total WL was 770 hours per week, equal to a duty-time of 19.25 C. WL evaluation allows a better understanding of operating conditions ina ward, it is essential when C are committed to pursue specific objectives, and it represents a basis to monitor efficiency. The reliability of WL largely depends upon STD; this underscores the fundamental role of Scientific Societies to prevent a tool intended for a better utilisation of human resources from becoming a pure instrument of cost-containment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9244744/"}

This paper provides a guide for clinicians on relevant aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, reviews selected applications of these methods in cardiology to date, and identifies how cardiovascular medicine could incorporate artificial intelligence in the future. In particular, the paper first reviews predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization. Second, it discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and reviews selected applications in cardiology and related disciplines. Third, it describes the advent of deep learning and related methods collectively called unsupervised learning, provides contextual examples both in general medicine and in cardiovascular medicine, and then explains how these methods could be applied to enable precision cardiology and improve patient outcomes.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880128/"}

This document also examined several important challenges presented by COCATS 4. The proposed changes in COCATS 4 should not only enhance the training experience but also improve trainee satisfaction.

Functional reactions of the heart to acute loading (exercise, etc) comprise myocardial contractility, preload, pump function and peripheral factors, and are mobilized step by step in that order, to maintain normal functioning. Morphological reactions to chronic loading (hypertension etc) comprise hypertrophy and dilatation, which are caused by mechanical and nonmechanical factors, but may not always be mobilized to maintain normal functioning. Various neurohumoral factors take part in the mechanisms, and modifications, of these reactions. They act in a complex manner according to the biological conditions, and may not always act to maintain normal functioning. The biological reactions in the heart (ie, Basic Cardiology) should not be interpreted as having purpose; that is, putting a value on humankind, although medical treatment (Clinical Cardiology) and the solution of health problems in the community (Community Cardiology) should be done from this viewpoint.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10553914/"}

We sent an anonymous survey to United States cardiology program directors and their chief fellow. The survey assessed the program curricula, rotation structure, faculty expertise, obstacles, and recommended improvements. The results revealed that 24% of surveyed programs met the Core Cardiovascular Training Symposium guidelines with a dedicated 1-month rotation in preventive cardiology, 24% had no formalized training in preventive cardiology, and 30% had no faculty with expertise in preventive cardiology, which correlated with fewer rotations in prevention than those with specialized faculty (p = 0.009). Fellows rotated though the following experiences (% of programs): cardiac rehabilitation, 71%; lipid management, 37%; hypertension, 15%; diabetes, 7%; weight management/obesity, 6%; cardiac nutrition, 6%; and smoking cessation, 5%. The program directors cited \"lack of time\" as the greatest obstacle to providing preventive cardiology training and the chief fellows reported \"lack of a developed curriculum\" (p = 0.01). The most recommended improvement was for the American College of Cardiology to develop a web-based curriculum/module. In conclusion, most surveyed United States cardiology training programs currently do not adhere to basic preventive cardiovascular medicine Core Cardiovascular Training Symposium recommendations. Additional attention to developing curricular content and structure, including the creation of an American College of Cardiology on-line knowledge module might improve fellowship training in preventive cardiology.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22482864/"}

A cost construction model was used to quantify the costs of teaching faculty, cardiology fellows' salaries and benefits, overhead (physical plant, equipment, and support staff), and other costs associated with the cardiology residency program at the University of Texas-Houston during the 1996 to 1997 academic year. Surveys of cardiology faculty and fellows, checked by the program director, were conducted to determine the time spent in teaching activities; access to institutional and departmental financial records was obtained to quantify associated costs. The model was then developed and examined for a range of assumptions concerning cardiology fellows' productivity, replacement costs, and the cost allocation of activities jointly producing clinical care and education. The instructional cost of training (cost of didactic, direct clinical supervision, preparation for teaching, and teaching-related administration, plus the support of the teaching program) was estimated at $73,939 per cardiology fellow per year. This cost was less than the estimated replacement value of the teaching and clinical services provided by cardiology fellows, $100,937 per cardiology fellow per year. Sensitivity analysis, with different assumptions on cardiology fellows' productivity and replacement costs, varied the cost estimates but generally represented the cardiology residency program as an asset. Cost construction models can be used as a tool to estimate variations in resource requirements resulting from changes in curriculum or educators' costs. In this residency, the value of the teaching and clinical services provided by cardiology fellows exceeded the cost of the resources used in the educational program.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10467189/"}

This mixed-methods systematic review aimed to assess the source profile and content of Twitter and YouTube posts about heart failure (HF). We searched PubMed, Embase and Medline using the terms \"cardiology,\" \"social media,\" and \"heart failure\". We included full-text manuscripts published between January 1, 1999, and April 14, 2019. We searched Twitter and YouTube for posts using the hashtags \"#heartfailure\", \"#HF\", or \"#CHF\" on May 15, 2019 and July 6, 2019. We performed a descriptive analysis of the data. Three publications met inclusion criteria, providing 677 tweets for source profile analysis; institutions (54.8%), health professionals (26.6%), and patients (19.4%) were the most common source profiles. The publications provided 1,194 tweets for content analysis: 83.3% were on education for professionals; 33.7% were on patient empowerment; and 22.3% were on research promotion. Our search on Twitter and YouTube generated 2,252 tweets and > 400 videos, of which we analyzed 260 tweets and 260 videos. Sources included institutions (53.5% Twitter, 64.2% You- Tube), health professionals (42.3%, 28.5%), and patients (4.2%, 7.3%). Content included education for professionals (39.2% Twitter, 62.3% YouTube), patient empowerment (20.4%, 21.9%), research promotion (28.8%, 13.1%), professional advocacy (5.8%, 2.7%), and research collaboration (5.8%, 0%). Twitter and YouTube are platforms for knowledge translation in HF, with contributions from institutions, health professionals, and less commonly, from patients. Both focus largely on education for professionals and less commonly on patient empowerment. Twitter includes more research promotion, research collaboration, and professional advocacy than YouTube.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31820703/"}

On the one hand, machine learning and deep learning algorithms facilitate the management and review of ever-increasing volumes of clinical, imaging, and telemonitoring data, identifying predictive patterns and automating repetitive tasks. On the other hand, the high cost and long duration of traditional trials, coupled with the need for adequate population diversity, underscore the urgency of re-engineering trial design. AI can contribute to more adaptive study protocols, minimize interobserver variability, and improve endpoint accuracy. However, technical and ethical challenges remain, including algorithmic bias, privacy, model interpretability, and legal accountability for errors. Looking ahead, the introduction of digital biomarkers, synthetic control arms, and increasingly decentralized trials may redefine experimental paradigms and make cardiovascular trials faster, more inclusive, and more targeted.

The provision of quality healthcare faces challenges due to resource scarcity and unequal distribution, particularly affecting rural areas. Telehealth strategies have shown potential to address these challenges by improving access to specialised care. The Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) is a large-scale Brazilian public telehealth service, established in 2005 to provide telecardiology support to primary healthcare teams. Positive outcomes led to its expansion. Currently, the TNMG provides telecardiology support for 14 out of the 27 states and 1320 municipalities in Brazil, 72.1% of those with up to 20 000 inhabitants. Between 2006 and 2024, more than 9 million ECG reports were issued by the TNMG. Operational aspects include 24/7 availability, with elective ECG reports issued in a median of 41 min 30 s (Q1=6 min 44 s, Q3=1 h 32 min 24 s) and emergency reports in 47 s (Q1=22 s, Q3=1 min 55 s). Clinical alerts notify urgent conditions, facilitating timely interventions. Synchronous eConsults service support local primary care-based physicians, promoting collaborative care. TNMG's telecardiology system has facilitated scientific and technological advancements, including machine learning applications for ECG interpretation and prognostic implications. International collaborations have expanded, with ongoing projects in Africa and partnerships with prestigious institutions worldwide. Future directions involve integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into the telecardiology service to improve efficiency and prioritise critical cases. AI offers promising opportunities for enhancing medical ECG reporting and sustaining the effectiveness of telehealth services.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39828428/"}

The study sample consisted of 15 physicians from two large Midwestern hospitals, one an academic medical center and the other a medium-sized community hospital. Interventional cardiologists were identified through their online physician profile and respective departments. A questionnaire was developed to assess each physician's self-perceived adoption style, their awareness of the new technology, their participation in clinical trials, organizational support, and how various factors influence their adoption of new technology. Lastly, a database of bare metal and drug eluting stents was examined to document the number of stents used by each physician. Pragmatic and observational findings are presented from the questionnaire, physician profile, to database on stent use. The paper concludes with a discussion of the managerial and forecasting implications and methods to promote technology adoption.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16848131/"}

The aim of this paper is to describe the adoption and integration within the curriculum in one United Kingdom (UK) medical school of 'Harvey', the Cardiology Patient Simulator, and the UMedic multimedia computer-based cardiology curriculum - resources developed in a medical school in the USA. The integration of the resources into the curriculum is described by 3 teachers actively involved in the cardiology curriculum of the UK medical school and 3 teachers associated with the development of resources in the USA. ASPECTS CONSIDERED: The review considers the adoption of Harvey and UMedic in the UK in programmes in relation to: curricular issues, training needs, learning outcomes, curriculum content and sequences of content, educational strategies, teaching and learning methods, assessment, communication about the curriculum and management of the curriculum. Learning resources, in the form of simulators and computer-based learning modules, developed in one country can be successfully adopted and implemented in another. Facets that facilitated the adoption included close liaison between the developers of the resources in the USA and the implementers in the UK, and careful and systematic planning including in-depth integration of the simulation-based resources into the required curriculum rather than their relegation to a peripheral ad hoc position. The successful use of simulators such as Harvey requires the presence of a 'champion', a clinician educator and a supporting administrative staff who ensure the simulator's appropriate use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14641638/"}
{"id": "24365192", "title": "Evolving trends in interventional cardiology: endovascular options for congenital disease in adults.", "text": "As increasing numbers of patients with congenital heart disease enter adulthood, there is a growing need for minimally invasive percutaneous interventions, primarily to minimize the number of repeated surgeries required by these patients. The use of percutaneous devices is commonplace for the treatment of simple lesions, such as atrial septal defect, patent foramen ovale, patent duct arteriosus, and abnormal vascular connections. There is also substantial experience with device closure of membranous and muscular ventricular septal defects, as well as more complex shunts such as baffle leaks after atrial switch repair and ventricular pseudoaneurysms. An increasing use of covered stents has improved the safety of aortic coarctation, conduit, and branch pulmonary stenosis interventions. Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation now has an established role in the setting of dysfunctional right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduits or failing bioprosthetic pulmonary valves. Many patients remain unsuitable for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation because of large diameter \"native\" outflow tracts, however, various techniques have emerged and multiple devices are in development to provide solutions for these unique anatomic challenges. Hybrid approaches involving use of surgical and transcatheter techniques are increasingly common, serving to optimize efficacy and safety of certain procedures; they depend on a collaborative and collegial relationship between cardiac surgeons and interventionalists that is primarily patient-centred.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24365192/"}

Technological advancements and increasing clinical adoption have made radiofrequency ablation a key therapy in improving life quality for patients with conditions like atrial fibrillation (AF). Consequently, there has been a marked increase in research output, underscoring the technology's significance and its potential in cardiology. Aims to comprehensively analyze cardiology's radiofrequency ablation research trends, identifying leading countries and institutions in international collaborations, key researchers' contributions, and evolving research hotspots. The study, based on the Web of Science Core Collection database, reviewed the literatures from 2004 to 2023. CiteSpace 6.2.R7 Basic was used for bibliometric analysis, which examined annual publication trends, international collaboration networks, key authors, leading research institutions, major journals, keyword co-occurrence and clustering trends. Analyzing 3423 relevant articles, this study reveals a consistent growth in cardiology radiofrequency ablation research since 2004. The analysis shows that the United States, Germany, and France hold central roles in the international collaboration network, with leading authors from premier US and European institutions. Keyword cluster analysis identifies \"atrial flutter\" and \"ventricular tachycardia\" as current research focal points. Cardiology radiofrequency ablation research shows a growth trend, led by the United States and European countries. Research hotspots are concentrated on the diverse applications of radiofrequency ablation technology and the treatment of AF.

An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34838700/"}

This study assesses four LLMs-GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4omni (GPT-4o) (Open AI), and Gemini (Google Inc.)-in responding to questions from the 2023 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology Board Preparation Exam, reflecting the scope of the Certification Board of Nuclear Cardiology (CBNC) examination. We used 168 questions: 141 text-only and 27 image-based, categorized into four sections mirroring the CBNC exam. Each LLM was presented with the same standardized prompt and applied to each section 30 times to account for stochasticity. Performance over six weeks was assessed for all models except GPT-4o. McNemar's test compared correct response proportions. GPT-4, Gemini, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o correctly answered median percentages of 56.8% (95% confidence interval 55.4% - 58.0%), 40.5% (39.9% - 42.9%), 60.7% (59.5% - 61.3%), and 63.1% (62.5%-64.3%) of questions, respectively. GPT-4o significantly outperformed other models (P = .007 vs GPT-4 Turbo, P < .001 vs GPT-4 and Gemini). GPT-4o excelled on text-only questions compared to GPT-4, Gemini, and GPT-4 Turbo (P < .001, P < .001, and P = .001), while Gemini performed worse on image-based questions (P < .001 for all). GPT-4o demonstrated superior performance among the four LLMs, achieving scores likely within or just outside the range required to pass a test akin to the CBNC examination. Although improvements in medical image interpretation are needed, GPT-4o shows potential to support physicians in answering text-based clinical questions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39617127/"}

Over the past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations is presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores, the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction, exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced therapies as well as end of life considerations.

Geriatric cardiology melds cardiovascular perspectives with multimorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty, cognitive decline, and other clinical, social, financial, and psychological dimensions of aging. Although some assume that a cardiologist may instinctively cultivate some of these skills over the course of a career, we assert that the volume and complexity of older cardiovascular patients in contemporary practice warrants a more direct approach to achieve suitable training and a more reliable process of care.

This paper takes into account the training requirements, the relationships between different professional societies, the accessibility, the choice of imaging protocols, tracers and stressors, the impact of managed care and the role of cardiologists, nuclear physicians and technologists in nuclear labs. The economical differences which may affect the field of high technology, imply a wide range of variability concerning the availability of nuclear cardiology studies in different countries (1:1/10). Moreover the legislation which regulates the practice of nuclear medicine may differ from country to country.

Synchronized pacing (SyncP) is defined as optical recording guided real-time detection and stimulation of spatiotemporal excitable gaps. In this paper, we investigate the effect of post-shock SyncP strategy on improvement of defibrillation efficacy. After a near-threshold defibrillation shock, when the reference site detected the earliest activation of the reinitiated VF, a 5-mA electric stimulus was delivered from the post-shock pacing electrode to depolarize the excitable gap. This area of wavefront synchronization may lead to a change in the timing of VF propagation, which is important for VF termination. Here, we implemented the concept of post-shock synchronized pacing by a real-time feedback mechanism and demonstrated a successful VF termination by the post-shock SyncP strategy. Further optimization of this technique may prove effective in improving the defibrillation efficacy for low-energy ventricular defibrillation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17946240/"}

Expansion has often come at the expense of physician-scientists whose traditional role has been to bridge the gap between early preclinical research (stage I-II) and clinical trials (stage IV). Consequently, a paradigm shift has occurred, and increasing pressure has been placed on physician-scientists to choose between clinical practice and fundamental research. This shift is particularly concerning in the field of cardiovascular medicine, where the ubiquitous nature and clinical significance of cardiovascular disease make the role of the translational scientist essential. The challenges facing academic cardiologists have then further been amplified by the necessity not only to maintain clinical competence but also to maintain competence in highly technical fields with rapidly advancing technology. Potential solutions to these problems include increasing support from postgraduate training programs, increased participation of trainees in physician-scientist development programs, and recognition of the pivotal role physician-scientists play in translational research by funding agencies. Although the physician-scientist remains an endangered species, multifaceted solutions with a focus on collaboration among institutions, training programs, and funding agencies have the potential to maximize efficiency in biomedical research and successfully translate scientific discoveries from bench to bedside.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30078695/"}
{"id": "9864599", "title": "[Physiopathological basis of the treatment of heart failure].", "text": "Therapeutic advances have changed the mode of presentation of cardiac failure over the last decades: the main cause, nowadays, is myocardial ischaemia. The modern treatment of cardiac failure is based on relatively simple physiopathological mechanisms which take into account the different aspects of cardiac physiology: a pump, a muscle, a coronary circulation supplying oxygen to the myocardium, an automatic contraction. The concept of vasodilatation and the blocking of vasoconstrictive systems introduced during the 70s is the basis of modern treatment of cardiac failure which involves angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and, increasingly, betablockers. In the near future, with earlier treatment of cardiac failure, the stimulation of vasodilator systems could become a new therapeutic strategy. Early detection of ischaemia and its complications with the aim of limiting the loss of cardiac myocytes is a priority for slowing the progression of cardiac failure. The prevention of cardiac failure also depends on educating cardiologists to treat rapidly the factors predisposing to or prolonging episodes of even mild cardiac failure.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9864599/"}

Reports from individual countries show that women are underrepresented in internal medicine workforces. However, large pooled international studies are not available. This study investigates the current representation of women in the internal medicine workforce internationally and identifies specialties in which underrepresentation is evident. Peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and medical association reports were used to determine proportions of specialists and doctors training in internal medical specialties and in comparator surgical specialties. Data were available from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, the United States, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A total of 380,263 doctors were studied, including 268,822 practicing specialist physicians (also known as attendings or consultants) and 53,226 doctors in internal medicine specialty training programs (also known as residents, fellows, advanced trainees, or specialist registrar trainees). Among practicing physician specialists, the rate of representation of women was 35% (95,195/268,822, p <0.001). Among trainees, the rate of representation of women was 43% (22,728/53,226, p <0.001). Among physician specialties evaluated, cardiology (15%, 4,152 of 27,328), gastroenterology (20%, 3,765 of 18,893), and respiratory/critical care (24%, 5,255 of 21,870) had the lowest representations of women compared with men (p <0.001 for all). Cardiology and particularly the subspecialty of interventional cardiology were clear outliers as the internal medicine specialties with the lowest representation of women at practicing specialist and trainee levels. In conclusion, this study is the largest international study of women in internal medicine specialties. It found that cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory/critical care specialties have the most substantial underrepresentation of women. These data are a global call to action to establish more successful strategies to provide a diverse and representative cardiology workforce.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36216603/"}

In this respect, the inclusion of indicators based on routine data facilitates the efficient and standardized analysis of the long-term quality of treatment; however, experiences from the first feedback procedures show that the use of social data is associated with challenges. For example, for the rehospitalization rates due to heart failure nonspecific exclusions and the lack of a differentiation between comorbidities and primary complications lead to distortions. The situation is similar for the 1‑year mortality. In this case, due to the long follow-up period of 365 days a sufficient association between the quality characteristic and the service provider carrying out the index procedure is often not possible to establish using social data. In addition, documentation problems, such as discrepancies between operative data and social data make a precise assessment more difficult. Nevertheless, the QS procedure KCHK makes a substantial contribution to quality assurance by creating transparency and comparability between service providers.

In this document, the EACVI underlines major differences between echocardiography and FoCUS, and underscores the need for specific education and training in order to fully utilize advantages and minimize drawbacks of this type of cardiac ultrasound examination in the critically ill patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24866902/"}

The discovery of blood circulation by Harvey is now considered the only progress in physiology at the beginning of the XVII century, comparable to the current advances seen in physical sciences. The history of this exploit could be written from view point of the progressive advance in knowledge. In his experiments, Harvey referred to the authentic not imaginary experiments, and put forward irrefutable quantitative arguments. We can therefore claim that his discovery of blood circulation was the first proper explanation of an organic process and the starting point leading to experimental physiology. So it seems justified to assert that modern medical science did not all rise suddenly, but was gradually structured starting from the middle of the XVII century following the path traced by William Harvey in light of Galileo's thought.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554458/"}

Socioeconomic evaluation of clinical cardiology practice].", "text": "Health services are systems whose mission is to improve the health status of both individuals and society in general. In recent decades, these systems have faced challenges such as their increasing complexity, limited resources, rapid innovation and diffusion of medical technologies, pressures on demand from society and professionals, and the lack of knowledge of the effects of these factors on costs and society's health. In addition, health care expenditures have grown twice as fast as wealth in industrialized countries during the last 25 years. These problems have prompted cost containment as a key issue in health policy and, at the same time, have promoted the development of socioeconomic evaluation as a scientific activity in the frame of health services research. Socioeconomic evaluation tries to determine if the sacrifice made by society, which devotes part of its limited resources to health care, maximizes the outcomes for population. This article describes basic concepts and methods of economic appraisal in health services which are illustrated with examples of clinical practice in cardiology. Common methods of evaluation are described; the relation between the clinical outcome of a procedure and its associated costs is emphasized in explaining the types of efficiency analysis (cost-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit); and finally a guide for socioeconomic evaluation is provided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9304166/"}

These indicated a field predominantly centered in academic medicine with growth in manpower close to predicted need. The questionnaire was mailed to 844 of 884 active board-certified pediatric cardiologists and was returned anonymously by 570, a 68% response rate. Among respondents, the mean year in which fellowship training was completed was 1974. The average length of subspecialty training was 31 months for all respondents and 34 months among those completing training since 1981. Seventy-seven percent of subspecialty training centered on clinical training. Although there has been a slight increase in research training in recent years, only 18 respondents completed > or = 22 months of research training. Respondents devote a mean of 89% of professional hours to subspecialty activities and spend 63% of total hours in clinical care. Total hours, income and procedures were related to site of professional activity. Professional satisfaction was high in the factors considered more important: professional challenge and interaction, clinical resources, career security and clinical autonomy. The field of pediatric cardiology is a subspecialty centered on patient care and performance of diagnostic and interventional techniques. Professional activities varied according to practice site. Pediatric cardiologists with basic research training and professional activity remain a minority.

A large evidence base has evolved regarding the relationship between APT prescription in various clinical contexts and risk/benefit relationships. The Guidelines Committee of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology publishes regular updates of its recommendations, taking into consideration the most recent clinical evidence. The present update to the 2011 and 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society APT guidelines incorporates new evidence on how to optimize APT use, particularly in situations in which few to no data were previously available. The recommendations update focuses on the following primary topics: (1) the duration of dual APT (DAPT) in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome and non-acute coronary syndrome indications; (2) management of DAPT in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery; (3) management of DAPT in patients who undergo elective and semiurgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; (4) when and how to switch between different oral antiplatelet therapies; and (5) management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients who undergo PCI. For PCI patients, we specifically analyze the particular considerations in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical or bioprosthetic valves (including transcatheter aortic valve replacement), venous thromboembolic disease, and established left ventricular thrombus or possible left ventricular thrombus with reduced ejection fraction after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In addition to specific recommendations, we provide values and preferences and practical tips to aid the practicing clinician in the day to day use of these important agents.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29475527/"}

Numerical parameters on image quality have also been measured for different X-ray beam qualities using the plastic wall of the ionisation chamber. When moving from 1 to 10 mm of Cu, IAK per frame increased to a factor of 38 for cine and 27 for fluoroscopy. A cine frame requires 60-116 times more IAK than a fluoroscopy frame. As for PMMA, when the backscatter factor is included (simulating real conditions with patients), and when moving from 12 to 28 cm, the increases in ESAK are 16 times for cine and 10 times for fluoroscopy. Because of the differences in X-ray beam quality for cine and fluoroscopy modes, the Cu thicknesses necessary to drive the generator to equivalent kilovolts resulted in the following values (cine and fluoroscopy, respectively): 12 cm of PMMA (1 and 1.5 mm Cu), 20 PMMA (2.5 and 3.5 mm Cu) and 28 cm PMMA (4.5 and 8.5 mm Cu). With the analysis of IAK, ESAK and image quality, one can verify the appropriate settings of the X-ray system and obtain baseline information for constancy checks and help cardiologists in the management of patient doses by knowing the dose increase factors and image quality changes when increasing patient thickness or using different C-arm projections.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19617238/"}

This meeting was remarkable in the diversity of its 700 participants from English-, French- and Portuguese-speaking Africa. Important aspects of cardiovascular disease in Africa were presented in 195 abstracts and numerous talks; the topics were hypertension, obesity, diabetes, heart failure, cardiomyopathies, coronary heart disease, stroke and rheumatic heart disease. The general assembly meeting was marked by the review and adoption of a new constitution and elections of a new PASCAR governing council that will be in office for the next four years. The new leadership of PASCAR has committed itself to strengthening the administrative infrastructure of the organisation, developing programmes to address education and training needs of African cardiovascular practitioners, developing a pan-African multi-national research platform, and ensuring that ministries of health implement national programmes for the prevention and control of cardiovascular and other noncommunicable diseases.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24217160/"}

Data were collected through a self-completed questionnaire administered to Italian cardiologists in June 2007 (n = 129 respondents, 1143 observations). The questionnaire asked clinicians to make choices between paired scenarios, across which three key dimensions were identified and varied: (1) quality of clinical evidence, (2) size of health gain (reduction of relative and absolute risk), and (3) economic impact (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). A random effects probit model was used to estimate clinicians' preferences for the different dimensions, while the heterogeneity of preferences was tested in a model with interaction terms. Dominance tests were used to assess the consistency of responses. The results indicate that Italian cardiologists regard economic impact (cost-effectiveness) as an important factor in their decision making. Economic evidence is valued more highly among clinicians with a higher self-assessed level of knowledge regarding economic evaluation techniques, as well as among younger professionals (age<45). While relevant study limitations should be acknowledged, our results suggest that DCEs can be used to elicit clinicians' decision-making criteria and to inform the allocation of resources for future research in a logical manner. Italian cardiologists appear to take cost-effectiveness information into account when deciding whether to use new treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20207466/"}

The article is based on results previously delivered in historical works of other researchers and on original texts coming from the era which is the subject of the present report. The review focuses on the main topics of scientific investigation related to heart diseases - the subject of interest for physicians who are depicted herein. It should be stressed that only part of their intellectual heritage could be presented, with only a limited selection of names, articles, or books. Nevertheless, even when narrowed in scope, it shows innovativeness in many aspects of practical and scientific approaches to clinical problems. It also brings to our mind times when the dreams of many have wandered around the independence of one's homeland, dreams which finally came true in 1918. From Adam Raciborski, who was fighting in the November Uprising and then was forced to leave Polish soil, to Andrzej Klisiecki, a soldier of the resurrected Polish army, defending his country against the Bolshevik invasion in 1920, the majority of researchers would take a strong patriotic attitude and work for the benefit of society. When Poland was back on the maps of Europe, they were able to open a new chapter in their scientific research, valuing the treasure of independence.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338503/"}

Although heart failure treatment has developed rapidly and several novel approaches aimed at preventing or retarding worsening of failure are available in addition to those providing symptomatic relief, many patients are still treated inappropriately. This is particularly true for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, which, despite the fact that only slightly more than 50% of heart failure patients receive this form of therapy, should be given to all patients with the syndrome, irrespective of the severity. Heart failure patients are under the care of different types of doctors, including general practitioners (estimated 80-85%) and internists and geriatricians (10-15%); cardiologists see relatively few patients. Pertinent studies in heart failure have, however, been performed by the latter group and, in general, awareness of the clinical usefulness and prescription of ACE inhibitors is therefore highest amongst these specialists. As the management of heart failure is transmural in nature, proper education of the different echelons is mandatory. Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure are pivotal in this process. However, it is not an easy task to prepare guidelines that are applicable in all circumstances and can be used by any kind of doctor involved in heart failure care. It is even more difficult to ensure the guidelines are implemented and it requires the input of both individual doctors and the national and international medical associations. The European Society of Cardiology is dedicated to this educational process and, through its Educational and Training Programme Committee and relevant Working Groups such as the Working Group on Heart Failure, has already set programmes into motion.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9821008/"}

Professional medical associations such as the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) support these obligations. In Europe, the costs of continuing medical education (CME) are insufficiently supported from governments and employers; however, medical associations have been criticized for accepting alternative financial support from industry. Medical education and training in research include learning how to assess the quality and reliability of any information. There is some risk of bias in any form of scientific communication including intellectual, professional, and financial and it is essential that in particular, the latter must be acknowledged by full disclosure. It is essential that there is strong collaboration between basic and clinical researchers from academic institutions on the one hand, with engineers and scientists from the research divisions of device and pharmaceutical companies on the other. This is vital so that new diagnostic methods and treatments are developed. Promotion of advances by industry may accelerate their implementation into clinical practice. Universities now frequently exhort their academic staff to protect their intellectual property or commercialize their research. Thus, it is not commercial activity or links per se that have become the target for criticism but the perceived influence of commercial enterprises on clinical decision-making or on messages conveyed by professional medical organizations. This document offers the perspective of the ESC on the current debate, and it recommends how to minimize bias in scientific communications and CME and how to ensure proper ethical standards and transparency in relations between the medical profession and industry.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22383146/"}

The first is a social revolution. It has resulted in plummeting esteem for the medical profession reflecting disenchantment coupled with the rapid emergence of the recognition that health care is a right rather than a privilege. The second revolution, interventional cardiology, has provided powerful therapeutic tools demanding technical as well as cognitive expertise. The third, the revolution in molecular and cellular biology, is transforming our understanding of mechanisms underlying disease. Because of the seminal importance of progress in basic science to advances in clinical cardiology, features of these three revolutions are being synthesized in a fourth, a revolution transforming cardiology itself. Novel approaches are needed for optimal training of clinicians with diverse areas of interest, investigators in fundamental and clinical research, house staff, and students; for optimal use of clinical and research resources; and for optimal responsiveness to the needs of patients. They must be developed with cognizance of and fidelity to our clinical and scientific heritage.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8504520/"}
{"id": "4025183", "title": "The effect of cost containment on the practice of cardiology: predictions.", "text": "When health care cost containment is tied to unit pricing, the system may become price-driven rather than care-driven. Although the incentives engendered by unit pricing may not necessarily result in practices detrimental to the young or the patient with relatively pure disease, the potential for adverse effects on the elderly, the poor and the chronically ill is real. Hospitals will soon emphasize quick turnover, efficiency and intensive care. Diagnostic evaluations and chronic disease care will be moved out of hospitals into physician owned-and-operated facilities and out-of-hospital settings, respectively. The health care system will fractionate, and quality control will require restructuring to achieve the present level of quality assurance. Cardiologists, as well as other physicians, will need to alter their teaching style and teaching locations. Better methods for predicting outcomes will need to be developed; we will no longer have the safety net of following a patient closely and altering management plans according to the patient's response. Cost containment may occur under diagnosis related groups, preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations and other prepaid or \"capped\" systems. There are, however, many issues relative to cost versus quality that need to be resolved if severe detrimental effects on care are to be avoided.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4025183/"}

Once the formal requirements for Food and Drug Administration approval and insurance coverage are met, however, few systematic criteria are applied to ensure patient benefit. A more systematic policy approach regarding new technologies is needed, with input from balanced groups reviewing evidence of clinical outcomes data to determine patient benefit. This paper examines cardiac computed tomography angiography as a case study; it proposes procedures designed to ensure that the benefits of new technologies justify their costs.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211017/"}
