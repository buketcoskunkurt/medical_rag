Overall, studies have provided the most support for the modality of therapeutic exercise. Different physical modalities have similar magnitudes of effects on chronic pain. Therefore, selection of the most appropriate physical modality may depend on the desired functional outcome for the patient, the underlying impairment, and the patient's preference or prior experience with the modality. Certain patient characteristics may decrease the effectiveness of physical modalities, as has been seen with TENS. These characteristics include depression, high trait anxiety, a powerful others locus of control, obesity, narcotic use, and neuroticism. The effect on pain by various modalities is generally strongest in the short-term period immediately after the intervention series, but effects can last as long as 1 year after treatment (e.g., with massage). Most research has tested the effect of physical modalities on chronic low back pain and knee OA. The effectiveness of physical modalities for other chronic pain conditions needs to be evaluated more completely. Older and younger adults often experience similar effects on their perception of pain from treatment with physical modalities. Therefore, use of these modalities for chronic pain in older adults is appropriate, but special precautions need to be taken. Practitioners applying physical modalities need formal training that includes the risks and precautions for these modalities. If practitioners lack formal training in the use of physical modalities, or if modality use is not within their scope of practice, it is important to consult with and refer patients to members of the team who have this specialized training. Use of a multidisciplinary approach to chronic pain management is of value for all adults and older individuals in particular [79-81]. Historically, physical therapists have been trained to evaluate and treat patients with the range of physical modalities discussed in this article. Although members of the nursing staff traditionally have used some of these modalities (e.g. some forms of heat or cold and massage), increasing numbers of nurses now are being trained to apply more specialized procedures (e.g., TENS). Healthcare professionals must be knowledgeable about the strength of evidence underlying the use of physical modalities for the management of chronic pain. Based on the limited research evidence available (especially related to assistive devices, orthotics, and thermal modalities), it often is difficult to accept or exclude select modalities as having a potential role in chronic pain management for adults and older individuals. Improved research methodologies are needed to address physical modality effectiveness better.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14567204/"}

Regular physical therapy with trained physiotherapists is recommended in the guidelines. Recently, digital physical therapy offered by digital health interventions was shown to be effective. However, the evidence on its real-world usage in health care systems is limited. Based on claims data, this study examined the current usage of digital health applications (DiGAs) for musculoskeletal disorders in the German health care system. Patients with standalone digital physical therapy were compared to those with a combination of analog and digital physical therapy. In addition, predictors for concomitant use were identified. This retrospective cohort study analyzed claims data from Germany's largest statutory health insurance. Patients who used DiGA for musculoskeletal disorders at least once were included. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients receiving standalone and concomitant physical therapy were compared. Statistical analyses comprised univariate analyses and binomial logistic regression. Of the 6090 individuals, 58.2% (3543/6090) were prescribed physical therapy within 6 months before or after DiGA prescription. In this population, 36.3% (2210/6090) used DiGA and analog physical therapy at the same time. Concomitant physical therapy was significantly more likely in patients with chronicity risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.31-1.69; P<.001) or established chronicity (OR 2.76, 95% CI 2.22-3.47; P<.001), female gender (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.33-1.66; P<.001), and higher age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.02; P<.001).

We sent a questionnaire to 600 physicians in three medical specialties (neurology, orthopedic surgery, and physical medicine and rehabilitation), in four geographic regions of the United States. The usable return was 41 percent. Overall knowledge, technical knowledge, and professional knowledge scores were compared by medical specialty, region of the country, years in practice, and three measures of utilization using analysis of variance, student's t, and chi-square statistics. Physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists and physicians in practice 10 years or more had the most knowledge of physical therapy procedures. Respondents preferred a prescriptive relationship when referring patients to physical therapists, and they most often selected \"technical\" procedures traditionally associated with the profession rather than \"professional\" procedures when referring patients to physical therapy. Those practicing medicine in their specialty 10 years or more were more conservative in their referral preferences than those in practice less than 10 years. The implications for educational intervention concerning the professional role of the physical therapist are briefly discussed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6483981/"}

Other states have enacted direct access legislation enabling consumers to obtain physical therapy without a physician referral. Critics of direct access cite potential overutilization of services, increased costs, and inappropriate care. Using paid claims data for the period 1989 to 1993 from Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Maryland, a direct access state, we compiled episodes of physical therapy for acute musculoskeletal disorders and categorized them as direct access (n = 252) or physician referral (n = 353) using algorithms devised by a clinician advisory panel. Relative to physician referral episodes, direct access episodes encompassed fewer numbers of services (7.6 versus 12.2 physical therapy office visits) and substantially less cost ($1,004 versus $2,236). Direct access episodes were shorter, encompassed fewer numbers of services, and were less costly than those classified as physician referral episodes. There are several potential reasons why this may be the case, such as lower severity of the patient's condition, overutilization of services by physicians, and underutilization of services by physical therapists. Concern that direct access will result in overutilization of services or will increase costs appears to be unwarranted.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8996459/"}

Many members and nonmembers, however, appear confused and perhaps even intimidated by the concept of autonomous practice. This paper will review and discuss the processes used by other health care professions to gain autonomy within the US health care system. In particular, the processes used by physicians, which were extremely effective and have been used as a template by many other health professions, including physical therapy. Further discussion will focus on the physical therapy profession, emphasizing the parallels with medicine and considering many issues relevant to the goal of autonomous practice. By understanding the past and considering the present, readers will develop an appreciation of (1) the foundation for autonomous practice in health care, (2) the vision of the APTA and why the profession is well positioned to achieve this vision, and (3) the factors we need to consider to hold (and maintain) all privileges of autonomous practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16294983/"}

One of four versions of two physical therapy problems was mailed to 500 randomly selected physical therapists. Therapists were asked to define reliability and error of measurement, to estimate the error of measurement of two assessments, and to make decisions about an intervention based on specific measurements. They were also asked to rate their confidence in those decisions. Problems varied on the presence or absence of measurement information and on the difference between an observed measurement and a criterion measurement against which the observed measurement must be compared to make a decision. The response rate was 62%; respondents represented a typical profile of practicing physical therapists. The therapists understood reliability, but they did not correctly describe the relationship between reliability and error of measurement. Their estimates of the error of measurement of the two assessments were reasonable for only one procedure. The presence or absence of measurement information and difference between observed and criterion measurements affected their confidence, albeit inappropriately, in only one problem. Confidence was not affected by the therapists' level of experience, type of reading, formal study, or degree earned. Therapists responded to the two problems differently. The problems involved different measures, roles, utilities, and structures. The process of decision making does not generalize to all decision types. Measurement principles and strategies of use in decision making must be emphasized in physical therapy curricula so that physical therapists can consider the quality of their assessment data in making clinical decisions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1409884/"}

Results showed that female physical therapists, when employed full time in Maryland as department managers, on average, earned significantly less than their male counterparts. A significant difference existed between male and female department managers for full-time work experience in physical therapy. Neither the number of management courses taken nor seniority in an organization were significantly different for male and female physical therapists, regardless of managerial level.

Is it worth the risk? A comparison of risks versus benefits indicates that at present, the risks of cervical manipulation outweigh the benefits: manipulation has yet to be shown to be more effective for neck pain and headache than other interventions such as mobilisation, whereas the risks, although infrequent, are serious. This analysis is of particular concern because the conditions for which manipulation is indicated are benign and usually self-limiting. Because physiotherapists have legal and ethical obligations to the community to avoid foreseeable harm and provide optimum care, it may be prudent to determine who in our profession should perform cervical manipulation. That is, the profession could restrict the practice of cervical spine manipulation. Although all registered physiotherapists in Australia are entitled to perform cervical manipulation, few choose to use this intervention. Therefore, it might be feasible to encourage those practitioners who wish to use cervical manipulation to undertake formal education programs. Such a requirement could be embodied in a code of practice that discourages those without formal training from performing cervical manipulation. By taking such measures, we could ensure that our profession exercises wisdom in its monitoring and use of cervical manipulation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12217065/"}

A survey questionnaire was distributed to 490 physical therapists in clinics affiliated with the academic programs of Ithaca College and Temple University. Forty-five percent (221) of the distributed surveys were returned. Descriptive statistics and chi-square calculations were used in the data analysis. Respondents frequently used two forms of pulsed current and rarely used two forms of alternating current. No form of electrical current was used as frequently as ultrasound. The frequency and type of electrical stimulation used depended on the availability of electrical stimulators and the adequacy of entry-level training in electrotherapy.

Specifically, this research investigated how the accreditation on-site visit may serve as a method for defining the dominant values of a developing profession. A set of criteria selected from the literature describing the process of professionalization served as an operational model of professional values for the study. The model served as the framework for analysis and categorization of the professional values that evaluators emphasized during the on-site visits. The qualitative data collection methods of interview, nonparticipant observation, and document analysis were used in constructing case studies of five physical therapy education program accreditation visits. Results of this research indicated that on-site evaluators represent an elite community within the field and share similar values about the profession. These shared values about the professionalization of physical therapy formed the basis for evaluators' interpretation of accreditation standards. Evaluators' emphasis on the professional values that focus on defining and validating the body of knowledge in physical therapy and faculty endorsement of the norms of the academic work place have implications for the continued professionalization of physical therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3174834/"}

The purpose of this study was to describe a method to create treatment categories used for patients with low back pain. We surveyed physical therapists in Virginia to identify frequently used treatments for patients with low back pain. One hundred fifty-five surveys were completed. Twenty-eight treatments, used frequently or very frequently by 50% or more of the respondents, were retained for analysis. Factor analysis was used to identify treatment categories. Seven categories were identified: McKenzie approach, manual therapy, exercise with equipment, active and stretching exercise, physical agents, aerobic exercise and walking, and ergonomic activities. Indices for the categories were created. Confirmatory factor analyses should be performed on a different sample to validate these findings.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8938602/"}

Parallel-forms intratester reliability for ankle AROM measurements obtained by the universal goniometer (UG) and by visual estimation (VE) and intertester reliability for VE of ADF and APF were examined. Repeated measurements were obtained on 38 patients with orthopedic problems by 10 physical therapists in a clinical setting. For intratester reliability of measurements obtained with UG, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for all physical therapists were 0.64 to 0.92 (median, 0.825) for ADF and 0.47 to 0.96 (median, 0.865) for APF. Intertester reliability was quantified with use of ICC. ICCs for measurements obtained by UG were 0.28 for ADF and 0.25 for APF; ICC of VE for ADF was 0.34 and was 0.48 for APF. ICC for parallel-forms intratester reliability obtained with UG and VE ranged from 0 to 0.94 (median, 0.58) for ADF and 0 to 0.86 (median, 0.625) for APF. Thus, a physical therapist should use a goniometer when making repeated measurements of ankle joint AROM. Considerable inconsistency exists when two or more physical therapists make repeated goniometric and visual measurements of ankle motion on the same subject. Physical therapists may erroneously conclude that a patient's AROM has changed because of treatment when the change could be attributed to a lack of intertester reliability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8215866/"}

This study's purpose was to investigate whether quantitatively augmented feedback could enhance the learning of joint mobilization and, more specifically, to compare the effects of training with concurrent or terminal feedback by using a joint translation simulator (JTS). Thirty-six undergraduate physical therapist students were randomly assigned to control (no feedback), concurrent feedback, and terminal feedback groups. The JTS was designed to simulate tissue resistance based on load-displacement relationships of glenohumeral joint specimens. Subjects applied specific mobilization grades of force on the JTS while quantitative feedback was given to the feedback groups either during a trial (ie, concurrent feedback) or after a trial (ie, terminal feedback). The skill acquisition phase lasted a total of 40 minutes, and a total of 75 repetitions were performed for each grade of each joint model. Pretest and no-feedback retention tests were conducted. During acquisition and retention, both feedback groups performed more accurately than did the control group. No obviously superior performance was shown by the terminal feedback group compared with concurrent feedback group during retention testing. Subjects who trained with augmented feedback had less variability, and thus more consistency, than the control group subjects who received no feedback. Augmented feedback provides the student with a reference force and the status of his or her performance. The effectiveness of the JTS feedback compared with no feedback was clearly demonstrated. Skill acquisition in mobilization can be enhanced by either concurrent or terminal feedback.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17341511/"}

It is advocated that attention must not be restricted to either clinical decision making or communication, but needs to be directed towards the relationship between communication and diagnostic approaches. In other words, in order to understand how a health problem is defined, the complexity and social organization of the process of interaction cannot be ignored. Therapies are chosen and cooperation is built on such socially and professionally constructed basis, and it is suggested that the nature of this construction needs to be grasped. To this end, the author analyses both the therapists' examination and the communication between patient and therapist. Focus is thereby shifted from the 'pure' diagnostic activity to the frame of reference underlying it. The analysis demonstrates differences in the two therapists' practice from the very moment patient and therapist greet one another till they say farewell.

A systematic review.", "text": "Child and adolescent conversion disorder has the potential to impart significant burden on health-care services and affect quality of life. Clinically, physiotherapists are involved in conversion disorder management; however, no systematic reviews have examined physiotherapy effectiveness in its management. The aim of this review is to identify the efficacy of physiotherapy management of child and adolescent conversion disorder. A search of multiple databases (Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO, PEDro and the Cochrane Library) was completed along with manual searching of relevant reference lists to identify articles including children 0-18 years with a diagnosis of conversion disorder who received physical management. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts using criteria. Data were extracted regarding study characteristics, functional outcome measures, length of stay, physiotherapy service duration and resolution of conversion symptoms. Methodological quality was assessed using a tool designed for observational studies. Twelve observational studies were included. No functional outcome measures were used to assess the effectiveness of the treatment protocols in the case studies. Resolution of symptoms occurred in all but two cases, with conversion symptoms still present at 11 months and at 2 years.

National and international databases within the medical field (Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, PubMed …) have been searched for German and English articles that dealt with climbing in a therapeutic context. Only a limited amount of scientific investigations regarding the effects of therapeutic climbing were found. Evidence for the effectiveness of this form of climbing was only found in the field of orthopedics. Other published results were field reports or individual case studies which did not make any reliable statements/conclusions. Based on the current review, therapeutic climbing cannot be wholly recommended as an interventional method. However, this should not be interpreted as a refusal to use therapeutic climbing as an intervention. The use of systematic analysis in studying the general effects of climbing movements as well as comparisons to classical interventional methods is necessary.

It also should help clarify, however, what decision analysis is not: This is not a practical method for making most decisions in everyday clinical practice. The process of carrying out all the steps in a full, formal analysis is much too time consuming to be applied to the dozens of important decisions clinicians make each day. The method should be used selectively to ensure that the time invested in analysis will pay off in a practical way in practice. Formal analyses should be attempted only for decisions that are made frequently, have important consequences, and provoke some sort of significant controversy, uncertainty, or discontent with the results less formal-decision making achieves. Decision analysis is not a substitute for all other methods of decision making. To suggest that this is the only tool clinicians need would be a little like suggesting that a balanced diet could consist exclusively of broccoli. Intuitive judgments, use of theoretical models, knowledge-problem coupling, and hypothesis-oriented algorithms for clinicians all provide important tools for improving patient care. Often these tools can be combined effectively with decision analysis, but at other times they will be superior on their own. Decision analysis is not an entirely unfamiliar method, and it does not always need to include all component steps to be useful.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2500674/"}

The purpose of this case report was to describe the implementation, evaluation, and sustainment process of incorporating a physical therapy neurologic outcome measure CPG in a physical therapy student run pro bono clinic. A mixed methods study, using the Knowledge to Action framework, was completed to standardize the outcome measures completed on patients with neurologic conditions who received services at a physical therapy student run pro bono clinic. The project was titled iKNOW (integrating KNOWledge translation) Super Six. Chart audits, surveys, and focus groups revealed success in implementing a CPG promoting standardization of practice in a student run pro bono clinic. Students reported that environmental modifications and the availability of resources were strong facilitators of completing the measures. Differences existed between cohorts in perceived usefulness of peer support. To sustain use of the neurologic outcome measures as recommended by the CPG, efforts to enhance awareness, leverage peer support, maximize environmental facilitators, along with audit and feedback will continue.

Only 6.8% received physical therapy within 30 days of their LAS diagnosis, 94.1% of which performed therapeutic exercise, 52.3% received manual therapy, and 50.2% received modalities. The annual cost associated with physician visits, diagnostic imaging, orthopedic devices, and physical therapy was 152 million USD, 81.5% was from physician evaluations, 7.9% from physical therapy, 7.2% from diagnostic imaging, and 3.4% from orthopedic devices. Most patients with LAS do not receive supervised rehabilitation. The small proportion of patients with LAS to receive physical therapy get rehabilitation prescribed in accordance with clinical practice guidelines.

A mixed design ANOVA compared participants' total scores and individual Core Value scores on the Professionalism in Physical Therapy: Core Values Self-Assessment (PPTCVSA) after 3 and 33 weeks of clinical education. The effects of gender, age, and undergraduate area of study on growth in professionalism scores were also investigated. Total PPTCVSA scores and individual Core Value scores on professionalism (accountability, altruism, compassion/caring, excellence, integrity, professional duty, and social responsibility) were higher after 33 weeks compared to scores after 3 weeks of clinical education. Female student's total professionalism scores were higher than male student's scores on both the first and second self-assessments.

Ratio-scaled data are necessary, for example, to report muscle performance characteristics in terms of ratios or percentages or in the form of ratios with another muscle (eg, ratio of hamstring to quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque). The purpose of this study was to determine the error associated with the gravity-correction procedure of the Kin-Com dynamometer when a weight or limb segment is weighed at different lever arm positions. A known weight was suspended from the lever arm of the Kin-Com dynamometer. The rotational component of gravitational forces on the weight was measured at 11 different angular positions. We compared the force measurement obtained from the Kin-Com with the predicted rotational component at each angular position. The gravitational forces on a subject's limb segment (leg) were then measured at 12 different angular positions in each of two trunk positions (sitting and supine). We compared the force measurement obtained from the Kin-Com with the predicted rotational component for each position. Forces measured for the two trunk positions with the lever arm horizontal were compared. Forces measured with the knee extended were compared with forces measured with the lever arm horizontal. The dynamometer accurately recorded the rotational component of gravitational forces for the weight suspended from the lever arm. There was a progressively greater discrepancy between measured forces and predicted forces for the leg as the lever arm was moved from horizontal to 50 degrees below the horizontal. The force recorded with the Kin-Com was greater when the subject's knee was in full extension than when the lever arm was horizontal, which placed the subject's knee in a flexed position. A small difference was noted between the measured forces with the lever arm horizontal when the subject was sitting compared with when the subject was positioned supine. When weighing a leg with this dynamometer, we recommend that the lever arm be as close to the horizontal position as possible. Positions of proximal joints should be chosen that do not put two joint muscles in stretched positions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7991654/"}

A total of 208 clinicians representing 41% of the population sample, responded to the survey. Results indicated hot packs followed by ultrasound, ice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential were the most frequently used modalities. With the exception of ultrasound, these findings differed considerably from previous reports of modality usage. Statistical comparisons, using Fisher's exact test of independence, revealed frequent use of TENS was greater amongst older clinicians and clinic owners (p < 0.05) while male therapists used biofeedback more often than female colleagues (p < 0.05).

The very weakest group is unable to make use of existing offers of rehabilitation. The objective of the investigation was to develop and test a model for functional training of weak, elderly people in their own home. The process was assessed in eight cases. The elderly were selected consecutively on discharge from two geriatric wards as those who could be rehabilitated, but who were too weak to undergo the usual process. Training was supported by the regular home help assigned to the old person and carried out under the supervision of a geriatrician and a physiotherapist. An external-qualitative evaluation of the programme is published elsewhere. In collaboration with the elderly people and the home help, the project team succeeded in forming and implementing a training scheme based on the expectations that the elderly people had to rehabilitation. Of the eight patients taking part in the investigation, five realised their wishes for a greater degree of mobility and for being able to get out-of-doors. The model developed, where the home help acts as the central figure in the implementation of the rehabilitation of enfeebled, old persons under the supervision of a physiotherapist and a geriatrician, is an interesting alternative to the existing programmes for rehabilitation of elderly people in their own home.

To investigate current physiotherapeutic management of low back pain throughout Britain and Ireland. Physiotherapists play a key role in low back pain management. Although clinical guidelines for best practice have been developed recently, there has been no large-scale attempt to describe current physiotherapeutic treatment approaches within Britain or Ireland. After semi-structured interviews (n = 6) and two pilot studies (n = 77) were done, postal questionnaires were distributed to four regional cluster samples of the membership of two physiotherapy professional organizations (n = 2654). After two mailings, a random sample of 90 nonresponders were followed up. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Ltd., Woking, Surrey, UK), and precision of the survey estimates was assessed by calculation of sampling errors and intraclass correlation coefficients for cluster sampling. Results were received from 1548 therapists (total response rate, 58.3%); of these, 813 reported that they were practicing in settings in which they treated patients with low back pain. Analysis of the results indicated the overall popularity of the Maitland mobilization and McKenzie approaches among physiotherapists. Although exercise per se was mentioned frequently by respondents, a marked difference in opinion among therapists regarding the optimal type of exercise for low back pain was obvious. Little evidence was demonstrated of the use of manipulation, fitness programs, or multidisciplinary efforts involving behavioral and physical aspects of treatment. Commonly used methods of electrotherapy were interferential therapy, ultrasound, pulsed short-wave diathermy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The results of this study emphasize the need to evaluate further and improve the dissemination of findings regarding the effectiveness of specific physiotherapy approaches for low back pain management.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10404576/"}

The amount of sacral and lower thoracic rotation that occurred during loading between 30 and 100 N was also recorded. A small but significant variation of stiffness with direction of applied force was found. At L3, mean stiffness was greatest when the posteroanterior force was applied in a base direction; it was 11% less when the force was applied 10 degrees more caudad than the base direction and 14% less when the force was applied 10 degrees more cephalad than the base direction. There was no significant effect of direction when the force was applied at L5. Both sacral and thoracic rotations displayed significant variation with direction of force when load was applied at L5, with decreasing rotation as the force was applied in a more caudal direction. Posteroanterior stiffness in individuals without back pain is affected by the sagittal plane direction in which the posteroanterior force is applied to the lumbar spine. Remote (thoracic and sacral) movements are also affected by the direction of posteroanterior force. Direction of applied force should therefore be controlled, particularly in the research setting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11208218/"}

Sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent TKR surgery during the years 2007-2009. We used regression analysis to evaluate the effect of physician self-referral on the following outcomes: (1) time from discharge to first physical therapy visit; (2) episode length; (3) number of physical therapy visits per episode; (4) number of physical therapy service units per episode; and (5) number of physical therapy services per episode expressed in relative value units. TKR patients who underwent physical therapy treatment at a physician-owned clinic received on average twice as many physical therapy visits (8.3 more) than patients whose TKR surgery was performed by a orthopedic surgeon who did not self-refer physical therapy services (p < .001). Regression-adjusted results show that TKR patients treated at physician-owned clinics received almost nine fewer physical therapy service units during an episode compared with patients treated by nonself-referring providers (p < .001). In relative value units, this difference was 4 (p < .001). In contrast, episodes where the orthopedic surgeon owner does not profit from physical therapy services rendered to the patient look virtually identical to episodes where the TKR surgery was performed by a surgeon nonowner. Physical therapists not involved with physician-owned clinics saw patients for fewer visits, but the composition of physical therapy services rendered during each visit included more individualized therapeutic exercises.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913811/"}

Two hundred fifty occupational therapists were randomly selected from the American Occupational Therapy Association's Physical Disabilities Special Interest Section. The practitioners were surveyed about their use of, education in, competency testing for, and opinions on eight physical agent modalities. Results were based on 100 responses (40% response rate). Of the eight modalities, the most commonly used were hot and cold packs, and the least were transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators. The most common means of education was on-the-job training, and the least common was higher level accredited education. A majority (71) of respondents reported that no competency testing was being performed at their facilities. In the remaining facilities (29), the majority performed competency tests with no routine frequency, using no particular guidelines for testing and no formal methods for maintaining standards for physical agent modality use. Eighty-five respondents indicated they would be interested in attending continuing education programs on the use of physical agent modalities, and 88 believed that functional activities should follow the use of physical agent modalities within the same treatment session.

The World Confederation for Physical Therapy describes physiotherapy as providing services to people and populations to develop, maintain, and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. Physiotherapists working with terminally ill patients face a myriad of ethical issues which have not been substantially discussed in bioethics especially in the African perspective. In the face of resource limitation in developing countries, physiotherapy seems to be a cost-effective means of alleviating pain and distressing symptoms at the end-of-life, ensuring a more dignified passage from life to death, yet referrals to physiotherapy are not timely. Following extensive literature search using appropriate keywords, six core ethical themes related to physiotherapy in terminally ill patients were identified and using the four principles of bioethics (patient's autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice), an ethical analysis of these themes was done to highlight the ethical challenges of physiotherapists working in a typical African setting such as Nigeria.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26620621/"}

While clinical practice guidelines have been established in an attempt to reduce costs and healthcare utilization, it is unclear if adherence to physical therapy guidelines for those with LBP is efficacious. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess current evidence and evaluate the impact of physical therapy guideline adherence on subsequent healthcare costs and utilization for patients with LBP. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO Host), AMED (Ovid), and PEDro. Studies included in this review were published in peer reviewed journals and the primary mode of treatment was administered by a physical therapist. Also, the definition of adherence was clearly defined based on claims data and at least one measure of cost or utilization reported. Quality assessment was evaluated via a modified Downs and Black checklist. Due to the conceptual heterogeneity in variable measurements, data were qualitatively synthesized and stratified by reported utilization and cost measures. A total of 256 results were identified and after omitting duplicates, 4 articles were retained, which were all retrospective in nature. Quality scores ranged between 19 and 21 points out of a possible 26 on the modified Downs and Black checklist. All identified studies used the same definition of guideline adherence, which focused on billing active codes and minimizing use of passive codes. The results demonstrated trends that, with a few exceptions, suggested those patients with LBP that were treated with an adherent guideline program demonstrated decreased healthcare utilization and an overall healthcare savings. Preliminary evidence suggests that adherence to established clinical practice guidelines may assist with decreasing healthcare utilization and costs. Additional research based on prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to provide high quality evidence regarding the impact of guideline adherence among patients with LBP.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27285608/"}

Each PT performed each test on the same healthy volunteer for 20 s, on three separate occasions, at intervals of one week using a specially constructed examination table which registered pressure force. The PTs were capable of maintaining a relatively constant pressure force for 20 s. The intra-test reliability was acceptable even though there were individual differences on different occasions between those PTs who used the SI joint tests often and those who seldom or never used them. The inter-test reliability was insufficient.

There is a clear link between reduced proprioceptive input, altered slow motor unit recruitment and the development of chronic pain states. Dysfunction in the global and local muscle systems is presented to support the development of a system of classification of muscle function and development of dysfunction related to musculoskeletal pain. The global muscles control range of movement and alignment, and evidence of dysfunction is presented in terms of imbalance in recruitment and length between the global stability muscles and the global mobility muscles. Direction related restriction and compensation to maintain function is identified and related to pathology. The local stability muscles demonstrate evidence of failure of adequate segmental control in terms of allowing excessive uncontrolled translation or specific loss of cross-sectional area at the site of pathology. Motor recruitment deficits present as altered timing and patterns of recruitment.

In this article, the focus is on the economic determinants of physiotherapist behaviour in The Netherlands. It is shown that relative prices work as strong incentives to alter the mix of services supplied, conform to the model of revenue maximization under a production constraint. However, the time-series analysis also gives some indication that this ability to influence the demand for their services to increase hourly income is not fully exploited. The latter finding is inconsistent with pure income maximization but rather points to a trade-off between loss of revenue and demand manipulation. The fact that the choice of therapy varies with the pressure on provider incomes does not cast some doubt on the appropriateness of the chosen patterns of treatment in terms of effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3616685/"}

A computer-aided and manual search for published RCTs investigating treatment and prevention of SUI using physical therapies, e.g. pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises, with or without other treatment modalities, were carried out. The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using criteria based on generally accepted principles of interventional research. Twenty-four RCTs (22 treatment and two prevention) were identified; the methodological quality of the studies included was moderate and 11 RCTs were of sufficient quality to be included in further analysis. Based on levels-of-evidence criteria, there is strong evidence to suggest that PFM exercises are effective in reducing the symptoms of SUI. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of high-intensity vs a low-intensity regimen of PFM exercises. Despite significant effects of biofeedback after testing as an adjunct to PFM exercises, there is no evidence that PFM exercises with biofeedback are more effective than PFM exercises alone. There is little consistency (of stimulation types and parameters) in the studies of electrical stimulation, but when the results are combined there is strong evidence to suggest that electrostimulation is superior to sham electrostimulation, and limited evidence that there is no difference between electrostimulation and other physical therapies. In the prevention of SUI the efficacy of PFM exercises, with or without other adjuncts, is uncertain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9722751/"}

The analysis of the attributes of modern physical therapy has been undertaken with special reference to the definitions of the concepts, categories, classifications, therapeutic physical factors, and physical treatment methods that provide the basis of modern physical therapy. The directions of scientific and practical development of physiotherapy in the currently adopted system of organization of the medical care services in Russia are determined. The discussion presents arguments for the introduction of new concepts, terms, classifications, and treatment methods. The prerequisites for the formation of such notions and ideas, their composition and structure as well as the role of the therapeutic physical factors in the system of treatment and preventive measures are considered. The basic methodological approaches (both evidence-based and systematic) which are in line with modern physiotherapeutic research programs are substantiated. Special attention is given in the article to the currently adopted system of the training of physiotherapists accepting present-day ideas and practicing modern approaches in their practical work. The principal way to carry out this task under the present-day conditions is through education in a three-stage manner in accordance with the main categories of physical therapy. The current status and assessment of the use of the concepts of evidence-based and translational medicine in physiotherapy are discussed together with the prospects for its further systematic development and practical application.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29388935/"}

The project is the result of collaborative research between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany (PTB, DE), the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL, UK) and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, Prevention and Health (TNO-PG, NL). The work has been undertaken under the 4th Framework Programme of the European Community (EC). Primary standard designs of radiation force balances based on both absorbing and reflecting targets have been constructed. To avoid heating effects, the measurements should be done relatively quickly (10 to 20 s). The methods have been validated using ultrasound (US) transducers that demonstrated an adequate short and long-term stability; a method to detect cavitation based on monitoring the acoustic signals produced by bubble oscillation and collapse has been confirmed. It has been shown that only the detection of the subharmonic can be used in practice as cavitation detector. Different procedures for obtaining degassed water have been investigated. A method showing significant promise to be used in a clinical or manufacturer's environment involves the addition of sodium sulphite (Na2SO3). During the validation process, commercially available radiation force balances and ultrasonic physiotherapy devices have also been evaluated. Limitations of current measurement methods and practices, including power measurements made on transducers exhibiting a diverging beam, have been identified. It has been shown that a reflecting target is not appropriate to measure powers of transducers with a ka-value < 30. Based on beam shape and target distance, it has been shown also that proper power measurements using a 45 degrees convex-conical reflecting target can never be performed for transducers with a ka-value < 17.4.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11369129/"}

This research follows an earlier study which investigated the accuracy and inter-rater reliability of auscultating tape-recorded lung sounds in a 'non-specialized' cohort of physical therapists. The subjects were 26 'specialized' cardiorespiratory physical therapists working in acute urban teaching hospitals. These individuals were required to have been practising currently and exclusively for at least one year in the area of cardiorespiratory physical therapy. Participants listened with a stethoscope to five different sounds and identified them from a standardized list of terms. One of three tapes with the same lung sounds in different order was randomly selected for each physical therapist. The percentage of correct answers for all subjects was calculated. An accurate response in the detection of lung sounds was arbitrarily defined as a percentage of correct answers of 70% or greater. The difference between the pooled correct response rate of 50% and the arbitrarily set value of 70% was statistically significant (z = 2.23, p < 0.05), indicating that the 'specialized' physical therapists were not accurate in identifying lung sounds. There was no relationship evident between the accuracy and the number of years of cardiorespiratory 'specialization' (r = 0.08).

The understanding of the mode of action regarding physiotherapeutic methods with analgetic effects is due to the knowledge about the pathophysiologic relationship between inflammation and pain. On one hand, the information of pain from the periphery causes a sensibilisation of central nervous areas and therefore allodynia as well as irradiation of the painful area. On the other hand, biochemical processes lead to a neurogenic and alogenic inflammation due to the impact on the pain nerves. Beside the arthritis itself, the physiotherapy of a rheumatic-inflamed painful joint has to take into account the components arthralgia, irritation of the capsula, periarthropathia, and allogenic inflammation. Physiotherapeutic pain treatment has three modes of action: a causal effect on the structural level, suppression of over-excitation of the tissue as well as the central nervous transmission areas, and activation of the decelerating pain modulating systems. Each treatment procedure with analgetic effects like cooling, heating, localized mechanical methods, the activation techniques with proprio- and exteroceptive effects (TENS, Maitland-mobilisation), the electrotherapeutic option, and physical training therapy is characterized with its specific mode of action. The dosage of physiotherapeutic techniques has to be taken into account since it has to remain within physiologic limits and the tissue's irritability must not be reached.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10478427/"}

{"id": "8677280", "title": "Temporal stability of gait in Parkinson's disease.", "text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Evaluation of physical therapy for gait disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) requires an under-standing of how the patients' medication cycle affects function. Four experiments were conducted to investigate stability of gait variables. METHODS AND RESULTS. In experiment 1, 15 subjects with idiopathic PD and 15 subjects without PD performed two sets of gait trials spaced 30 minutes apart, with the initial trial conducted with the subjects at a peak dose of medication. Strong correlations, as determined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC[2,1]), occurred between repeat measures of speed (ICC = .92), cadence (ICC = .92), stride length (ICC = .94), and time spent in double support (DS) (ICC = .93). In experiment 2, 16 subjects with PD were tested at the same time on two consecutive days. There was good repeatability for speed (ICC = .88), cadence (ICC = .85), stride length (ICC = .84), and DS (ICC = .80). When we assessed the repeatability of measurements taken at peak dose and at end of dose, there were low correlations for speed (ICC = -.54), cadence (ICC = -.07), stride length (ICC = -.35), and DS (ICC = -.38). In a final experiment on 16 subjects with PD, we used time-series analysis to examine the stability of measurements taken every 15 minutes for 2 1/2 hours. Slopes of regression models, standard deviations, and residual autocorrelations were negligible, indicating that the measurements were stable. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION. The parkinsonian gait pattern is reproducible across either brief time intervals or 24 hours when peak medication prevails. At the end of dose, however, marked changes in gait occur, apparently related to depletion of medication.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8677280/"}

The present study aimed to test whether these benefits could be maintained when the manometer is withdrawn and whether the availability of a manometer affects the pressures delivered under changing respiratory compliances. Manual hyperinflation breaths were delivered to a test lung by student physiotherapists, with a target peak airway pressure of 30 cm H2O under control, feedback and feedback-withdrawal conditions. The breaths were delivered for three trials under each testing condition at each of three respiratory compliance settings. The availability of augmented feedback increased the accuracy and reduced the variability of performance; however, these improvements were not maintained when feedback was withdrawn. Changing respiratory compliance significantly affected the accuracy and variability during the control and withdrawal conditions, but the availability of a manometer negated these differences. The availability of a pressure manometer negates the influence of respiratory compliance on the achievement of target peak airway pressures during manual hyperinflation in the laboratory environment, however these benefits are not retained when feedback is withdrawn. Therefore, it is recommended that a pressure manometer should be routinely available during manual hyperinflation in clinical practice to optimize treatment safety and effectiveness.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12109235/"}

The design requires that the problem area be selected by staff consensus--in this case planning and administration of therapeutic exercise programs for patients with hip dysfunctions. Five sessions which centered around this patient oriented problem area were presented by the physical therapist to the three physical therapy technicians. Principles of instructional design and events of instruction were incorporated using the format of Gagne and Briggs (1979). The technicians' perception of physical therapy inservice training was rated before the implementation of the systems approach, after the second inservice session, and after the final inservice session. By the end of the five inservice sessions, all three technicians were able to accomplish the predetermined goal of planning and administering a safe therapeutic exercise program to patients with hip dysfunctions. Progress notes also indicated that patient programs were being appropriately upgraded based on the patient's condition. Technicians' ratings of inservice training also had increased after the final session. Further implementation and evaluation of this approach to training is recommended.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2630502/"}

These clusters can be labeled as classifications or diagnoses by physical therapists and can guide management of the patient. The purpose of this article is to discuss what has yet to be included in articles about diagnosis: the diagnostic process. We first acknowledge the complexity of the diagnostic process, reviewing the study of clinical diagnosis mostly from the field of medicine, including statistical as well as process-tracing approaches.

We next discuss error and clinical judgment and strategies to constructively deal with error in the clinical environment.

The procedure for measuring has to put the musculature under conditions as they occur in physiological functioning. Furthermore a measuring instrument should be economical and easy to handle in the course of the daily routine. The Myofunctional Therapist presently has a number of measuring instruments available. Some of them need to be adjusted before every operation. Others give only comparative readings, having no absolute reference. Others measure states which do not represent normal functions of the musculature and therefore do not allow conclusions about the state of the muscle in relation to function. Some apparatuses are highly sensitive and can only be handled by highly trained persons. In this category we find the highly precise electronic equipment being highly expensive to purchase and to repair. It seems that the Function Tonometer is in all points compatible when waging the pros and cons. It directly reads the actual muscle tone under conditions which occur during normal function. The device can be used for diagnostics and documentation as well as in functional training. The output is a defined mechanical range (pressure in mbar) and needs not be adjusted before each measurement. Used in treatment, it motivates by visual feedback. The results are reproducible at any time, at any location, and by any person, even young patients. The instrument has an easy handling, favorable costs in purchase and operation, and is not easily damaged.

As soon as the patient is able to continue with an active program without unbearable pain, the passive modalities should be discontinued gradually. If neck pain becomes chronic, the accompanying psychosocial dysfunction must be addressed through behavioral modification techniques, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting. Modification of the work place, work habits, and lifestyles must be emphasized at both the acute and chronic stages. The modalities presented in this article are commonly used by physical therapists.

This coil improves the focal effect of a magnetic stimulator, and it reduces its inductance, hence the efficiency of the system is improved. The basic structure of the device is derived from the popular \"Slinky\" toy. The actual device is formed by winding different numbers of loops forming a helical coil on a half torus. The loops are bunched at the axis of the torus. The coil, due to its geometry, generates a unique distribution of eddy currents in nearby tissues which is favorable compared to a solenoid type stimulator. This renders the Slinky coil more selective than conventional coils used for magnetic stimulation. The distribution of eddy currents was analyzed using Matlab, following Faraday's Law of Induction. Improved focality permits the current through the coil to be reduced for the same effect. In addition, the reduced inductance of the Slinky coil decreases the power requirement; thus, the improved efficiency of the system may allow the generation of bursts of pulses, and expand the utilization of the system to possible functional activation of certain neuro-muscular structures when peripheral nerves are stimulated.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7558066/"}

The study design was a retrospective chart review of 99 patients with orthopedic diagnoses from one home health care agency in York, Pennsylvania who were admitted and discharged in the 2005 calendar year. For all subjects (N = 99), the mean number of physical therapy visits was 5.7 (3.2), and the average duration of an episode of care was 20.5 (10.6) days. There was a significant improvement (P = .000) in all 3 functional activities, as scored by the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) functional scale following the episode of physical therapy intervention. Physical therapy may be beneficial to the study's homebound patients in improving their functional abilities.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20503727/"}

Little is known about the frequency of use of cervical manipulation versus passive mobilisation by physiotherapists. A recent national, multi-centre randomised clinical trial of the physiotherapy management of cervicogenic headache provided an opportunity to gain an insight into practices of a sample of manipulative physiotherapists across Australia. The treatment records for the 100 subjects who received only manipulative therapy, or manipulative therapy with exercise as per the trial protocol, were audited. The results revealed that cervical manipulation was used in 20.2% of the 1090 treatments provided to these subjects but cervical joint mobilisation only was used in the vast majority of treatments (77.6%). Nevertheless, 42% of subjects were treated with cervical manipulation at some time. In most instances, manipulation was accompanied by passive mobilisation in the same treatment session. Patients were manipulated on one to six occasions and this occurred predominantly in the latter half of the 12-treatment program. Cervical manipulation was used less frequently in the group who also received exercise. The data suggest that the physiotherapists participating in this study used cervical manipulation selectively and relatively conservatively considering the high use of cervical mobilisation techniques. This may reflect their due regard to safety in the treatment of the cervical region.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12217068/"}

Ten men and 10 women, mean ages 28.3 +/- 5.1 and 30.0 +/- 10.1 years, respectively, participated in the study. Random selection was used to determine testing sequences. The Orthoranger and the goniometer were used to measure each joint three times during the five sessions. Results indicated that both instruments were reliable for assessing active lower extremity joint ROM. The goniometer showed greater intraclass correlations and confidence levels for all movements except hip lateral rotation, which demonstrated a higher intraclass correlation for the Orthoranger. In addition, all motions except hip adduction and knee extension demonstrated a positive relationship between instruments. Compared with a manual goniometer, the added costs for purchase and use of the Orthoranger appear to be unnecessary until such time that factors enhancing its inherent reliability are identified.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3340659/"}

This study documented the accuracy of reconstructed angular estimates under static and dynamic conditions using the Ariel Performance Analysis System. Angular velocity was systematically increased by raising the release position of a T-shaped pendulum. Angular velocities were examined by releasing the pendulum from four angles (0 degree-static, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 120 degrees). Twelve reference angles were estimated over 20 autodigitized frames for 10 trials at each release position. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) procedures were used to test the hypothesis that the error of angular estimates grows with increasing angular velocity. Mean errors of the reconstructed angles were consistently within +/- 1.0 degree, regardless of angular velocity. An ANOVA revealed a statistically significant angular velocity effect, characterized by release position. The 90-degree release position produced the greatest error, followed by the 120-, 45-, and 0-degree release positions. The error was not significantly different between the 120- and 45-degree release positions. Intraclass correlation coefficients greater than .90 were found for all frame-to-frame angular velocities, except for the 90-degree release position. The angle estimates consistently underestimated the reference angles, regardless of release position. The results suggest that clinically accurate angular estimates can be obtained across the range of angular velocities used in this study.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9413452/"}

The primary method of data collection was nonparticipant observation of physical therapist-patient treatment sessions. A team of two researchers performed each of the observations. Eight physical therapists, representing three levels of experience, were observed in four different adult outpatient orthopedic settings. Field notes constructed from the observations and transcribed data were used to develop coding categories. These categories were the basis for the development of five themes that describe some aspects of the therapeutic intervention: 1) how treatment time is allocated, 2) the types and uses of information gathered from the patient, 3) the impact of the therapeutic environment, 4) the degree of responsive therapeutic interaction, and 5) the therapist integration of nontherapeutic interaction with therapeutic interaction.

The purposes of this study were: 1) to investigate the effects of physical agents, joint manipulation, low-tech exercise, and high-tech exercise on objective measures of CLBP; 2) to track the length of CLBP relief; and 3) to determine treatment cost-effectiveness. Two-hundred-fifty subjects (68 females, 182 males; ages 34-51 years) with CLBP following an L5 laminectomy were randomly assigned into five separate groups for a treatment period of 8 weeks. Chronic low back pain status was measured by modified-modified Schober, Cybex Liftask, and Oswestry procedures. Results revealed that: 1) only low-tech and high-tech exercise produced significant improvements (p < .05) in CLBP, 2) the mean period of CLBP relief ranged from 1.6 weeks (control) to 91.4 weeks (low-tech exercise), and 3) low-tech exercise was most cost-effective. It was concluded that: 1) low-tech and high-tech exercise were the only effective treatments for CLBP, 2) low-tech exercise produced the longest period of CLBP relief, and 3) low-tech exercise was the most cost-effective form of treatment.

A group of 110 physical therapy students had been randomly divided into two groups for teaching purposes. All students had previously learned mobilization of peripheral joints and were currently learning spinal mobilization. From one of the groups, 22 students volunteered to comprise a control group, which was taught a spinal mobilization technique in the traditional way. Additional concurrent quantitative feedback of the level of force applied to the patient was given to 31 volunteers from the other group. These students formed the experimental group. A force plate was used for force measurement, and the feedback was given via an oscilloscope. The average force applied by the students' instructors was taken as an \"ideal\" force. The oscilloscope showed both the applied force and the \"ideal\" force. Consistency was measured by the variance of the group's performance. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the difference between the applied force and the \"ideal\" force. Results indicated that this feedback was associated with a significant improvement in accuracy and consistency in the application of the mobilizing force. This improvement was still present at a follow-up test conducted one week later. This result supports a greater use of such feedback in the teaching and practice of joint mobilization techniques, although the need for further research is emphasized.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2296617/"}

This randomized trial evaluates whether physical therapy is beneficial for frail debilitated long-stay residents of nursing homes. Subjects are recruited from a cohort of academic and community nursing home residents who have resided in the nursing home for greater than 3 months and are over age 60 and dependent in at least two activities of daily living. Subjects randomized to the intervention group receive one-on-one physical therapy sessions three times weekly for 4 months, while control group subjects receive structured social visits three times weekly to control for potential Hawthorne effects. Physical therapy sessions generally last 30 minutes and consist of functional activity and general conditioning exercises; these exercises are individually tailored to the subject's level of physical and functional disability. Prime outcome variables are physical function assessed by an observer-administered, performance-based instrument and self-perceived health status assessed by the Sickness Impact Profile. Health care utilization and associated costs are calculated for the following areas: the nursing home, hospitalizations, outpatient visits and procedures, medications, and the intervention. A cost-effectiveness ratio dividing incremental health care utilization and physical therapy intervention costs by the observed improvement in physical function is calculated. It is expected that results of this study can be used to help determine whether long-stay nursing home residents should be eligible for physical therapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8440858/"}

The treatment coefficients (CoA) were calculated by dividing the number of treatments in a particular year and region by the estimated population of that region in that year. The CoA in Brazil in 2008 was 0.19 and the North and Center-West regions presented the lowest coefficients (0.13 and 0.10, respectively). Between 1995 and 2007 there was an increase in the national treatment coefficient of 33.7%, with the North region showing the largest increase, 143.8%; the Center-West 62.1%, and the Northeast 56.1%. Treatment for motor disorders was the most widely performed procedure (61.8%), and the values of payments approved were lower than those presented by the managers of the services in 2008 (10.4%). Private for-profit establishments provided 44.5% of the physical therapy treatments paid for by the SUS in 2008. Municipal establishments accounted for 26.6% of the treatments, and federal establishments for only 0.9%. Between 1995 and 2007, the quantity of treatments offered by municipal establishments increased 278.7%. It was observed that the provision of ambulatory physical therapy treatment by the SUS remains small and geographically unequal, although less developed regions showed a larger increase in the CoA. The SUS remunerates inadequately the physical therapy services provided and continues to do so, in large part, by means of agreements with private establishments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22262274/"}

Some physiotherapists release the valve but maintain compression of the bag, whereas others release both the valve and the bag. The effect of this difference on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) has not been reported. The aim of this study was to document the effect of maintaining bag compression during expiration on PEFR and inspiratory to expiratory flow rate ratio (I:E). Six physiotherapists with experience using manual hyperinflation participated. A within-subjects repeated measures design was used. Subjects performed manual hyperinflation using a Mapleson-C circuit with 'rapid release', releasing the valve only, or releasing both the bag and the valve, during expiration in a test lung model. Inspiratory time was controlled using a metronome and flows were measured with a heated pneumotachometer. Maintaining bag compression significantly reduced PEFR (1.54 (0.08) vs 2.00 (0.07) l/sec, p = 0.008) and increased I:E flow rate ratio (0.65 (0.04) vs 0.50 (0.02), p = 0.02) for the Mapleson-C circuit at a 1.4 litre target volume.

This study therefore aimed to explore with experienced therapists firstly how the Bobath concept had changed since 1990, and secondly what they considered its main theoretical assumptions to be using a focus group research design. Eight peer-nominated expert physiotherapists agreed to participate in two focus groups organized according to specialist interest in either neurology (group A) or elderly care (group B). Therapists were asked to discuss six topics based on a review of published literature. Data analysis involved several readings of verbatim transcriptions, from which key themes and concepts were developed. All therapists agreed on the following core themes defining Bobath: analysis of normal movement, control of tone and facilitation of movement. Neuroplasticity was described as the primary rationale for treatment with therapists using afferent information to target the damaged central nervous system. In addition group A discussed motor learning, whereas group B discussed patient focused goals and relating treatment to function. This study highlighted changes in theory, terminology, and techniques. Tone remained a major problem in the rehabilitation management of the hemiplegic patient; however much attention was also directed towards the musculoskeletal system. Both facilitation of normal movement components and task specific practice using specific manual guidance were considered critical elements of the Bobath concept. For Bobath therapists, physiotherapy has an important impact on both the performance components of movement and functional outcomes. In view of the small numbers involved in this preliminary study, further studies are now needed to determine if these themes and concepts are congruent with the majority of physiotherapists' interpretation of the Bobath concept in stroke rehabilitation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11087062/"}

Two force plates, each capable of sensing three orthogonal forces, were used in a descriptive study to assess force. Studies evaluating the reliability of sacroiliac joint tests have revealed conflicting results and to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the distribution of forces and their variations. Fifteen physiotherapists, experienced in musculoskeletal therapy, performed the distraction test and pressure on apex sacralis on the same healthy person on two occasions. In both tests, the total force vector was less on the force plate closer to the physiotherapist. The vertical force component dominated and was considerably greater than the lateral (examined person supine/prone). The caudal/cranial force component was small. Systematic differences were found for the total force vector and for the lateral and vertical force components between occasions and/or between the force plates. The consistency of total force vector and force components was incomplete within and between physiotherapists and between occasions. Relevance. The results indicate that forces have to be investigated as the questions still arise of whether the variation in force distribution has any importance in pain response, whether force registration could be a useful pain evaluation instrument, and whether force registration could be a step towards standardising pain-provocation sacroiliac joint tests.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11358617/"}

Postal questionnaire survey. All 192 English district health authorities. One physiotherapist from each district who was primarily concerned with urinary incontinence. A consensus view was requested. Responses to questionnaire and analysis of a visual analogue scale to indicate effectiveness. There was a 98% response rate. Treatment was often by senior physiotherapists (108 senior I grade or above) who, in 117 districts, claimed to have made a specialty of treating the condition. Gynaecologists and obstetricians were far more likely to refer patients than any other agency (147 respondents said that they were the commonest source of referral). One hundred and fifty four respondents stated that physiotherapy was usually used as the first line of treatment. Pelvic floor exercises and interferential treatment were most commonly used (by 178 and 144 respondents respectively) and thought to be the most effective, especially in combination, though various techniques were used in applying them. Positive motivation (108), recent onset of symptoms (55), and youth (40) were viewed optimistically, and obesity (60), previous surgery (59), prolapse (42), and a chronic cough (36) were considered to be bad prognostic features. The number of patients treated varied greatly (range 10-360) between districts and was poorly correlated with catchment size (correlation coefficient 0.3). As physiotherapists are treating considerable numbers of patients with stress incontinence research is urgently needed to produce efficacy data to enable rationalisation of resources to cater for the whole population.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1888358/"}

Adding dry needling to a physical therapy session was hypothesized to elevate the session's perceived financial and therapeutic value. This study aimed to investigate perceptions of dry needling with electrical stimulation to understand its appeal. Participants were randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization sequence to one of two groups: an experimental group (n = 169), which watched video clips of a physical therapy session including dry needling with electrical stimulation, or a control group (n = 169), which watched similar clips but with therapeutic exercise replacing dry needling. After viewing the clips, participants completed a survey rating the perceived cost and therapeutic effectiveness of each intervention, as well as the overall treatment. A total of 252 participants finished the study (119 experimental, 133 control). The results showed that adding dry needling to a session led to a 29 % higher perceived financial value compared to the control group. Additionally, dry needling was perceived to cost more than any other individual intervention. While perceived therapeutic value was high for both groups, there was no significant difference between the experimental and control group. The addition of dry needling with electrical stimulation to a physical therapy session appears to have increased perceived financial value of the session, however, did not affect perceived therapeutic effectiveness.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a physical therapy patient education questionnaire. Candidate items were developed and evaluated by an expert panel for content validity. The resulting items were administered to 350 patients in physical therapy treatment, and the reliability and validity of the scale's subscales were evaluated. The final version of the questionnaire consists of 36 items that assess six education domains for patients receiving physical therapy: 1) assessment and information provision (10 items), 2) hygiene and safety (9 items), 3) patient empowerment (8 items), 4) emergency and infection control (3 items), 5) adverse event prevention (4 items), and 6) identity confirmation (2 items). The internal consistency of the subscales ranged from 0.69 to 0.92, and support for the six-domain structure of the items was supported via factor analysis. The questionnaire was successfully developed and evidenced good psychometric properties for the assessment of the perceived importance of six physical therapy education domains.

Three samples, consisting of 177, 257, and 173 outpatients from 21 facilities, were used in phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In phase 1, principal component analyses (PCAs), reliability checks, and correlations with social desirability scales were used to reduce a pool of 98 items to 32 items. These analyses identified a 5-component model of outpatient satisfaction in physical therapy. The phase 2 PCA, with a revised pool of 48 items, indicated that 4 components rather than 5 components represented the best model and resulted in the 34-item Physical Therapy Outpatient Satisfaction Survey (PTOPS). Factor analyses conducted with phase 2 and phase 3 data supported this conclusion and provided evidence for the internal validity of the PTOPS scores. The 4-component scales were labeled \"Enhancers,\" \"Detractors,\" \"Location,\" and \"Cost.\" Responses from subsamples of phase 3 subjects provided evidence for validity of scores in that the PTOPS components of \"Enhancers,\" \"Detractors,\" and \"Cost\" appeared to differentiate overtly satisfied patients from overtly dissatisfied patients. \"Location\" and \"Enhancer\" scores discriminated subjects with excellent attendance at scheduled physical therapy sessions from those with poor attendance.

Especially the part that concerns the different stages of childhood development of which, one thinks, can be observed the deterioration \"in reverse\" during the senile dementia impairment processes. Some special hypothesis concern:--the different parts of reality in which relations between patient and society are disturbed --the activities that are connected in a network of relations between the conceptual instruments required to realize these activities --the fact that the steadiness of a particular activity should help to recover another one, thought to be close in the way by which its realization puts into action the same cognitive processes. Thus, we have been able to fix the way of directing a first examination for the taking in charge in ergotherapy; examination that should point out the fields in which the patient can be mobilized (as well from the level where he is as from the investment one can expect in regard to the pleasure or the interest that he shows for a work rather than another). Besides, we tried to represent the channels of activities and their relations, starting from the most elementary one to reach the most complicated one, that is to say the ones that allow us to work on reality. It is in the network of these channels that the proposed activities should find their place in the ergotherapy workshop and their application should permit the readaptation to everyday actions in a progressive way.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/694471/"}

The method was originally developed in the 1950s for enhancing understanding of the doctor-patient relationship. Few studies have focused on BGT and physiotherapists. The aim of the present study was to describe and analyse physiotherapists' experiences of participation in BGT as a means of learning and understanding the physiotherapist-patient relationship. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with three physiotherapists working in private practice, all participating in BGT. The interviews were transcribed and subjected to a qualitative analysis. The results are presented in a sequential model, featuring eight themes in which the physiotherapists' experiences of the training process are portrayed. The results suggest that BGT and sharing the experiences of others may be considered a way of enhancing understanding of the patient encounter in clinical practice, possibly to the benefit of physiotherapists and their patients.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10863715/"}

A wide variety of interventions are used in the management of FM. There is, however, no clear consensus on the treatment of choice and FM remains relatively refractory to treatment. Therefore, prevention, causal therapy and rehabilitation are not possible. FM patients frequently use alternative therapies, indicating dissatisfaction or ineffectiveness of traditional medical therapy. Alternative therapies are generally perceived to be more \"natural\" and as a result, to have fewer adverse effects. Despite the positive results found, the number of publications related to the application of physical therapy modalities such as acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, laser, biofeedback, electrotherapy and magnetic field is still scant, especially concerning FM treatment. The demonstration of a long-term effective intervention for managing the symptoms associated with FM is needed. Multidisciplinary approaches to management include physical and medical therapeutic strategies. Treatment modalities should be individualised for patients based on target symptoms and impairment in functioning. Patience and positive attitude on part of the physician and active involvement of patients and their families in treatment are likely to enhance improvement. It can be concluded that there is a need for larger, more systematic and methodologically sound randomised controlled clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy modalities of managing FM. We will review some of the existing studies of physical therapy relevant in the treatment of FM and give some practical advice for their use.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16454722/"}

To assess the implications of practice setting (hospital outpatient settings versus private practice) on clinical outcomes and efficiency of care in the delivery of physical therapy services. Many patients with musculoskeletal conditions benefit from care provided by physical therapists. The majority of physical therapists deliver services in either a private practice setting or in a hospital outpatient setting. There have not been any recent studies comparing whether clinical outcomes or efficiency of care differ based on practice setting. Practices that use the Focus On Therapeutic Outcomes, Inc system were surveyed to determine the specific type of setting in which outcomes were collected in patients with musculoskeletal impairments. Patient outcome data over 12 months (2011-2012) were extracted from the database and analyzed to identify differences in the functional status achieved and the efficiency of the care delivery process between private practices and hospital outpatient settings. The data suggest that patients experience more efficient care when receiving physical therapy in hospital outpatient settings compared to private practice settings, as demonstrated by 3.1 points of greater improvement in functional status over 2.9 fewer physical therapy visits. However, the difference in improvement between settings is less than the minimum clinically important difference of 9 points in functional status outcome score. In this cohort, our data suggest that more efficient care was delivered in the hospital outpatient setting compared to the private practice setting. However, we cannot conclude that care delivered in the hospital setting is more cost-effective, because it is possible that any difference in efficiency of care favoring the hospital outpatient setting is more than offset by higher costs of care.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25350133/"}

The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of physiotherapy treatment for the treatment of epicondylitis and, if any, to identify the most appropriate techniques. A systematic search was carried out in October 2020 in the databases of PubMed, Cinahl, Scopus, Medline and Web of Science using the search terms: Physical therapy modalities, Physical and rehabilitation medicine, Rehabilitation, Tennis elbow and Elbow tendinopathy. Nineteen articles were found, of which seven applied shock waves, three applied orthoses, three applied different manual therapy techniques, two applied some kind of bandage, one applied therapeutic exercise, one applied diacutaneous fibrolysis, one applied high intensity laser, and one applied vibration. Manual therapy and eccentric strength training are the two physiotherapeutic treatment methods that have the greatest beneficial effects, and, furthermore, their cost-benefit ratio is very favorable. Its complementation with other techniques, such as shock waves, bandages or Kinesio® taping, among others, facilitates the achievement of therapeutic objectives, but entails an added cost.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34397403/"}

Good results of treatment are obtained with peloid packs, which, however, above all are yielded in the health-resort. In chronic gastroenterological diseases more attention should be paid to kinetotherapy and it should more frequently be used. It not anyway acts only on the locomotor system, but always on the general organism, especially on the vegetative functional system and should be prescribed particularly in rehabilitation after a long stay in sick-bed.

{"id": "9408934", "title": "A multidimensional scaling analysis of the techniques that physiotherapists use.", "text": "Following the essentially 'hands-on' origin of the physiotherapy profession a century ago, the range of techniques available to practitioners has expanded considerably. While this expansion of techniques has been of research interest, the main focus has been upon individual techniques, thus neglecting the fundamental question of the use of techniques in combination. In addition, researchers have tended to treat the profession as homogeneous, thus overlooking possible differences in technique usage. The present study addressed these questions. It postulated that ordered combinations of techniques usage would be employed, and that a typology would exist that differentiates the profession according to patterns of use. The study comprised a questionnaire survey of 230 clinical physiotherapists in England. This sought information on the range and frequency of techniques used over the previous six months. Descriptive analysis indicated a high frequency of use of several techniques, notably exercise therapy, passive mobilisation techniques and ultrasound. A feature of the analysis was the use of two multivariate procedures, multidimensional scalogram analysis (MSA) and smallest space analysis (SSA). The SSAs revealed a clear structure concerning combinations of techniques used, and the MSAs provided a coherent typology based upon this usage. One feature of the techniques in combination that emerged was the frequent use of passive mobilising techniques, which was associated with equally frequent use of electrotherapy techniques. In contrast, respondents who employed neurological or respiratory techniques made little use of electrotherapy. Regarding the typology, differentiation of the profession according to use of particular combinations of techniques indicated probable specialisms. The specialist areas identified were neurological physiotherapy, respiratory physiotherapy and musculo-skeletal physiotherapy. The results reinforce the need for both future research and physiotherapy education to address the issue of techniques in combination. Finally, and on the basis of the analyses, elements of a theoretical model are advanced that may provide directions for future research.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9408934/"}

Yet, few resources exist to assist physical therapists with the basic mechanics and quality standards of producing a clinical case report. This situation is further complicated by the absence of uniform standards for quality in case reporting. The importance of including a concise yet comprehensive description of patient functioning in all physical therapy case reports suggest the potential appropriateness of basing quality guidelines on the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) model. The purpose of this paper is to assist physical therapists in creating high-quality clinical case reports for the peer-reviewed literature using the ICF model as a guiding framework. Along these lines, current recommendations related to the basic mechanics of writing a successful clinical case report are reviewed, as well and a proposal for uniform clinical case reporting requirements is introduced with the aim to improve the quality and feasibility of clinical case reporting in physical therapy that are informed by the ICF model.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24375956/"}

However, incontinence management is not limited to the PT. Providing the best care to incontinent patients requires open communication among professions, disciplines, and care settings where incontinence specialists may be found. To help illustrate this point, a professional opinion survey was sent to leading PTs and RNs who conservatively treat and manage incontinence. Respondents were asked about the following: entry point, preparation, and practice setting; general practice description; assessment and treatment; individual practice innovations; what is unique to physical therapy and nursing; and interaction between the professions. Twenty-six (26) responses were received. While responses varied among PTs and RNs, both professions agreed that musculoskeletal assessment and treatment were unique contributions of physical therapy while medical/surgical expertise and pharmacologic issues were unique contributions of nursing to the field of incontinence.

As the abnormality is strictly on one side of the body in most people, the circuitry is minimised, as gait can be analysed by only comparing muscle activity in the affected gluteus medius muscle with that in the unaffected gluteus medius muscle, through the EMG. Two foot contact switches are used to help assess timing of the step cycle. If gait is different on the two sides of the body, an audio cue directs the patient to correct the abnormality by increasing activity on the affected side. The device is tested on five patients. Trendelenburg gait is reduced by an average of 29 degrees through the use of the device. The average stride length at the beginning of the study is 0.32 +/- 0.3 m. By the end of the study, the stride length is increased to 0.45 +/- 0.2 m for the entire group of five subjects.

Outpatient physical therapy clinic. Patients receiving physical therapy treatment for low back pain. Patients with low back pain were videotaped while performing a variety of movement tests including single, repeated, and sustained movements. Forty licensed physical therapists and 40 physical therapy students were provided with operational definitions of the three potential judgments of status change with movement testing; centralization, peripheralization, status quo. All therapists and students viewed the videotape and made a judgment regarding the patient's status change in response to the test. Percentage agreement and kappa coefficient values for agreement. Interrater reliability was excellent for the total sample of examiners (kappa = .793), for the licensed physical therapists (kappa = .823), and for the students (kappa = .763). Judgments of status change are reliable when operational definitions are provided.

To establish a profile of the typical graduate and to determine the value and influence of residency training on professional development, particularly on clinical expertise. Physical therapists are involved in direct access in some states as a result of health care reform. There is increasing interest within the physical therapy profession in evaluating residency education as an avenue for providing physical therapists with the advanced skills to meet the changing nature of providing care. A questionnaire was sent to 98 graduates of a year long advanced orthopaedic manual therapy residency program. A response rate of 94.9% was obtained. Influence of residency training on clinical skills and expertise received high (\"major positive\") ratings on the abilities to logically reason (94%), thoroughly examine (95%), treat effectively (84%) and efficiently (79%), and to \"diagnose\" (85%). Graduates spend 23% of their time teaching in some manner. Autonomy of decision making was the primary factor (43%) in determining place of work. The results of this survey suggest that residency education assists physical therapists to refine and expand their clinical knowledge and skills that are important for health care roles requiring increasing autonomy of practice, such as primary care.

Transducer output power has been determined with an uncertainty of <3.3% and with a long-term (2-y) output stability of better than 3%. The CD can detect bubble activity for powers above 3 W for a 1-MHz transducer. Travel trials demonstrated the utility of the PPS in practical measurement environments.

Early work on treatment of patients with cerebral palsy and polio led to improvements in treatment approaches used to facilitate motor skill and functional motor ability in patients with upper motor neuron disorders. From the 1950s to the present, therapists have refined their treatment techniques as knowledge from neuroscience has become available.

The classification acute or chronic has to be made according to two criteria: acute or chronic course in time/acute or chronic type of disorder. The main concern of physical therapy is prophylaxis of chronic disorders. Chronification of symptoms quite often leads to human tragedy and, moreover, to higher costs, since the total medical and social costs for the chronic cases are higher than those for acute cases. The general practitioner has an important function in the prophylaxis of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Three to four weeks after the onset of the symptoms he should perform a special evaluation of every patient, thereby assessing the risk of chronification. When a chronic course is considered to be probable, an activating treatment concept should be initiated which in general comprises the following components: comprehensive information and instruction, active exercising (especially training therapy), self mobilization and soonest possible return to work within the limits of stress the condition can be exposed to.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2711073/"}

The resulting standards and evaluation forms were found to be practical, reliable, and valid for use by personnel of physical therapy and physical therapist assistant educational programs responsible for selecting clinical education centers for part-time and full-time students. We recommend that the standards and evaluation forms be used by personnel of physical therapy educational programs, clinical education centers, and selected committees of the American Physical Therapy Association because the standards and forms incorporate aspects of clinical education currently believed important to providing high-quality learning experiences in physical therapy practice.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7079297/"}

{"id": "16616270", "title": "Physical agents used in the management of chronic pain by physical therapists.", "text": "Evidence supporting the use of specific physical agents in the management of chronic pain conditions is not definitive; it is largely incomplete and sometimes contradictory. However, the use of agents in chronic pain management programs is common. Within the broad use of physical agents, they are rarely the sole modality of treatment. A 1995 American Physical Therapy Association position statement asserts that \"Without documentation which justifies the necessity of the exclusive use of physical agents/modalities, the use of physical agents/modalities, in the absence of other skilled therapeutic or educational intervention, should not be considered physical therapy\". Physical agents may serve as useful adjunctive modalities of pain relief or to enhance the effectiveness of other elements in therapy geared toward resolution of movement impairments and restoration of physical function. Given that a conclusive aggregate of findings is unlikely to exist for all permutations of patient conditions, combined with interacting therapeutic modalities, an evidence-based approach to pain management is not always possible or beneficial to the patient. In the face of inconclusive evidence, a theory-based approach may help determine if the therapeutic effect ofa given physical agent has the possibility of being a useful clinical tool in the context of treating a particular patient's mechanism of pain generation. Until controlled efficacy findings are definitive, careful individual patient response monitoring of thoughtful theoretical application of adjunctive physical agents may be a prudent approach to the management of chronic pain.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16616270/"}

A questionnaire, developed from a preliminary study (Part 1) with experienced sport physiotherapists (N = 10), was mailed to 500 sport physiotherapists in Australia, New Zealand and Canada (Part 2). Responses from Australian (N = 147), New Zealand (N = 65) and Canadian (N = 45) subjects suggested that: (i) anxiety and frustration is experienced frequently by injured athletes, and non-compliance to the rehabilitation program is a significant problem preventing effective recovery and rehabilitation; (ii) psychological skills training and learning to deal with psychological responses to injury would facilitate more effective treatment; and (iii) athlete self-presentation styles influence the support and attention received from physiotherapists.

In addition, it has been demonstrated that different resuscitation circuits provide varying degrees of resistance to expiratory flow and it is known that a variety of circuits are used in Australia for manual hyperinflation. The aim of this study was to document current practice, the effect of rapid release, controlling inspiration, different volumes and circuit type on flow rates, and the inspiratory to expiratory flow rate (I:E) ratio during manual hyperinflation. Using a test lung model, 15 physiotherapists performed 11 trials using the Air Viva 2, a Mapleson-C and a Mapleson-F circuit, both with and without rapid release, and delivering two volumes. The order of the trials was randomised. Rapid release produced a faster PEFR irrespective of circuit type or volume delivered. The effect of rapid release, and the absolute PEFR, was less for the Air Viva 2 compared with the Mapleson circuits. Expiratory flow rate was faster for the larger volume. The theoretically optimal I:E ratio to move secretions was achieved delivering the lower target volume with the Mapleson circuits and using rapid release.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12600252/"}

The purpose of this brief report is to report the duration and cost of PT care, and subsequent escalation of care events, for LBP in service members with and without limb loss. This was a retrospective cohort, descriptive study. Service members with and without limb loss (matched) who received PT for LBP at a military treatment facility from 2015 to 2017 were included. Duration of PT care, number of PT visits, and escalation of care events 1 year after PT were extracted from medical records. Escalation of care events was identified as epidural steroid injections, referrals to specialists (e.g., orthopedists, spine surgeons, and pain management), and LBP-related hospitalizations.LBP-related PT encounters were queried; duration of care, number of visits, and cost of care were quantified. Escalation of care events, including opioid prescription, epidural steroid injections, specialty referrals, and hospitalizations, were identified up to 1 year after PT care. The average course of PT care for LBP was 12.9 more visits, 48.7 days longer, and $764.50 more expensive in service members with limb loss (n = 16) vs. those without limb loss (n = 48). Higher rates of opioid prescriptions and specialty referrals were observed in service members with limb loss. This study suggests that service members with limb loss and LBP received higher quantities and longer durations of PT than those without limb loss, yielding a nearly 4 times higher cost of PT.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39367785/"}

The method consists of exposing an acoustic absorber tile, part of which contains a thermochromic pigment, to the ultrasonic beam, thereby forming an image of the intensity profile of the transducer. Images acquired using thermochromic materials were postprocessed in order to estimate effective radiating area (ERA) and beam nonuniformity ratio (BNR) for ultrasound transducers operating within the frequency range from 1.0 to 3.3 MHz, and nominal applied intensities in the range of 1-2W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Results of our measurements have shown that thermocromic tile can be used for quality control of ultrasound transducers in the hospital environment. Experimental results show that proposed method can be used to distinguish highly non - uniform ultrasound beams with high value of BNR. Influence of exposure duration on obtained ERA and BNR values was also analysed. Our results show that values for ERA increase with insonation time, while BNR values decrease. In order to compare our results with theory we have estimated temperature rise in thermochromic material experimentally and compare it with theoretical prediction.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31398497/"}

Information is lacking, however, on the source and explanation of the variation. The purposes of the current study are: 1) to determine how the variance in the number of physical therapy treatment sessions in patients with non-specific low back pain (LBP) in the Netherlands is distributed over patient level, therapist level and practice level; and 2) to determine the factors that explain the variance. Data were used from a national registration network on physical therapy. Our database contained information on 1,733 patients referred with LBP, treated by 97 therapists working in 41 practices. The variation in the number of treatment sessions was investigated by means of multilevel regression analyses. Eighty-eight per cent of the variation in the number of treatment sessions for patients with LBP is located at patient level and seven per cent is located at practice level. It was possible to explain thirteen per cent of all variance. The duration of the complaint, prior therapy, and the patients' age and gender in particular are related to the number of physical therapy treatment sessions. Our results suggest that the number of physical therapy treatment sessions in patients with LBP mainly depends on patient characteristics. More variation needs to be explained, however, to improve the transparency of care. Future research should examine the contribution of psychosocial factors, baseline disability, and the ability to learn motor behavior as possible factors in the variation in treatment sessions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16307679/"}

Research has shown that directing learners' attention to the effects of their movements can be more beneficial for learning than directing their attention to the details of their own actions. Furthermore, giving learners some control over the training regimen has been found to enhance learning, unlike prescriptive training protocols that dictate when feedback will be delivered, how often, and the order that tasks will be practiced. Finally, not only can practice in dyads (or larger groups) reduce the costs of training, but it can also result in more effective learning than individual practice sessions.

The sample consisted of 67 women and 23 men with a mean (SD) age of 40.1 (5.4) years and 9.2 (3.1) years of experience as chartered physiotherapists. Descriptive statistical and qualitative analysis showed that physiotherapists believed athletes were often psychologically affected by injury. The physiotherapists also reported often using psychological techniques when treating injured athletes, but few reported having access to a sport psychologist for referral. This research indicates that future physiotherapy education may need more emphasis on the psychological aspect of injury, and seek to increase knowledge on the potential of using psychological interventions within a physiotherapy rehabilitation programme.

To explore how parents of infants with CF experience physiotherapy clinic consultations. A qualitative study, informed by hermeneutic phenomenology, utilizing in-depth semi-structured interviews and daily diaries was conducted with 13 parents of infants (aged 0-2 yrs.) receiving physiotherapy care for CF in Australia. Three themes arose from the text. The first was that parents' physiotherapy clinic experience is influenced by the manner in which health professionals communicate to parents about physiotherapy in CF, as well as their own prior experience and knowledge. Secondly, parents receive conflicting messages from the physiotherapy consultation, but perceive the key message to be to prioritize adherence to physiotherapy. The final theme was that parents' expectations of the physiotherapy interaction were often not met, in particular a lack of practical physiotherapy education and training was reported. Parents of infants with CF seek an optimistic, practical and hands on approach during physiotherapy consultations. Exploring options for providing physiotherapy input outside of traditional clinic environments may help accommodate individual needs. Investigation into the manner in which physiotherapy education is communicated to parents is warranted in light of the influence on parents' expectations of physiotherapy.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35042441/"}

To date, systematic reviews on the effectiveness of CPD provide limited guidance on the most efficacious models of professional development for physiotherapists. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate which learning activities enhance physiotherapy practice. A search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO (Psychological Abstracts), PEDro, Cochrane Library, AMED and Educational Resources and Information Center (ERIC) will be completed. Citation searching and reference list searching will be undertaken to locate additional studies. Quantitative and qualitative studies will be included if they examine the impact of learning activities on clinician's behaviour, attitude, knowledge, beliefs, skills, self-efficacy, work satisfaction and patient outcomes. Risk of bias will be assessed by two independent researchers.

Eleven studies involving 668 participants were included in the review. The relative intrarater reliability of the Berg Balance Scale was high, with a pooled estimate of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). Relative inter-rater reliability was also high, with a pooled estimate of 0.97 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.98). A ceiling effect of the Berg Balance Scale was evident for some participants. In the analysis of absolute reliability, all of the relevant studies had an average score of 20 or above on the 0 to 56 point Berg Balance Scale. The absolute reliability across this part of the scale, as measured by the minimal detectable change with 95% confidence, varied between 2.8 points and 6.6 points. The Berg Balance Scale has a higher absolute reliability when close to 56 points due to the ceiling effect. We identified no data that estimated the absolute reliability of the Berg Balance Scale among participants with a mean score below 20 out of 56.

Results revealed considerable agreement between therapists' perceptions of PTA roles and those outlined by PTA practice guidelines, and these perceptions changed little over time. Discriminant analyses suggested that therapists' perceptions of PTA roles were, in general, not predicted by supervisory experience with PTAs, therapist experience, or content of entry-level professional education curricula. Generally, therapists' perceptions of PTA roles are consistent with published practice guidelines.

A recent study in England addressed these deficits, and determined that techniques were used in ordered combinations, which differentiate the profession into 'typologies' or specialities. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a similar picture would emerge in Australia, and to determine the type and extent of technique use amongst Australian physiotherapists. This replication study comprised a questionnaire survey of 141 hospital physiotherapists working in Southeast Australia. Information concerning the range and frequency of techniques used over the preceding six months was obtained. Descriptive analyses indicated high frequency use of exercise therapy, manipulation, heat packs, massage and ultrasound. Multidimensional scaling revealed a clear structure concerning combination use of techniques, and a coherent typology based on this usage. Differentiation of the profession according to the typologies supports the specialist areas identified in England, namely respiratory, neurological and orthopaedic/musculoskeletal physiotherapy. A further subdivision of the latter was possible in Australia, with the emergence of both a manipulative speciality, and an exercise rehabilitation speciality. While this study confirms the findings of the earlier research, it identifies important differences in practice between Australia and England.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12047210/"}

These new approaches include novel placements, optimization of electrical stimulus parameters, and new methods for inducing more targeted seizures(eg, magnetic seizure therapy [MST]). MST is the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce a seizure. Magnetic fields pass through tissue unimpeded, providing more control over the site and extent of stimulation than can be achieved with ECT. This enhanced control represents a means of focusing the treatment on target cortical structures thought to be essential to antidepressant response and reducing spread to medial temporal regions implicated in the cognitive side effects of ECT. MST is at an early stage of development. Preliminary results suggest that MST may have some advantages over ECT in terms of subjective side effects and acute cognitive functioning. Studies designed to address the antidepressant efficacy of MST are underway. As with all attempts to improve convulsive therapy technique, the clinical value of MST will need to be established through controlled clinical trials. This article reviews the experience to date with MST, and places this work in the broader context of other means of optimizing convulsive therapy in the treatment of depression.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12894034/"}

There have been several challenges in understanding the specific circumstances of these events to direct prevention such as inconsistent reporting, misuse of professional titles, and incomplete data. There are also differences in opinions between professions. It is now important to understand expert views and consensus across professions regarding prevention strategies and minimum requirements for reporting standards for future SAEs. A modified Delphi method was used, involving 28 international experts from various allied health professions, including chiropractic, physiotherapy, osteopathy, and medicolegal fields. The experts took part in three rounds of online surveys to reach a consensus on reporting, characteristics, risk factors, and prevention of SAEs associated with neck treatments. An agreement of >74 % was required before consensus was reached. Consensus was reached for more standardised reporting of SAEs across different types of treatments and professions. Addressing underlying health conditions and improving the recognition of potential risks, precautions, and contraindications during treatment were highlighted. Recommendations for strategies to improve safety, including early identification of risk factors and careful application of techniques, especially in vulnerable populations were also provided. Experts called for the development of universally accepted clinician friendly clinical guidelines that focus on improving SAE reporting, early identification of SAEs, and safer technique application, particularly in special populations. Implementing these recommendations will help reduce the occurrence of SAEs and improve the safety of conservative cervical spine management across professions.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40319549/"}
{"id": "9651602", "title": "Characterising ultrasonic physiotherapy systems by performance and safety now internationally agreed.", "text": "The IEC 1689 standard specifies: methods of measurement, characterisation of the output performance, requirements for safety due to the ultrasonic field generated, characteristics to be declared by manufacturers and acceptance criteria for aspects of performance. For the characterisation, reference as well as routine testing methods are described. Important parameters such as effective radiating area (AER), beam nonuniformity ratio (RBN) (characterising 'hot-spots': potentially harmful to patients) and beam type have been re-defined. The quality, reproducibility and accuracy of measurements of AER are significantly improved compared to those in IEC 150 (which is now replaced) and the FDA 1050.10 (USA) standards. As a result, values of effective intensity are shown to be significantly higher than those obtained using the FDA 1050.10 (USA) definitions. As it may be expected that the new standard will be implemented worldwide, this problem is just a matter of time. The standard discussed above specifies the need for acoustic power measurement with an accuracy of more than 15%. However, several investigations carried out over the last ten years show a lack of proper facilities to calibrate the acoustic output power at physiotherapy levels. A project to investigate the complications and to produce definitive guidance for therapy-level power measurements is funded by the EC and has been started recently. Future activities will be undertaken to estimate the expected temperature rise in tissue due to the ultrasonic field. Such a figure may result in an improved judgement of the ultrasonic safety aspects of physiotherapy systems.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9651602/"}

As a bench-top device, the use of the tile is designed to mimic the nature of the physiotherapeutic application, requiring minimal training. Two designs where thermochromic pigments are added to the various polymeric layers of the tile are presented. Testing has been conducted with two physiotherapy treatment heads of differing performance, one of them notably exhibiting a strong \"hot-spot\" in localised acoustic time-averaged intensity.

Other techniques, such as serial casting and static splinting, are time intensive and usually require assistance by a therapist. This study evaluates SPS via a new orthosis that directly applies SPS incrementally through patient-controlled therapy, allowing for stress relaxation of contracted tissue. Patients used the device in 30-minute treatment protocols. The length of treatment time varied between one and three months. Twenty patients with elbow contractures who had limited success with other treatment modalities including serial casting, dynamic splinting, physical therapy, and/or surgery, underwent SPS using the new orthosis. The increase in motion for the 20 patients in the study averaged 31 degrees (69%).

With regard to the so-called electrotherapy of denervated muscles. it has been stressed that the trophic state can also be promoted by vibratory mechanical stimulation while the electrical stimulation could partly reduce the diffuse type of membrane excitability present in the devervated muscle fibres; this effect might interfere negatively with the process of collateral nerve sprouting.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6966219/"}

At least some of these improvements can be attributed to better organization of services and improved rehabilitation. Many patients, however, remain severely disabled and we will need to develop new strategies in which the focus will be on reversing impairments rather than simply helping patients to adapt to unaltered impairments. For this to happen, neurological rehabilitation research will have to develop therapies that have a clearly defined rationale and are rooted in neurosciences, are clinically described, are addressed to a well-characterized target population and are evaluated using appropriate outcome measures. Few studies at present meet all these criteria. The recent revolution in our understanding of the nervous system as being soft-wired, of the potential for recovery through reorganization and of the central role of afferent information associated with normal activity is ground for optimism and indicates the direction in which future therapies should be sought. The paper considers some approaches to providing appropriate afferent information, including inputs such as that from electrotherapy, novel approaches to assisted activity and constraint-induced therapy. We are on the verge of a revolution in neurological rehabilitation. If we exploit the new understanding of the nervous system arising from basic neurosciences in developing and evaluating therapies we should be able to build on the achievements of the last few decades so that fewer of our patients have to carry the burden of severe disability.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12109237/"}

This was provided in addition to standard physiotherapy. The treating physiotherapists observed the activity coaching session undertaken by their patients. Observing the coaching interview was valuable for the treating physiotherapists in that it provided a way to refocus, step back, gain insight, and facilitate more active involvement for their patients in the rehabilitation process. Similarly patients valued the opportunity to focus on what was important and put into action their rehabilitation goals. Contrasting perceptions were evident, which limits the practical usefulness of this intervention due to the concerns voiced by some of the physiotherapists.

The subjects were 152 adults with SCIs (103 male, 49 female; mean age=34 years, SD=8, range=18-55) who returned mailed survey questionnaires. A 17-item self-report survey questionnaire was sent to the 463 members of a provincial spinal cord support organization. Survey responses for 26 of the 152 respondents were eliminated from the analysis because they had minimal effects from their injuries and did not need prolonged standing as an extra activity. Of the 126 remaining respondents, 38 respondents (30%) reported that they engaged in prolonged standing for an average of 40 minutes per session, 3 to 4 times a week, as a method to improve or maintain their health. The perceived benefits included improvements in several health-related areas such as well-being, circulation, skin integrity, reflex activity, bowel and bladder function, digestion, sleep, pain, and fatigue. The most common reason that prevented the respondents from standing was the cost of equipment to enable standing. Considering the many reported benefits of standing, this activity may be useful for people with SCI.

The Vodder technique differs in the use of adapted pressure and its application. The constant change in pressure optimizes results, moving fluid in the skin, increasing lymphomotoricity, and softening fibrosis, with the positive side effects of reducing pain and relaxing tense muscles. Another difference from other methods is the technique of stretching skin, not sliding it. Because of the fluid content in lymphedema, which is different from all other edemas, the combination of MLD with compression treatment is the only solution for this pathology. Depending of it severity, each case requires individualized treatment. Phase 1 (intensive treatment) consists of daily treatment with up to two sessions per day for up to 2 hours. This phase is combined with special, individual skin care and remedial exercise. In phase 2, the goal of treatment is to maintain the results achieved in phase 1. The frequency of treatment is changed, but there is still the need for permanent, continued therapy. In phase 1, an average reduction of more than 40% of edema volume is achieved. In phase 2, the results are maintained and, with repetitions of phase 1, further improvement is possible. Thus, long term results with permanent improvement are possible. Because of the complexity of the technique, no one can learn MLD in 1 week. Students require a great deal of correction, and the technique must be checked constantly. To become a certified Vodder therapy, a 4-week education program must be completed, and reviews must be attended every 2 years to maintain certification. The best education produces the best results for patients as long as patients are compliant. Therefore, the Vodder School also includes a patient education program as part of its curriculum.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9874409/"}

They require strict adherence to rigorous methodology and, in particular, the consistent use of a range of clinically appropriate and scientifically sound measures of outcome. Incorporating this approach, it is possible to evaluate rehabilitation at four different levels, including (1) the broadest concept of service delivery; (2) packages of comprehensive care; (3) individual components of the package; and finally, (4) the intrinsic elements of the rehabilitation process. Most recent studies have focused on in-patient rehabilitation and have demonstrated benefits across disability, handicap, and quality of life in patients with mild to severe disability. Such benefits persist following discharge into the community. Studies evaluating service delivery and components of the rehabilitation package are in progress, but few investigators have taken on the intrinsic elements or 'black box' of rehabilitation. These recent studies underline the fact that the evaluation of rehabilitation is feasible. Such studies are important, not simply to justify funding but to ensure continuing improvement of the way in which MS is managed.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11028701/"}

This question was the point of departure for this article and it immediately gave rise to another: what is the relationship between professional knowledge and general experience? Data were collected as part of a project where encounters between patients and physiotherapists are analysed. The encounters were directly observed and video-taped, and the participants individually interviewed afterwards. The article is based on a detailed analysis of two encounters. It is shown how both therapists direct their examination towards local symptoms and conditions; the emphasis being on joint mobility. The information obtained is adapted to the therapists' biomedical frame of reference. Their interpretations, assessments, and treatment proposals are well within the same frame. In this way historical and clinical data are not 'revealed' but rather constructed; a process which helps transform the patients' problems to solvable problems--for the therapists. Despite the fact that the conception of the body implicit in their diagnostic practice was dualistic, both therapists related to their patients as embodied subjects in many of their general actions. They examined the body as a physical object extrinsic to the self and added the human factor by being interested in the patients as persons through general communication actions. It is argued that the discrepancy between these two views of the body justifies the conclusion that the therapists were operating with unintegrated worlds of knowledge. The findings are interpreted in light of general perspectives on the relationship between general and particular knowledge, between the 'scientific' context-free attitude and every-day contextualized knowledge.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7973868/"}

The peak torques produced were examined to determine on which day and during which contraction subjects produced the greatest torques for each condition. This information was used to develop a practice protocol. Fifteen different subjects were tested following this protocol. Subjects participated in two practice sessions, a test session, and a retest session. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to determine the degree of agreement between torques for the test and retest sessions. The ICCs ranged from .87 to .98.

{"id": "11034883", "title": "The role of electrotherapy in contemporary physiotherapy practice.", "text": "Although electrotherapy has a well established role within physiotherapy practice, the current concepts that influence its application vary considerably from those proposed historically. It is argued that there is a place for electrophysical modalities in contemporary practice, and several basic principles are considered together with more specific information regarding two modalities namely, ultrasound and interferential therapy. Electrophysical agents are utilised to bring about physiological effects, and it is these changes which bring about the therapeutic benefit rather than the modality itself. Clinical decision protocols employing the available evidence should enable the most appropriate modality to be employed for a particular patient. Indiscriminate use of electrotherapy is unlikely to yield significant benefit, however used at the right time, it has the potential to achieve beneficial effect. The patient management programme which combines manual therapy, exercise therapy and electrotherapy, based on current evidence, should enable the most efficacious management of a patients' dysfunction. This paper aims to consider some of the current concepts in electrotherapy and to relate this to both general and specific treatments.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11034883/"}

Three factors were analyzed: (1) Therapy, which were transcribed physical therapy modalities used; 2) If there were any guidelines or procedures for home exercises without the professionals presence; 3) the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) palpation pain rates, transferred to a pain level measurements table according to visual analog scale (VAS). The Chi-square test was applied for statistical analysis with a significance level p ≤ 0.05. All physiotherapy modalities used separately or mixed contributed to TMJ pain relief. Guidelines for physical therapy at home proved to be very useful to pain decreasing. It was concluded that the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary work in dentistry and physiotherapy treatments for TMD has been properly verified. It is essential to have an interdisciplinary treatment plan, where the physical therapy helps the pain relief and dentistry treats the disorders related to the stomatognathic system. The interdisciplinary work between dentistry and physiotherapy is more effective in TMD treatment.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23250156/"}

The purposes of this study were to quantify the forces used and to determine the accuracy of therapists in applying forces on a mechanical model. Ten physical therapists participated. A spinal model was used to measure applied force and displacement under different conditions of stiffness. The therapists applied oscillatory posteroanterior mobilizations to the model under three different conditions of stiffness. Mean peak forces across grades and stiffness levels ranged between 57.59 and 178.27 N. The forces were generally lower in the least stiff condition. Displacement varied with stiffness and mobilization grade. In the least stiff condition, the mean displacement varied between 2.25 and 3.45 mm for grades 1 to 4, respectively. Inter-therapist variability was high, and there was a systematic bias in underestimating the magnitude of applied force and in overestimating motion. The variability in force application and the general overestimation of motion detection may explain the poor reliability of measurements obtained with clinical tests based on motion palpation.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7870752/"}

For the typical impedance of 500 Ω, the EMS units delivered the most current followed by the electrical weapons; TENS units delivered the least current. At higher im-pedances (> 2 kΩ) the electrical weapons delivered more current than the EMS units, which is explained by the higher voltage-compliance of their circuits.

Surveys were mailed to 984 physical therapists from across the United States. Each survey included questions concerning staffing and availability of physical therapists for ICU patients, and the utilization of PT for six patient scenarios requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Overall, 482 physical therapists completed their survey. The majority of hospitals (89%) at which the physical therapists were employed require a physician consultation to initiate PT for ICU patients. Established hospital criteria for the initiation of PT in the ICU were present at only 10% of the hospitals. Community hospitals were more likely to routinely provide PT on weekends compared with academic hospitals (p = 0.03). The likelihood of routine PT involvement varied significantly with the clinical scenario (highest 87% status postcerebrovascular accident, lowest 64% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, p < 0.001). The most common types of PT that would be performed on these critically ill patients were functional mobility retraining and therapeutic exercise. The type of PT identified by the physical therapists as having the most positive impact also significantly varied according to the clinical scenario (p < 0.001). PT is commonly administered to ICU patients during the recovery from critical illness in the United States.

A 26-item instrument designed to measure the domains of patient satisfaction among patients was developed by the authors in preparation for this study and field tested on patients from several sites comprising a large clinical operation. Descriptive statistics and estimates of reliability of measurements obtained with the instrument were computed. Reliability and validity were assessed. A total of 289 individuals completed the instrument. The coefficient for reliability (Cronbach alpha=.99) obtained for the instrument was clearly within a desired range. Different types of validity were established as well. Instruments typically used by physical therapists to measure patient satisfaction have undergone little psychometric analysis.

Using this market research strategic recommendations for the future marketing of physiotherapy are made within the professional context. Marketing will be used to contribute to changing the public perception of physiotherapy. The market research involved a qualitative study of five focus groups of the general public and one focus group of physiotherapists. The responses from the focus groups were used to construct an appropriate questionnaire for the qualitative study. A random sample of 510 members of the general public were then surveyed. The market research results yielded the following key features: The best known conditions treated by physiotherapists are musculoskeletal. The least known are women and children. Client-centered care is sought. The importance of location gives potential for physiotherapists to capitalise on tailoring to clients in their area. Doctors are important for referral and communication about physiotherapy. Marketing should be used to inform doctors of what physiotherapy has to offer. A marketing orientation has begun within physiotherapy; however, it must 'fit' the culture initially to be successful. A marketing strategy should be developed on national, state and individual levels based on a strategic intent. At the state level, strategies must be responsive to area or regional needs. Marketing needs to target identified market segments such as workers compensation organisations. Individual physiotherapists must promote themselves within their region, particularly to doctors and clients with the use of relationship marketing. Informal presentations to community groups and school students about physiotherapy will increase their profile.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10141086/"}

We studied the cost effectiveness of supervised group physical therapy compared to unsupervised exercises at home in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A total of 144 patients with AS (modified New York criteria; mean age: 43 years) were randomized to unsupervised daily individualized exercises at home for 9 months or the same plus supervised group physical therapy (3 h weekly). At baseline and after 9 months we measured spinal mobility (thoracolumbar flexion and extension), fitness (maximum work capacity by ergometry), and patient's global assessment of change as measured on a visual analog scale. We used a questionnaire at baseline and a diary during the trial to measure AS related direct medical costs, such as doctor visits, paramedical treatment, medication and hospitalization. The mean effects of group therapy and home exercises were, respectively, +0.9 cm (16%) and +0.5 cm (9%) for mobility, +7 watts (4%) and -2 watts (-1%) for fitness, and +1.7 (34%) and +0.3 (6%) for global health. These 3 differences were significant (p < 0.01 for mobility, p = 0.05 for fitness and p < 0.01 for global health). During the trial total medical costs decreased by an average of US $379 (44%) for group therapy, and by $257 (35%)/patient/year for the \"home\" group. Additional costs of group therapy were estimated at $531/patient/year ($177 for accommodation, $256 for therapist and $98 for materials). After the study 75% of the patients wanted to continue group physical therapy and were willing to pay for it. Compared to therapy at home, additional benefits of group therapy cost $531/year, but reduced direct medical costs by $122/year.

Fifty-four patients with chronic RSD were randomized to receive either SCS together with physical therapy (SCS+PT; n = 36) or physical therapy alone (PT; n = 18). Twenty-four SCS+PT patients responded positively to trial stimulation and underwent SCS implantation. During 12 months of follow-up, costs (routine RSD costs, SCS costs, out-of-pocket costs) and effects (pain relief by visual analogue scale, health-related quality of life [HRQL] improvement by EQ-5D) were assessed in both groups. Analyses were carried out up to 1 year and up to the expected time of death. SCS was both more effective and less costly than the standard treatment protocol. As a result of high initial costs of SCS, in the first year, the treatment per patient is $4,000 more than control therapy. However, in the lifetime analysis, SCS per patient is $60,000 cheaper than control therapy. In addition, at 12 months, SCS resulted in pain relief (SCS+PT [-2.7] vs PT [0.4] [p < 0.001]) and improved HRQL (SCS+PT [0.22] vs PT [0.03] [p = 0.004]).

Two examiners made 2 individual measurements of each of the individual cervical ranges of motion of 23 patients (15 men, 8 women; aged 21 to 42 years) with no cervical symptoms. The patients were asked to move their necks to end range while they sat upright. The accuracy of the CROM instrument and SpinT goniometers was assessed with a testing instrument capable of rotating and/or tilting to preset angles and upon which either device could be positioned. There was excellent agreement between the SpinT measurements of rotation about the Y axis compared with the readings from the testing platform regardless of the angle of tilt, whereas the CROM instrument displayed poor concordance when the tilt exceeded 5 degrees. The reliability trials generally yielded close agreement between the examiners, especially regarding measurements of rotation left and right and extension and revealed higher concordance regarding intraexaminer results.

Several studies suggest that early, compared with delayed, initiation of physical therapy for musculoskeletal conditions may decrease health costs and improve outcomes. To compare early and delayed initiation of physical therapy for individuals with musculoskeletal conditions and to assess effects on patient-important outcomes and cost. MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, and PEDro were the data sources. We included studies that compared early and delayed initiation of physical therapy for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Studies in which early and delayed interventions differed were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics and outcomes, and determined eligibility and quality through consensus with a third reviewer. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used in summary conclusions. Standardized effect sizes (d) and odds ratios were calculated to assess the effect strength of early versus delayed physical therapy for each included study. Of the 3855 articles initially screened, 14 studies were included. The majority of articles studied low back pain (only 2 articles studied cervical pain). For spinal pain, there was low-quality evidence that early versus delayed physical therapy was associated with decreased cost and decreased frequency of opioid prescriptions, advanced imaging, and surgeries without compromising patient-important outcomes. One subgroup analyzed showed improved function/disability with early physical therapy in an occupational health setting. Although there were consistent results across studies favoring early physical therapy for decreased cost and medical utilization, quality was limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that early physical therapy may decrease cost without compromising outcomes. The primary limitation of the current research on this topic is in study design. Additional high-quality research involving prospective randomized designs and economic impact analyses is required to further investigate the outcomes associated with early initiation of physical therapy.

The surgeon is placed in a dilemma: on the one hand, if repair is achieved and the finger is kept immobile during the healing phase, dense adhesions may bind the tendons within the sheath and limit motion. On the other hand, uncontrolled early flexion may disrupt the tendon repair. Early 'controlled motion' increases tensile strength, reduces the formation of adhesions and improves clinical results. To investigate the relationship between the patient's compliance concerning the post-operative motion regimen and the final range of motion, a device has been developed which records when and how often the patient exercises. The device is attached to a modified Kleinert splint. This configuration enables comparison of the outcome of the rehabilitation of patients who exercise according to the rehabilitation programme with patients who exercise less often. The device measures for up to one week.

Twenty-four nondisabled, right-hand-dominant adults (18 male, 6 female), aged 19 to 33 years (mean = 22.5, SD = 4.1), participated in this study. Eight subjects in each of three kinetic feedback groups performed an isometric elbow extension task in an attempt to minimize error between their effort and a force template over a 5-second period. Feedback was provided (1) concurrently with and after each attempt (concurrent feedback), (2) after each attempt (100% feedback), or (3) after every other attempt (50% feedback). Immediate and delayed (48-hour) retention tests were performed without feedback. Separate analyses of variance for repeated measures were used to compare task error among the three feedback groups for acquisition, immediate retention, and delayed retention trials. A significant interaction was found during the acquisition trial blocks, but at each trial block, subjects in the concurrent feedback group exhibited less error than did the subjects in either the 50% or 100% feedback group during the acquisition trials. For the immediate retention test, the 50% and 100% feedback groups exhibited 58% and 39% less error, respectively, than did the concurrent group. For the delayed retention test, the 50% and 100% feedback groups exhibited 52% and 26% less error, respectively, than did the concurrent group. In the immediate and delayed retention tests, subjects in the 50% feedback group displayed less error (31% and 36%, respectively) than did the 100% feedback group. When permanent changes in the performance of a motor task are desired, concurrent feedback about task performance may be less desirable than feedback that is provided after the task has been completed. In addition, when feedback was used after the task had been completed, a lower frequency of feedback resulted in more permanent changes in the subjects' ability to complete the task.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8421721/"}

The purpose of this review was to update the current evidence regarding physical therapist care for patients with MSKD in EDs and to update current recommendations for these models of care. Systematic searches were conducted in 5 bibliographic databases. The studies selected presented quantitative data related to the care of patients with MSKD by physical therapists in an ED setting. Raters reviewed studies and used the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool to assess their methodological quality. Fifteen studies were included. Two studies, 1 of weak and 1 of strong quality, demonstrated that physical therapist care in EDs was as effective as or more effective than usual medical care for pain reduction, and 6 studies of varying quality reported that physical therapist care in EDs was as effective as usual care in EDs in reducing disability. Eight studies of varying quality reported that physical therapist care could significantly reduce waiting time in EDs. Four studies of varying quality reported that physical therapists ordered no more, or even fewer, medical images than physicians. In terms of health care costs, 2 studies of moderate to high quality found no significant differences in costs between physical therapist care and usual care in EDs. Finally, 6 studies of varying quality reported that patients were as satisfied or more satisfied with physical therapist care as with usual medical care in EDs. The roles of physical therapists in EDs vary depending on the setting, legislation, and training of providers. Only a limited number of high-quality studies were identified. Although the quality of the evidence is heterogeneous, physical therapist care for patients with MSKD in EDs may be beneficial.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31505674/"}

However, there is no standardized assessment tool routinely used to evaluate the clinical performance of physiotherapy students in Turkey. This study aimed to examine the psychometric (validity and reliability) and edumetric (acceptability, feasibility, and educational impact) properties of the Turkish version of the Assessment of Physiotherapy Practices (APP-T). This methodological study included 7 clinical educators and 174 4th-grade physiotherapy students at three universities in Turkey. Students were assessed with the APP-T on completion of 4-week clinical placements. The construct validity was examined using the exploratory factor analysis. The internal consistency was determined using Cronbach's α-coefficient. The test-retest and inter-rater reliability were evaluated with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). For the measurement error of the APP-T, standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimum detectable change (MDC) values were calculated. After the administration of the APP-T was completed, clinical educators were requested to provide feedback on the acceptability, applicability, and educational impact of the APP-T. Exploratory factor analysis demonstrated the 20 items of the APP-T represent a single dominant dimension explaining 76.28% of the variance. Excellent test-retest and inter-rater reliability was detected by ICC = 0.94 and ICC = 0.77, respectively, and good internal consistency was detected by Cronbach's α = 0.935. The MDC<sub>90</sub> values for test-retest and inter-rater reliability were 3.11 and 6.86, respectively. Clinical educators provided generally positive feedback on the acceptability, feasibility, and educational impact of the APP-T. The current findings provided evidence for universities and clinical educators that the APP-T has sufficient psychometric and educational properties for evaluating the clinical performance of physiotherapy students in Turkey.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39420285/"}

Whilst KT training programmes have been reported to significantly improve evidence uptake by physiotherapists, it is unclear which aspects of training optimally assist KT into physiotherapy practice. The purpose of the review was to establish the body of evidence regarding KT training programmes to improve physiotherapists' use of evidence-based practice (EBP) and clinical practice guidelines (CPG). A systematic scoping review was undertaken in line with the adapted Arksey and O'Malley framework. Nine electronic databases (CINAHL, BIOMED CENTRAL, Cochrane, Web of Science, PROQUEST, PUBMED, OTseeker, Scopus, ERIC) were searched. Targeted keywords identified primary research articles of any hierarchy, that described the nature and impact of KT training programmes for physiotherapists. Where systematic reviews were identified, the component primary studies were considered individually for relevance. Critical appraisal was not undertaken due to the nature of a scoping review, and data was reported descriptively. Ten systematic reviews were identified (yielding four relevant primary studies). Five additional primary studies were identified (two randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised controlled trials and one pre-post study) which were not included in the original systematic reviews. This provided nine eligible primary research studies for review. The KT strategies were all multi-faceted. Interactive sessions, didactic sessions, printed material and discussion and feedback were consistently associated with effective outcomes. When KT strategies addressed local barriers to EBP utilisation, there were better success rates for EBP and CPG uptake, irrespective of the outcome measures used. There were no consistent ways of measuring outcome. Multi-faceted KT strategies designed to address local barriers to knowledge translation were most effective in improving EBP/ CPG uptake among physiotherapists.", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29334943/"}

To retrospectively analyse CRD patient encounters at a local physiotherapy facility during a period of 2 years. A review of the literature regarding the potential interactions between physiotherapy modalities and CRDs was performed. Next, a 2 year retrospective analysis of patient encounters at a physiotherapy facility was conducted. In addition, seven international physiotherapy societies and four CRD manufacturers were surveyed with respect to recommendations regarding physiotherapy treatments in device patients. The local physiotherapy facility treated 25 patients with CRD (22 pacemaker and 3 ICD patients) for a total of 230 visits (9.2 visits/patient). Five patients received transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and all 25 were administered additional treatment in the form of ultrasound (15), acupuncture (19), Laser (7), traction/manual therapy (12), exercise (8), education (18), taping (5), and/or moist heat (5). No complications occurred. Meanwhile, international societies and device manufacturers offered few specific or consistent recommendations. There are no specific international policies regarding the administration of physiotherapy modalities in CRD patients and, thus, there are no specific guidelines to be implemented at the local level. Review of the literature and of recommendations from CRD manufacturers suggests that TENS, Diathermy, and Interferential Electrical Current Therapy are best avoided in patients with CRDs. However, there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring.
